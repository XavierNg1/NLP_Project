 These are the best sized tomato suckers for rooting. You can usually find them growing between a main production stem and a leaf. Make sure they’re healthy and visually free from disease. Ideally, it shouldn’t be flowering., Place a pair of shears at the base of the sucker, right where it meets the main stem. Clip quickly and firmly to cut it cleanly.


After shearing, you can scrape the sides of the stem with a knife. Some gardeners believe this might make the roots grow more quickly, but it isn’t necessary.
Make sure you’re using clean shears. That way you’ll avoid spreading disease between your plants.
Shear off the sucker’s lower leaves., Being transplanted to a water jar is a big shock for a plant, and it may wilt for the first few days. Make sure to keep it out of direct sunlight initially, so that it has time to recover. After this period, you can place it in a sunny spot, like a windowsill. Don’t leave the cutting outside; it needs protection from the elements.


Change the water every few days, always using warm water., This should be sufficient time for new roots to have sprouted. Looking through the jar will allow you to keep track of the sprouting roots. When you see about an inch (2.5cm) of roots you can transplant the tomato sucker to your garden. Otherwise, let the plant root for a few more days, checking it occasionally.If you want to transplant the tomato sucker to a larger pot instead of your garden, make sure it’s opaque. Direct sunlight can kill roots over time.

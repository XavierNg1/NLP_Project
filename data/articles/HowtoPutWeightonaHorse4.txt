 Is he pulling a two week cart, or in a team pulling the Budweiser wagon? What you feed here depends on what it is you and your horse do.


If your horse is working hard 4-6 days a week, devise a feed chart.
Racehorses need high protein feeds which are less fattening. Reducing hay and increasing the hard feed is the norm, Race mix is the norm and is pre made but tends to be expensive. Traditional feeds such as beet pulp and oats are still common in the racing yard.
For the pleasure horse, feed simple coarse mix or beet pulp and barley. Increased amounts of feed is given after the horse has worked hard. Hard feed is cut out completely for the ponies in Spring as they tend to only look at grass and get fat.

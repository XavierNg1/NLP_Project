 Clarified butter is butterfat that has been separated from the water and milk solids. It has a higher smoke point and longer shelf life than fresh butter.








Put the butter in a heavy-bottom sauce pan. Heat on medium until it’s melted. Turn down the heat, and keep on a low boil until the top layer begins to froth and foam.
Skim off the foamy layer with a spoon. What’s left in the pan will be a liquid layer of butterfat in the middle, and the separated milk solids on the bottom.
Continue heating on low until the milk solids begin to turn a light brown. Remove from the heat.
Gently pour out the liquid into a separate sauce pan, being sure the leave the milk solids in the bottom of the sauce pan. If you have a strainer and cheesecloth, strain the liquid butterfat into the new sauce pan.
Discard the milk solids, or keep them to add into gravy, mashed potatoes, or other recipes.
 Heat on low for at least 20 minutes, so the garlic and herb flavors permeate the butter.









You can use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and you can add any of the extra herbs or spices according to your taste.
Cooking oils (like olive) can be substituted for the clarified butter at this stage, but be warned that different oils have different smoke points.
 Although clarified butter has a longer shelf life than regular butter, adding garlic reduces the shelf life. Store unused portions in the refrigerator in a mason jar or covered container. Refrigerated clarified butter will not remain liquid, but can easily be melted into a sauce again.









Strain out the herbs and garlic before use if you like, or leave them in for texture and additional flavor.
The garlic butter sauce can be brushed on meat, fish, tofu, or vegetables, drizzled on breads, or used as a fondue sauce.

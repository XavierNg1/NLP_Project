Note that using the "No Auto-Restart" feature does not achieve the goal that you want. It will stop the auto-restart but you will continue to get pop-ups asking for a restart until you do. To prevent this, you need to enable "Re-prompt for restart with scheduled installations", found in the same section, and set the interval for reprompts to the max allowed which is 1440. That's 24 hours. You will probably turn off or restart your computer normally during that time. With this option set, you will be asked only once to restart now or later. After you click later, you will not be asked again until the next day if you have left your PC on for 24 hours.

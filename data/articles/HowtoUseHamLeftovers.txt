 This soup is great for using up leftover cooked vegetables from the meal too. Place the leftover vegetables into a blender, add some water or stock and blend until smooth. Fry some celery, garlic and onion pieces until cooked. Pour the pureed vegetables into a saucepan, adding more stock if needed. Throw in the fried vegetables and add chopped pieces of ham. Warm up gently until hot. Add a tin of beans and heat through, then serve.

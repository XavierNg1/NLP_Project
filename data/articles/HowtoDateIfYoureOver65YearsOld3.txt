 If you’re over 65 years old, you have likely had some past relationships. One or more of those may have been very serious (e.g. a marriage that lasted decades). If you are going to start dating again, you will need to spend time acknowledging how you feel about those past relationships and allowing yourself to let go of them.You can do things like write in a journal or talk to a counselor or friend about your feelings.
 Society often portrays youth as the most desirable time in life. Don’t fall prey to this skewed image. Instead, realize that you have already lived through your youthful years, and you have learned a lot from them. Know that the person you are today is just as appealing as the person you were years ago., When you were young, you may have been looking for someone to raise a family with and support you in your career. If you’re over 65, starting a family or a career is not likely to be on your mind. Allow yourself to analyze exactly what you need in a partner at this age, and make a list of the qualities that are most important to you. The list might include things like:Someone who enjoys travel
Someone that likes to socialize
Someone who is caring

 If your blister came in response to a new type of shoe, or a very uncomfortable shoe, stop wearing the shoes that caused it. Purchase shoes that leave your feet with some wiggle room and fit comfortably. Wearing the right shoes can prevent a future blister.
 Attach a small bit of moleskin or padding to the inside of your shoes, particularly areas where your shoes rub against your feet. Moleskin can provide some padding and cut back on friction and irritation that causes blisters., Moisture can cause blisters or make existing blisters worse. Invest in a pair of moisture-wicking socks. These will absorb sweat from your feet and cut back on blisters and other injuries.

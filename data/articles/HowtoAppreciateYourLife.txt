 Start by being grateful for the things you do have. Life for the most part is made up of the mundane and the ordinary. Look at your accumulated clothes and possessions, your home, friends, family, job, the food in your cupboards, everything. Maybe there isn't much for you to look at now, but be thankful for the things that you do have.;
, It makes them feel good, and it makes you feel good too. If you are feeling down, try doing a little something that takes you outside of yourself. Pick up some litter on your street, or say a kind word to a neighbour or bus driver. These small kindnesses somehow seem to add up and help you to feel more useful, thankful and a part of the wider community.
 Always remember the words of Scarlet O'Hara in 'Gone with the Wind': "Tomorrow is another day." No matter how bad things were today, life does indeed go on. Try not to fret about the bad day, everyone has them, and we are generally too preoccupied with our own stuff to remember someone else's folly for more than a passing moment.
 This can be hard to do, particularly if they have seriously wronged you. Start by being willing to forgive. Say it out loud "I am willing to forgive So & So. I'm not sure if I can, but I'm willing." This can diffuseÂ the stress of feeling you 'must' forgive (a stress all of its own) and the guilt of not being able to.
 For those with a monotheist faith, thank God for the life He has given you. For those in other faiths, thank your relevant deities. If you do not believe in a deity or do not view yourself as a spiritual person, thank the universe in general for the precious reality of life. Whatever your beliefs, it is simply amazing that we beings are capable of thinking, feeling and interacting with other people.
 This is the greatest way to honour and appreciate your life.

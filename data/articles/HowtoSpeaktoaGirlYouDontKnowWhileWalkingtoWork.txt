 Instead of just rushing up to her and launching into a conversation, take some time to watch her. You can really pick up some helpful tips while doing this. For example, she stops by a book cart that sells fantasy novels, so you can guess that she would like to read! Or she's wearing a shirt that has one if your favorite bands on it. But don't make it obvious that you're watching her or she may think that you're stalking her.;
, Unless your smile looks more like a leer, she will normally get the idea that you are trying to be friendly.
 You need to be a quick thinker and should be able to mold every situation with tact.
 Try not to overdo it but saying something sweet and gentlemanly will boost her ego which will help her confidence a lot.
 Introduce an element of humor into your compliments, or tell a joke or funny story about yourself. Do NOT make a joke about her, she could easily become offended and walk away.
 Just push by her once and make it look like a mistake. Then apologize and introduce yourself.
 Tell her your name first before you ask for hers. If she doesn't seem to like you, don't push her, just calmlyÂ walk away with a stiff smile. This will give her a sense of security and warmth and she'll tend to smile at you the next day. You should also reflect her smile. Slowly, conversation may start, if it doesn't, forget her.
 Fakeness is one of the biggest turnoffs for a girl. The same goes for lines. Unless the line is very sweet and original, don't use it.
, Pop in and say hey before you leave to go home, or maybe ask her if she'd like to hang out on your break.
 (Not judging) But women do enjoy talking about themselves. So asking her simple questions like.... Where she works, what she does at work, Etc. The easier she can come out and talk about herself is her showing that she is becoming more comfortable around you.

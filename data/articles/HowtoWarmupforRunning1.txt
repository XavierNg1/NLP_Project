 Jogging even for 10 minutes will activate your muscles, increase your resting pulse, and put you in a better condition to run. Even taking a brisk walk before you go for a run can be an effective way of warming up.You won't be able to run or even stretch your best without getting your blood pumping and your muscles warmed up with light cardio exercises like the ones listed in this section.
If you plan on doing a walking warmup, keep your pace faster than normal and swing your arms as you would if you were really running.Jog or walk until the motion becomes natural. Avoid jogging for too long during your warmup; many runners feel some fatigue set in after about 25 minutes of jogging.;
, While at a moderate pace, raise your knees as high in front of you as comfortable to perform the high-knee exercise. Butt-kickers are the exact opposite: extend your leg as far back as far as comfortable so that it nearly strikes your butt.Butt-kickers and high-knee exercises are a great way to end your jog, though these can be done at any time during the warmup.
 You could also do this in addition to a light jog for extra cardiovascular conditioning. Beyond being an excellent cardio warmup, jumping rope will also engage your upper body and arms, preparing it for the run to come.While jumping rope, keep your weight on the balls of your feet and the swinging motion of the rope in your wrists (as opposed to your shoulders/arms)., Jumping jacks can be done pretty much anywhere, making this a versatile warmup for your exercise toolbox. But that doesnâ€™t mean this exercise should be taken lightly! Your shoulder blades should be back, your spine straight, and your arms fully extended throughout.

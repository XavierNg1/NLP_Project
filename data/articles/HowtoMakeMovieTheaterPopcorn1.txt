 Add the butter to a microwave-safe bowl. It should be at least a 4-cup bowl.Using clarified butter is one way of replicating movie-theater flavor because it takes some of the moisture out. Movie theaters tend to use oils that have less moisture than water, so they aren't as soggy as home popcorn.;
, Place the bowl in the microwave. Heat the butter on high until it is all melted., Leave the butter alone in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes. It should separate out into three distinct layers.The top layer will be a light foam. The middle layer will be a golden liquid, while the bottom layer will be cloudy and more solid, as it is formed from the milk solids., Dip the spoon lightly into the top of the butter, letting the foam drain into the spoon. Discard the foam. Keep dipping until most of the foam is gone., The middle layer is the clarified butter. Pour into a covered container. Do not pour the solids at the bottom of the butter into the jar. Throw away the solids once you've poured off the middle layer., Drizzle the clarified butter over popcorn. Refrigerate any leftovers for later.

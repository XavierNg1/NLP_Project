 Double-cleansing produces brilliant results: first you cleanse with an oil, then with your normal facial cleanser, maximizing the benefits of each to your skin.


Apply four drops of argan oil to your face and rub gently in circular motions with your finger tips. Massage for 60 seconds and wipe off with a disposable facial cleansing cloth. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat dry.
Wash your face a second time with your preferred facial cleanser, rinse well, and pat dry.;
, Add several drops of argan oil to your preferred facial toner, making sure to shake vigorously to emulsify the oil before each use. Spray as normal.
 Argan oil is a "dry oil," and it is easily absorbed by the skin, so it gives those who use it to moisturize a glowing complexion.


Add a dab of argan oil to your normal portion of facial moisturizer, tinted sunscreen, or liquid foundation, mix with your fingertips, and apply to your face as normal.
 Rather than using an alcohol-based aftershave, use a drop of argan oil to moisturize and soothe recently shaved skin on your face and elsewhere.


Apply a moist, hot towel to your face, legs, or underarms to keep the pores open.
Warm a drop, or a few, in your fingertips and gently massage into skin.
 Moisturizing at night with argan oil will have a pronounced restorative effect, giving your skin a healthy look, especially over time.


Apply argan to your face before bedtime.
Cover the facial coat of argan oil with a normal night cream once your skin has absorbed the oil.
 Conventional face masks can be even more rejuvenating by adding a small amount of argan oil.


Add a few drops of argan oil to your conventional face mask.
Apply the mask with the argan oil mixed in as directed.
 Use argan oil to treat lipsâ€”especially when cracked or chapped.


Rub two to three drops onto your lips and wipe away any excess.
Apply regularly to keep lips conditioned and prevent chapped lips in the winter.

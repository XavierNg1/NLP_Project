 It is best to put larger, heavier books on lower shelves and smaller, lighter books on higher shelves; this is a basic principle to ensure that you stabilize the bookcase. This method is visually appealing and appears neat, as there is a size order. If you remember books by their size or shape, this method might be just right for you.
 For some people, the book's color or colorful style/depictions on the book's cover is highly memorable and instantly draws you back to each and every book read. And if you love arranging things by color in your home, this could be a great d√©cor statement as well as an easy to way to retrieve your books.

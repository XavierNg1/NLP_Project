 Any type of synthetic faux fur should do.
 You can use less if you want to make short boot covers instead of leg warmers that extend to your knees.



Measure the circumference at the top of your shin. You will want the area just below the knee. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the measurement to ensure the elastic is not too tight.
Measure the circumference at the widest part of your calf.
Measure the area at the bottom. If you want it to cover various sizes of boots as well as legs, try a 22-inch (56 cm) measurement.
Measure the length of your leg from just under the anklebone to the top of your shin.
 They should be as wide as the length of your leg and as long as the circumference at the widest point at your calf. Give yourself 1/2 inch extra in length to account for seams.
 Measure 3 horizontal lines at approximately ankle, mid-calf and an inch below the top of the shin.
 Pin it closer together at the ankle and top of the shin, if your measurements were drastically different. This will ensure a tight fit.
, Pin the 2 sides together as close to the edge as possible. Sew the vertical length of the leg warmer.


Faux fur should hide the seam.
You can also wrap the leg warmer into a loop and sew as far in as you can on the sewing machine. You may need to hand sew the middle portion, if you cannot sew all the way down to the bottom without sewing through your leg opening.
You do not need to sew the top or bottom edges when using acrylic fabrics. , Wear over tights or boots.

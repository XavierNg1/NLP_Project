 Also, if you do it first, then hurry; cut corners. If you hear the buzzer, do not ignore it (especially the washer). If questioned, say that you will put your laundry in the dryer quickly, and use a "less dry" setting to get it out right away, and avoid shrinkage, of course! You can use it as an excuse to do their stuff, and to beat them to cleaning when they want to do it!;

Avoid moving their stuff around, especially papers or small valuables that you know they get a bit touchy about. You will make them happy and you will keep a fight from starting.


If your roommate or relative is a bit on the obsessive (OCD) side, be sure to not misplace little things around the house all the time. Also, don't purposely leave a cup in the sink, papers on the table and in chairs, shoes and socks/stockings strewn down the hall...

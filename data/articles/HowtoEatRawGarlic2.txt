 Mashed potatoes can hide anything, right? Well, raw garlic might test its limits. If you're eating raw garlic purely for health benefits, mince it as finely as you can and stir it into your potatoes once they've cooled down a little. You'll still taste it, but the cream and starch should help spare your sinuses.
 This may sound like a strange combination, but the goal is to hide the garlic, not to create a new favorite snack. Ohio State researches discovered that raw apple can break down the compounds that cause garlic breath.Place thinly sliced garlic between two slices of apple and you may manage to hide the flavor as well as the evidence.


The compounds that cause garlic breath are part of the same group of compounds that are often credited with health benefits. The exact link is unclear, but it is possible this method could undermine your goals.
Parsley, spinach, and mint had the same effect in this study, making them good choices for a post-garlic breath freshener.
 This garlic isn't exactly raw; the pickling process does reduce the amount of beneficial compounds, but not as much as prolonged cooking does.Pickled garlic is less intense than raw garlic, so you can add several cloves to saut√©ed vegetables, salad dressings, and other recipes without overpowering other flavors.The easiest way to peel large numbers of garlic cloves for canning is to blanch them. Keep them in the water for less than five minutes to minimize the effect on nutrition., This chilled soup is a blend of several raw vegetables, usually with tomatoes and stale bread as the base. Although the linked recipe blanches the garlic for three minutes, this is probably not long enough to break down the raw nutrients.If you'd like to keep it 100% raw, simply blend raw garlic along with the rest of the vegetables.

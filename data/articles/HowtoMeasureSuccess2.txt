 Concrete outcomes are not the only way to measure success. You can also measure success by trying hard to live up to your values, even if you sometimes fall short of the mark. List the sort of characteristics you want to have, in order to be considered successful. These can be things like, ‘I pick myself up when I’m down’, ‘I look for the positives in every situation’, or, ‘I make an effort to speak kindly and politely to everyone, even if I’m in a bad mood.’These values don’t come with an expiry date: they will help you gauge how you’re doing at any given stage of life.
 Are you living up to these characteristics most of the time? Think of examples that can show that you are or are not living up to your standards of success. Are you trying your best to be the kind of person you want to be? Think of behavior you can improve to be successful. Ask others for advice on how to do it.


Ask others for their opinion of your current performance. They can give you a perspective that you might not have thought of.
Remember that this is a life long process and there often will be no concrete outcome.
 Decide if how you did things is more important than what you did. For example, if you managed to score goals in all of your football matches but you were arrogant and rude to your friends and lost some of those friends, are you still successful?Or, if you did NOT manage to secure straight A’s in all of your exams but you worked hard throughout the year and you learnt a lot of skills along the way, did you really fail? Keep things in perspective.
 Sometimes it just makes sense to reduce effort, such as if the goal you are trying to achieve is not really obtainable.Keep in mind that when you get sick or need to direct your attention elsewhere, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are not succeeding, but that your success is on pause while you deal with more pressing concerns.

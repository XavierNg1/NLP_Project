 Have everything in place.
 Depending on whether you're using 3 or 4 flavorings, measure thirds or quarters in a measuring jug.
 Add 150ml/1/4 pint of water. Gently heat and stir well to ensure that the sugar dissolves.
 Bring to the boil, then cover and boil for another 3 minutes.
 Boil until the temperature reaches 130ºC/265ºF, the hard ball stage.
 Separate quickly into three or four batches. Pour in the chosen flavoring for each batch.
 Carefully add a lollipop stick to each round, covering with a little more syrup if needed.
 Carefully remove them from the parchment paper. Wrap in clear cellophane or stick into a lollipop holder and they're ready to be shared around or given away as a gift.

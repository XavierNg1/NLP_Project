 If you’re driving in the rain on an overcast day or at night, your headlights can help you increase visibility. Even if you’re driving in rain during the day, turning your headlights is a good idea since it allows other vehicles to see you., If your headlights are caked in grime or dirt, they will not shine as brightly as they should. This could reduce your visibility when driving in the rain. To keep your headlights shining properly, wash them with soapy water either on their own or when you wash your car., For a deeper clean, soak a piece of 1000 grit wet/dry sandpaper in cold water. Apply painter’s tape to the area of around the perimeter of your headlights. After 10 minutes, lightly sand the headlights, moving in straight strokes from side-to-side. Spray the headlight with water while you work.Repeat the procedure using 1500 grit sandpaper, then 2000 grit, 2500 grit, and 3000 grit wet/dry sandpaper.

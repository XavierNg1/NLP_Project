 FUNimation, Viz Media, and Sentai Filmworks always put age ratings on their releases. Also, if you live in the UK the 'BBFC requires everything have an age rating on it, so there's no need to worry about unrated anime.;
, Even shows airing in Japan currently have age ratings submitted by people who have watched the show and gave the rating from their best judgement.
 See what other people have to say about the show. Sometimes the description can be a bit "blurry", but there's clearly going to be an age rating difference between a show that says "Hamtaro and his friends have fun adventures all around town!" and another one that says "In a post-apocalyptic world, a man (stalker) chases after attractive girls."

, Every parent has different standards as for what is appropriate, so you may want to watch shows you're iffy about before you allow your kids to watch them.

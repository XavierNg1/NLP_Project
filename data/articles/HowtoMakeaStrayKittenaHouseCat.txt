 This is the only best way to keep the cat around your house. If it realizes you will feed it and give it water, it will rely on you.Use only cat food for better results.;
, Note if the cat looks ill or hurt in any way. Watch how it acts alone.
 Talk to it, make noises, slowly move to it.
 If the cat does not seem scared by your noise or movements, let it rub on you and pet it. You may want to get on the floor with it.
 If it's cold, put a box with old T shirts out for it. This will also help the cat get used to your scent.
 After a while of sitting and petting the cat, try to pick it up. Just lift it slightly off the ground, in case it doesn't like it, so you don't get scratched. See if you can eventually pick it up and carry it.
 Before you bring the cat inside, you will want to get its shots, possibly fixed and checked for illness.
 Bring it in. But seclude it from other pets for the first few days. Spend time with it to make sure it doesn't feel too anxious.
 Slowly introduce them to keep from fighting.

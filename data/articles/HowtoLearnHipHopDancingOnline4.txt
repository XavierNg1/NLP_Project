 Put all the moves you’ve learned to use and tackle the choreography for a whole song. Try a popular dance or song and look for choreography tutorials for it online.


Try searching for a step by step video that breaks down each part of a full choreographed dance, just like you did with learning the basics. While you might be able to pick up a dance from watching a music video or other performance, it’s much easier to grasp it when the steps are taught individually.
You can also make up your own choreography to your favorite song using the hip hop dance moves you have learned if you feel confident to do so!

, Gather family or friends for a small informal performance. Show them the choreography you learned, or some of the individual moves you like best.


You can even use your new skills to teach other friends or family members some of your moves. It can be fun to pass on a new skill, and it can also help you get better just by teaching others.
Performing for a casual group of people you know is also a great way to get used to having an audience if you think you might like to perform in public in the future.
 Keep up with the skills you learned online by finding ways to participate in hip hop dance in new places and with new people. Join a class, take a private lesson, or just dance at clubs and parties to continue honing your skills.


Look for a club, dancehall, or other venue that plays hip hop music on a regular basis. Make sure you are of age for the venue, bring some friends, and use it as an opportunity to practice dancing and even pick up some new moves from other dancers there.
Consider joining a dance crew or another small street dance group. You can even consider performing with a group on the street in areas where it’s allowed in your city.

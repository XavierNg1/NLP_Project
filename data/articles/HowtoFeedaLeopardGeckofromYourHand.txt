 If you are going to feed the leopard gecko a food, make sure it is appropriate to feed the food to it, like a meal-worm. If you are using a cricket, hold it by the back leg. Some crickets cooperate more than others and if the cricket moves around too much, the leg could come off. Don't do this with every food item you feed or the gecko will depend on you entirely. This is great for taming your gecko. If your gecko bites you while doing this, which rarely happens, it is accidental. It is best not to use tweezers if you want the gecko to connect you with feeding.


Don't feed your leopard gecko anything it cannot eat. It may get sick if you do this.;
, Make sure that the lizard will be able to reach it.


Don't put a piece of food wider than the space between your gecko's eyes.
, You'll know it when you see it also they'll look really concentrated on the target and possibly crouch; that means they are interested and will probably eat it.


If they walk away, do it later or tomorrow - they are not interested. Don't force-feed them; imagine how much harm that could do to their digestive system, plus it's not fair on them. Try again later.
 If you put your hand near it while it is eating, it may bite your hand.

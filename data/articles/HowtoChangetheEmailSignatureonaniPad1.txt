 You'll find this on one of your Home screens. The icon looks like a gear.;
, This will display your mail account settings.
 This will display the current signature for your email account.
 By default, your iPad will set the same signature for all of your connected email accounts. Tapping "Per Account" will reveal the signature fields for every account on your iPad, allowing you to set a different one for each.


This option will not appear unless you have more than one account on your iPad.
 The default signature is "Sent from my iPad." You can tap the end of this and use your keyboard to delete it.
 Try to keep your signature short and to the point, including only the most pertinent information. You can press the "Return" key on the onscreen keyboard to move down to the next line.


If you want to create a signature with text formatting and images, see the Creating an HTML Signature section below.
 Tap the "< Mail" button in the upper-left corner to return to the Mail menu. Your signature will be saved and applied to all future email messages you send from your iPad.

 There should be nothing in it as you begin scrubbing your sink. Remember to clean items that you keep in or around your sink, too. Move your sponge holder and drain stopper to get a more thorough clean.;
, Use a gentle soap, soft cloth, and warm water to clean the faucets, drain, and outer rim. Do this every time you use the sink, which includes after preparing meals or washing dishes.
 This will help eliminate bad odor and soften any gooey materials that may threaten to clog the drain. Alternatively, boil a pot of water and pour that down, as it will help loosen any caked-on gunk in your drain. Be sure to wet down the entire sink through this process. Do this several times a week.
 Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda to 1/4 cup of lemon juice and pour it over the surface of your sink. Let this mixture stand for approximately 10 minutes before rinsing it away with hot water. Do this to your sink at least once a week. Baking soda is a natural cleaning agent that breaks down dirt and grease, so feel free to sprinkle it on cracks and harder-to-hit places, such as around the faucet and handles, and scrub at it with a toothbrush., Mix 1/2 cup of baking soda with 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Pour this directly into the drain, and follow it with 1/2 cup of white vinegar. Cover it and wait 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, boil some hot water and pour it in. The reaction of the cleaning products will help break up gunk and sanitize the drain, and the hot water will rinse it before it forms again.
 Completely dry the sink with a towel. Any wetness left over will become like a paste when mixed with the flour. Sprinkle flour around the sink.Using a new, clean towel, slowly buff around the stainless steel in circular motions (the way you might wax a car). Remove the excess flour and throw it away.

1/4 cup of flower works great, but it isnâ€™t essential that you measure it.
Repeat this process as you see fit. It may take a few times before it glistens.

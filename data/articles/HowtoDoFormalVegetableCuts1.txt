Julienne. According to most, a standard Julienne is 4mm x 4mm x 5cm, or 1/8 x 1/8 x 2 inches. 1/8th of an inch is approx 3mm, so the sizes do vary from school to school.

Chiffonade. This cut is mostly used with leafy greens and herbs for things like garnishes, salads and coleslaw. Its basically very fine shreds. The size definition is rather informal in that there seems to be no formal sizes so luckily that's easier according to what is practical.

Jardiniere. These are vegetable "batons". They are shorter and fatter with sizes ranging from 2cm x 4mm x 4mm (4/5 x 1/5 x 1/5 of an inch) or as large as 4cm x 10mm x 10mm (1.5 x 2/5 x 2/5 of an inch).

Brunoise. Brunoise is a fine dice measuring 4mm x 4mm x 4mm, or 1/8 x 1/8 x 1/8 inches.

Macedoine. This is a slightly larger dice with sizes measuring from 5mm cubed to 10mm cubed (10mm is the more common size).

Paysanne. This translates as Peasant but the sizes are far more flexible.
 As the methods are quite similar, the other cuts either borrow from or continue on the same method as the Julienne cut, so this is the best all-rounder to be start with.

 Any given glass is unlikely to be perfectly round, so the upper glass may only be "pinched" between two points in the lower glass. If there is movement when you tilt the glass, you're in luck, and detaching them will be far simpler.
 Remember not to apply excessive force. If you are too rough, you might shatter one or both of the glasses. If the glasses come unstuck unexpectedly, they might slip or shoot out of your hands.


Make sure that you have a firm grip on each glass. Dry the glasses before you begin, and dry your hands. If your hands slip, the glass might fall and shatter!

, If you absolutely cannot get the glasses unstuck, breaking one may keep you from losing both. Place the glass on a solid, easy-to-clean surface, or hold the base carefully in your hand. Tap the outer glass gently with a hammer, on the rim, until it cracks. There is a risk that you might break both glasses â€“ but this can be a great last-ditch effort.


Afterward, be sure to gather all shards of broken glass. Safety first!

, Sometimes, there is a thin layer of water between the glasses that keeps them stuck. Try squeezing a straw between the two glasses, then blowing in. A small amount of air should suffice. However try blowing in as much air as you can because the straw is being squeezed,

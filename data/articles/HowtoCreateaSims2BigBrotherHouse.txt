 Many themes are associated more with the actual layout of the house, such as a "claustrophobic" or "inside-out" theme. Consider this method carefully instead of putting random dribs and drabs everywhere.;
, Completely build the wall structure without adding any furniture. Remember, every "Big Brother" house is completely enclosed, even the yard has walls. Take into consideration the number of house-mates you are going to put in the house at any given time.
 Construct the wall around the space that you want the yard to be, but don't enclose the entire yard. Leave one space to put in a concrete fence slab, so that light still shines through.
 The color should match the associated theme that you picked.
 Just make sure that the furniture matches with the theme as well.



If you decide to film using the Video Camera Function, allow more space inside the house so film shots do not have bits of outside light in it.
 Once everyone is inside the house, delete it and replace it with a wall. If you have Open For Business (or a later expansion pack) installed, you'll be able to lock and unlock the gate.

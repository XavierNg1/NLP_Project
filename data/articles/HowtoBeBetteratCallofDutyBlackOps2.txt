 Typically if you shoot someone but it doesn't kill them and they turn the corner one of two things will happen. A) They stop turn around and wait for you to follow after giving them the advantage of being ready to shoot. B)They keep running in hopes of getting to a safe place and hoping you run into their teammates. When this happens, do not chase the target, let it go and move forward unless they turn back around and try to shoot you, in that case finish them off. However if you have the jump on them and they don't see you, then yes you can chase the enemy, however do not open fire until you know that you can finish him off.
 Instead, aim down the sights!

, Again, situational awareness, you can play run and gun but if you're not good at that then holding a spot and picking off enemies who are dumb enough to keep running into your sights is perfectly fair and normal. However don't get comfy at the same spot that you exploited for 10 kills without dying. Eventually your enemies wise up and know exactly where to aim. So after picking off 2-4 people from the same spot, move over to another spot nearby that gives a clear shot at the enemy when they come into the same area expecting to find you where you've been hiding the last 5-7 minutes of the game.

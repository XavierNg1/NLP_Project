 Hold the cutter between your index and middle fingers, with your thumb at the back. If this is uncomfortable or difficult for you, hold it like you would hold a pen or pencil. There is no right or wrong way to hold the cutter; find something that is comfortable for you., A score line is the cut that is made in the glass. Hold the cutter perpendicular to the surface of the glass and push or pull along the surface to create the cut. Practice cutting with enough pressure that you hear a “zip” sound as you use the cutter on the glass surface.
 Using cheap glass, practice scoring the glass with your cutter several times, taking care not to go over any previous score lines. It will take some practice and experimentation to get this right.


Without enough pressure on the cutter, the sheet glass will not break.
The glass won’t break cleanly with too much pressure.

 Keep in mind that the busier the color pattern the more difficult it is to read the logo. Therefore, if you're going to design a logo that you want people to read, choose no more than two or maybe three colors.;
, While fancy fonts look pretty up close, they are difficult to read from afar. Reading a T-shirt often occurs in passing. Whether you’re walking into or out of a store or walking down the street, your font has to be large, clear and easily readable by anyone passing by.
 Similar to choosing fonts, graphics have to be clear, large, and viewable. Fine details on a logo can get lost on a small logo image. It might be necessary to forgo fine details in favor of large viewable and less detailed graphics.
 Once you've designed the logo for your T-shirt, digitize it. That means if the image was hand drawn, scan it so that it is computer readable.
 Use care not to design a wonderful looking logo only to find that it distorts when resized to fit on the T-shirt. Keep track of the logo’s dimensions to ensure it renders properly on the T-shirt.

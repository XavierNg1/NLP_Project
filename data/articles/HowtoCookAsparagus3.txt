 If you want to make a stir fry, slice the spears into 1 to 2-inch pieces for stir-fry, making the cuts diagonally.
 Place about 1 tablespoon of oil or butter in a saucepan, and heat it over medium-high heat.
 Carefully place the asparagus in the pan. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir-fry it until it's tender, about 3 to 6 minutes. The asparagus is ready when it's bright green with a few charred spots.


If you're making a stir fry, add other vegetables to the pan at the same time. Carrots, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms are all delicious served in a stir fry with asparagus.
 Sauteed asparagus is delectable with lemon juice and butter drizzled over the top. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

;
, For example: "Sushi, taberu?" instead of "sushi o tabemasho ka?" Again, unless the person is someone you just met or really respect.
 The more the better! Sou desu yo ne! Well, sometimes. No one wants to listen to "blah blah blah right. blah blah blah eh." Use them sparingly. Like, if you use them in one sentence, don't use them again till 2 sentences later.
, Instead of Kore wa use the proper name--it's more polite and natural. With your buddies you can refer to others as koitsu or aitsu but keep in mind these words are so informal so as to be rude in some situations.
 Use their name instead. People usually refer to their friends as omae or kimi, but don't do that unless you're really good friends.
 You may find yourself saying "Taberaru ma!" instead of "Tabenasai." People will be more comfortable around you.
 Warning: this will make you sound like you're from the countryside, but people from the more rural areas might get sentimental at the way you speak.
 Actually pronounce that long oo or chisai tsu. Say Toukyo the way the Japanese do. This is a little advanced, but learn about devoiced vowels and pronounce the words correctly. For example, 'kishi' (coast) is pronounced 'kshi'--ever notice that? And 'suki' (like) is pronounced ski. Most U sounds are either barely pronounced or silent.
 These translate to the equivalent of "um", "uh", and "well then". Throw 'nanka' in anywhere you please, but beware, too many nankas sounds like a teenagerish "like...like...like" in English.
 While Japanese does not place stress and accents on words like English does, it does have a pitch accent, making homophones like hashi (bridge) and hashi (chopsticks) sound different.

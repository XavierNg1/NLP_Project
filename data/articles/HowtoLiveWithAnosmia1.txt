 You are twice as likely to be exposed to an undetected fire or gas leak because you have anosmia. Using detectors and sensors can prevent this from happening. Place a smoke detector in any room that you sleep in or that may have a fire.Propane detectors, natural gas detectors, carbon monoxide and gasoline detectors can be purchased at marine electronic stores, recreational vehicle dealers, or your local gas company.
The type of detector you use will depend on the energy sources in your home. For example, if you have a gas stove, you will need a gasoline detector instead of a propane detector.
Keep a fire extinguisher handy, especially in the kitchen.
Have your gas appliances serviced each year by a professional.;
, An electric stove is safer for you than a gas stove. You will not have to worry about gas leaks. If you must use a gas stove, make sure it has an automatic pilot light. You can also prepare your food using other methods that do not require gas.Try preparing your food on the grill.
Use an oven that has automatic shut-off features.
 As soon as you go grocery shopping, label the foods with the date that you purchased them and the date that you open them. This will help you avoid eating expired food since you cannot smell the food to see if it has gone bad. Eating spoiled food can be unsafe and give you stomach problems.Always check expiration and use by dates on food before you eat it.
If you are ever in doubt, it is best to throw the food away instead of taking the risk.
If you live with another person who can smell, ask them to check your food before you eat it.
 Label all of the chemicals in your home such as bathroom and kitchen cleaners, pesticides, hair products, etc. Always read the label before you use them as well. Some chemicals should only be used in well-ventilated areas and you cannot rely on your sense of smell to determine if the chemical is toxic., You may be self-conscious about body odor because you cannot smell yourself. Having good hygiene can eliminate some of this.Brush and floss your teeth twice a day. Shower or bathe at least once a day and wear deodorant. Also, wear breathable fabrics like cotton to keep your body cool.


If you have a good friend, ask them to smell you.
If you are sweating a lot or it is hot outside, you may need to shower more frequently or have an extra change of clothes.

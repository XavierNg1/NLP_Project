 What's your favorite herb? For many people the answer is mint, but you don't have to limit yourself to just one when you make herbal sun tea. Pick out one or more herbs that add up to about a cup - less if you want the flavor to be subtler.









Experiment with different flavor combinations. Try lemon balm with chamomile, mint with rosemary, or basil with hibiscus, for example.
Choose herbs that are at their fresh, healthy peak. Pick them fresh, if possible. If you buy them at the store, make sure they don't look wilted or discolored.
Try to get organic herbs. Brewing tea with herbs that were treated with pesticides is not a healthy practice.
 Rinse them thoroughly in cold water. Run your fingers over the leaves and stems to help remove dirt and other debris. There is no need to chop the herbs or remove their stems.
 Place the herbs in your sterilized container and cover it with the 4 cups of distilled or spring water. Put the lid on the container.
 Set it in the windowsill or on a clean outside surface in direct sunlight. Let the tea steep for 2 - 4 hours. Remove it from the sunlight when the water has taken on a golden or green hue, depending on what herbs you're using.
 Herbal sun tea is healthy and delicious. Pour it into glasses and sweeten it with honey or agave nectar. Serve it iced.

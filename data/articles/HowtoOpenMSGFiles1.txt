Windows - Select "Notepad" from the list of programs. If Notepad isn't listed, select the "Choose another app/program" and navigate to C:\Windows\System32\Notepad

Mac - Select "TextEdit" from the list of programs. If TextEdit isn't listed, select "Other" and then find TextEdit in your Applications folder.

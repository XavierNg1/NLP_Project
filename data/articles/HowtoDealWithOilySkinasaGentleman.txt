 Try not to touch your face too much during the day. Leaning on your hand or playing with your face can lead to blocked pores which can turn into spots and blackheads, particularly if your skin is naturally oily.;
, In the morning, wash your face using the exfoliator with some warm water. Apply in a circular motion to all the affected areas - normally the forehead, nose and cheeks. This removes dead skin cells and unblocks pores. When you're done, rinse your face with warm water.
 Apply the oil control lotion all over your face using upwards movements. You can also tap the skin to improve circulation.
 Dampen a cosmetic pad by running it under warm water and then squeezing the water out of the pad. Apply some toner to the pad and then run lightly over your forehead, nose and upper cheeks. Avoid the beard area as the pad will snag on your stubble. You're now ready to don your suit and head out to face the day.
 Use a soap designed for oily or neutral skin. This will be clearly marked on the packaging. Finally run over your face with some toner before heading off to sleep.

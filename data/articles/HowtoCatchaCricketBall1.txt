 For taking a catch you should be aware of the rules made by the International Cricket Council (the governing body over cricket):


The batsman is not declared out if the ball is a no-ball or dead ball.
The fielder drops the ball before completely catching the ball.
The fielder steps over the boundary line.
The ball bounces before the fielder collects it.;
, The fielder should be in a good position in order to catch the ball. An ideal stance would be bending your knees and making cup with your hands.


It is essential for a slip fielder to bend on knees and keep hands pointing down, making a cup position. This will assist you in taking a low catch.
 If you think you are a bad fielder, keep that thought out of your mind. Fielding depends on your attentiveness and your attitude towards game. Thinking in a positive way can help you become a better fielder.
 Attentiveness is required for a good catch. You should expect that every next ball will come to you. In this way, you will be more attentive and focused on the game.

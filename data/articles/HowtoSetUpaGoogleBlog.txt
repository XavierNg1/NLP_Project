 Go to blogger.com from any web browser. Here you will see a sign-in box. Blogger is Google’s blog platform.;
, Under the sign-in box, type in your Gmail email address and password. This is your one Google ID for all Google’s services, including Blogger. Click the “Sign in” button to proceed.


Once you’re signed in, you will be brought to your main Blogger dashboard. All your blogs are found here. Blogs you follow can also be accessed from the dashboard.
 After you click the button, the “Create a new blog” window will appear. It contains several fields you need to populate to define your blog.
 The first field is for your blog title. Think of something creative and memorable for your title to attract readers. There’s a lot of blogs out there and you need to find your niche. Picking the perfect title can be hard, but it’s important. It’s your name, your brand, and your trademark.
 Since you’re housing your blog on Blogger, you will have "blogspot.com" in your address. The name that goes before it is something you can control. You can use your title or part of it as your address. Similar to your blog title, your URL or Internet address needs to be unique and attractive. Make it memorable so that people can easily recognize and remember it. Type it in the second field. If the text you’ve entered is already taken, you will be notified since the address needs to be unique.
 The third section contains templates for your blog. Blogger has some good templates available to help you start your blog. Scroll through the available templates and pick one that suits your blog. Remember, you can always fine-tune your theme later.
 When you’re done, click the “Create blog!” button at the bottom of the window. You’re set. The blog is now created and you can start writing.

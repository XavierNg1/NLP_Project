 Turn off the printer and wait for it to finish shutting down. Unplug the printer. Open the main cover, where you would normally put in your toner cartridge.
 During laser printing, the paper passes between two heated rollers, called the "fuser."If the paper has jammed in or near the fuser, wait at least thirty minutes for it to cool down. The fuser reaches dangerously high temperatures.


Some printer models recommend waiting at least thirty minutes.
 In a laser printer, one of the front or top covers will usually expose the print cartridge. If you have not yet found the paper, pull out the cartridge carefully. Most just pull out. A few may require disengaging a latch or a pair of latches.
 Hold the paper with both hands if possible. Pull very slowly, to avoid tearing the paper. Continue patiently until the paper is freed. If the paper does not move, move on to the next step. Do not use force.


If you can't reach the paper, use wide grip tweezers.
 Paper jams often occur as the paper passes between the two rollers. If the rollers turn easily when touched, rotate them slowly until the paper is free. If the jamming is complex, with multiple folds or tears, look for the mechanism attaching the roller to the rest of the printer. Carefully remove one roller and lift it out of the printer, freeing the paper.


It's best to follow user manual instructions. Do not try to force the mechanism.
Many models use rollers attached with a "hole and pin" latch. Push down on the pin to release the roller.
 If the paper still won't come out, refer to your printer manual for instructions on further disassembly. If you've removed all the paper but the printer still won't print, hire a printer repair service to inspect parts for replacement.

 Do research on genres. Don't simply believe whatever the media says it is, online users say it is or what others say it is. Some genres have been around longer than people think and they may bash a genre but then listen to a band that goes under the genre they bashed without awareness. You can use sites such as about.com, allmusic.com or search some articles on Google. Wikipedia is okay to do it, but be aware that anyone can edit it, therefore, Wikipedia isn't always meant to be trusted. Urban Dictionary is not recommended. Anyone can post their view on a definition and they'll often get it wrong.;

 It’s pleasant to dine with your friends and family, but when you do, always use your own cup, utensils, and dishes. Otherwise, you could accidentally expose yourself to CMV-infected saliva.


If someone offers you a sip of their drink, politely decline. Say, for instance, “Thanks, but I’m not thirsty.”
Use care when throwing out paper, plastic, or other disposable plates, cups, and utensils. Wash your hands after handling these items.
 Use a condom during sex in order to limit the chance of getting a CMV infection. Do not have sex with people whose sexual history you do not know.


Since bodily fluids contain the CMV virus, use protection during oral sex as well.

 Some pumps don't give you what you pay for. If you want to get free gas, it's important to make sure that the gas you are paying for matches up with what is advertised. Sometimes the pumps can be miscalibrated, and if they are, you can get some extra gas for free.Try filling up a container you're sure of the dimensions of, like a gas can, instead of your tank. Use a calculator quickly to make sure that the price that you're paying matches the amount that went in. If it doesn't, go in and ask for a refund, or for extra gas.
If you find a pump in your town that's reliably wonky, keep going back to it and complaining every time it messes up. Print your receipts every time and double-check.;
, At some pumps, even newer multi-pump dispensers, you can take the nozzle out of the dispenser with one hand and grip the hose 2-3 feet above the nozzle with your other hand, and shake firmly downward, as if you were cracking a whip. A small amount of gas will squirt from the nozzle every time you do this, and it won't show up on the counter.


Warning: This can be extremely dangerous, resulting in damage to the dispenser or personal injury. It's also a good way to get you into trouble and a super-inefficient way to fill your tank.
 Often, a little gas will keep coming after you cut off the flow. Shake the hose gently and get the rest of the gas out of it and into the tank. It won't be like getting a full tank for free, but you'll be getting a little extra than what you paid for.

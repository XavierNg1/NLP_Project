 You will never be able to make eye-contact with every person in a large group, so don't even try! Aim your eyes 2-3 inches above the heads of the group without focusing on one particular person.


If you are at a podium or raised above the crowd, aim for the middle of the crowd without focusing on one particular person.
 You do not want to look straight ahead the entire time you are speaking. Every so often, turn your head a different direction. Try to look at every section of the crowd once or twice so that the whole audience feels like they have your attention.
 This works best if you know several people in the crowd and feel comfortable speaking to them, like a classroom presentation. Simply rotate your gaze from one to the other every 10-15 seconds.
 If you keep eye-contact on one person the entire time the rest of the group may become disinterested or feel left out. As you speak, look in each person's eyes for 5-10 seconds before moving slowly to another person.


This works best with groups of 3-5 people.
 This lets the speaker know that they have your attention, are listening, and care about what they have to say. Most likely, they will only make eye-contact with your briefly, keeping things from seeming awkward.

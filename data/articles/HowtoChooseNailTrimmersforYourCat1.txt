 Guillotine trimmers are trimmers that have a circular hole that you place the nail through. This is called the stationary ring. When you squeeze the handle, a cutting blade appears from the bottom of the stationary ring and slides upwards to snip the nail., When you use a guillotine trimmer, you will hold the trimmer in your dominant hand. The top side is the flat side, and the underside is the side with the movable part you squeeze. When you trim your cat’s nails, the flat, top side of the trimmer will be turned towards you. The side with the cutting blade will face you, and the screws will face the cat.Angle the handles either down towards the floor or up towards the ceiling.
 When you use a guillotine clipper, hold it in your dominant hand. Place the cat’s nail in the stationary ring, making sure that you don’t go so far as to cut the quick. Then, squeeze the handles to move the cutting blade. It will snip off the tip of the nail.Make sure the nail is being cut on the top and bottom, not along the sides.
The quick is the pink, living part of your cat’s nail. You can clearly see it through the white nail. Only clip the dead, white part of the claw.
Clipping the quick will cause bleeding. Apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding, or if you don't have it on hand you can use some tissue paper to apply pressure. If the bleeding persists for several minutes call your vet for advice.

 This method is best used for programs that you installed from a disc or downloaded from a website.


Apps from the Windows Store will not appear in this list. Use one of the two methods above to remove these apps.
 In the “Programs and Features” window, you will see a table listing all the programs installed in your device. Scroll up or down the list until you’ve located the program you want to remove. Click or tap on it select it.
 When you highlight the program you want to uninstall, the “Uninstall” command button will be added to the command bar above the list of programs. Click or tap the “Uninstall” button. (In some cases, the program’s uninstall wizard will be activated. Follow instructions given by the uninstall wizard.)


A window will pop up asking if you are sure that you want to completely remove the program. Click or tap “Yes.” Uninstallation will commence, and when complete, a pop-up window will inform you that the program was successfully removed from your computer. Click “OK” to exit the window.

 For a two-dimensional array, you will have both rows and columns that need to be printed out. Enter for ( i = 0; i < rows; i++) for the rows and for ( j = 0; j < columns; j++) for the columns.
, Different compilers have different ways to accomplish this task. You may be able to go to "File" and then "Run." You may also have the option to simply click the "Run" icon in your toolbar. Your elements will be printed out in a line or column in the lower window of Java.

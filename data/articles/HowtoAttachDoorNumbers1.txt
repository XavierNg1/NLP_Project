 You can choose between screw-on or adhesive numbers. It is a good idea to match them with other fittings already on the door, such as the doorknob and a postal flap.
 You can fit the door numbers anywhere you like, but it is standard to fit them in the centre of the door, halfway between the (Yale) lock and the top of the door.


It is recommended to measure the distance between the lock and the top of the door. From this point, mark the halfway point, then find the horizontal centre point of the door and make a mark where the two points cross.

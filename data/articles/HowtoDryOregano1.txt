Harvest oregano 3 times during the season. Cut fresh oregano leaves with clippers when it is 6 inches (15.24 cm) tall, just before it flowers and in the late summer. This will help the oregano grow tall and strong.
Put fresh leaves you plan to use right away in plastic bags in the refrigerator. When you prepare oregano for storage, you should use the fresh oregano first, because it has the most flavor.
Cut entire stalks with clippers at the end of the summer and tie their bases together with a string.;
,


Purchase oregano that has vibrant color and no blemishes on the leaves.
Store the fresh oregano in your refrigerator until you are ready to dry it.
Tie the stalks together at the base with a string.

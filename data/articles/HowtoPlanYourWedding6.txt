 Consider using a professional for this special occasion, and make sure that this person is reliable so that you don't have to worry about him or her forgetting your wedding or stuffing up the photos or filming. There are just too many stories of relying on friends or family to photograph or film a wedding followed by years of regret about the fuzzy, out-of-focus shots or no footage at all because the photographer got carried away doing something else...


Ask for recommendations from friends who have married recently who they'd recommend.
Ask to see portfolios at the business premises. This will give you a good idea of their abilities and style.
 Decide on whether you're going to have a quartet, orchestra, band or a DJ. Professional musicians will keep the flow of the event, make announcements, and plan all your special events with you. Each has its advantages and limitations depending on what you're seeking.


Music students at college/university level are definitely worth considering as they will be at the peak of their abilities and a lot cheaper than professional musicians, and many of them crave chances for a public performance.
This aspect should not be booked last, because all the good bands and wedding DJs get booked first! The entertainment is crucial and is what makes a wedding one to remember! It's recommended that you sort out this aspect of your wedding at least 10 months before the day.

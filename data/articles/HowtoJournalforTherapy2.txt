 Ask yourself what's going on in your life; how you feel; what you're thinking about; and what you want. Identify the issues and emotions that you need to explore. If you've been dwelling on something lately, there's a good chance that it will rise to the surface as the focus of your examination. Close your eyes and take a deep breath – inhale, then exhale. Review the ideas, events, or emotions that are most pressing.
 Write for 5-20 minutes, or as long as you feel inspired. Write the start time and the end time at the top of the journal page. Set an alarm on your phone, clock, or computer so that you don't need to keep checking the time. This way, you'll be able to fully immerse yourself in the writing process.


If set writing times aren't your style, feel free to write for as long as you like. The aim of a timed writing session is to practice the process of sustained writing. If you want to write something cumulative, there's nothing wrong with taking extra time to flesh out a thought – or with refraining from times at all.
 Set your pen to the page and don't take it away until the time is up. Try to channel the thoughts directly from the top of your brain. Try not to be critical of yourself while you are writing – this might take you out of the moment and impede your flow. Start with a simple topic sentence—something that sets the tone for everything else you'll write—as though you were starting a conversation with a friend. Review these example sentences:


Today was the greatest day that I've had in months. Where do I start?
I don't know what to do. I can't do this anymore.
I'm beginning to suspect that Dan is cheating on me.
 When you finish writing, read over your new journal entry. Write a sentence or two of reflection: “As I read this, I notice—” or “I’m aware of—” or “I feel—”. Consider whether there are any actions that you can take based on what you wrote. If so, figure out what you need to do to make them happen.

 There are two main types of clip-on earring backs: the skinny type with a bar in front, and the larger type that are shaped like a disk. The skinny type may be more discrete, but they will be more painful to wear. The larger ones will be less painful to wear; they will also be easier to decorate.Consider getting some clip-on earring pads. You can slip them over the back of your clip-on earrings to make them less painful to wear., Be sure to cover the entire front evenly. Don't apply any glue to your item.
 Make sure that they are right-side-up.

 Pull open the earring and position it over your earlobe. Close the earring. When taking the earring off, do not yank or pull it off. This can damage the earring. Instead, open the earring back first, then take the earring off.

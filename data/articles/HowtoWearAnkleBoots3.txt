 Worn leather ankle boots with a cute embellishment such as a buckle or front laces work especially well for summertime. Avoid suede, as this material tends to be reserved for the colder months.
 Make sure that some of your legs are exposed as ankle boots look odd if they are poking out beneath a long skirt or dress.

Paisley or flower-patterned dresses with lace embellishments pair beautifully with a pair of casual ankle booties.






Skirts or jean shorts can also be paired with ankle boots. Pair with a colorful and/or lace blouse.
 These can create a nighttime look, allow you to wear skirts more comfortably in colder weather, or perhaps create a cute and modest appearance, depending on the overall appearance. You can add tights to your outfit whether you choose to wear a skirt, a dress, or a pair of jean shorts.
 A leather belt that matches your boots can be a cute way to accent your footwear. You can also add simple embellishments like pearl earrings, a pearl necklace, or a lace headband to personalize your look.

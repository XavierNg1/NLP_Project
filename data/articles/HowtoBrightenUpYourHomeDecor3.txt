 When was the last time you vacuumed the dust bunnies under your bed or wiped down the walls? Cleaning streaked and smudged windows will let more sun shine through. A clean house just feels brighter.


Open your windows. It sounds silly, but fresh air can make any room feel brighter and more cheerful! So raise the shades, open the blinds, and air things out!

, You probably have too much stuff. Sometimes it’s time to do a major purging. Once you get started, it feels great to say goodbye to all that clutter!


Donate it. Give your extra clothing, books, housewares, and toys to a local collection for those in need. Some organizations will even come to your house and pick up donations.Throw it away. Do you really need to save those textbooks from 10 years ago or that half-roll of Christmas paper? Probably not. If no one can use it, just pitch it.
 The old saying is “there is a place for everything,” but you don’t really need a thing for every place!


Don’t go out and replace things immediately. If you run out of something or break an item, see what you can “make do” with. You would be surprised at how resourceful you can be when you challenge yourself to use what you already have available.
Give yourself restrictions. Limit yourself on certain things.Decide on the number of coats you’ll allow yourself to have or how many coffee mugs are allowed in your cabinets. You probably don't really need three copies of your favorite book!

 The total dilution ratio can be determined by multiplying the dilution factor of each step leading up to the final step. This can be mathematically illustrated with the equation Dt = D1 x D2 x D3 x … x Dn where Dt is the total dilution factor and Dn is the dilution ratio.For example, let’s say you did a 1:10 dilution of your liquid 4 times. Plug your dilution factor into the equation: Dt = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000
The final dilution factor of the fourth tube in your serial dilution is 1:10,000. The concentration of your substance is now 10,000 times less than the original undiluted solution.
 To determine the final concentration of your solution following serial dilution you will need to know your starting concentration. The equation is Cfinal = Cinitial/D where Cfinal is the ending concentration of the diluted solution, Cinitial is the starting concentration of the original solution and D is the dilution ratio previously determined.For example: If you started with a solution of cells with a concentration of 1,000,000 cells per mL and your dilution ratio is 1,000, what is the final concentration of your diluted sample?
Using the equation:

Cfinal = Cinitial/D

Cfinal = 1,000,000/1,000

Cfinal = 1,000 cells per mL.
 When performing any calculation, you want to make sure that your units always match at the end.If you started with cells per mL make sure you are ending with cells per mL. If your starting concentration is parts per million (ppm), then your final concentration must be ppm.

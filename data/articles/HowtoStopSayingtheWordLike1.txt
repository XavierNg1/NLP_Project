 Instead, use about, roughly, approximately, around, and other similar words to make approximations. Try to omit approximations when they are unnecessary.Instead of saying, “We spent like $500 at the mall today,” say, “We spent around $500 at the mall today.”
Instead of saying, “You need, like, a wetsuit to surf,” just say, “You need a wetsuit to surf.”;
, Replace “like” with said, yelled, whispered, shouted, or exclaimed when recounting what someone said. These words are much more descriptive and will get your point across better.For example, “She screamed, ‘Happy Birthday’ at the top of her lungs. It frightened me more than surprised me.”
For example, "He whispered, 'I love you' into her ear."

, Sometimes we use the word “like” to emphasize a point we are trying to make. However, this is an unnecessary use of the word like. Additionally, by omitting the word “like,” you can actually strengthen your sentences and speech.Instead of saying, “He was, like, so angry,” say, “He was very angry.”
Instead of saying, "The sky was, like, so blue," say, "The sky was a deep blue color."

, The proper way to use “like” is when you are expressing enjoyment or comparing two similar things. If you are unsure about when to use the word “like,” then look the word up in the dictionary. The dictionary will give you a definition of the word and how to use it properly.Use it to express enjoyment, for example, “I really like chocolate.”
Use it to convey similarity, “He acts like his father.”

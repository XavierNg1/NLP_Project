 For each game played, choose one part of speech to concentrate on. Instruct all players that only words belonging to this one type will be accepted. Favor this style of play at first with beginners who are unfamiliar with grammar so they can start identifying words that belong to each group.
 Anyone who has played Scrabble knows that sometimes you end up with letters that don’t form any words. Expect the risk of this to potentially rise when you limit the number of acceptable words. To avoid this, establish one part of speech to focus on, but accept others when players are unable to spell out words that satisfy the game’s primary focus.


Avoid cluttering up the board with all nine parts of speech. Keep things concise by allowing only one or two to be used as a fallback. Favor those you have already covered so you can reinforce that area of study without straying off-topic with lessons on brand new material.
Mandate that each player must announce when they intend to play any part of speech other than the one they’re supposed to be focusing on. Avoid confusing other players, who may not realize when a fallback part of speech is played instead of the primary one.
 Keep in mind that some words satisfy more than one part of speech.For example, take “poor,” which can be used as both a noun (“the poor”) and an adjective (“the poor woman”). To ensure that players learn how to correctly apply and identify parts of speech, have them use each played word in a sentence. You can either:


Only accept a word if the person who played it correctly identifies its part of speech (if you’re allowing more than one) and/or uses it correctly in a sentence.
Supply all players with paper and writing utensils so that everyone can compose a sentence using that word.

 Which seem active? Which seem happy? Look closely at the animals and see if they are generally perky.
 Are their eyes open and bright? Make sure none of the gerbils have wounds, these are usually indicators of a past fight. Their coats shiny and well kept? A rough coat is usually a sign of illness. (Also keep a look out in case a gerbil is over or underweight.) Another good call is if the gerbils nose is clean and pink and not red and crusty. Gerbil mucous is red, so a gerbil with a red nose probably has a cold or allergies.)If you see a gerbil sleeping in an area by itself, he/she may be ill., Will you be able to keep up with the one running laps around its cage? You need to think if you would be able to manage the more lively ones if you are looking to tame them and have a good relationship. Try to choose two plus gerbils who already live together and who get on well., One making the bed and One going around digging would be a good match. Why? Gerbils have "jobs" in their terrariums. It could possibly cause a disagreement if they both wanted to be the "burrower"., Agouti (Brown with black flecks and black eyes) is the natural coat color for a Mongolian gerbil to have. Any others have been bred to achieve that color. So an Agouti is the closest you can get to a gerbil in it's natural habitat, sometimes un-natural colored gerbils can have slightly different temperament/health problems. Agouti coated gerbils are usually the most resilient., You will want gerbils who are happy healthy, properly sexed (so you don't end up with accidental pups), In the end it's up to you. Gerbils are comic little animals that will leave you in spirals of laughter. If you feel a special connection, go for it!

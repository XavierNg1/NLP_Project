 The most important part in having a sexy butt is showing the difference between your waist and your butt. Give yourself curves by defining your waist. Make your waist the smallest part of your body by belting it. Wear clothes that naturally accentuate your small waist because as your clothes flare from there, the eye is naturally drawn to your sexy butt., Once you’ve made your waist appear smaller, you need to be sure that you’re making your butt look as good as it can. To do this, you have to start by choosing the right bottoms. There are many options out there, and what works best for your friends probably won’t work best for you.Find the right fit. Baggy pants are going to hide your butt. If you have a small butt, skinny jeans are going to be the best way to make your butt look bigger. If these aren’t comfortable, you can also try boot cut jeans as long as they fit you well. Make sure they don’t have a saggy crotch—this means there is too much fabric and they’ll sit in an unflattering way on your butt.
Wear jeans with pocket flaps. This is an easy way to add volume to your butt. Make sure that the flap hits at the widest part of your butt. Anyone looking at you will see your small waist and their eyes will move over your curves down to your pocket flap.
Be sure pocket placement flatters you. The easiest way to portray a “mom butt” is by wearing jeans with pockets that are way too high or way too low. Small, high pockets will make your butt look larger. They should sit directly on the top of your butt.
 The higher the heel, the higher the sex appeal. The design of heels naturally changes the curve of your spine when you wear them. This causes your butt to protrude while you walk, giving it a sexier shape. They also help because they make your legs look more toned, which tricks people into believing you have a stronger butt. Heels exaggerate the difference between male and female gaits, creating sexual arousal in males.

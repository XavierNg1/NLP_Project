 Although it can be tempting to kick the ball from far away and as hard as you can, taking shots closer to the net can result in a better chance of scoring a goal. By shooting close to the net you will allow for greater accuracy and control over your shot, making it more difficult for the goalkeeper to block. Make sure you aren't shooting from too far away to increase your score count. Also, ensure you maintain your distance from the goalie as goalkeepers are trained to make themselves look big and then dive and latch onto the ball. Make sure you have sufficient distance to shoot from without the goalkeeper being able to grab onto the ball. Shoot from around 10 to 15 meters away.

 Glaucoma is a less common cause of swollen or bulging eyes. However, an injury or infection that resulted in the bulging eye can also cause glaucoma in the future. Glaucoma is incurable, but medications that reduce pressure within the eye and treat inflammation can help manage it.Glaucoma occurs when pressure builds up within the eye due to drainage issues. Injury and infection can cause these drainage issues, so you should take your cat for regular vet exams at least once a year after treating the bulging eye.
 Feline herpesvirus (FHV) causes eye infections like keratitis and conjunctivitis that result in swollen or bulging eyes. This often occurs as a result of the eyelids gumming shut and pus collecting behind them. Carefully bathe the eyelids with water to get them to open and release the trapped infection. FHV-related eye infections can be treated with antivirals, but if your cat tests positive for FHV, it will be a carrier for the rest of its life. However, the virus will go into a dormancy period, and there are steps you can take to manage it.Do your best to reduce your cat’s stress level by giving it loving attention, letting it have its space, limiting encounters with other animals or small children, and keeping it indoors. Stress will lead to more frequent recurrences, or flare-ups, of the virus.
 If a malignant tumor has pushed the cat’s eye out of place, immediate surgery will be required to remove the eye and gain access to the tumor, provided the tumor is surgically accessible. Your vet will likely suggest a chemotherapy regimen in addition to surgical removal.With its high cost and risks, the vet might unfortunately recommend euthanasia over cancer treatment. However, cancer treatment in small animals is a rapidly evolving field, so there might be a therapy or combination of therapies available to manage the tumor.

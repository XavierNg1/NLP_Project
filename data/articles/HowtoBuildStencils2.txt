 A single-overlay stencil is a single sheet of paper or plastic on which you draw and cut your completed design.


Make a single-overlay stencil if you're working from a black-and-white image or if you want your final image to be a silhouette or ghost of the image.
If you want to work with a colored image, choose one that has high contrast and very little variation in color.
The downside to single layers are that some detail may be lost like, but the upside is that you'll only have one sheet to cut and paint.
 Outline the image and separate its different parts. Areas should have clear boundaries that allow "bridges" to appear around the openings where paint is to be applied.


Make sure the bridges are wide enough to keep paint from seeping under and smudging your image.
 For a design with more detail or more color variations, you'll need to create a multiple-overlay stencil. In other words, you'll create several stencils--each with a portion of the image on it--and layer them one-by-one on your stenciling surface to apply the paint/ink and create the finished design.


Trace your image onto thin tracing paper. Begin as you would for a single-overlay stencil. Outline the image and separate its different parts. Areas should have clear boundaries that allow "bridges" to appear around the openings where paint is to be applied.






Make sure the bridges are wide enough to keep paint from seeping under and smudging your image.


Create registration marks. Draw a small triangle or other simple shape in each of the four corners of your drawing. You will copy these onto each overlay you create so that you can line up each layer exactly in place.






Lay a new piece of tracing paper over your first stencil drawing. Trace the openings and bridges that go together either by color or purpose (shadows, highlights, etc.)






Create as many overlays as you need until you've retraced all the elements of the design.

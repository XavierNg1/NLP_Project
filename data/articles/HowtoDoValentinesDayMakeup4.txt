 A feminine headband can add a romantic side to your look. For instance, you can get one that sparkles and almost looks like a tiara, or one that boosts big, romantic blooms. Whatever you choose, make sure it goes with the makeup you've chosen., Another hair option is to use messiness to your advantage, creating a sexy look. Start with a texturizer. Make sure to just use it on the roots of your hair. Turn your head upside to create a big ponytail high on your head. Also, make sure to leave a few straggles of hair out at the front to frame your face., Start with a low, loose ponytail. Separate the ponytail into two parts above the holder. Flip the ponytail down and through the separation. Tease your hair in the ponytail a little (if it's fine) to give it body. Flip the ponytail back up and over, tucking the end back into the top of the ponytail, creating a loop. Secure it with bobby pins and hairspray., Use a curling iron that creates big curls. Curl the hair away from your face, holding each curl to set it. Once you've got your curls set, spray in some light hairspray to set the curls for your day. Smooth any stray hairs out with a touch of hairspray.

 Using a larger needle size will help to ensure that your design retains the ribbon look after you have finished knitting it. Small needles will make ribbon yarn seem more like regular yarn.You should always check your yarn’s label to see what needle size is recommended, but if you are not sure, then try a pair of size 11 needles.
Opt for plastic or wood needles rather than metal needles when working with ribbon yarn., Yarn can get twisted while you work with it. If this happens with ribbon yarn, then it won’t look like ribbon anymore. Check your yarn after each row to make sure it has not gotten twisted. If it has, then stop knitting for a moment and untwist it.Push your stitches back on the needle to ensure that they will not come off the needle while you are untwisting your working yarn.
 Wrapping your yarn around a yarn cone will help to ensure that the yarn stays flat as you work with it and reduce the need to constantly check it for twisting. Unfurl your yarn, and then begin wrapping it around the cone. Keep the yarn flat as your wrap it around the cone.If you don’t have a yarn cone, then use an empty paper towel roll.
 You may come across a knot or two when you are working with slotted ribbon yarn. This is due to the manufacturing process, but you do not want to incorporate these knots in your work because they will stand out. Instead, cut out the knot and then continue knitting. When you near the end of the ribbon, put the slot of the new yarn onto your hook and knit as usual.

 The worst thing you should do is panic and start shooting like a maniac. The main way to earn tons of points is to get the consecutive hits on the targets and such.;
, If you hit a scarecrow's body multiple times, you'll find that its head begins to grow. Shoot the enlarged head for up to 1,000 points!

, Certain pots have fairies in them, which give you 1,000 points, and other pots have rupees in them. These rupees will float in the air until you hit them. The sooner that you hit them, the more points that you'll get. You can get over 1,000 points with these.
 In certain courses, there are doors that will open and spew out 5 watermelons if shot several times. These watermelons can be shot at for 100 points each, with the last one giving you 500 pointsâ€”adding up to 900 points total.
 If the course you are playing has a specific goal, such as defeating 25 Bulblins, focus on completing that goal first. After this, you should move on to secondary items. After you complete the given goal, you will receive 500 points multiplied by however many seconds that remain on the clock. This is an excellent way to earn many points, thereby awarding you with the high score.

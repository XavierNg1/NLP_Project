 Water the turf a few days before you plan to dig it up. Water the turf enough so that it is moist, but not waterlogged.



Use a spade or edger to cut strips into the turf. Use a sod cutter for large lawns.
Cut the strips 1 foot (.3 m) wide and 2 inches (5 cm) deep.
Cut each of the strips into shorter sections between 1 and 2 feet (.3 m and .6 m) in length.



Insert a pitchfork or spade underneath a strip of turf.
Pull the strip up and out of the ground to extract it. Ensure that you keep the roots of the turf intact in the section that you remove. Remove all of the divided strips.
 Use a tiller to break up the soil for planting.

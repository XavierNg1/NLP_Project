 If you eat lots of candy and drink a lot of coffee or use "5-Hour Energy" every day, try to cut down on sweets and caffeine. Limit yourself to 1 cup of Joe a month, 1 piece of candy a week, and no "5-Hour Energy" pills at all. Caffeine isn't good for your heart at all, nor is candy or "5-Hour Energy". Instead of coffee, drink water, fruit juice, milk, or chamomile tea. Don't put sugar in the chamomile tea because it is supposed to help you relax.;
, Exercising helps your heart and muscles work the way they're supposed to. Warm up before you do any kind of exercise.
 Smoking is bad for every part of your body, and it makes you look all wrinkly and old. Buy a Stop-Smoking thing, like Nicorette, or buy those no-tobacco cigarettes they have now. Whatever works for you to quit.
 Instead of going to Starbucks every morning to get a coffee, go to a local gym. Be sure you have enough money to pay your monthly gym fees. While at the gym, pump iron and use the treadmill. The treadmill gets your blood flowing. Pumping iron builds up your muscles.
 Going for a run helps get your heart rate up. Be sure to drink water while you are exercising.
 Drinking is damaging to your liver and spleen.

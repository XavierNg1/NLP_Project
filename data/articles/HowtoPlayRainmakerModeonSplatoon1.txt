 Before you can even try Rainmaker, you need to understand that ranked battles require being Level 10 or higher. You can increase this by battling in regular mode. Be sure to paint plenty of the map, excluding walls, and remember that you level up faster when your team wins, but don't get too competitive!
, Ranked battles involve a certain type of battle and ranks. When you win a battle, it goes towards increasing your rank, and the other way around. Ranks go from C- to A+, and the elusive S-, S, and S+ rank., This means a good choice of gear and weapons. First, it comes with choosing a great weapon that's easy for you to use. The most popular weapons happen to be snipers since you can get your enemies from afar, but as long as you can easily "splat" your enemies, as well as spread a good amount of ink, your weapon should be good.

You also some great gear. Try getting 3-star gear, as it can hold more abilities at once. Make sure the gear you get comes with abilities to help with your weapons work more efficiently. For example, sloshers use up quite a large amount of ink, so use gear with abilities that give you the power to use less ink with any weapon. It's not just about looking good, but if it looks great and works well, then that can make you more confident in battle!

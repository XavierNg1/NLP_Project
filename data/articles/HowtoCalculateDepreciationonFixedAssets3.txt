 Your fixed asset has a lifespan, after which it will no longer be of use. That number is usually measured in years. In this example, assume that you purchased factory equipment for $1,000, you expect it to last five years, and that it has a salvage value of $200.



Remember, the factory equipment is expected to last five years, so this is how your calculations would look: 100% / 5 years = 20% and 20% x 2 = 40%.
 In this example, the asset was purchased for $1,000.
 This calculation will give you a different depreciation amount every year.


In the first year of use, the depreciation will be $400 ($1,000 x 40%).
For the second year, the depreciable cost is now $600 ($1,000 - $400 depreciation from the previous year) and the annual depreciation will be $240 ($600 x 40%).
For the third year, the depreciable cost becomes $360 with a depreciation of $144, and so on.



Using this example, in year 4 the depreciable cost is $216. The salvage value is $200.
In year 4, calculate depreciation of $16 to reduce the final value to $200.
In year 5, there is no need to calculate depreciation.

 Before you begin seeking writing jobs, you should have a solid idea of what you write well. There are many different styles of writing, from technical or casual to academic or narrative fiction. Figure out what type of writing you do best.


Look at the types of writing you’ve done in the past. What has been received well? What has been enjoyable to write? These are likely your strengths. On the other hand, if you’ve struggled with certain types of writing, these might be types to avoid.;
, There is a nearly unlimited number of outlets you could potentially write for. Every possible niche is covered by some publication, either in print or online. Make a list of topics that you can write about. If you have a particular hobby or skill in a certain area, think about how you can share your expertise through writing. For example, you might be an avid skier and can write about different ski resorts you’ve visited. Or, you might like to write about woodworking, giving step-by-step instructions for making birdhouses.
 When someone is looking to hire a writer, he or she will want to see samples of your writing skill and style. Put together your strongest samples in a portfolio.These will represent you as you search for writing gigs.


It’s likely best to make an online portfolio. Save your writing samples as PDF files so that they are easily downloadable.
 Demonstrate your experience in writing by putting together a resume that lists different writing jobs you’ve had. Make a list of every kind of writing you’ve done for someone else. This can include any kind of writing, such as newspaper articles, advertising copy, voiceover narration, website copy, headlines, captions, book or film reviews, and so on. Include the approximate length of the piece, as well as the date and employer. If you have an online link, include that on your list.

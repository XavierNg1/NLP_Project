 A witch will sit there and cry with her hands pressed up against her eyes. Eerie music will also play if she is nearby. She also glows a faint red when she is in dark areas. This can help you find her.;
, Think of her as a crying little girl. Don't mess with her. No touching sudden movements, or loud noises near her. Move slowly and be as quiet as possible.
 she always attacks the person who startled her and will stop at nothing until that person is dead. The only thing to stop her is a nice shot to the head.
 ALWAYS have 1-2 team members carrying an Auto/Combat Shotgun or at least a pump shotgun. To cr0wn, you point a shotgun at her body at point blank range and shoot. Contrary to FPS belief, aiming at the body is easier since she has 1000 HP and a point blank shotgun does a bit more than that. It is very important to make sure all the pellets hit.
 On expert, she will kill a survivor with ONE HIT, regardless of their health.
 This will incapacitate him/her but will prevent the witch from killing that player. Once this is done, the fight with the witch should be simple.

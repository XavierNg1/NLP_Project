 It's always safer not to say where you live in your profile. Don't say your exact location. Like "302 Oak Street, Donville, Mississippi, USA" is not something you should write in. Even giving a city can be risky, especially if it's a small town like Donville, Mississippi, USA. But just to stay on the safe side, just write in your country, or even better, write in "?".;
, It's always best to let only selected and trusted people see your space. Just go to Hotmail, click on spaces, and go on "Your space". Then click "options" and choose who will be able to view your space. "Anyone on the Internet", "All contacts", "Messenger Contacts", or "Spaces friends". This is especially important if you have a blog.
 This is a common rule, but not all of us follow it. You could be thinking your talking to a nice person named bob who's an engineer, but who knows? It turns out it's a robber wanting to steal your money. Don't take risks. But Jenny is so nice! So? You will never know if Jenny is a dangerous person or not.
 They're not that safe either. If it's not a pic of you, your family, or your home, then it's probably safe, but avoid sharing pictures that could be used to identify you or where you live. Try sticking with patterns, cartoon characters.
 It might not be safe. Only chat to your friends and don't make friends on it because you never know who is at the other end.

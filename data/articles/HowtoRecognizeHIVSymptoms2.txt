 This symptom occurs in the later stages of HIV, sometimes many years after the virus has been contracted and been latent in the body. This seemingly innocuous symptom is easy to ignore at first, especially if it occurs during allergy season or during cough and cold season. If you have a dry cough you just can't seem to kick by taking allergy medications or using an inhaler, it may be a symptom of HIV.
 People in the later stages of HIV often get rashes on their skin, especially on the face and torso. These can also be present on the inside of the mouth and nose. It's a sign that the HIV is developing into AIDS.Flaky, red skin is also a sign of later stage HIV. The spots may also look like boils or bumps.
A skin rash usually doesn't accompany the flu or a cold, so if you have one at the same time as other symptoms, see a doctor right away.
 Pneumonia often affects people whose immune systems aren't working properly for other reasons. People with later-stage HIV are prone to getting pneumonia from a germ that wouldn't normally cause such a severe reaction.
 Later-stage HIV patients commonly get a yeast infection in the mouth, called thrush. The condition looks like white spots or other unusual spots on the tongue and inside of the mouth. This is a warning sign that the immune system isn't effectively fighting off infection.
 Nails that are yellow or brown, and that are cracked or chipped, are common among later-stage HIV patients. The nails become more susceptible to fungus, which the body is able to fight off under normal conditions.
 In the early stages of HIV, this could be caused by excessive diarrhea; in later stages, it's known as "wasting," and is a strong bodily reaction to the presence of HIV in the system.
 HIV affects the cognitive function of the brain in later stages. These symptoms are serious and should be looked into no matter what.

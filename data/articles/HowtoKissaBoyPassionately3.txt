 You don't want to start initiating a kiss in a location that isn't opportune. You're looking for somewhere secluded and where you can hopefully sit.
 Passion can't always be planned out in a step by step process. You need to be flexible and able to easily adapt with the mood of your partner., A boy will be into it if you are spontaneous and confident. If you're going on a walk and see a picturesque trail, then grab his hand and pull him along. Exploring places with someone will increase your security and bond together.
 This can be the hardest part about passion and kissing. Only go with this guy if he does something for you. Not just buying you material products, but if he excites you or makes you laugh, he may be worthy.
 Periodically through your date with this guy you should give him slight physical attention. You don't need to overdo this, but every once in a while grab his arm when he says something funny.

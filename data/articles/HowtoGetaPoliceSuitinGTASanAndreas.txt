 Tierra Robada is located in the northwest corner of the map, just on top of San Fierro. It’s a dry desert place that connects San Fierro and Bone County. You can take the west service road from Bone County to easily get to Tierra Robada.;
, As soon as you get to Tierra Robada (assuming you took the road from Bone County), you’ll immediately see its first town, is El Quebrados. On the right side (if you’re entering the area from Bone County), the first thing you’ll see is the El Quebrados sheriff’s station.
 Park your car outside the sheriff’s station. Here you should see a female non-playable character standing out in the parking lot. This is Barbara Schternvart. Approach her and your main character will ask her out on a date.


You have a better chance of seeing Barbara outside the Sheriff’s office anytime between 12 midnight and 6 o’clock in the morning, or between 2 o’clock in the afternoon and 10 o’clock late in the evening.
 After talking to Barbara and asking her out on a date, take Barbara out for a ride or to Jay’s Diner—the nearest diner in the area, southwest of Tierra Robada.


Barbara likes driving at regular traffic speed and eating out at diners.
 Repeat these dates a couple of times until your Relationship Progress Bar (appears after every date) with her reaches 100%. Once your Relationship Progress Bar with Barbara reaches 100%, she will give you a Cop Uniform, which can be accessed from the wardrobe of your safe house.

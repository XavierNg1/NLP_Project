, Again, connect the positive (red) lead to the positive (longer) terminal and the negative (black) lead to the negative terminal.
 You should leave these connected for no longer than 1 to 4 seconds.
 This is to prevent damage to the capacitor when you perform the task and to reduce the likelihood of your getting an electric shock.
 Be sure to wear insulated gloves and not to touch anything metal with your hands when you do this.
 The possible spark will give you an indication of the capacity of the capacitor.


This method will only work with capacitors that can hold enough energy to produce a spark when shorted.
This method is not recommended because it only can be used to determine if the capacitor can hold a charge, capable of sparking when shorted, or not. It can not be used to check if the capacity of the capacitor is within the specifications.
Using this method on larger capacitors could result in serious injury or even death!

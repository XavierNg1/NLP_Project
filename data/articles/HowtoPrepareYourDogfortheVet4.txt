 For safety reasons, most clinics insist your dog is restrained on a collar (or harness) and a lead. If your dog is not used to wearing a collar, introduce the idea in stages.


First, show the collar to him and let him sniff it. Reward this positive interest with a pet or a treat.
Place the collar around his neck but without fastening it. Again, tell him how clever he is and pet him.
Practice these actions so that you familiarize your dog with the collar and then fasten it over time. This way, your dog believes the collar means attention and treats.
 Train him to get used to the muzzle in the same way you introduced the collar.


Feed him treats while he is wearing the muzzle, so it almost becomes a feeding port for treats.
There are many different types of muzzles available, so choose one with a gap at the nose end that is large enough to allow you to feed him a treat.
 Phone ahead and let the receptionist know about your dogâ€™s issues. The clinic may have a side room you can wait in, or else book you in a time slot when there are no other dogs around.


If you let the vet know about your dog's preferences in advance, your anxiety levels will drop and your dog will pick up on your sense of calm in a positive way.

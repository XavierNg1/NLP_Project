 If you want to sleep on the floor as a lifestyle choice, then you might want to try it out a few times first. It takes time for your body to adjust to the new position and the absence of a soft mattress. You may be uncomfortable for the first few days, but after that you should get used to it. You may even wake up feeling refreshed once you’re in the routine of sleeping on the floor.In some cases, sleeping on the floor might be a necessity, such as if you do not have a bed.
 In the beginning especially, you may want some type of cushion to help you transition from the bed to the floor. A yoga mat is great for this because it is already designed for you to lay down on at length and provides a slight cushion between you and the floor.You can also provide some cushioning for yourself by placing a few doubled up blankets on the floor.
 While you might have another preferred sleeping position when in bed, the best position for the floor is on your back. Otherwise, you won’t get the benefit of the back support the floor provides. Sleeping on your side while on the floor may cause back pain.

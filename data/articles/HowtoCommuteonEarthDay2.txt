 If you are 1 of the few people who live within 3 miles (4.8 km) of your office, then choose this heart-healthy option of walking to and from work. Make sure to wear supportive athletic shoes and bring a change of shoes and/or clothing with you to the office.
 Perhaps a bike commute is seen as 1 of the most popular Earth Day commutes. Like walking, it allows you to commute using your own physical power; however, a bike commute may allow you to reach an office 10 to 30 miles (16 to 48 km) away from your home.


Map out your bike commute before you try it. Take some time on a weekend before Earth Day to see if there is a safe route that you can travel. This is especially important if you don't ride your bike very often.
 Leave your car at home and opt to take a bus, subway or other public form of transportation. Check in advance to see if public transportation prices are lower on Earth Day, a subsidy often provided by local governments.


You may need to leave a little earlier to take the bus or subway to work. Depending upon where you live, it could take 30 minutes to an hour longer.
 Post an advertisement for the carpool 1 month to 2 weeks before Earth Day. Ask people to email you their location, so that you can map out neighborhoods, routes and how many cars are required.

, Add two long lines for front flippers then draw out the arch for the back tail. And what do you think you will do next? That's right, move down to the next step.
 Make a line for the brow and define the flippers a bit. This is where things get creative. Is your manatee excited, angry, carefree, brooding? Add a personal flair to your manatee-drawing style by throwing in a few of your own details. Want to really spice things up? Sketch in a newborn manatee peeking out from behind the magnificent creature you just drew!

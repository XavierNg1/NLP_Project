 When preparing to get into a split stance, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean forward on your dominant foot. This will be the leg that goes forward in your split.It is best to practice doing the splits on a softer surface, such as carpet or a yoga mat. Try to avoid practicing on tile or hardwood, if possible.
 Keeping your front leg straight, slowly slide it forward directly in front of you.Keep your stance controlled and tight; do not allow yourself to wobble back and forth or slip.


Try taking your socks off to prevent your feet from sliding. Another option is to try performing the splits on carpet flooring with your socks on.
 While your front leg is slowly extending, do the same with your back leg. Propel it outwards and straight behind you while staying upright and controlled. Once you begin to feel a tightness in your thighs, refrain from stretching any further.Forcing your body past what feels comfortable is a sure way to injure yourself.


If necessary, use a small chair or table to help keep your balance as you lower yourself down.
 When your legs are both extended as far as they can go, pause and hold the stretch. Try counting to 15 or even 30. The point is your body will learn to relax while in the splits pose. Rest your arms on a supportive chair, side table or ground if necessary.


Always remember that a stretch will cause discomfort, but not pain. If you feel pain while doing the splits stop immediately., Once you’ve held the stretch as long as possible, slowly ease up back onto your feet.After resting a few moments, you are free to try again if you feel your body is capable. Take your time and focus on technique as you practice.


Most people are not naturally flexible. Mastering the splits may take several months of practice. Be patient and don’t be discouraged if you feel that your flexibility is not improving. Depending on your age, flexibility may take a while to improve.

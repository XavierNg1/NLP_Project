 Simply mix in the oats after cutting the butter and flour. You may need to add an extra 1/2 cup of milk in order to blend the oats in with the dough, as they will soak up the liquid quickly.
 This simple, scone-like treat is easy to make. Simply add the apples and cinnamon in place of the dried fruit.
 Tasting a bit like unsweetened coconut macaroons, adding coconut takes your rock cakes to the next level. Mix the coconut in with the dried fruit.

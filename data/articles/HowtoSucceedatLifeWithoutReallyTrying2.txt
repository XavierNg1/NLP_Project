 One reason we feel successful when we work so much is that we are able to have material fruits; be it a fancy title at work, a new car, or just more money. Value things like relationships and personal health over things money can get you. This will help you feel more like a success without needing to spend all your time working. Success is what you make it!Put value on goals not work related. These can be relationship goals, or even seeing a new movie or reading a new book.
 If you are someone who constantly finds yourself staying after hours, answering late night e-mails and racing out of the door to prepare for a meeting, set limits. Set times each night when you have to stop all work related activities and force yourself to sit and back breakfast in the morning. You will spend less time trying to force success and less time working as a result.


Make plans outside of work that you can't break. This can be meeting friends who will hold you accountable for not showing, to a weekend trip where you'll be fully disconnected from work.
 A sure fire way to hurt your success rate and increase your workload is to try and take on too many tasks at the same time. Focus on one assignment or task at a time. Take one task at a time, focus on it, finish it, and move on. If you let your brain be torn in a lot of directions at once, you're likely trying too hard and probably not doing your best work.

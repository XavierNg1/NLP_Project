,,,, If you want to, use the grinder to polish, sharpen, and point the arrowheads

, You'll need normal, wood shafts (they don' have to be any wood in particular.
 After you've glued on the points, cut the arrow to the right length. It can be done holding the arrow to you're anchor point and placing it on your extended arm – as if in shooting position - and adding the index fingers length) (by hammering and cutting in various ways you can't get different arrowhead forms – the middle one is a fishing arrow, and the right one is a poorly made hunting arrow)

, The backs of your fletches will touch this point. Make three marks in equal distance (this distance will be the same as the diameter of the shaft – in my case, 8mm) one from the other and glue the fletches as straight as you can. If you can, make one of the fletches (the guide one) parallel with the arrowhead.
 Heat your knife (it will turn black and you probably won't want to use it again for eating) and cut (with heat – if you saw the nock it will break quite quickly) about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) into the shaft (lengthwise). This cut has to be perpendicular to the guide fletch, and preferably to the point. Then heat the nail and at the end of the nock (where the string will be when it's nocked) pass it through widthwise, parallel to the cut you just made. You can also tie a bit of string bellow the nock to make it last longer.

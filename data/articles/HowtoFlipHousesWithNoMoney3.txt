 A hard money lender is a company who borrows money from individuals at one interest rate and loans that money to other private individuals at a much higher interest rate.There are many companies that specialize in funding real estate investments such as flipped houses.Use your social network or internet directories to locate a hard money lender in your area.
 A hard money loan is likely the easiest kind of loan to secure for a first-time home-flipper who does not have a lot of liquid cash. However, it is also one of the riskier options.The interest rates from hard money loans tend to be much higher than typical bank mortgages at 8-15%. This can seriously cut into your potential profits from a flipped house., Before a hard money lender will loan you the cash, you will have to provide them with key information about your financial stability as well as your plans for flipping the house.They will likely want to examine your tax records, credit rating, and pay stubs. Have your documents at hand to demonstrate to your lender that you are a worthwhile investment opportunity for them.
 Another added cost of hard money loans is the initial fee, often referred to as "points." Most fees are between 2-10% of the mortgage cost of the house you will flip. This money provides your lender with some security and serves as a demonstration of your financial viability., Most hard money loans are limited to purchase and rehabilitation of property or construction, and might last from six to 24 months. Hard money loans are not suitable for longer-term investments because of the high fees involved. It is best to use hard money loans on properties that you will be able to turn around quickly to ensure that you are not paying sky-high interest rates.

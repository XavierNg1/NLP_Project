 Fillet the fish. Holding the tail, cut under the fillet just above the backbone, moving towards the head. Once you cut the fillet off, use your knife to remove the skin, if desired. Use a similar technique: start near the tail, and run the knife under the skin, moving away from you.Pop each fillet in a freezer storage bag, and push out as much air as possible. The bag should seal around the fish as closely as possible., If you are freezing whole fish (minus the guts and scales), you need to dip the fish in saltwater before freezing. The water helps it build a glaze to protect the fish.Pre-freeze a baking pan by placing it in the freezer for 5 minutes. Stir a teaspoon of salt into a quart of water until the salt dissolves.Dip the fish quickly, and set them on the tray. Place the tray quickly back into the freezer.Once the ice has frozen on the outside, repeat the process a couple of times to build up a layer.Wrap the frozen fish in freezer paper. Secure with tape. Place them back in the freezer., You want to freeze the fish as quickly as possible, and spreading the fish out in the freezer is the easiest way to do that., Fatty fish, such as tuna and salmon, can be frozen for about 3 months. Non-fatty fish, such as cod or flounder, can stay in the freezer for about 6 months., When thawing the fish, make sure it stays in the container it was frozen in to help maintain flavor and texture.To thaw seafood, place it in cold, running water to keep it cool while thawing out the ice.

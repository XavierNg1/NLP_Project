 As stated above, smaller chunks of almond bark will melt more quickly. If your almond bark is already in small pieces, there is no need to chop it up.
 It is important that the bowl be microwave-safe or else it might shatter while cooking. Place the bowl of almond bark in the microwave.
 When the time is up, take the bowl out (be careful, it may be hot), stir the bark, and then put it back in the microwave. Continue to heat the bark in 15 second increments, taking it out and stirring each time. The reason you need to heat it at such small increments is because almond bark burns easily.

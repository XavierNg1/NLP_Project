, This is called the drop.


Leave a drop of at least 12 inches (30.48 cm) for informal table dining. A formal setting tablecloth ideally reaches the floor.
 Multiplying the length of your drop, times 2. Add this measurement to the table width. Next, add this measurement to the table's length. Multiply these 2 sums together.


Use the measuring formula: (length + drop x 2) x (width + drop x 2) = rectangle tablecloth area. Here's an example for a 3 foot (0.9 m) by 4 foot (1.2 m) table with a drop of 1 foot (30.48 cm): (3 feet + (1 x 2)) x (4 feet + (1 x 2)) = 5 feet (1.5 m) x 6 feet (1.8 m) = 30 square feet (914.4 square cm) = 360 square inches (914.40 cm).
 The radius is half of the diameter. Add to this your desired drop length, square the total (multiply by itself), then multiply this sum by pi (3.145).


For instance, use this formula (radius + drop) squared x 3.145 = round tablecloth area. For a 4 foot (1.2 m) diameter round table with a 1 foot (0.3 m) drop: ((2 + 1) x (2 + 1)) x 3.145 = 28.3 square feet (862.6 square cm).
 If you measured your tablecloth area using inches, divide your tablecloth area by 36. If you chose to measure in feet, divide by 3. These will give you your total required yardage. When measuring in cm, divide by 100 to get your total square meters of fabric required.

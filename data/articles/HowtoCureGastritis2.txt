 The majority of chronic gastritis cases are caused by the presence of a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, which can be identified via an endoscopic biopsy. The treatment for this type of gastritis is based on a regimen of anti-acids and antibiotics.


Many other cases of chronic gastritis are linked to the prolonged use of NSAIDs, chronic bile reflux, diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and Crohn's disease, among others.
First, undergo medical treatment to control your primary illness, and then, talk with your doctor about how to cure chronic gastritis.

 Your cat should always have safe zones where it can retreat and maintain its personal space. Try designating a room or part of a room as a private cat retreat. If possible, choose a space that is not a high traffic part of your home.Try creating a retreat for your cat in the spare bedroom, basement, or study.
 Once you pick a place where it will be safe for your cat to retreat and preserve its personal space, fill the space with your catâ€™s favorite items. Make sure the cat has a comfy place to lounge or sleep, food and water, a litter box, and some of its favorite toys., When your cat in hanging out in a designated safe retreat, make sure you do not bug the cat. Allow the cat to do as it pleases, whether that is sleeping, lounging, eating, or playing. Tell friends and family members to leave the cat alone., If you have multiple cats, it is important that each cat has its own space where it can relax. For example, if you have two cats, then you should try and set up at least two separate retreats. This will help prevent the cats from fighting over the space.

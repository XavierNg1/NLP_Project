 Before you buy a dog from a breeder, consider adopting from the humane society, your local shelter, or a breed-specific dog rescue organization. Adopting a dog will save you money, and often you will be saving the dog’s life. Give adoption some thought before making a decision to buy a puppy from a breeder., Before deciding to buy a dog from a breeder, visit some local animal shelters. Most municipalities have many animal shelters. Some of these may be no-kill facilities, but many will euthanize dogs that are not adopted. Visit several shelters in person and online to see if you can find a dog that fits your lifestyle and desires., If you want to adopt a specific breed, make contact with a breed specific rescue network or organization. The American Kennel Club, for example, has more than 400 rescue network groups in the United States., If you make the decision to not adopt from a shelter or dog rescue organization, seek out a reputable breeder. Make sure you have reliable referrals from others who have worked with the breeder. You should meet the breeder and her dogs in person, inspect the breeding facility conditions, and confirm both the credentials of the breeder and your puppy’s lineage before buying a puppy.
 If you find a dog that might be a good fit, take a trip to meet the dog. It’s important that you spend time hanging out with an active dog before bringing it home. Take the dog for a walk, play a game of fetch, and introduce it to the other members of your family, including any other pets you might have. This will help you ensure the dog is a good fit for you and your family.
 Once you choose a dog, introduce it to your family members, and complete the required paperwork, you can bring home your new dog. Be prepared with a collar, leash, bed or crate, toys, food, treats, and bowls for food and water. Establish house rules in advance so you can start training your new dog as soon as it walks in the door.

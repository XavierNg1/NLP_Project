 If your dog has a deep, bleeding wound in the shoulder, you’ll need some basic supplies to wrap it properly. Ideally, you should keep these items on hand in a first aid kit:


sterile gauze pads
cotton roll
micropore tape (3M micropore)
elastic bandage;
, Press down on the wound with a sterile gauze pad to slow down the bleeding.
 Dab the area around the wound with cotton to ensure that it is as clean as possible.
 Place a fresh set of gauze pads over the wound. Use four to six layers of gauze, and make sure the entire wound is covered. Apply pressure again.
 Tape the gauze pads to keep them in place, using the micropore tape.


If you do not have micropore tape, you can substitute another kind. What’s most important is that the gauze stays securely in place.
 Using an elastic bandage, start your wrap. Begin by wrapping the bandage around the dog’s chest, immediately after the shoulder. This will serve to anchor the bandage.
 Take the bandage and pass it over and around the shoulder area several times, covering the gauze. Apply sufficient pressure to ensure that the bleeding stops.
 Continue to wrap the bandage around your dog, going around front legs, the chest, and the shoulder.
 Elastic bandages come with locks to keep them in place. Use that to secure the bandage.
 These instructions are only meant to help you provide immediate first aid when necessary. If your dog has a deep, bleeding wound, you need to see a veterinarian.

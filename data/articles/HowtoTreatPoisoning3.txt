 This will enable you to seek specific advice on treating the victim. Stay on the phone and follow all the instructions given to you by emergency assistance or the poison control center.


If the person's skin or eyes were exposed to a corrosive substance, have the bottle ready so you can describe it to the poison control center attendant.
Some containers have information about what to do in case of skin contact; take those instructions into account as well.
 If the poison is a skin corrosive, remove the victim's clothing from the injured area. Discard the clothing, since it will no longer be wearable and could injure someone else. Be sure there's no chance that you or the person who has been poisoned will suffer more exposure to the substance.
 Run lukewarm water over the skin or eyes, whatever was exposed, for 15 to 20 minutes. If a burning sensation persists, keep flushing the area until medical help can be obtained.


If the poison has come in contact with the victim's eyes, ask the person to blink a lot but to avoid rubbing his or her eyes, since this could cause further damage.
Don't use hot or cold water to flush the area.

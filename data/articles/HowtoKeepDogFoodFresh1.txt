 Many dog food bags are made to have food stored directly in them. Open the bag carefully along the top seam or dotted line so that you can fold and roll the bag later. If the bag comes with a zipped top, open carefully above the seal to keep it intact for later.Use scissors or a knife to get a clean, consistent opening from the bag.
Once you have poured food from the open bag, fold in the corners in, compressing out all of the air and roll down the top of the bag until you cannot roll any further. Then, seal with a clip.;
, Plastic and metal bins or storage containers can also work to keep dog food fresh. Find a bin with an air-tight lid large enough to store a full bag of your preferred dog food.


Pour the dog food directly from the bag into the bin, and ensure the lid is latched on whenever you are not refilling the bowl.To keep excess bacteria from entering the bin, use a scoop to transfer food from the bin to the bowl, instead of scooping directly with the bowl, itself.
Wash the bin with soap and hot water and dry completely between every bag of food.
 Dog food has a shelf life just like most any other food. Always check the printed expiration date on your dog’s food bag to ensure the food is fresh. Generally speaking, dry food should be consumed within six weeks after opening.Once in the bowl, the food should be left for no longer than about 24 hours. Try to feed your dog roughly what they can eat in a day and no more.
 Dry food is meant to be kept in a dry environment. Keep your food in a cool, dry area to prevent bacteria and mold growth. If your food does get wet, it should be thrown out and replaced.Dog food should be stored at a temperature of around 100°F (38°C). If the ambient temperature in your usual storage area is above this, try moving the food to the refrigerator or freezer.

 If the drop is much larger than needed, use a toothpick to pick up the adhesive and apply it to the back of the rhinestone. If the test drop is sufficient, apply a second drop directly to the back of the rhinestone.


When applying to the rhinestone, lift the rhinestone up and face the bottom down before applying the glue to the bottom. This will prevent accidents such as spilling too much glue on your rhinestone and ruining it.Eyelash glue is a great adhesive if you donâ€™t sweat much. It is available at most drugstores and is quite inexpensive.
 Letting the glue dry longer is better than not long enough. Packaging of eyelash glue commonly says to wait 20 seconds, but this is not enough.Waiting longer allows the glue to bond better to your face., When applying to your face, roll your lip back over your teeth to provide an even canvas. If the flesh on your face is pulled taut, you will have better control when it comes to applying the rhinestone.

 Usually a wall works best for this project, but it's possible to use something else--a large bookcase, the back of a door, or across a window frame.;
, You'll need string, nails or tape (thumbtacks work as a substitute for nails), and clothespins. You can switch it up a little and modify these materials; use beaded string or strips of pretty fabric. You can decorate your clothespins with paint or markers. Get creative!

, This step is simple. You don't even need measuring tape for it--just unroll your string across your wall and cut accordingly.
 If you can use nails on your chosen space, that's your best bet. They will last longer than tape. Pound a nail in where one end of your string will be. Tie the end of your string around it, being sure it's sturdy. You might want to pound the nail up a little, so the string won't slip off. Then extend your string out to about the middle, and pound another nail. Pull your string taut to that spot and tie around that nail. Finally, pound a nail in at the end of your string, pull taut, and tie off. Whew! Now you've got your first clothesline! Basically you have three nails, with the string tied around each one to make one long, strong line.
 Use your clothespins to hang your snapshots. Horizontal pictures should probably be hung with two pins to keep them straight. Vertical pictures can be hung with one pin placed in the center.
 The best part about this project is how versatile it is. You can switch your pictures and change your whole room in a few minutes. Use all black and white pictures for a more formal look. Hyper-colored pictures can really brighten up a space as well.

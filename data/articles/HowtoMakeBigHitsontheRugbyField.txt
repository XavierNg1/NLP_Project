 Resistance training and gym work are vital. Not only defensively but for rugby in general, use your 4 key exercises:bench press, incline bench press, squats (be careful with squats, they can damage your knees and back and slow you down) and dead-lifts. Don't forget core and speed work though, rugby is not American football, stamina and fitness are vital.;
, A good low body position is key. Practice getting low, despite position, anyone can work on the scrum machine. It is a fantastic device for not only props, but all team members, improving tackling and rucking alike.
 Practice makes perfect. Outside training and during the off-season, get some friends together, a work. Simple drills, with tackle bags and one on ones work a treat.
 For the tackle, try to aim your shoulder below the chest, at the stomach area of the man you are tackling- remember going in too high (the chest area) will give your opponent a better chance of breaking-through the tackle, because that is where he is strongest. Lift both of his legs from behind the knees and drive through with your shoulder by pumping your legs (like you are running with him in your arms), always begin the tackle from a low body position and drive upwards.
 The ring of steel is crucial, wrap your arms round the player, preferably just above the knees, and squeeze, lifting him up or driving them back will be easier and you will be able to hold onto them without them slipping away.

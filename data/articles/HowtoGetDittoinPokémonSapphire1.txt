 In each Pokémon game, there will be at least one requirement you will have to fulfill before you are allowed to trade with your friends. In Pokémon Sapphire, you must first get your Pokedex from Professor Birch in Littleroot Town.Littleroot Town is located in the southwest part of the Hoenn region. This is also the location most Hoenn centered games start off.;
, For you to trade with another player, you will need at least two Pokémon in your party. Trading works on a principle of demand, or else by virtue of kindness. Many players are willing to help others out by offering spare Pokémon they've collected for trade online or among friends. However, it may help the process if you have a desirable Pokémon to trade.


The Pokémon exclusive to Sapphire, and therefore more valuable to players of other versions, are:

Lotad
Lombre
Ludicolo
Sableye
Seviper
Lunatone
Kyogre, Unlike newer versions of the Pokémon game series where you can make use of a wireless Internet connection, Sapphire will require the Link Cable to perform a trade., Since your Link Cable can only connect Nintendo consoles, like your Gameboy Advance and a Gameboy Color, or even the original Gameboy, you will need another player with a different version/console, one in which Ditto can be caught. When you've found another player with a Ditto who is willing to trade, connect your Gameboys with the Link Cable and get ready to exchange.
 Place the Pokémon you wish to trade for Ditto in your party, then head to the closest Pokémon Center. There you will find a receptionist who will ask you if you'd like to trade Pokémon with another player.Follow the prompts and in a few short moments, Ditto will be in your party.

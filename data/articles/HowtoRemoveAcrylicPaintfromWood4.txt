 The most common paint stripper is methylene chloride. It’s extremely potent and should be used with care. There are solvents that are citrus-based and more environmentally friendly, but these are still dangerous and proper safety precautions should be taken.Solvents can be purchased at your local hardware or paint store.
 Wear eye protection, like safety glasses or goggles, and a ventilation mask to protect yourself from the harmful vapors. It’s also a good idea to wear gloves and long sleeves since the product could splash., Work outside if possible, but if the wood can’t be moved, open all windows and doors. Set a fan behind you so that the airflow blows the fumes away from you and out a window or door.
 Use a paintbrush or paint roller to apply a thin coat of the solvent to the paint. Allow it to sit for about 20 minutes, or however long the instructions recommend.The paint will begin to bubble as the solvent is working.
 Use a blunt plastic scraper to scratch off the paint that has begun bubbling and peeling. Avoid using sharp metal tools that will gauge the wood. Collect the peeling paint in a disposable container or plastic bag.
 Some manufacturers claim that water alone will clean the area, but the best way to ensure the wood is neutralized is to wipe it with a rag soaked in mineral spirits., Give the wood at least a week to completely dry and air out before you attempt to apply any stains or waxes.

 Get out a 5 to 6-quart (4 to 5 liter) slow cooker and plug it in. Generously spray the inside of the slow cooker with cooking spray or brush olive oil inside the slow cooker to prevent the lasagna from sticking.If you prefer, you can buy slow cooker liner inserts. Just put a disposable liner insert inside the slow cooker before you add your ingredients.
 Open one 24-ounce (68 g) jar of marinara sauce and pour it into a medium mixing bowl. Stir in 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and 1 handful of freshly chopped basil. Set the sauce aside.For a meaty version, you can cook 1 pound (453 g) of ground beef or Italian sausage. Stir it into the seasoned marinara sauce.
 Open one 15-ounce (425 g) package of frozen cheese-filled ravioli. Place half of the frozen ravioli in the bottom of the greased slow cooker. Spread half of the seasoned sauce over the ravioli. Sprinkle 1 cup (113 g) of shredded Italian cheese over it. Arrange the rest of the ravioli on top and spread the rest of the sauce over it. Sprinkle it with another 1 cup (113 g ) of Italian cheese., Put the lid on the slow cooker and turn the cooker on to LOW. Cook the lasagna for 4 to 6 hours. The ravioli should be completely heated throughout and the cheese should melt. Garnish the lasagna with extra chopped basil and serve it right away.Store leftovers in the refrigerator for several days.

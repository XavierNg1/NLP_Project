 Keeping junk food around when you are trying to avoid it is a recipe for failure. If you have lots of junk food on hand, you will be much more likely to eat it. Stop buying junk food and keep it out of your house, car, and office., Buy whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean meats, milk, eggs, and whole grains.


Selecting foods on the outer ring of the grocery store or foods with five ingredients or less is an easy way to make sure that you are making healthy choices., The more healthy food that is readily available for you to choose from, the easier it will be for you to keep yourself from chowing down on junk.


Keep granola bars, fresh fruit, almonds, and low-fat yogurt in your refrigerator and always stash a couple of snacks in your car or purse., Stock your freezer with frozen vegetables. Stock your pantry with canned beans, tomatoes, whole grain pasta, brown rice, and other healthy staples so that you can easily throw together a pasta primavera or pot of rice and beans. Cooking dinner at home will save you money and it will take about the same amount of time as going through a drive through.

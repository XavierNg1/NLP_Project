 Teams can consist of individuals, pairs, three players, or four players. Regardless of how many players you have, you need to separate the players into two equal teams. Each team should also have a leader.
 The jack is a small white ball that is rolled to establish the target. A coin is tossed to determine which team's leader will roll the jack. That person must stand on a mat at one end of a rink and roll the jack down the rink. The jack must travel at least 25 yards (23 meters) but should not roll past the boundary pin.
 Move the jack to the center of the rink, keeping it even with the same length it rolled to.
 The weight should not exceed 3.5 lbs (1.59 kg). Each team must alternate. One teammate from the first team should roll his or her ball, then another teammate from the second team should roll his or her ball, and so on. The lawn bowl must be rolled within the rink and players should aim for the target jack.
 For instance, if Team A delivered three bowls far away from the jack and further away from Team B's bowls, but delivered one bowl directly next to the jack, closer than any of Team B's bowls, Team A has one shot and Team B has zero.
 Stand at the opposite end of the rink and repeat the jack delivery, lawn bowl delivery, and counting of shots. This completes an end.
 There are two methods of deciding when a game is complete. In the first, the game ends when one team reaches 21 points. In the second, the game ends after 18 or 21 ends are played, and the victor is whoever had the highest score.

 This glitch requires you to battle Gambler and Youngster.;
, Instead of not letting you pause the game, your Pause Menu will appear.
 The gambler will see you after you press fly and you'll hear his music, but you will then fly to Cerulean City anyway. Your start button won't yet work, but it will shortly after.
 He's the second Youngster you come across and he's facing up. He's also standing above a "Lass". He's very easy to beat now, as he only has a Slowpoke.
 Your start button should work.
 Your pause menu should pop-up automatically.
 Be careful because Mew will only be at level 7!

, Or, if it is weakened enough, try catching it with a Pok√© Ball.

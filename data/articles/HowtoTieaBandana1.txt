 Lay the bandana flat on a solid surface (e.g. a tabletop). Smooth out any bunches or wrinkles in the fabric. Bring two opposite corners of the bandana together to create a triangle.;
, Smooth your hair back so that it doesn't stick out under the bandana or bunch up under it. Pick up the folded bandana with the point of the triangle pointing upwards. Place the flat edge of the bandana on your forehead, on or near your hairline.
 Bring the two corners of the bandana around your head to meet behind it. Keep the edge of the bandana above your ears. Tie the ends together in a square knot.









Make sure that the bandana isn't too tight or too loose before securing it.
 Tuck the loose corner of your bandana under the knot where you tied it. This will help to keep the bandana from blowing up or coming loose. Smooth out any stray hair that might be sticking out.

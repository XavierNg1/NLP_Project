Make a hole in the straw that is the same width as the straw (this should be approximately 6mm/0.23" in diameter for a 6mm /0.23"straw) because you will be sliding in the other straw, so the hole needs to be large enough without cutting the straw in two.

The resulting hole.






A side-on view. Note that the hole has not cut the straw in two!







,


Insert another piece of straw through the hole, as shown. You'll need to weave around the thread running through the first straw.



How it now appears from the side.






Here is what it appears like as a whole.
 Follow this main diagram if you want to understand the entire structure of the threaded string within the puzzle as you move along threading the string and beads.


Thread one bead onto the string.






Once the bead is in place, bring this side of the string up and through the small inserted piece of straw that has no string in it yet.






Wind this piece of string around the two straws as shown in the image (click on image to enlarge if needed). Bring the string under the long straw to one side, then up and over the short straw on one end, and then under the other side of the long straw.






Now bring the loose end of string back down through the short piece of straw. As shown in the image, you should now have a circular shape underneath the short straw. Leave the piece of string dangling out at the end as shown.






Thread the other bead on to the dangling piece of string.

 Tie a neat and strong knot so that it won't come apart when trying to do the puzzle. Slide the knot neatly into the long straw so that you don't see it.


Adjust the puzzle so that it sits evenly as in this image.

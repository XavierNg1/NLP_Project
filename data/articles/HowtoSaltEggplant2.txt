 If you're using small eggplants (such as Japanese eggplants, which are about the size of a small apple), you can simply peel some of the skin off (about half of it in stripes), or poke holes in it with a fork. For larger eggplants (such as the typical American ones that weigh in at a pound), cut it into cubes or slices, whatever you need for the final dish., Get a bowl big enough for the eggplant to soak in. Add room-temperature tap water to it, leaving room for the eggplant. Pour in salt. You'll need about a tablespoon per cup or two of water. Mix it up to dissolve the salt., Place the eggplants in the bowl. Mix the water and eggplant around to get the process started. Leave the eggplants to soak in the water. You'll want them to soak for about 30 minutes or so. Drain the water off at the end, but you don't need to rinse the eggplant off with this method., Before cooking, you should pat the eggplant dry between paper towels. It can help to press down slightly on it to release a bit of the water. Use the eggplant immediately. This method works especially well before frying.

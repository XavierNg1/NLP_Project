 It doesn't have to be sterile, just washed down so there aren't any food remnants or other contaminants. The larger the sink, the better.;
,, This usually cores the head in one or two blows. Then you may pull greens apart (so that nothing remains between leaves that are stuck together) and put them in the sink. For smaller baby greens the stem can usually be pinched away with a thumb and forefinger. To remove tough stems from greens, fold the greens in half along the stem line with one hand clasping close to the stem. With the other hand rip away the stem from the base toward the tip of the leaf. Discard the heart (unless you plan to use the heart for a dish) and any tough stems.
, Each leaf should be submerged and moved around.
, If you pull a leaf out of the water and it still seems dirty, swish it around in the water gently or, if you have a double sink, run it under the tap in the other sink. Try not to stir the water (and dirt) up too much.
 If you place the colander in the sink, make sure you have drained the sink fully and rinsed away any remnants. To remove excess water from greens, place the greens in the center of a large piece of cotton muslin (36' x 36'). Gather up the four corners and four edges of the muslin and grasp firmly. Go outside (or in a shower stall) and swing your arm around in a big circle. The water will spin away from this centrifuge action. Then while you prepare the rest of your meal you can open up the muslin and place the greens on a surface somewhere cool and dry, so the greens dry off even further. You can also use a salad spinner, but muslin is much easier to store and less expensive. Dry greens make the best salads -- the salad dressing is not diluted by rinse water, and the leaves are less prone to rot when the salad is stored.

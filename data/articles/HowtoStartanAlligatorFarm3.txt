 Alligator feeds in pellet form are preferred by many alligator farmers and eliminate keeping a stock of fresh-frozen meats (such as beef, chicken, deer, fish, and horse) on hand. You can also use a combination of feed and meat.
 Rates for the first year are 25 percent of body weight per week and are reduced to 18 percent by the third year. Overfeeding can cause gout in alligators, but is cured by a 7-to-10-day fast.
 Stressed alligators may develop brown spot disease, which leaves discolored spots on the hides and lessens their value. Prevent overcrowding in the pens (alligators do not congregate in the wild except at breeding season) and minimize outside noise by insulating the building.
 Alligators should never be agitated just before, during, or after feeding. You might coordinate the pen cleaning in the morning and the feeding in the afternoon to prevent stress.

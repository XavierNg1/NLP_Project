Make sure you only fill the container with a little bit of water. The water should be shallow enough so that the frog can stand in it.;

 With your finger, gently rub the frogs back, belly, arms and legs.
 It helps if you've cleaned the terrarium before you let the frog back in it to make sure everything is neat and tidy.

 The Maori language, spoken by indigenous people of New Zealand, has vowels with long and short sounds (such as ay and ah for the letter A). Each phrase, such as “ka ma - te,” is pronounced separately.There is a very short stop between each syllable, with a few exceptions. The resulting sounds in a Haka will be staccato and fierce.;
, Vowel combinations, such as “ao” or “ua,” are pronounced by gliding them together (such as “ay-o” and “oo-ah”).There isn’t a brief stop or breath between these vowel sets, also known as diphthongs. Instead, they are a smooth combination sound.
 The letter T is pronounced like an English T when it is followed by the vowels A, E or O. It carries a slight “s” sound when the T is followed by an I or U.The Haka has both of these instances:


For example, in “Tenei te tangata,” the T will sound like an English T.
For example, in the line, “Nana nei I tiki mai,” the T letters followed by I will have a slight “s” sound accompanying the T.
 The last line of the Haka starts with “whiti te ra.” Pronounce the “whi” as a “fi.”, The last syllable of the song is “Hi!” This is pronounced as “he” with a quick breath, rather than a drawn out “high.”Push the breath out of your lungs by tightening your stomach muscles.
 Listening to proper pronunciation can help you practice your language skills. There are a number of audio pronunciation guides available online. Search for “Maori pronunciation” in a search engine.

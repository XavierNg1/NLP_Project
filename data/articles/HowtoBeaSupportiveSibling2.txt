 A big part of being supportive of your sibling is making sure you are honest and share your feelings with them. Don’t be shy about sharing how you are feeling. Tell your sibling when you are feeling emotional and be honest with them. Use “I” statements when you express your feelings.For example, you may tell your sibling, “I am feeling down today” or “I want to support you right now, even though I’ve had a long day.”

, Support your sibling by being a good listener, so they feel they can confide in you. Maintain eye contact with your sibling and nod as they speak to show them you are listening. Avoid interrupting them and wait until they are done speaking to ask them thoughtful questions.Try to practice active listening, where you listen to your sibling speak without interruption. Then, once they are done, respond by repeating back what they said to you. You may say, “What I’m hearing you say is…” or “What I think you meant is…”. Once they have confirmed you heard them correctly, you can respond to them.
Doing active listening will ensure you are both communicating effectively with one another and listening to each other closely.
 If your sibling confides a problem or issue to you, try to offer guidance and advice. Listen to what they have to say first and then ask them thoughtful questions. Wait for your sibling to ask for your opinion or for advice before you give it.


Make suggestions, offer advice, but do not pressure your sibling to take your advice. Ultimately, they are their own person and should make their decisions on their own.
For example, you may offer advice to your sibling by saying, “In my opinion…” or “My advice is to…”.

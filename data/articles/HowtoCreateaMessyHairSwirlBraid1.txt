 Use a fine tooth comb to create a “V” down the back of the hairline so you have an equal amount of hair hanging down along each side of your head.


Grasp and separate the middle section of the hair while twisting it upward.;
, The “messy” effect comes later. Use a hair tie to finish the braid at the base of your neck.
 Don’t pull too far as you only want to loosen the braid.
 Use as many pins as needed to secure the bottom underneath the braid--you don’t want to see any trace of the hair tie or tail.

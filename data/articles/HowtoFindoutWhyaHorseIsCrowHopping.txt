 Crow hopping is like a small buck. It is just enough to get you slightly out of your seat, and forward. It can be very uncomfortable, especially if you are not expecting it. Always be aware of your horse, and its habits. It's never a bad idea to be prepared for the worst.;
, A lot of the time it can result from pushing them to canter, or making them do something they don't wish to do (however, you must continue to push your horse-as long as what you are doing is feasible for your horse to accomplish).
 Make it habit to ask yourself these questions before pushing your horse to do something. Is my horse ready to accomplish this task? Is my horse able to accomplish this task? Am I pushing them too hard?


A young horse (green) is most likely to give you a ride for your money. They will sometimes crow hop when pushed to do certain things, but can also crow hop spontaneously. You never know so be ready.
 Normally when a horse gets ready to crow hop, you can feel it. If they are in motion, usually their gate will become choppy, and "bouncy". Other times, they do it quickly, giving you no time to react. In either case, do your best to keep their head up. Although the hop may never develop into a buck, it is always a smart idea to keep their head up just in case.
 If you can prevent it, by all means-do! This is the best way to handle the situation (however, I do realize that some times can't be stopped.)

, A bridle that is too tight or a saddle that pinches will only cause your horse irritation, resulting in a very unhappy horse and rider.

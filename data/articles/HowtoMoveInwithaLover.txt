 Only do this if you are ready for the commitment it is sure to bring.;
, Will your family accept your lover? Will their family accept you? Is this arrangement likely to make both of you happier in the long run, or are you simply shacking up for convenience, sex, or financial reasons?

, Are you married to your lover? Do you plan on marrying? If you want to start a family, will this house be a good place to raise your children?

, This cannot happen without the consent of both sides of the relationship. You may be spending your life with them; what they have to say about it is important.
 Are you going to move in with your lover, or will they move in with you? How will you divide the household expenses and chores? Are your lifestyles, tastes, and preferences compatible? Not everyone who makes a good lover also makes a good roommate.
 Never go into a move without being completely upfront (in a clear, but gentile way) about your concerns, as they will only be magnified once you two live together.
 Will you split all bills equally? Will the homeowner or person who makes more money pay a larger percentage? What steps do you as individuals currently take to save money -- is the other person comfortable with these money-savers? Consider everyday household items (such as paper towels) and emergencies (such as a plumbing leak) -- who will pay for these?

, Moving can be a stressful time. It is a change of lifestyle, and if you are choosing to live with someone else, it may be a greater change than you think. Try to remain calm and pull through this stressful time.

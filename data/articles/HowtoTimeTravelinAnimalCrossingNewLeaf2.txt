 In order to change the time outside of the game, you will need to start your DS.
 Instead of loading an Animal Crossing game, click on the settings icon from the DS menu.

The system settings will not open if you have a game running; if you do, the DS will inform you that the software needs to be closed to proceed.
 “Other settings” is found in the lower-right corner.
 Tap on “Date & time,” which is the second on the list; here, you can either change today’s date, the current time, or both (just one at a time).
 Once you’ve selected the date and time that you desire, load Animal Crossing: A New Leaf. You will see that the date in the game will also change in order to reflect the system settings.

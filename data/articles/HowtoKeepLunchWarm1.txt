 Let the thermos sit for about 10 minutes with the boiling water inside of it to help heat the container.This preheating treatment will help to keep the food that you put into the thermos warm until lunch time.


Pour out the water after 10 minutes.;
, This will help to ensure that it is warm enough to eat at lunch time.








Remember that the food will be consumed hours later, not right now. It is okay to make it too hot to eat right away.
 Close the thermos immediately after you put the food into it to lock in the heat. Make sure that the thermos has a tight seal to prevent heat from escaping from it.








If the food in the thermos is for your child, then instruct him or her to ask for help opening the thermos at lunch time. Do not try to seal it loosely so that your child can open it him or herself.
 Keep the thermos closed tightly until you are ready to eat it. If you open it before lunch to check on the temperature, then some of the heat will escape and it may be cool by lunch time.If you are sending lunch for your child, then make sure that you tell him or her to keep the thermos sealed tightly until lunch time.

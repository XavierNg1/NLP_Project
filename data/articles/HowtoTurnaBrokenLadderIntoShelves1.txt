 Evaluate first whether the ladder will suit your current design style. For instance, what the ladder is made of will impact whether it suits your décor. Wooden ladders might look great in one room, while a steel one might be better in another.


Bring the ladder inside and see how the material looks inside your existing décor.;
, While you can certainly repurpose a broken ladder into shelving, you don’t want to use a ladder that is so damaged that it lacks functionality. Since the steps will be used as the shelves, there need to be at least a few of them in place or you'll need to be able to mend missing ones with ease. Do any repairs needed first.
 The ladder needs to fit; for example, a small nook space won't work if you're trying to create shelves from a 15 foot (4.6 m) ladder. Keep in mind that one half of the ladder will need to lean against the wall, meaning that you need to allow adequate space for it to protrude into the room.


Take measurements of both the ladder sides and the area to ensure a comfortable fit.
 This will help you to decide its best placement. It might be figurines, books, a collection of some sort, quilts, whatever.


Check that the desired shelf items can fit easily and safely on each step. Test out items you aren’t completely sure about before using them. You can also make use of poster tack to hold light things in place if needed.
Do you perhaps have a theme? For example, you might like to display your snow globe collection or your favorite set of leather bound books.

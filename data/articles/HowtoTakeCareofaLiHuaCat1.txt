 Start at your cat’s head and brush gently down toward its tail. Work on one section at a time, and be sure to brush its sides, chest, and abdomen.The Li Hua breed has a short coat and therefore requires minimal brushing. Brushing once a week should be adequate.Brushing reduces your cat’s hairballs and the amount of hair that gets left strewn about the house.;
, Before a brushing session, check your cat’s skin for wounds, redness, bald patches, or other signs of irritation. If you notice these or similar symptoms that your cat has been scratching or suffering from irritated skin, contact your vet., Li Hua cats don’t have an undercoat, so there is no need to use an undercoat rake. Instead, use a brush with bristles that aren’t too dense and stiff. An angled wire brush is your best option for this breed.You might also find a rubber brush useful for removing dead hair., During your regular brushing session, use a flea comb to check for flea excreta. Flea excreta looks like small comma-shaped specks of dirt, and will get caught in the flea comb. If you’re not sure if you’ve found flea excreta, place the offending speck on a paper towel and place a drop of water on it. If it runs red, it is flea excreta. Contact your vet for treatment options., To trim your Li Hua’s nails, use a pair of clippers appropriate for a pet. Clip the claw with a firm squeeze of the clippers, then continue onto the next.To get your cat’s claw to extend, only squeeze the individual toe pads, not the whole paw.
 Ideally, you will brush your Li Hua cat’s teeth once daily, but once weekly is better than nothing. To get started, sit your cat on your lap. Apply a bit of feline toothpaste to a pet toothbrush or a finger brush (a thimble-sized brush with short bristles designed for pets). Scrub the outer faces of the teeth in a gentle up-and-down motion.Talk to your cat in a reassuring tone throughout the brushing session.
Do not use human toothpastes when cleaning your cat’s teeth.

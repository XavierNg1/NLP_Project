 A phishing email isn’t always easy to detect. Scammers use legitimate-looking company logos and request in the email that you click on a link to verify your password or account number. However, clicking on the link does not transfer you to the real company’s website, they send you to a phony website and the scammers gain access to your private financial information.;
, If you are suspicious of any email, contact the institution directly by telephone and ask them if they have sent an email asking for information. Most credit card companies and financial institutions do not send this type of an email.
 Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and give them the information about the email.
 Do not click on any links in the body of the email.

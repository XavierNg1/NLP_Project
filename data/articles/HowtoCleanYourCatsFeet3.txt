 Your cat may at some point step on an object that could become lodged in their foot. When this happens, you should remove the object and clean the foot properly.


Use antibacterial soap and warm water to clean the area.
Take tweezers and pull the object out.
Apply an antiseptic like betadine to the wound.
Cover your cat’s foot in a bootie or sock for a day or so., While a cat’s foot pads don’t require regular cleaning or attention, they may need to be cleaned if they are scraped or injured. This is important, as an injured foot pad may lead to serious infection or other problems. If you identify an injured foot pad:


Dip the affected foot into warm clean water two to three times a day.
Consider protecting the foot with a sock or cat bootie.
Talk to your veterinarian. In some circumstances, your cat may need topical antibiotic or a course of oral antibiotics., There might come an instance when your cat’s feet exhibit symptoms or problems you’re not familiar with. In this case, you should talk to your veterinarian. Your veterinarian is trained to identify a wide variety of cat foot problems.


Schedule a meeting with your vet. Make sure to tell the receptionist the details of your cat’s foot problem. For instance, if you notice black or green pus built up between your cat's toes, tell them.
If your cat has had foot problems before, let the vet know about them. While they may have your cat’s medical records, they may not have had time to read them thoroughly.
Inquire whether you should clean your cat’s feet before bringing them to the vet.

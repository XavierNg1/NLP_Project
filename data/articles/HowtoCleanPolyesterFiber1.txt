 Most tags on furniture contain codes in the washing instructions. “W” means you should only use water-based solutions. “S” means the fiber can only tolerate solvent-based solutions. “S-W” allows you to use either solvent- or water-based solutions. If you see an “X,” however, you should only vacuum the material., If your tag is coded with “S” or “S-W,” you can fill it with rubbing alcohol or vodka. Otherwise, you should only use water. Avoid using soap, which can leave a stain on the fabric.If your tag is coded with an “X,” you should skip this step.
 Spray the stained area and allow the water or alcohol to sit for about 30 seconds. Then, blot and gently rub the stain with a clean cloth. Move the cloth with the grain of the fabric. The cloth may be made of any absorbent material.If your upholstery is vacuum-clean only, attach the brush to the extension hose of your vacuum cleaner. Gently glide the brush across the fabric until the stain has been removed.
 This step is necessary only if the fabric feels stiff as it begins to dry. Use a scrub brush with soft bristles or the scrub side of an unused dish sponge. Move the brush or sponge in gentle circles until the fabric feels soft.

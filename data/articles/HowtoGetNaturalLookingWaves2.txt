 Before curling irons and straighteners, curls and waves were achieved by wetting setting hair. Pin curls are a traditional wet-setting method. To begin the process, dampen your tresses with a spray bottle and apply a generous amount of mousse to your damp hair., Create a one to two inch vertical section in front of and above your right ear. Produce a loop in the section by wrapping the hair away from your face and around your fingers. Wind the curl towards your head until it reaches your scalp. Slide a duck bill clip up through the bottom of the curl—the bottom prong should sit against your scalp and the top prong should be positioned in the center of the curl.


The sections do not need to be perfectly even or straight., Continue to work from the right crown to the nape of your neck—always wrap the curl away from your face. Once you reach the center back, move to the front left. Work from above the left ear to the nape of your neck—wrap each curl away from your face., Once your locks are secured in pin curls, allow your hair to dry. When your tresses are no longer damp to the touch, remove the duck bill clips. Comb your fingers through your hair to loosen curls and transform them into natural looking waves.

 No one likes going through all of their email, so make sure to thank your recipient for taking the time to read yours. This simple courtesy will greatly improve your recipients mood and increase the chances of you getting a response.


"I appreciate you taking the time to read this email."
"Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to read this."

, Ask the recipient to write you back, call, think about your proposal, or anything else to get them engaged. Asking a question is another great way to increase engagement."Give me a call when you have some free time"
"Let's meet for lunch sometime soon"
"What are your thoughts on...?"
"I look forward to your response"

, When ending a professional email, make sure that your ending is grateful but concise. A simple ending salutation will keep your email professional while still expressing your gratitude.


"Sincerely,"
"Thank You,"
"Kind/Warm Regards,"
"Best,"
Avoid "Yours Truly," "Sincerely Yours," "Cheers!," "Peace," "Thank you for your consideration."

, If you haven't configured your email service to include your signature, make sure to end with your name, title, and contact information. Don't overload this part with five phone numbers, two email addresses and three websites. Keep it simple so that the recipient knows the best way to get back in touch with you. Avoid including quotes in your signature.Joe Smith

, Before clicking the "Send" button, take some time to read through your email a couple times, correcting any errors that you find along the way. Since this email will likely be your first contact with the recipient, you need to leave the best impression possible. Misspellings and grammatical errors will quickly make your email look much less professional.

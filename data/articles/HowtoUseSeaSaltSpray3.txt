 Wash your hair using a normal or curl-enhancing shampoo. Blow dry your hair using cool heat and a diffuser attachment.


Before you can loosen your curls, you'll need to create curls that will actually hold. Moisturizing shampoos and curl-enhancing shampoos will help you do that. If you use a normal shampoo, follow it with a matching condition to lock in additional moisture.
Cool heat will limit frizziness. The diffuser isn't strictly necessary, but it can help you add more waviness to your hair.
 Apply curl serum to your hair, if desired, then tightly curl your hair using your favorite styling method.


If you've never curled your hair before, consider using a curling iron.

Turn on the curling iron.
While it heats up, comb your hair and split it into sections.
Clamp the curling iron near the bottom of one section, then wrap your hair around the side, working up to your desired height. Hold the hair for 10 seconds before releasing the curl.



Avoid spraying too much sea salt since it can weigh down your curls and flatten them out.
You should also avoid spraying the roots of your hair. It shouldn't cause much harm if you do, but the sea salt spray won't be very effective there.
 Working at random intervals, pinch your curls between your fingers. Rub your fingers back and forth to loosen the curl before moving onto the next one.


Don't spend too much time on each curl. The idea is to loosen perfectly locked curls and give them a messier, more natural look, but playing with them too much can cause them to come completely undone.
 The sea salt spray should dry within a minute or so, and your curls should look softer and a little looser while still holding their form.

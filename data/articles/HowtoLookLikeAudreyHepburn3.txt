 Audrey Hepburn often wore her hair in an elegant French Twist with a slight bouffant.Sweep all your hair to one side and twist your hair up into the opposite direction that you swept it. Insert pins to hold the hair in place, and tuck loose ends into the twist.

Use hairspray to hold the twist in place.
This hairstyle is ideal for long hair. If your haircut is shoulder-length or shorter, try a half-up/half down hairstyle or a pixie cut.
 While filming Bloodline in 1979, Audrey Hepburn wore her hair in a neat bun.Pull your hair back into a high ponytail, securing it with a hair tie. Then, wrap your hair in a spiral around the base of the ponytail and secure the bun with bobby pins. Again, spritz the bun with hairspray for a sleek look.

Buns come in many different styles. After you've mastered the classic bun, you can try a messy bun, ballerina bun, or a braided bun.
 Headscarves were a go-to for Audrey Hepburn; in fact, she even sported one at her wedding to Andrea Dotti.Buy a few headscarves in different colors to wear on days when you don't feel like styling your hair. You could also adapt a regular scarf into a head scarf.
 In the 1950s, Audrey Hepburn popularized pixie cuts for women.With a little bravery and confidence, you can wear a pixie cut, too. Bring in a picture to your hairdresser so they know what you're looking for. Accessorize your pixie cut with a headband or with bobby pins to give your hair extra "oomph."

Pixie cuts may seem easier to style than longer haircuts, but they are still high-maintenance. Research different ways to style your pixie cut beforehand so you're ready for the upkeep.

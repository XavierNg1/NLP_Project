 When performing the push up, your lower back must be straight, i.e., not sagging or arching, and your feet must be shoulder width apart. Your elbows should be tucked close to your body, i.e., at a 20 to 40 degree angle from your abdomen. As you go down, make sure your chest gets as close to the floor as possible.Make sure to tighten your abdomen, legs, and buttocks. This will prevent your back from arching and sagging.
Try not to let your hips touch the floor. They should be on the same level as your shoulders.;
, When you are performing the push up, make sure to inhale as you go down. Then exhale as you go back up.If it is hard for you to remember to breathe, then count out loud as you do your push ups. The act of talking will force you to breathe as you do your push ups.
 Start out by doing as many push ups as you comfortably can. This is called a set. Then do two more sets. Make sure to rest for at least 30 seconds in between sets. Practice this three to four times a week, or every other day until you are comfortable. For example, if you can only do seven full push ups, then start out by doing three sets of seven push ups every other day until you are comfortable.
 Once you can comfortably do your normal number of push ups, add three to five more push ups. Adding more push ups will challenge your muscles, enabling you to build more muscle.


For example, once you can do seven push ups comfortably, add three more push ups to make a total of ten. Make sure to do three sets of 10 push ups every other day to build your muscles further.
 Make sure to stick to your routine. If you find it hard to stick to a routine, then ask a friend to join you. Alternatively, you can hire a personal trainer to keep you on track as you strive for your goal. For example, if you have been doing push ups three days a week, then do not throw off your routine by reducing it to twice a week.
Depending on the intensity of your routine, you may see results in one to two months.

 The food you eat plays a large role in your natural scent. When you eat something strong smelling, those scents will eventually make their way up to your skin and out through your pores. Vegetables and fruits smell fresh and natural. They also help your body get rid of toxins that may be causing unpleasant odors.Avoid red meat, alcohol, and foods with lots of chemical preservatives.
Garlic and onions are healthy veggies, but because of their strong odor, try to limit your intake of those.;
, Water flushes odor-causing toxins from your system, first by diluting them and eventually getting rid of them entirely. The more water you drink, the cleaner your system will be. Try to stay hydrated at all times and counteract any smelly foods youâ€™ve eaten by upping your water intake more.For example, if you ate red meat earlier, up your water intake significantly afterward. The water will help you move the food through your system, dilute toxins and flush them out of your body faster.
 Sweating helps your body to excrete even more odor-causing toxins though your skin. To detoxify your system and keep it running clean, try to work up a sweat regularly by exercising and increasing your overall physical activity.If you eat red meat or other odor-causing foods often, try to work in an exercise session each day to flush out those toxins.

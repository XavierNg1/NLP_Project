 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need".;
, Use a strong piece of paper to avoid tearing. Draw a triangle on the paper. The dimensions are best as follows:


Child Santa hat: Draw a height and base width of 13"/ 33 centimeter (13.0 in)
Adult Santa hat: Draw a height and base width of 14"/ 35 centimeter (13.8 in)
Super large head: It's advised that you measure first!

, Do this by attaching a pencil to a piece of string and taping the string to the top point of the triangle. The pencil should just touch the center of the base of the triangle. Simply draw across the circle with taut string and paper, and you'll create an arc.
,, Use pins if this helps you to keep the template in place. Keep one edge of the template along the folded edge of the felt.


You can either double over the felt and cut both pieces at once, or cut two distinct pieces from two different pieces of felt. Do whatever is easiest.
, These are the straight edges, not the curved edge that forms the base. If you don't want to sew the two pieces together, then glue them in place using a suitable glue for felt.


If you cut a folded sheet, you'll only be sewing or gluing one side.
If you cut two separate sheets, you'll have to sew or glue two sides.
If gluing, leave to dry before proceeding.
 The hat will appear like a cone.
 You have several choices here, depending on your preference for the final look:


Cut a band of white felt measuring about 2"(5cm) in width of enough length to wrap around the hat base.
Cut a band of white fluffy fabric to the same measurements. Be aware that cutting fluffy fabric can be a little messy but the end result is really good.
, If gluing, leave to dry before use.
 It's now ready to wear.

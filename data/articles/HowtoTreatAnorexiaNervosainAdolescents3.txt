 Your child may have a negative view about other people’s bodies, not just his or her own. As such he or she might make small comments, or compare his or her body to the bodies of people your child’s thinks are thin.
 An adolescent coming from a family with a history of depression, substance abuse, or weight problems is more likely to develop Anorexia Nervosa by imitation.
 Adolescents suffering from Anorexia Nervosa are often perfectionists or overachievers.They are often labeled as good sons and daughters, following exact instructions, excelling in everything, and focusing on pleasing others.


While they please others, inside they feel inadequate, and worthless. They begin to view themselves through a critical lens, feeling they are not perfect, and may take this feeling out on their bodies.

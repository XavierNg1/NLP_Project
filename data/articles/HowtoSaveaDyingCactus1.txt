 If parts of the cactus appear shrunken, wrinkled, or wilting (drooping or appearing limp), it probably needs more water.If the soil is fully dry, water it thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain out the bottom of the pot.


If the soil is not dry, the problem could be a condition called etiolation, where the rounded or stem-shaped parts of the cactus become narrower. This tells you that the cactus needs more sunlight, so move the pot to a southern- or western-facing window.;
, Any brown or black segments should be cut away. Rotting can be caused by a fungus that appears after overwatering.If the soil is soaked throughout, remove the plant and repot in a measured soil blend. If it is not entirely soaked, let the soil dry completely before watering again.


A standard mixture of soil for cacti of desert origin consists of two parts garden soil, two parts coarse sand, and one part peat., Spherical or other rounded cacti with pointy tops, or narrowing and stringy stems in column-shaped cacti, are signs of a condition called etiolation. Insufficient sunlight is the cause, so find a spot in the home that gets sunlight for a longer period (a southern-facing window) or more intense sunlight(a western-facing window)., If the parts of the sun-facing side of the plant have yellowish or brownish skin, it is getting too much sunlight. Move it immediately to a spot with better shade, such as an east-facing window, which gets gentle sunlight.Wait to see how the cactus responds to its new shadier location. If the yellowed segments don’t improve in a few weeks, cut them away up to the healthy, green areas.
 The main insect pests that can damage cacti are mealybugs and spider mites. Mealybugs are tiny, powdery white, and appear in clusters. Spider mites are red, also quite small, and spin sheet-like webs between the cactus’s spines. To remove both these, apply rubbing alcohol directly to the infested areas with a cotton swab. A miticide may also be used for spider mites.

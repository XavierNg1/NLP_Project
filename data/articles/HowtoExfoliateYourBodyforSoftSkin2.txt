 Although calling it 'chemical exfoliation' may carry the pejorative impression of being unhealthy or unnatural for the skin, most chemical exfoliators are actually based in natural ingredients, like fruits, milks, or sugars. Many exfoliators are relatively affordable and readily available at your nearest supermarket.
 Attaching the exfoliating process to an existing part of your daily schedule will make it that much easier to make it part of your routine; keep in mind that exfoliation is best approached as a regular part of your life. You may have softer skin immediately after an exfoliating cleanse, but repetition will yield longer lasting results.
 Squirt some exfoliator onto your hands, and begin to rub it onto your skin. Before applying the exfoliator, it's important to make sure your hands are clean; otherwise, you may very well be spreading bacteria to your skin and face. In a gentle, circular motion, swirl the exfoliator around your skin to sweep away any grime and dead skin cells. Take particular care towards exfoliating your face; not only is it the part of you people are going to notice the most, it also carries more oil than other parts of your skin. Three minutes on the face alone should suffice; the rest of the body should warrant a less intensive, but nonetheless attentive do-over with your exfoliator.


When exfoliating your face, take proper care to focus on the central area of your face, from the forehead to the nose to the chin. Collectively, this is referred to as the 'T-Zone', and is notorious for its oiliness.
 Take some water in your hands and wash the product away. Making sure the exfoliant is entirely gone will ensure it doesn't irritate your skin later on. Although the chemical exfoliating process requires less of a 'physical' element than its mechanical counterpart, you should find your skin just as soft and smooth following a proper ritual as you would if you'd used the loofah the whole way through.

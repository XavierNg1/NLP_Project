 Larger diameter lenses or mirrors allow higher resolution (ability to separate closely spaced objects) and will gather more light from faint astronomical objects. They also cost more. A good size for a first telescope is roughly four inches (100mm). Bigger tends to be considerably more expensive and more inconvenient. Bigger works better, of course, though not shockingly so.;
, In astronomy, the purpose of a telescope is mostly to collect light from faint objects, not to magnify them. Most visual observing is done between 50 and 200 power.
 A good rule of thumb to determine the maximum usable magnification is to multiply the diameter of the objective in millimeters by 2.5 (which means that the typical department store 60mm scope is only usable to 150x). In actual practice, on nights of extremely unusual atmospheric stability, you -may- be able to use a somewhat higher power, but don't count on it.
 If the eye relief is too small you will have to bring your eye very close to the eyepiece, and it will be all but impossible to observe for more than a few seconds at a time.
 In general, the more massive the mount looks, the better it performs. When in doubt, spend more on a mount.

, No telescope practical for most individuals to own will show significant color in nebulae to the naked eye, although bigger ones will show shape well, and many can reveal color through time-exposure photographs.

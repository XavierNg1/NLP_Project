 You may be tempted to drastically cut back on your calorie intake in order to lose pregnancy weight quickly, but this isn't the healthiest way to lose the weight. Talk with your doctor about making gradual adjustments, so you lose one or two pounds a week. You'll be more likely to keep the weight off and lose the weight in a way that's healthy for you and your baby (if you're breastfeeding).Keep in mind that breastfeeding burns 500 calories a day. If you plan on breastfeeding, you probably won't need to cut any calories for a while.
 If you're eating a balanced diet and not breastfeeding, your doctor may not suggest any nutritional supplements. But if you're breastfeeding or you're concerned that you're not getting the nutrients you need, your doctor might recommend that you take a postpartum vitamin or continue taking your prenatal vitamin. Ensure that the vitamin contains:Vitamin D
Calcium
Iron (if anemia is suspected)

, It may be tempting to drink more coffee or caffeinated sodas to increase your energy levels, but you should limit or avoid them. Sodas are full of sugars that offer no nutritional value. If you plan on breastfeeding, your baby may be sensitive to the caffeine, so plan on cutting or limiting your intake. You should also watch or avoid alcohol intake, especially if you're breastfeeding.Avoid heavy drinking if you're stressed or anxious about caring for your baby. If you're having difficulty coping, talk with your doctor or a friend.
 Fuel a healthy appetite and gradual weight loss by exercising regularly. While you may not have as much time to hit the gym as you did before the baby's birth, you can still do low-key exercises that are recommended by your doctor.For example, you can fast-walk with your baby in a stroller or learn to do pelvic stretches that can improve your healing.

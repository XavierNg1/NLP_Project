 It needs to be big enough for all your vegetables. Make sure it also has a matching lid or a lid that will sufficiently keep in the steam.
 This will create the steaming effect but is not enough to boil all the nutrients out of the vegetables. And the left over water can be used in a vegetable broth!Don't be tempted to add more water -- that defeats the purpose. If it all evaporates away mid-steam (which it shouldn't), you can just add more.
 Refer to the heating times listed above to know when the vegetables are done. Keep the vegetables separate so you can easily take out the ones that finish first.


If the lid has a vent, great. You want a tiny amount steam to escape. If it doesn't, open it just slightly periodically -- but not all the way!

, Steamed vegetables without a steamer. Season as you like (salt, pepper, or olive oil) and serve with any main dish.


Keep the vegetable water for tomorrow's soup! You're so resourceful.

 Most small swallowed items, such as teeth, will easily pass through the digestive tract along with food because they are the size of a pill and too small to cause any blockage. However, it is possible that the tooth will become stuck somewhere in the digestive system and require medical attention. Go to a doctor if:


The tooth has not passed within 7 days.
Vomiting occurs, especially with blood present.
Symptoms such as pain in the belly or chest develop, coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath.
You have blood in the stools, especially black or tarry blood.;
, It will probably take about 12 to 14 hours for the tooth to pass.However, don’t be surprised if it shows up sooner, or later, than within those parameters.
 Nothing moves through your body quickly. You need to pass it through your digestive system and the more relaxed you are, the faster it will move along through your stomach, intestines, and colon.
 Corn kernels can stay largely intact as they pass through the bowels. When you start seeing corn in your stool, you’ll know it’s time to look for the tooth., These foods can help items move along through the digestive tract. , If recommended by a doctor, you may consider using a laxative to aid in the recovery of the tooth. Make sure to take the right amount of the laxative to avoid overdosing. Overuse of laxatives can have serious effects and lead to dependency, loss of bone density, and a host of other problems causing dehydration followed by an increased heart rate and low blood pressure.When your stool is fairly loose and/or watery (because of the laxative), place a screen on the toilet to catch the tooth.

 Make sure your home printer can print on cardstock. Load a sheet of cardstock (or blank postcards) into your printer's paper tray. Print out however many copies of your postcard that you want.


If you are printing both the front and back of your postcards, print a page of "fronts" first. Then, load the cardstock back into your printer's paper tray before printing the "backs." If you're unsure which side your printer prints to, try doing this using a test page on normal printer paper first.
 Unless your postcard takes up the entire sheet of paper, you will need to cut your printout into separate cards. If you have a paper cutter, use that to quickly make consistent cuts into multiple copies at once. Otherwise, hand cut them one at a time with a pair of scissors. Some blank postcards are perforated so that all you will need to do is tear where necessary.
 If your Word document didn't include addresses, write them in. You can also add a handwritten message to any available blank space. Affix a stamp to the top right corner of the addressed side, and your card is ready to post.

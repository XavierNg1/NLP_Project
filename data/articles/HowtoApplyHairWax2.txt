 Comb your eyebrows so that the hairs run in the same direction, then spread a tiny amount of wax along each eyebrow with the tip of your finger. Waxing is ideal for naturally dark or bushy brows that grow back quickly after shaving.
 You can use standard hair wax, but you may also use a dedicated mustache wax product. These are often harder and less goopy than standard wax products. Rub the wax between your fingers until it is warm, smooth, and clump-free.









For a more natural look, work a moderate amount of wax into your mustache and do not twist the ends. Try using a mustache comb to work it in. Blow-dry the wax on a high-heat, low speed to blend it in.
For a more ostentatious look—say, a handlebar mustache—apply more product and twist the tips of your mustache into points. If you have a particularly long or bushy mustache, consider grabbing the hairs at the base of your mustache as you twist so that you don't rip any out. When the mustache is thoroughly waxed, work the tips into curls until they hold.

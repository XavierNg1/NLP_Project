 In combination, one of these methods can produce stronger results.









Try lightening your hair with Cassia Obovata. Cassia is a plant that contains a faint golden or slight yellow dye. It's known also as "neutral henna" and will give your hair a golden tone.
Spritz on chamomile tea to lighten to your hair. Chamomile tea works best on light brown or blonde hair. Spray it in the same way you would lemon juice or hydrogen peroxide.
Drench with diluted hydrogen peroxide. It may not be "natural", but it certainly works. (Lightening your hair with lemons, even though they are "natural" still causes damage to your hair in much the same way hydrogen peroxide does.)
Try a bit of cinnamon to lighten those locks! Cinnamon works nicely on dark hair and it sure smells better than hydrogen peroxide. Give it a try!
Sweeten that color with a bit of honey. Honey is another good lightening agent. It's natural, doesn't dry your hair like lemon or peroxide and it works!
Combine lemon with honey and cinnamon for an excellent conditioning hair lightener. Follow the above lemon water method, only also add cinnamon and honey to the lemon water.

 For the best results, preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Before heating, center your oven racks.
 Gently rinse your fillets and place them on a non-stick baking pan or a pan lined with foil.


You can cook frozen fillets.
Season your fish if you prefer. Squeeze lemon juice on each piece of fish and sprinkle them with garlic salt and pepper.
Bread your fish if you prefer. Lightly dust each piece with a fine layer of breadcrumbs. You can make fresh breadcrumbs of use store-bought and mix in extra seasonings like garlic powder or pepper if you'd like.
 Place your pan in the oven and bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes. If you have breaded the fish, the breading should be golden brown.


Add 5-10 minutes if cooking from frozen.

 If not, think about getting a freezer-less option. They offer excellent storage space. If it does need a freezer, where do you want it? You have options as to on top, bottom or the side. In deciding this you will also need to think about how much space you'll need and what kind of freezer you want. A good example is a side by side refrigerator; while it has a great deal of space, it doesn't allow anything wide to be placed in it. (Better measure that Thanksgiving turkey before bringing it home!);
, Does the refrigerator have a certain area that it has to fit into? Are there cabinets around it? If so, make sure you look for refrigerators that have a vent at the bottom otherwise the motor will burn out quickly.
 If you are looking for a color, is it one that will allow you to update your kitchen in the next 5-10 years or will the avocado green always make your kitchen look like it is stuck in the 70's? Remember, you will use it for a long time and if it can't withstand changes in your personal taste, trends and styles then you will regret it.
 Stainless steel will get fingerprints on it if it isn't treated with protective coatings, something that can be a nasty surprise for unsuspecting buyers.
 Remember to take into account what types of changes you expect in your life over the next 10 years. For example, if you're single now, you might get married, have kids and need more room.
 Do you need a built in ice maker? Do you long for an ice and water dispenser? Do you need adjustable shelves?

, Try not to rush into your decision because you may find that for only a few hundred dollars more you will get a lot closer to the refrigerator you want. In the end a few hundred dollars more is well worth being happy with your fridge for the next 10-15 years.
 If you live alone, you might want to consider a 3 cubic feet refrigerator. If you are a large family, say, with 5-7 members, you might consider getting a Side-by-Side refrigerator, which has much more capacity.

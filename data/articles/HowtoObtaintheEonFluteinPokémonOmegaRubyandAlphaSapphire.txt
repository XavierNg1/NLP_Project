 Earlier in the game a cutscene would have played where Groudon or Kyogre causes either a drought or rainstorm. Steven will ask you to come to Sootopolis City. The Sootopolis Gym is locked at the time, so you can't beat it.;
, You won't be able to make it there because Steven will appear and a cutscene with Wallace will occur. They should take you there to fight the game's legendary.
 As you get closer to the end, a screaming sound will keep playing. This just means that you are getting closer.
 Team Magma or Team Aqua will have given you a Magma Suit or Aqua Suit to ride in. By this point, you will have the Orb, so the suit can operate.
 This will enable you to get the flute. You will either have to knock out or catch the Pok√©mon.
 Then, a cutscene will play, and you will get the Eon Flute. The flute will let you Soar and catch special legendaries at the Mirage Spots.

 Advertise in the newspaper, online or on local notice boards at schools, churches and coffee shops.
 Show parents and their children around your facilities, introduce them to the staff, and explain the schedule and curriculum to them. Obtain the necessary paperwork to admit children into your day care.
 Once your day care is up and running, keep improving your facilities, policies, and program structure to provide the best possible care to the children you are serving and attract a steady stream of new clients.

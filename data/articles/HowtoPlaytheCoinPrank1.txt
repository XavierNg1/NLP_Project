 You can set this trick up in any location and it is sure to fool someone. For the best effect, scout an area that is heavily trafficked. An example of somewhere with heavy foot traffic is a street festival or a busy corner. The coin will settle best on smooth cement, so keep this in mind when scouting for a location.


You should also consider an area where you can stand where no one will notice you.;
, Find a penny or another suitable coin like a quarter, dime, or half dollar. Try to use a coin that is worth more, so more people will be more inclined to pick it up. If you can find a gold colored coin, all the better.


Gold colors tend to glint temptingly in the sunshine.
 Pick out a decent glue that will hold. The best type of glue to use for this trick is some type of super glue. Super glue dries quickly and will be nearly impossible to remove. Super glue also comes in a smaller container so it will be harder for bystanders to notice what you are doing.


Attach the glue to the coin itself and then place it on the ground., Once the coin and glue are set onto the desired spot, step on the coin with your shoe. By stepping on it, you are helping the glue settle faster. This is also a good way to be discreet while setting up a prank.


Be sure the adhesive side is facing the ground.
Stand on the coin for about 30 seconds to a full minute. Check your phone and act like you are preoccupied.
Test the coin yourself by feeling if the glue is fully settled.
 Go to a discreet location where you can see the coin, and camp out for a bit. Watch for people who become enticed by the coin on the street. If you catch one of your friends going for the coin, take a picture so you can show him. It is all in good fun, and no one should get too upset by this.

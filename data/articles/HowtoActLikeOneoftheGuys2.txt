If they love playing video games, start playing the games that they're into. Guys take pride in their hobbies. Work to get better at whatever it is you do with the guys.


Remember to have fun. Don’t be too obsessed with being the best.
 Guys get irritated if it takes you two hours to get ready to do anything. Men like to get up and go. Don’t be too picky either. Guys get agitated if you have to have everything your way.Make decisions quickly. Guys don’t want to wait to eat because you can’t decide what to order.
If you like one of the boys, you especially want to show him you’re low maintenance. Guys can find dating high maintenance girls exhausting.
 Show the guys you’re down to experience new things. Guys love adrenaline. A rush of adrenaline releases dopamine which makes you feel good. The feeling is amplified when you experience it in a group.Don’t be afraid if the guys invite you to go skydiving or to ride a huge roller coaster.
Use your better judgement. If something really does make you feel unsafe, it’s okay to decline the invitation.
 Men like to have everything ready in advance. Show the guys they can count on you to cover all your bases. Organize all your supplies before you go camping or on a road trip. Talk to the guys to see what you should bring to every event. If it’s your job to bring snacks to a party, prepare them the day before so you’re not scrambling.

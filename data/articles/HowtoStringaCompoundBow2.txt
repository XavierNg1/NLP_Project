 The only compound bows that can be restrung by hand are older models with a "teardrop" shaped attachment for the string. These attachment points have two grooves in order to hold two strings at once, allowing you to use the old string to keep the bow in position while you attach the new one. Many of these can still be placed in a bow press for safer stringing.No compound bow can be safely strung by hand if there is not an old string present.










No other type of compound bow should ever be strung without a bow press. Even if you have successfully managed it before, you risk releasing several hundred pounds of pressure and causing serious injury.
If your teardrop bow has not been used in some time, take it to a professional archery shop rather than trying to string it yourself. Old, potentially damaged cables or strings could break and cause injury during restringing.
 Turn the top bolt one turn counterclockwise to loosen that limb, then do the same for the opposite limb. Repeat an additional one or two times, alternating limbs, to make the limbs slightly looser.
 Hold the bow in one hand and step on the old string. Lift the bow up to flex the limbs. Do not pull the bow back to its full draw length; you only need to flex the limbs close enough together to attach the new string.
 The teardrop on each limb of the bow should have two grooves, one with the old string and one empty. Slip the end loops of your new string over the empty grooves. Make sure they are firmly attached and taut.
 Lower the bow slowly to its normal position. Step on the new string this time, partially drawing the bow back up toward you as before. Unhook the old string from each teardrop.

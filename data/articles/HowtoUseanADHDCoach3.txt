 Coaching is a way to help manage ADHD, but is not considered a treatment option. In order to engage in coaching for ADHD-related issues, you should probably already have lived with ADHD for some time and tried a number of treatment options. For instance, medication in the form of stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall are considered an effective treatment for ADHD. These medications have few side effects.Talk with your doctor about different types of medical treatments for ADHD. You can see your primary care doctor or a psychiatrist, a doctor who specializes in the treatment of mental health conditions. A psychiatrist may be more appropriate for you if you have tried several different medication regimens without improvement.
 Although medical treatment can help with changing some of the behaviours often associated with ADHD, psychological therapy is essential for dealing with the long term impact of the illness.For example, therapy can provide an individual with an opportunity to talk about their feelings, explore their behaviours, learn how to control their emotions, cope with daily problems, and build self-esteem.
While coaching is typically not covered by insurance, seeing a therapist is usually covered and it can be very beneficial.
 Behavioural therapy focuses more directly on how to handle emotions and change behaviour. Rather than focusing on the origins of behavioural issues, this type of treatment tackles the issue by coming up with solutions. For example, a patient may focus on finishing projects in a timely manner.

 That is, talk about how you are committed to hiring a diverse group of people, or how you treat every customer with respect no matter what background they come from.


This is an important piece of your diversity statement, as it allows you to crystallize your organization's commitment to diversity.;
, Diversity encompasses many different spheres of life, so it is important to define the types of diversity that you are specifically dedicated to supporting.


For instance, you can talk about how you believe people of both genders should be treated equally, how every person should be treated the same no matter their ethnic background or what religion they practice.
You can also address age, gender identity, sexuality, and classism.
 Discuss the various ways in which you will follow through on your commitment to diversity as set up in your statement.


How exactly do you implement what you promise in your diversity statement?
Do you set specific goals for hiring?
Do you fire anyone who violates the policy?
Backing up what you say will give your diversity statement bite.

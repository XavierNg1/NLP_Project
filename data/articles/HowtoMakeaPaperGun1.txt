 Fold the top edge down to the bottom edge, matching the corners. Repeat this fold two more times.









Make your folds crisp and precise. Try using a bone folder (available at craft or art supply stores) to help crease your paper precisely.;
, The fold should fall approximately 3½" from the edge.
 The top of the gun (where the barrel will attach) is the edge with the open flaps.
 Take your other sheet of paper and fold it in half widthwise. Cut this paper on the fold, so you have an 8½" x 5½" rectangle.









Fold this paper in half lengthwise twice. Then fold the right edge over to the left edge and crease firmly.
 Take the barrel, open ends down, and fit it onto the handle where the open flaps face up.

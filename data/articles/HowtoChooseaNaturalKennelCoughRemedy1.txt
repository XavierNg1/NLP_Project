 While a Bordetella vaccine can provide protection, there are dozens of viruses your dog can catch, especially if boarded, visiting with other neighborhood dogs or involved in group training. Like humans, dogs can catch “colds” so make sure your dog has a full evaluation from a veterinarian.;
, Be descriptive of what your dog is experiencing. Describe the noise he or she is making because cough type is associated with a variety of diseases (i.e. kennel cough, heartworm, etc.). Also, don't forget to mention the last time your dog came in contact with another pup that doesn’t live with your family.
 Rather than wait and see, bring your dog to the vet the minute you suspect something is wrong. Especially if your dog is gagging and hacking your pup should be evaluated immediately because the diagnosis could be a range of issues.

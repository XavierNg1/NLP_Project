 Low blood sugar can cause a person to fall unconscious. If you or the person who fainted knows this is the cause, then give them something sweet to eat like a Jolly Rancher or another small candy. You can also give them something sweet to drink like Gatorade, juice, or lemonade.However, only do this after they regain consciousness.


If it is due to dehydration or heat, move them to a cool place and give them water or Gatorade to drink.
 Kneel by their side and place their arm closest to you at a right angle to their body with their palm facing up. Place their other hand across their chest with the back of their palm lying flat against their cheek. Hold this arm in place with your hand. Then, with your other hand, pull their farther knee up and over their other leg until their foot is flat on the ground. Gently pull on their lifted knee and roll them toward you until they are on their side. Now they are in a recovery position.You should do this if the person is unresponsive for more than a minute, but still breathing and lying on their back.
If you think the victim has a spinal injury, do not roll or move them.
 Once the person is in the recovery position, call 911 for emergency medical help. Keep monitoring their breathing until the medics arrive. If they stop breathing you or someone else will need to perform CPR.Call 911 if the person is injured, has diabetes, has seizures, has lost control of their bladder or bowels, is pregnant, is over age 50, or is unconscious for more than one minute.
If the person wakes up and feels discomfort, pressure, or pain in their chest, or if they have an irregular or pounding heartbeat, then call 911.
Also call 911 if the person has vision problems or cannot speak or move their legs.

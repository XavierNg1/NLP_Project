 It will make a difference if you are trying to remove Sharpie from wood or a counter top, for example. Be most careful with wood. Non-chemical products may be a better choice in that case.If you are removing a Sharpie from wood, sometimes, just rubbing it with the eraser can remove it. You do not want to use any cleaner that has alcohol in it on the wood because it will ruin the finish.
If you are removing Sharpie from a counter top that is not wood, nail polish remover, and other slightly alcoholic substances may remove it, though.
 Don’t have any chemical products around or don’t want to expose yourself to them? Try using oranges.Before you start, make sure you rub the orange peel; this is known to bring out the essential oils that you will need.
Using “elbow grease,” start rubbing the stain with the peels.
 Put a small amount of toothpaste onto a rag that you don't mind getting stained. Forcefully rub the toothpaste against the Sharpie.


Add more toothpaste as needed. Be sure to rinse the area after you finish. Toothpaste is an option for those who don’t want exposure to stronger chemicals.Do not use gel toothpastes, as they won’t work on Sharpie stains and can be too sticky. You could also try spraying deodorant on the surface, and the Sharpie should come off., This might not work for every surface; however, it works for a lot of them. You could also try hairspray.


Simply just get a tissue or toilet paper, put hand sanitizer and hairspray on it, put it in a ball (this will spread the sanitizer to almost all parts of the paper), and then simply scrub.
The more gross method if you have no hand sanitizer is using your own spit.
 There are other common household ingredients that you can use to tackle the stain. These are a few of them.


If the stain is on carpet, try white vinegar. If it’s on furniture, try milk.
If the stain is on ceramic or glass, add 1 part toothpaste to 1 part baking soda, and see if it will rub off.

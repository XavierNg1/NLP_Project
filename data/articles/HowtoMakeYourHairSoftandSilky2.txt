 Rinsing your hair with beer may help to make it silky and soft. Try pouring a flat beer over your hair after you have finished washing it. Leave it on your hair for about five minutes and then rinse it out with cool water.








Another alternative is to pour some beer into a spray bottle, and spritz it into your hair after you wash your hair. Then leave it in like a leave-in conditioner.
 Before you go to bed at night, cover your hair with olive oil or egg oil. Massage the oil into the roots of your hair all the way to the ends and then cover it with a shower cap. You can also wrap a towel or bandana around your head to help keep the shower cap in place. Sleep with your hair wrapped, and then rinse the oil out in the morning.








Follow up by shampooing and conditioning your hair as usual.
 Heat four tablespoons of coconut, olive, almond, or castor oil in a pan until it is slightly warm to the touch, but not hot. Pour this warmed oil into your hair, and use your fingers to massage it into your roots and scalp. When all of your strands have been coated with the warm oil, put a shower cap over your hair and then wrap the outside of the shower cap with a hot towel. The heat from the oil and the towel will open the pores in your scalp, allowing the oil to soak in and soften your hair.


After about 10 minutes, rinse out the oil and wash your hair as usual.
 Apple cider vinegar can also help to make your hair soft and silky. Combine Â½ a cup of apple cider vinegar with one cup of warm water. Spritz or pour the apple cider vinegar onto into your hair after you wash it and allow it to sit for about 10 minutes. Then, rinse the apple cider vinegar out of your hair with cool water.This treatment may also be helpful if you have dandruff or an itchy scalp.

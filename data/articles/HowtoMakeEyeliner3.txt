 Unsweetened cocoa powder makes a beautifully rich, dark brown eyeliner. Spoon a little into a small container. Mix the cocoa with a few drops of water, jojoba oil or almond oil until it has a gel-like consistency, then apply it with your eyeliner brush.
 Spirulina powder is made from dried and ground algae, so it has a beautiful dark green hue. Pour some spirulina powder into a dish, then apply plain or mix it with water or oil to create a gel effect., While you might not want to wear bright red eyeliner, adding beetroot powder to activated charcoal or cocoa will create a pretty reddish hue that looks great with warmer skin tones. Beetroot powder is available at most health food stores.
 Mica powder comes in every color of the rainbow. It's a product used in all types of makeup, from eye shadow to lipstick. Do an online search for mica powder to find the color you like best. Use the powder the same way you'd use activated charcoal: mix it with water, aloe, or oil to create a gel you can instantly apply.
 Any eyeshadow can be converted into eyeliner. Take one of your old, cracked eyeshadows and dump it into a small container. Use a knife to break it up until it turns into a fine powder. Mix in a little water, aloe, or oil to create a gel, then apply the product with an eyeliner brush.

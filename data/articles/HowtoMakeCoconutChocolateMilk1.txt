 Heat your water until it is either very hot or boiling. You can do this easily by heating the water in a pot on your stovetop or in an electric kettle. Water that is slightly below boiling will better preserve the nutritional value of the coconut., As your water is heating, take two pieces of cheesecloth and layer them inside your strainer. Be sure that both pieces cover the entire inside of the strainer. Then place the strainer over a large bowl., Make sure your blender is unplugged to prevent it from accidentally activating and causing harm or creating a mess. Then add your shredded coconut and heated water to the blender. Attach the lid firmly and blend the mixture.


It should only take about 45 seconds of blending before your mixture is ready to be strained., Pour your blended hot water and shredded coconut mixture into your strainer. Allow the liquid to drip into the bowl beneath the strainer. To get every last drop, gather the edges of the cheesecloth together and squeeze all remaining liquid from the shredded coconut.


Wait about 10 minutes before squeezing leftover liquid from the cheesecloth. It may still be quite hot., Depending on the brand of syrup you are using, the amount you need to add to your milk will vary. You may like your chocolate milk sweet, or you might like it less so. Add syrup until you achieve the desired taste.


Mix the liquid well with a spoon or similar suitable stirring implement to distribute the syrup throughout the milk. Otherwise, the syrup might collect on the bottom of the bowl., If you desire, you can transfer your simple coconut chocolate milk to a different container that might be more suitable for storage. However, feel free to put your bowl of coconut chocolate milk straight in the fridge.


Once your coconut milk is done, you should drink it within two days to prevent it from going bad.

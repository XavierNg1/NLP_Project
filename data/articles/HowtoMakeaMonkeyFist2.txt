 First you’ll need to construct a standard monkey's fist with three strands.


Leave enough slack on the tail to create the additional hangman's noose for the keyring.
Make sure you also have a keyring for your keychain.
 Create an even "S" shape with the remainder of the slack.


Now wrap the monkey fist around the S-shaped portion of rope three times, Like you would when making a monkey's fist.
 Take the loose strand and wrap it three times around, moving up towards the hole.


Super glue the wraps to keep a firm hold.
Cut off any excess rope.
 Take a keyring and weave it around the hole you’ve created from the bottom of the monkey fist.


Once you’re done you can attach it to your keys or pass it on to a friend.

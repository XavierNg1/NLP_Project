 Address together any concerns either of you may have regarding offering cigars at your wedding before moving forward with it.;
, The most elaborate way is to host a cigar rolling activity during the reception. You can hire a specialty company that will travel to your event, provide their own cigar rolling supplies and do the actual cigar rolling demonstration. The cigar roller, typically dressed in authentic Dominican attire and straw hat, will interact with your guests and offer a hand rolled cigar to each participating guest to enjoy at wedding or at a later time. Another option is to host a cigar bar in an area near the reception area where you offer cigars for guests so they can enjoy them there and mingle with other cigar smokers. The simplest option is to provide a celebratory cigar as part of a thank you gift as guests are leaving the wedding.
 If you are hiring a specialty company to do the cigar rolling demonstration or host a cigar bar, reserve them as soon as you can. If you are hosting a cigar bar yourself or giving out cigars, decide who will be responsible for fulfilling that task.
 Some good cigar brands to buy for the masses for weddings in particular are Roly and Baccarat. Another good choice is the Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde, which cost about $50 a box for 25 cigars. While ordering your cigars, don’t forget to include cigar cutters to have available as well.
 Personalized cigar labels with the wedding date and the bride and groom’s name is a nice touch especially at a wedding. Ask the specialty company who is doing your cigar rolling demo or cigar bar if they can coordinate this for you or if you need to order them online yourself. If you are doing the cigar bar or giving cigars as part of a thank you gift, you can find several companies online that specialize in customized cigar labels. While ordering cigar labels, also consider ordering personalized matches to have available at the wedding or included in bags with the cigars.

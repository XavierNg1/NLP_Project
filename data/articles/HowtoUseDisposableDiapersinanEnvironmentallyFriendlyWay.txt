 These are made from cloth and sometimes plastic components. They will often require the use of a disposable liner. They're a good in-between compromise for some moms.
 Anything added to diapers on top of their already extensive energy use is just cosmetic and unnecessary. Moreover, these additions can harm your baby when they're not clearly disclosed and you don't know what they are.
 Do not leave it for the garbage; the viruses in feces can impact from people in the household to the collector through to landfill. Keep a special feces scraper on hand and wash it thoroughly after each use. Wash your own hands thoroughly each time too.

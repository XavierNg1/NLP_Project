 Take the potatoes, carrot, and onion and cut them into equal and small pieces. Set the pieces aside and then cut the ginger and garlic into fine, diced pieces.;
, Add the vegetable oil to the skillet and heat the ginger and garlic pieces in it. Place the ground beef into the skillet and sprinkle the pepper and salt on top of the beef. Cook the beef all the way through, making sure all the red turns to brown. If you do not want the beef juice in this recipe, please discard the oil (drain it from the ground beef) into a can or a disposable container before moving onto the next step.
 Dump in the onion, carrot, and potato mixture into the skillet. Cook and stir everything together for five minutes.
 Carefully pour it in and mix everything together.
 Put the pan over medium heat and continue to cook and stir it for 20 minutes. You'll see that the stock has thickened by now. Add the curry cubes to the pan and they should melt into the stew once placed in. Put the heat to a lower setting and leave it to simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and set the saucepan on the side.
 Cut away any excess fat from the pork. With the side of your knife, flatten down the edges of the loin. Put the pork into a bowl and pour the sake over it. Marinate it for a few minutes and then dry both sides of the pork with paper towels. Season the pork with a little salt and pepper.
 Breading meat is always fun since there's different elements that go into it. Coat the pork loin with flour, dip (don't drown) it into the bowl of the beaten egg, and then lay each side of the loin onto a tray of panko flakes. Move the loin into another skillet with vegetable oil at 350 °F (177 °C). Make sure the oil fizzles as the loin drops in. Fry each side until they're both golden brown.
 Scoop up a cup of rice and cut a good slice of cutlet to put on the side of the rice. Take a spoon and dish out a spoonful of the curry to pour onto the cutlet and rice. Enjoy with a garnish of radishes.

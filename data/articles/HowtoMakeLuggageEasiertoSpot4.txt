 Use a cobra stitch or Turk's head knot.,, Look for one with a rainbow of colors, interesting patterns or somehow customizable. It'll keep your gear intact and make the bag easier to spot.


Add your own unique collection of embroidered "sleeves" by sliding them onto the belt. You can collect sleeves representing countries, states, sports, inspirational, etc. These can be a way to express yourself, as well as being a unique identifier. Indeed, they can be a great conversation starter. Luggage sleeves will work well on a backpack, golf bag, board bag or other 2 inch (5.1Â cm) strapping.

 Upgrade coupons are either single upgrade or double upgrade. For example if a company classifies its sizes from compact/mid/standard/full/premium, and you wanted a full size; you would book the mid-size and may receive an upgrade to a full size.


Don't forget...may receive an upgrade. Most coupons state some variation of "The upgraded car is subject to availability at the time of rental"

, Keep this in mind if you require a certain size. If you need a full size, book it and upgrade to a premium. If the price of the full size is more than you would like, book the full size and use a money off coupon instead.

 Making soft drinks from scratch means actually purchasing the ingredients that are used to cause carbonation to occur in water. They're available at home brewing stores or online.You'll need the following:


A 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket
Plastic bottles with caps, for storing the finished soft drinks
A large stock pot
A large stirring spoon
8 cups of sugar
Flavoring of your choice
1 packet champagne brewer's yeast
Soda extract
Kitchen thermometer

, In the big stock pot, pour in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water and 8 cups of sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and stir until the sugar has dissolved into the water.


At this point you can add any spices or flavorings you'd like to add, such as ginger (to make ginger ale) or lemon peel. Let the spices cook with the sugar. Once the sugar has dissolved, strain the spices from the mixture before proceeding.
 To make it less concentrated, add 2 more gallons of cold water to the mix.Let the mixture cool down a bit, but not too much; it should be between 70 and 80 degrees F.


Test with the kitchen thermometer to make sure it's at the right temperature before proceeding.
If the mixture gets too cold, you'll have to heat it back up before adding the soda extract and yeast.
,, If your bucket has a spigot, use that to fill the bottles; otherwise you can place a funnel in a bottle and ladle soda into it a cup at a time. When the bottles are full, screw on the caps tightly.
 At this temperature, the yeast will consume the sugar and begin to ferment, creating carbon dioxide. It will take 2-3 days for the water to become carbonated.
 Squeeze the plastic bottles. If they feel firm when you squeeze them, the water is carbonated. If the bottles indent easily, they need more time., When the bottles are ready, put them in the refrigerator to cool down. When they're cold, open one up and enjoy your homemade soda.

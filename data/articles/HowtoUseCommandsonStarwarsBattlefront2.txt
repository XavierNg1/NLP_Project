 When you're a private, you can only command 1 soldier. you can get a better rank by playing more battles and earning more medals to gain points.;
, Once you find a reasonable group, get near them and immediately move to the next step.
 The up arrow commands your team to follow, the down arrow makes them fall back. The side ones... I forget! If someone knows, please say so!

, Now that you have a team, you have a better advantage and chance of taking the enemy out.

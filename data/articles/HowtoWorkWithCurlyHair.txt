 (Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers.) Then take a shower. When you shampoo your hair put in the shampoo as if you're brushing it through your hair.. This will minimize the tangles that scrubbing too hard can cause. When you condition, apply it the same way. Rinse out the conditioner with warm water, then put a quarter sized amount into your hands. Evenly distribute this throughout your hair, then rinse with *cold water* this makes your hair a bit shinier and can help reduce frizz.;
, Be proud of your hair! Curly hair is amazing! When you're out of the shower, towel dry slightly, so that it's not dripping, and comb *with your fingers.* Let your hair air dry. If it's late, and you need to sleep, but your hair is still wet. Put it into a high ponytail (a loose so you can actually sleep) and wrap the remaining hair around it, and secure that with another elastic. Making a bun. If your hair is dry, put it into a ponytail or a braid while you sleep to reduce knots and frizz.
 and brush it lightly with your fingers. If its frizzy, wet your hands and rub them together, then brush your hair with your fingers again. If you don't have time to let this dry, (even though it only takes like, five minutes,) spray some light hold hairspray onto your hands, and run your fingers though your hair again. Repeat if needed. If this doesn't work, mist you hair (VERY lightly) with the hair spray, then brush with your fingers.
 A low side pony near your ear, or a loose side braid also looks good with curly hair. Or leave it down. Be proud of your luscious locks! Or brush your hair straight back (with your fingers of course!) then secure it with a clip. If you have a big forehead.... this style might not be best for you.

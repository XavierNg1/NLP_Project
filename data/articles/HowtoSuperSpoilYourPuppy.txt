 Look for one that contains coconut milk, as your dog requires a shiny pelt to look fresh. Clip their nails often, and brush their teeth regularly to keep them in check. Always blow-dry your pup after washing them, as nobody really likes the smell of a wet dog. Apply dog perfume for that added fragrance.;
, Get your puppy a big fluffy bed with lots of pillows, because if you find it comfy, so will your puppy. Perhaps even try getting cute matching nightwear.
 Take your puppy on a daily walk to stay healthy, as well as to relieve any stress the puppy may have. Make sure while on walks, you take a bottle of water on long walks and a poop bag to pick up any that they may do. Use a stylish leash for that extra class! Make sure you play with your puppy daily to keep the dog active.
, Clothes are a must. Booties, sweaters, tops, hats, fancy collars. The cuter the better.

 Enter vzw.com/changenumber into your web browser. Changing your number is free if you do it online.
 You will need to log in or create an account with your wireless account information.
 If you have multiple numbers associated with your account, you will be asked to select which one you want to change.
 This will start the number change process.
 You will be asked if you want to get a new number from your current city or state, or if you are moving and need a new area code.


If you are changing area codes, you will be asked to enter your new ZIP code or select a city and state from the drop-down menu.
 Click the drop-down menu to select the area code and exchange you would like. The area code is the first three digits, and the exchange is the second set of three digits.
 You can choose to change the number immediately, when your next billing period starts, or any date you choose within the next 30 days.


The number change will occur at midnight (EST) on the selected day, unless you choose today, in which case it should happen immediately.
 Review the new number and click the "Submit" button to confirm the changes. You will not be able to retrieve your old number once you click "Submit".
 The confirmation page will display instructions for activating your new number. The instructions vary for different devices, but generally:


3G users should dial *228.
4G users should turn off the device for five minutes.
 Changing your number is free if done online using the steps above, but you can call and have it changed by a customer service rep for $15. Call 1-800-922-0204 to speak to a representative.

The stink bugs will release their odor inside the vacuum, causing the machine to stink for several weeks. Sprinkle the interior of the vacuum with a strong deodorizer to minimize this effect.
Avoid using bagless vacuum cleaners. Use vacuums with bags and dispose of the bag after you finish sucking up the bugs.
Alternatively, wrap a knee-high stocking around the outside of the vacuum tube and secure it in place with a rubber band. Stuff the rest of the stocking into the tube and suck the stink bugs up as usual. This will prevent the bugs from passing through the vacuum filter.
 Place a bug zapper in a dark attic or closet.


Like most insects, stink bugs are drawn to sources of light. By placing the device in a dark room, the light of the electrocution system becomes more appealing to the stink bugs. As they approach the light, they are instantly electrocuted and die before they have the chance to release their stink.
Make sure that you sweep up or vacuum up the dead stink bugs after several days pass.
 Spread flypaper or other sticky traps near windows, doorways, vents, and cracks.


The stink bugs will get caught on the traps as they pass over them. Without being able to search out food, the insects will starve to death.
Throw out the glue trap after you have gathered several stink bugs.
Be aware of the fact that stink bugs may release their odor upon becoming stuck to the trap.
 Place the container in a freezer for several days to kill them.


Make sure that the container or bag has a tight seal. Otherwise, you run the risk of contaminating the contents of your freezer.
 Quickly pick up the glass. Sweep the dead bug into the garbage.

Make sure you do this outside because the chemical will build up and you can actually see the brown fumes.

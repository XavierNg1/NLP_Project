 Not only are your meals prepared here, but your family and guests gather here as well. Sufficient and adequate lighting is a must for performing all your culinary needs, helping your kids with their homework, and reading the paper.


Sketch a plan of your kitchen that focuses on activity areas and then decide what kind of light each area will need: general, task, accent, or decorative.
Use higher watt bulbs in task areas.
A glass or plastic pendant will provide ample "up-lighting" to cover the entire dinette area with light.
 Kitchens less than 100 square feet require a two lamp fluorescent, up to 250 square feet will require supplemental lighting. Down lights mounted 18" off the edge of the cabinets, and spaced 3' to 4' on centers is an excellent way to create additional general lighting.
 Fluorescent under cabinet fixtures are also a cost efficient lighting source. In open areas over sinks use recessed downlights mounted directly over the sink.


Mounting mini-pendants 18" to 24" above the work surface is an ideal way to light up a breakfast bar or counter dinettes, a pendant on a dimmer, hanging 24" to 30" above the table, is ideal for task lighting. Size the fixture to roughly 12" less than the diameter of the table.
 Use under cabinet lighting in cabinets, valences, and toe spaces and create drama while also supplying additional light to navigate around your kitchen in the evening.
 The ambient light provided by fluorescent fixtures will fill in your kitchen's shadows, reduce contrast, and light vertical surfaces to give the space a brighter feel.

, Do not get a wheel with bars. Gerbils tend to get their tails caught between the bars. Rather, get a mesh wheel or a silent spinner. Silent spinners are made of hard, durable plastic that most gerbils cannot chew. Watch for signs of wear, though. If your gerbils do begin to chew on it, switch to mesh.
 Refill it everyday with fresh water, or sooner if needed.
 There must be an all-day accessible block of chewing wood, because a gerbil's teeth are always growing. Make sure you add a little 'hiding place' because even if they're the best of friends, gerbils need a little privacy from their companions. Pet stores offer many plastic hideaways, but gerbils will chew them through quickly. A very inexpensive toy would be to use the cardboard toilet paper roll or paper towel roll. Though they will chew it up within a few hours, they provide lots of entertainment! Don't get any plastic toys, though!

, Just spread the food directly on the bedding, and watch them to make sure they are eating. This is called scatter feeding and encourages their natural instinct to forage. You can string small veggies on a metal Kebab stick made especially for rodents (but avoid ones with plastic tops).

 Turn the oven on to 250 degrees F (120 C). Tear off parchment paper and line two baking sheets with the paper. Set them aside while you make the butternut squash chips.Ensure that one of your oven racks is in the middle of the oven. This will help the chips cook evenly.
 Wash and peel one small butternut squash that's about one pound (455 g) in size. Use a large knife to carefully cut the squash in half so you end up with a thin end and a round end. Scoop the seeds out of the round end and throw them away. Use a mandoline to slice the squash into 1/8-inch thick (3 mm) slices.The slices from the thin end of the squash will be circular slices and the slices from the round end will actually be rings that you can fry.
 Place the slices and rings of butternut squash into a large mixing bowl and drizzle them with 4 teaspoons of olive oil. Sprinkle the squash with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh herbs. Consider using:Sage
Thyme
Oregano
Rosemary
Parsley

, Lay the seasoned butternut squash on the parchment-lined baking sheets. The chips should be in a single layer so they can crisp up as they bake. Bake the chips for one hour in the preheated oven and then turn them over. Bake them for another hour and turn them again. Bake them for one more hour and then turn off the oven. Leave the chips to crisp up in the oven overnight or for several hours before you serve them.The chips will bake for a total of three hours. You'll just need to turn them once every hour so they crisp up evenly.
You can store the butternut squash chips in an airtight container for up to one week.

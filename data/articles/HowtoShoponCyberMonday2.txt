 Some sites allow you to pre-load your shopping cart the day before the sale begins. This is a great way to save valuable time while shopping during Cyber Monday., Track down coupons and promo codes by typing in “store name promo code” or “store name coupon code” in your search engine. You can also visit sites like RetailMeNot.com and Savings.com. These sites list coupons and promo codes for different retailers.Many retailers, like Target and Amazon, will accept multiple promo codes on a single item. This is referred to as coupon stacking. Enter in one code, hit update total, and then enter in a second code to see if this is allowed.
 Use price comparison sites to ensure that you are getting the best deals. Use a price comparison site, like Price Grabber, before you place your orders. You can even download a mobile app if you plan to do your shopping on the go., Many stores offer free shipping during Cyber Monday, but not all of them do. Before purchasing your product, always double-check the shipping costs, particularly for heavy items like electronics and furniture. Try not to get hooked into shipping “deals,” either. Oftentimes, customers end up buying more stuff than they need because of shipping “deals.”For example, if one store has a better deal, but you still need to pay for shipping, factor in the shipping costs before determining which deal is better.
Check to see if you can purchase heavy items online, and then pick them up at the store.

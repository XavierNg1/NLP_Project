 Add your current expenses for housing, transportation, and so on to your best guess for what you’ll be spending on your newborn’s first month or two. Since the expenses of different new dads are highly variable, there is no single “right” way to do this. You could start by checking on the costs of basic items like diapers and basic services like childcare (if necessary).Talk to your employer and/or your partner’s employer about whether they offer paid parental leave or childcare.
Ask other parents about how much their costs increased after the arrival of a newborn.
 If you’re worried about having enough money for your newborn, look for ways to trim the fat from your expenses. For instance, instead of spending money on a film or concert, try saving it for expenses related to your newborn. You can also save money by purchasing reusable diapers rather than disposables. And if your partner breastfeeds the baby, you’ll be able to save on baby formula., The arrival of a new baby could mean that your tax status will change. This and other financial matters vary from place to place, so the best option to find out how your finances will or should change is by talking with a financial planner.You might also be able to set up a special account for your baby’s education or your immediate medical expenses.
Additionally, if you and your partner file jointly, you might be eligible for certain deductions for prenatal care, ultrasounds, and/or your baby’s delivery.

 If you have a regulation uniform supplied by a precise supplier, you'll have to go with that. But if the uniform is one that you piece together in the right colors or styles, then you can try to choose eco-friendly options, such as organic cottons, bamboo fiber and Fair Trade made gear.


Instead of buying brand new, buy secondhand uniforms to ensure that the clothing that already exists gets the most wear.
Even if you can't make changes, consider lobbying the school to shift to eco-friendly and Fair Trade clothing suppliers in the future. Perhaps this could make an excellent school project?

, Only purchase what you know you'll wear and need. Having too many items is a waste of precious resources and more cleaning work for you!

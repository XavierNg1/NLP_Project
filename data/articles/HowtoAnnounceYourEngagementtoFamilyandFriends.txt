 In fact, if you want to follow tradition, the groom should formally request the bride's hand. Invite the bride's parents to your home for dinner or take them out. The groom should take the bride's father aside and talk with him privately about the engagement. Allow the bride's father to then make a toast, making the engagement official.;
, Again, this should be done in person if possible. Invite them to dinner or take them out, and let them know about your engagement.
 Make sure that you invite both sets of parents if possible, and again, allow the bride's father to break the news to everyone.
 Include a formal engagement announcement in the local newspaper. You should include the names of both sets of parents in the announcement, and mention the date of the wedding, if that is known.


Create an engagement blog that debuts with the announcement, along with the story of how you both met. You can continue updating family and friends about the daily or weekly wedding plans.
Send an e-card announcing your engagement. You can include the link to your blog if you have one.
Include an announcement on social media outlets such as Facebook or Twitter. Again, you can keep your friends and family abreast of the wedding planning process.

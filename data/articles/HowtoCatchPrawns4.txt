 Fishing supply stores usually sell traps under the name “shrimp traps,” but they can be used for prawning. They are available in a variety of sizes. Determine which size fits your needs. A modest sized trap about ½ inch by one inch will usually do the trick.


Double check with your local authorities on limits to trap sizes before making your purchase.
 You’ll need this to lower the trap in the water. Weighted lines prevent the trap from floating and endangering marine life and boats. Fishing supply stores sell these in a variety of lengths. Purchase a line that’s about 25 percent longer than the depth you want to lower your trap to., You’ll need a regulation fishing buoy to spot the location of your trap. Don’t use plastic bottles from home, as they’re too light to accurately mark where your trap is. Mark your buoy with a unique color, initials, or serial number to tell it apart from other fishers’ buoys.
 Attach one end of the fishing line to the trap. Connect the other end of the line to the buoy. If you plan to set your trap far from your boat or land-based location, attach a polypropylene rope to the buoy so that you can pull the trap back to you without having to wade or swim too far., This step is optional, but it can help to increase your catch. Use pieces of dead fish, cat food, or artificial bait.Secure the bait in the trap with waterproof tape.
 Slowly submerge the trap into the water from your location on land or in a boat. Allow it to sink beneath the water. The fishing line will keep the trap weighted down. Wait a few hours or monitor the underwater action with your sounder.
 Locate your buoy. If your trap isn’t too far from shore, wade into the water and retrieve the trap by hand. If you attached a rope to the buoy, carefully start reeling the trap back to the surface. Stash your catch in a cooler to preserve their freshness. If you’re not happy with the results, repeat the process until you catch enough prawns.

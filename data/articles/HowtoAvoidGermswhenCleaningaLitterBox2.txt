 To keep the germs and odors down, plan on disinfecting and scrubbing your litter boxes every few weeks. You should do this with a mild bleach solution.When you disinfect the litter box, remove all the cat litter. Scrub the bottom and edges of the litter box with a mild-bleach solution. To make a mild bleach solution, add ½ cup of bleach to one gallon of water.
You can also clean the litter box with hot water and detergent.Make sure to clean the area you scrubbed the litter box after you finish cleaning the litter box to decrease germs.
Never clean a litter box in the kitchen or around any place you prepare food., Sometimes, your cat may end up pushing her waste around so that it gets smeared or caked on the sides of the litter box. If you see feces or urine sticking to the edge of the litter box, scrub down the litter box.Remove all the cat litter from the box and remove the waste with a mild bleach solution.
 Since your cat can spread germs, parasites, and bacteria through her waste, you want to make sure to take special care when your cat is sick. If your cat has an infection that can be spread through waste, or has something like worms, you should clean the litter box more often.If you have other cats, you may want to clean the litter box every day or every few days until the infected cat is better. This can help reduce the risk of your other cats from getting sick.
 You should place the litter box on a floor surface that is easy to clean. This may be tile or linoleum. You want to make sure you can easily remove any mess if there are accidents or waste gets on the floor.Don’t set the litter box on carpet. Cleaning waste out of carpet is difficult, and the fibers may hold bacteria. The same is true about hardwood floors.

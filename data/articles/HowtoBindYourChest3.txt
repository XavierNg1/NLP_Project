 Wrap it around so that the velcro fold falls under one of your arms.


Neoprene waist trimmers work as compression wear to improve blood circulation for people who are exercising. They are also worn to give a better and trimmer-looking waist for people who aren't.
 If your waist trimmer is too long for your chest, cut the end without the velcro with scissors to fit your bust. You don't want to double wrap your chest which could create the opposite effect you want.


If the trimmer is poking at your sides or under your arm, cut the corners of the trimmer into a smooth curve with scissors.
 The neoprene trimmer can cause chafing and extra moisture to build up on and around your bust. Sprinkle from baby powder before wearing your trimmer to help absorb the excess moisture. Put on lotion after you take off your trimmer regularly to protect your skin from chaffing and drying out.


Don't put on lotion and baby powder at the same time or while you're wearing your trimmer. You could damage your trimmer and the combination of lotion and powder could make a paste.
 It is extremely important when binding your chest to do it safely and protect your body from permanent health issues and damage. An extremely tight trimmer can result in restricted breathing, broken ribs, damage to chest tissue overtime, and cause fluid build-up in your chest.


Do not wear a trimmer for more than 8 hours. If you wear your trimmer for long periods of time, you risk bruising and restricting oxygen to you body.
Never sleep with your trimmer on.
Do not put bandages or duct tape over your trimmer. In fact, never use duct tape or bandages to flatten your chest. These tactics restrict movement and oxygen to enter to your body.

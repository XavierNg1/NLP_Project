, Dexamethasone is most commonly used, and it can be prescribed either as a tablet or as an injection.


Dexamethasone works both by diminishing inflammation and potential pain caused by the cancer, as well as by inducing death of the cancer cells themselves, so the benefits of the drug are several-fold., These include thalidomide (Thalomid), lenalidomide (REVLIMID), bortezomib (Velcade), carfilzomib (Kyprolis), ixazomib (Ninlaro), and pomalidomide (Pomalyst). These are most often considered for new diagnoses of multiple myeloma, and/or for cases that have been unsuccessful at being cured via other methods. Speak to your doctor for further information about considering these new drugs.
 They are specifically designed to target the cancer cells via immunological mechanisms (using antibodies that attach specifically to cancerous cells), with the goal of removing these cancerous cells from the body.


Immunotherapy is often used for people whose multiple myeloma has continued to progress, despite the trial of other medical therapies.
 Ultimately, the treatment of multiple myeloma is a complex issue that is best addressed by medical specialists. There are a variety of options available, and you will most likely be receiving multiple modes of treatment, either at the same time or in sequence, to treat your cancer.

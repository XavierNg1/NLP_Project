 Dip your clean brush in your water container. Press it against the bottom of the container to open up the bristles, then run it against the rim to release excess water.
 If you’re using wet watercolor from a tube, squeeze out as much red and white paint as you need. If you’re using dry watercolors, you can use your brush to paint red onto the surface of your project and mix there.
 If you are using wet watercolor paint, stroke your moist brush over your red paint. Mix it into your water container. Don’t dry the brush when done. Slide the brush across the rim of the container once to clean the brush.








Repeat the process to add more red until you get the value you want.
 Stroke your moist brush over your white paint. Mix it in the water container the same way you did with the red paint. Your paint will begin to take on a pink tint.









Continue to add more white until you achieve pink.
 Whether you’re using wet or dry watercolors, you can also make different types of pink such as by adding a dab of purple and then yellow or by diluting red with water and not using white. Experiment to find the pink that’s right for you.








When you don’t mix in white, you can get a standard pink. This depends on how much you dilute the red with water before it dries.
To get softer shades of pink, add yellow. This will eventually give you a peach color.
A little bit of violet or blue will give you a hot pink. Add more to get a shade such as magenta.

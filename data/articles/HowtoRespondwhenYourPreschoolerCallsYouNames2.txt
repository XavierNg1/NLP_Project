 Without raising your voice or overreacting, tell your child that calling names is not acceptable. Don’t try to ignore the incident or let it slide, even if you’re busy. Draw a clear boundary so your child knows the behavior is not OK.Don’t laugh or act shocked, even if your child calls you something surprising or funny. Your child wants a reaction from you. If you give it to them, they may continue calling you names in the future.
Say something like, “Toby, we do not call each other stupid in this house.”

, Look past the name-calling to see what’s really going on with your child. Consider whether they are feeling disappointed, angry, or overtired. Show your child that you’re on their side by empathizing with them.You could say, “I know you’re sad that we have to go home now. You were having fun at the playground, weren’t you?”

, Tell your child how you feel when they call you names. Help them develop their empathy by reminding them of a time when someone else hurt their feelings by calling them a name.For instance, say, “I feel sad when you say things like that to me. Do you remember when Ellie called you names last week? You felt sad then, too.”

, Give your child some new ideas for how they can cope with strong feelings. Encourage them to name what they’re feeling or to blow off steam by doing another activity.For example, you could say, “It’s okay to tell me that you’re feeling really mad at me right now. If you’re too mad to talk, you can go into your room and play with your trains until you calm down.”

, Don’t just pay attention to your child’s name-calling – notice their good behavior, too. When your child expresses their emotions appropriately, praise them and tell them what you like about their behavior.For instance, say, “I’m proud of you for telling me how you feel. That was very grown-up of you.”

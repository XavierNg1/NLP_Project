 While you wait for your oven to warm up, you can proceed to the next few steps.;
, The procedures for roasting both types of peanuts are very similar. However, there are just a few things to consider before beginning:


Shelled peanuts are much easier to use for peanut butter and baking recipes because you don't need to remove their shells later. If making peanut butter, use Spanish peanuts, which have higher oil content.If you wish, you can peel shelled peanuts' skins off with your fingers before beginning, though it's also easy to do this after roasting (see below).
In-shell peanuts should be rinsed in cold water briefly to remove excess dirt.Pat dry with a paper towel and allow to dry for about five extra minutes on a wire rack.
 The peanuts must all be sitting flat in one layer to ensure even roasting. If you have too many peanuts to make just one layer, cook them in batches.


For easier clean-up, line the sheet with baking paper or foil. This isn't required like it is with other recipes, however — the peanuts won't stick to the tray.
 Place the baking tray or sheet on the middle shelf of the oven. This will help ensure they are cooked evenly throughout. Set a timer and relax — there's no need to turn peanuts while they cook. Depending on which type of peanut you're roasting, cooking times will vary:For shelled peanuts, cook 15-20 minutes.
For in-shell peanuts, cook 20-25 minutes.
 The peanuts will cook a little bit more after you take them out of the oven. Be careful here — both the tray and the peanuts themselves will be extremely hot (especially shelled peanuts). Set the tray somewhere safe where it can cool, like on top of the stove.
 When the peanuts are cool enough to hold in your hands, they're ready to eat. Roasted peanuts taste great plain, but you can also toss them with a light sprinkling of salt at this point (you shouldn't need more than a teaspoon or two). Enjoy!

 Damp crawlspaces or subfloors may need anti-moisture polyethylene sheeting or professional treatment to prevent further mold growth. Check vents, closets, and the underside of upholstery as well, to make sure all sources of mold are located and eliminated. If possible, check beneath the carpet as well.


Most mildewy upholstery can be treated using the same methods as carpet, but test a corner first to make sure the color is unaffected.
 Air flow helps evaporate moisture, drying out damp areas where mold thrives. Leave the windows open or a fan blowing for at least two hours a day.


Open windows early in the morning if possible, to remove moisture that has built up overnight.
 If you live in a humid climate, or there is no easy way to ventilate the room, purchase a dehumidifier. Keep this running at night to remove moisture content from the air, before it settles on the carpet.
 Sweeping can be effective, but carpets can trap dust and mold spores deep in their fibers, making vacuum cleaning a preferred option. Shark vacuums may be more effective, but tend to be significantly more expensive.
 Mold grows well in the dark, and introducing more light can help reduce the spread of mold. You can try leaving on low-energy lights on for periods of time. You can even try using nightlights when you go to sleep.While average fluorescent light bulbs can prevent the spread of mold, special UV C lights can help detect and kill mold spores., After a serious mold infestation has been removed, renting a HEPA vacuum or filter is recommended to remove the last mold spores from the area. Seal vents and close windows before using, to minimize the amount of spores that travel to other areas of the house.


HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air. It is a rating used to describe various products, not a brand name.

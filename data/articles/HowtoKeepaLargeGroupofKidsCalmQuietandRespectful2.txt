 It can be helpful to have a special noise that signifies it is time to be quiet. The noise itself can be anything you might like to use. You'll need to introduce the noise as being the “quiet sound” and only use it when you need your kids to settle down. Work with your kids to let them know that the quiet sound is something fun and something to pay attention to. You could try sounding a chime to indicate it's quiet time.
Practice by having your kids get noisy and then seeing how fast they can be quiet after you make the noise.
 It can be a fun idea to create a “quiet spray”, using a simple misting water bottle. Fill the bottle up with water and tell the kids that it is a “quiet spray” and that they need to be silent whenever the spray comes out. Have fun with it, giving it a sense of being magical or special, to help engage the kids and manage noise levels., There are many apps available for your phone or tablet that can be helpful when keeping a group of young kids quiet. These apps listen to noise levels in the room and emit a tone when they get too loud. This noise can be a signal to kids that they need to quiet down until the app stops making the noise., If your group of children is getting too loud, you can try counting down with them. Tell the kids that it's time to do a quiet countdown, starting at ten and getting quieter as you countdown to one. Once the countdown is over, pick up where you left off and resume your lesson.

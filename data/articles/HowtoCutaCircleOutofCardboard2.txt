 You can use a compass, draw around a circular object or follow the instructions of the project you're making.
 Use the tip of the scissors to do this.


You may need to use a ruler or a compass to work out where the middle point of the circle is.
 Make a few tiny cuts to ease open a gap.
 Then cut another "slice" nearby, as if cutting a pie from the center outward.
 Do this until the whole circle has been cut.



First, pull open one slice or triangle. Cut that one out. This creates a gap that makes it easier to get at the next slice, and so on.
Cut out all of the slices.
 You should now have a nice, neat circle in the middle of the cardboard, ready for pursuing your art or craft project.

 A wooden post that is sunk into the surrounding soil will be relatively easy to remove, while one that is sunk into concrete will require additional equipment. Any wooden fence post that is severely deteriorated may also require additional tools to manage the extraction.;
, The trench does not have to be any deeper than about 1 foot (0.3 m). Remove the dirt directly around the post, or around the concrete plug that is holding the post in position.


Wear eye protection when digging around concrete, to protect against chipped concrete fragments.
 Watering the soil around the post will loosen it and make it easier to remove the post.
 Push it backward and forward several times to help loosen the post and plug as the hole is enlarged slightly. Try not to break the post.
 Drive four nails into each face of the post. Position the nails so they are driven into the surface of the post at roughly 1 foot (0.3 m) from the ground level. Make sure the nails are driven at least halfway into the wood, creating a firm hold.
 Secure a length of strong rope to the series of nails on the post. This can be accomplished by wrapping the rope around and under each exposed nail head in succession, finally tying the rope tightly around the body of the fence post.
 This can be accomplished by placing one to two layers of concrete blocks on one side of the trench, and then laying a thick plank or board across the blocks.
 Drive a couple of nails into the board to create a means of securing the rope into position.
 The effect will be somewhat like a seesaw, in that as your end moves toward the ground, the tension on the rope increases and pulls the post upward, slowly extracting the buried portion of the post.
 Once the post is pulled upward, detach the rope and move the post away from the open hole.

 Human retinas contain two kinds of receptor cells, rods, and cones. Rods enable us to distinguish light from darkness and to see at lower levels of light, while cones function in brighter light and enable us to see colors. Fish eyes also contain both rods and cones, allowing them to see in color, with the proportion of rods to cones dependent on whether the fish inhabits relatively shallow or deep water.;
, Light is divided into various wavelengths. Longer wavelengths of light, such as red and orange, are absorbed quickly in water and therefore penetrate to a shallow depth. At a depth of 10 feet (3 m), red lights is almost completely absorbed, and at 30 feet (9.1 m), orange and yellow light is mostly absorbed. Shorter wavelengths of light, such as green and blue penetrate to a much greater depth, and scatter more, explaining why bodies of water appear blue or greenish from above.


How colors appear underwater is affected by how far away the object appears. Red objects turn gray and then black, while blue objects turn white before turning gray and finally black.

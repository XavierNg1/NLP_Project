 Cleaners like peroxide and ammonia are too harsh to use on porous gemstones like pearls. Mix a gentler cleaning solution by adding three drops of mild dish soap to one cup (8 ounces) of clear, warm water. Then swirl it around to mix it., Dip just the corner of a clean cloth into the cleaning mixture. Youâ€™ll need the rest of the cloth to dry the jewelry later.
 Gently wipe the gemstones in your earrings with the corner of the cloth dipped into the soap and water mixture. Make sure that you work the cloth into any crevices in the earrings, particularly around any metal prongs that might be holding gems in place.
 Dip a jewelry brush into the soap and water mixture and scrub the metal on your stud earrings. Be careful not to scrub the gems, since porous gems scratch easily.
 Dip another corner of the cloth into clear, clean water, and wipe the soap off of your earrings. Make sure you get soap out of any of the crevices in the earrings.

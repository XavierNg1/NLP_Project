 Depending on your job, a few minutes may not be that big of a deal. However, if it is going to be longer, you probably need to call or apologize when you get there., For instance, if you have a big meeting, it may be more important for you to be on time. Also, some jobs are more attentive to punctuality than other ones., If you're going to be more than 5 minutes late, it's probably best to call ahead. Let your boss know that you'll be delayed, and give her an estimate for about how long it will take.

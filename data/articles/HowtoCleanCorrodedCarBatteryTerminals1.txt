 This will reduce the likelihood of accidentally grounding the cables.;
, There are two types.


If the terminals are on the side, you will need a 5/16-inch (8 mm) wrench to loosen both cable nuts.
If the terminals are on top of the battery, you will need either a 3/8-inch (10 mm) or 1/2-inch (13 mm) wrench.
 Unfasten the cable from the post.


Do the same for the positive (+) cable. If you have trouble removing either cable, attempt to twist them while pulling up at the same time.
 If any are found, you need to replace the battery.
 If a large rip is found, you may have to replace these parts.
 Dip an old toothbrush into the mixture and scrub the top of the battery to remove corrosion buildup.


You can even dip the ends of the battery cables in hot water to dissolve any corrosion on the cable ends themselves.
 Remember to soak your brush in the baking soda solution as much as needed.
 Make sure all the baking soda and corrosion is washed away. Dry the battery and clamps with a clean cloth.
 Use petroleum jelly or a commercial battery terminal protection spray.
 Tighten the nut with your wrench.


Repeat with the negative (-) clamp. Test if terminals are tight enough by twisting each one by hand.

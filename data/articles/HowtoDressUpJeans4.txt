 Stiletto heels work especially well, but kitten heels can also dress up your jeans. Go for black or another neutral to give your style class.
 Pick a pair with embellishments, like bows or gems, to add a bit more flair.
 If you have dark jeans and a dressy top in a neutral color, consider a bright red pump or crocodile skin flat to add a chic twist to your outfit.
 Leather boots have a naturally sophisticated look. Ankle-length boots work well with nearly any cut, from the classic boot-cut to the more modern skinny leg.
 Knee-high boots can also look trendy, and if paired with a dark jean and a nice blouse, they can make an outfit look city chic. Pair these boots with a snug skinny jean, however, and zip the boot up over your jean. Wearing these boots beneath your jeans defeats the purpose of having a boot with such a tall height.
 Instead of getting too casual with your shoes on casual Fridays, keep your footwear professional. Stick with high quality leather loafers to add structure and professionalism to your jeans.
 These look like barrettes for your shoes, and they provide a quick, easy way of dressing up an otherwise simple pair of flats.

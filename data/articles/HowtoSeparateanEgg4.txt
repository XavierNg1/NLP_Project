 Put the funnel into the mouth of a bottle, or have a friend hold the funnel over a bowl. Crack the egg into the funnel. The whites should pass through the small opening while the egg yolk remains in the funnel.


If the whites get stuck over the yolk, tilt the funnel so they can pass through.
This might not work well for fresh eggs, which have thick ropy sections of white.
 Unscrew the bulb from the baster handle, and you have a suction device the right size for grabbing yolks. Crack the egg onto a plate, then squeeze and let go to pull the yolk up into the baster., Shake the spoon gently side to side, then up and down, and the whites should dribble through the slots.
 You can buy a specialized tool for separating eggs from online stores, or from some kitchen supply stores. These come in two main types:


A small plastic cup surrounded by slots. Crack the egg into the cup, and rotate the separator so the egg whites fall through the slots.
A small suction device. Crack the egg onto a plate, squeeze the suction device, put it over the yolk, and release to suck up the yolk.

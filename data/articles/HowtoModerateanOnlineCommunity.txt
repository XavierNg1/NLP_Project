 If you aren't, try to find out if any of the sites you are a member on are hiring. If they are, check out the jobs. If not, search around, you may have to wait a while but a position is almost certain to open eventually. On some forums, a respectful member will be upgraded if they wish.;
, If you want to practice, try to get the owner of your site to make a sandbox area for you to practice in. If they don't want to, set up your own copy of the software in use on the site, or try out one of the live demos usually available on the publishers website. If the software your site is using is custom, you're probably out of luck, but try asking the other staff members for some help, if necessary.
 It can't hurt.
 Members like to know who the staff members are, and they like it even better if you're nice and do more than moderate.
 If you go to school, log in if you get the chance. If you have a job, check out the site on your break or lunch time.
 Yes, it seems cheesy, but it's true. Try to have fun on the job. As was stated previously, make sure to maintain a presence on the site. For example, if you work on a forum, post often, and post well. If you help out on a social network, keep your profile up to date (if you're comfortable doing so, of course). Moderators that are involved know more about the communities that they work in, which can help out a lot.

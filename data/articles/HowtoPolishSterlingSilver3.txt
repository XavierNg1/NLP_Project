 For this method of polishing silver, you will be pouring boiling water over a bowl full of other tarnish-fighting ingredients. Depending on the amount and sizes of the silver you are polishing, you will need to boil more water; just enough to completely cover your items.
 Get a heat safe bowl and cut a piece of aluminum foil to fit the inside. Lay the aluminum foil shiny side up along the interior of the bowl. If you need to use multiple sheets in order to fill the whole thing, feel free to do so.
 Measure out 1 tablespoon of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of salt, and Â½ cup of white vinegar. Add these one at a time into the bowl, creating a fizzy mixture on top of the aluminum foil. If you are polishing several larger items at once, you may need to double these measurements.
 Use a spoon to mix together all the ingredients in the bowl so that they completely dissolve. Leaving chunks of baking soda or salt in the mix could scratch or dull your silver.
 When your water has reached a boil, slowly pour it into the mixture. Use your spoon to mix the solution a bit more to make sure that it is thoroughly combined.
 Slowly drop in each piece of silver, using tongs if necessary to avoid getting burned. Allow the silver to sit for a few minutes in the solution, flipping so that both sides are exposed halfway through.
 Use tongs to pick each piece of silver out of the water, and place it onto your polishing cloth. Let it sit for a moment to cool slightly, and then polish the entire area of the silver with the cloth. Focus on previously tarnished areas to make sure that they are completely clean.

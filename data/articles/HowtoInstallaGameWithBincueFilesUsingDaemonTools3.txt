 There are a couple of different ways to do this. You can drag the .cue file onto the icon for the virtual drive in the bottom window of Daemon Tools if you have the program open. The image will mount automatically and the computer will act as if the CD was just inserted.
 Right-click on the Daemon Tools icon. Select Virtual Devices, then the drive that was created. If there is nothing currently mounted, it will say No Media. Click on Mount Imageâ€¦ Browse for your .cue file and open it. The image will be mounted and the computer will act as if the CD was just inserted.

This is a great stretch for loosening the inner thigh, and it will do both sides at once, which is a huge benefit. , Take a wide step out with your right foot, bending your right knee to lower yourself down slightly. Hinge forward slightly from the hips, keeping your back straight, and push your bottom back. This will stretch the left inner thigh. Hold this position for a few seconds, before resuming to the starting position. Do it again, this time extending your left leg., Lie down facing a wall with your legs resting straight up against the wall. Spread your legs apart to a comfortable position.

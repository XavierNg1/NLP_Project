 These are the little dust animals that are hiding in the oddest places. As you are cleaning up, entertain a child with a washrag that is only theirs, making a big deal out if it being theirs. If a child has something that no one else has, that's a big deal to them. If need be, write their names on it.;
, Tell a story as your child is dusting along with you. Explain why dust bunnies are hiding under the couch, under the kitchen table, and occupying all these little places that a 2-3 year old child can get to. Also,

, Pick a room for yourself to clean, and a small area, cupboard, closet, etc., for your child to clean. Explain exactly what needs to be cleaned, so they know what needs to be done in order to win. Get in your 'cleaning areas.' Shout "Ready? Set? Go!" The little one will start cleaning as fast as they can. This will make the chores go by faster for your child and for you.
 Little ones are the most helpful when they know they are helping.

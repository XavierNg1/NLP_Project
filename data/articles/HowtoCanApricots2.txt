 Use honey or sugar to create a light to medium syrup to preserve the apricots inside the can. The syrup you need to prepare for a raw pack is the same as the syrup you need to prepare for a hot pack.


For every 1 qt (1 L) of water, add 2 cups (500 ml) sugar for a light syrup or 3 cups (750 ml) for a medium syrup.
If using honey, for every 1 qt (1 L) of water, add 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) honey for a light syrup or 2 cups (500 ml) for a medium syrup.
Boil the sweetener and water together in a saucepan until the sugar or honey dissolves. After it thickens into syrup, remove it from the heat.
Alternatively, you could also use apple juice or white grape juice instead of a syrup.
 Use a kitchen knife to cut each apricot in half. Remove the pits, and if desired, cut the apricots into serving-size slices.


You may want to consider quickly dipping each half or slice in diluted lemon juice to prevent the fruit from discoloring or darkening.
You will need 16 lb (7.2 kg) of fruit to create 7 qt (7 L) of canned fruit. For 9 pints (4.25 L), you will need about 10 lb (4.5 kg).
Note that, for the raw pack method, you will not need to remove the skins. Just make sure that each piece of fruit has been washed well under running water first.
 Fill the jars with the apricot halves or slices, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each jar.


Place the fruit inside the jars cut-side-down. Doing so makes it easier to fit more fruit into each jar.
Make sure the jars are clean and sanitized before use. The lids should also be clean and sterilized.
 Pour the warm syrup over the apricot slices in the jars. Gently shake the jar from side to side to ensure that syrup makes it all the way down to the bottom, and maintain the 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of headspace at the top of the jar while filling them with syrup.


As the apricots undergo the canning process, the contents of the jar will expand. If you do not leave enough headspace at the top of the jar, the lid may not seal properly or the glass may even break.
Screw on the lids once the syrup is in place. Make sure they are on as tight as possible so the cans seal correctly during the canning process.
 Use canning tongs to carefully lower each jar into your canner. Make sure the jars do not clink together as you arrange them, since doing so can cause the glass to break. You can use a boiling-water canner, dial-gauge pressure canner, or weighted-gauge pressure canner, but the amount of processing time will vary depending on which method you use.


Note the processing times for raw-packed canned apricots will vary from those for hot-packed apricots when using boiling-water canners, but they will not vary if using pressure canners.
For boiling-water canners:

Pints should be processed for 25 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), 30 minutes between 1001 and 3000 feet (305 to 915 m), 35 minutes at altitudes between 3001 and 6000 feet (915 to 1830 m), and 40 minutes above 6000 feet (1830 m).
Quarts should be processed for 30 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), 35 minutes between 1001 and 3000 feet (305 to 915 m), 40 minutes at altitudes between 3001 and 6000 feet (915 to 1830 m), and 45 minutes above 6000 feet (1830 m).


When using a dial-gauged pressure canner, process both pints and quarts for 10 minutes. Use a pressure of 6 PSI for altitudes between 0 and 2000 feet (0 and 610 m), 7 PSI between 2001 and 4000 feet (610 and 1220 m), 8 PSI between 4001 and 6000 feet (1220 and 1830 m), and 9 PSI between 6001 and 8000 feet (1830 and 2440 m).
When using a weighted-gauge pressure canner, process both pints and quarts for 10 minutes. Use a pressure of 5 PSI between 0 and 1000 feet (0 and 305 m) and 10 PSI for anything above 1001 feet (305 m).

 Lay two sheets of parchment paper across the pan going in either direction so that the bottom and all four sides of the pan are covered. Leave about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of the paper hanging over the edge of the pan so that you can use it to pull the finished fudge out.


You can also use wax paper or tinfoil.
 Shake the can of coconut milk first before opening it and measuring out the milk. Sometimes, the coconut milk and cream separate, so this will mix them back up again. Stir the milk often while it is simmering so that it doesn't scorch.
 While the coconut oil is not absolutely necessary, it will help the chocolate melt better and give you a smoother, richer fudge in the end.There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.
 The vanilla will lend your fudge a more complex flavor while the salt will help cut the sweetness. It will also help bring out the flavor of the chocolate.
 If the fudge looks really thin and you suspect that it won't set up, you can add up to 1 cup (175 grams) of melted chocolate chips or some powdered sugar to help firm it up again., If you are in a rush, you can put it into the freezer for about 30 minutes or until it turns firm. The fudge must be firm before you remove it from the pan and cut it, or it will make an oozy, gloopy mess.
 Use the overhanging parchment paper to lift the fudge out of the pan. Use a sharp knife to cut it into smaller squares.
 If you have any leftovers, cover them up and store them in the fridge immediately. They should last about1 week.

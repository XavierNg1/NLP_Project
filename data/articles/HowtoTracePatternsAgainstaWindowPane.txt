 In the case of a small pattern, the tacking or pinning may be dispensed with and instead, the two sheets held firmly pressed against the window pane with the left hand, whilst the right hand does the tracing. However, even then it is safer to pin, sticky tack or gum the four corners of the two sheets together. This is especially useful in case of interruption such as the telephone ringing, as it is difficult to fit them together again exactly.
 The tracing may be done with a pencil, or, with a gel ink pen or water-colour paint., The process of tracing is easy enough, so long as the hand does not get tired. Depending on how complex and large the pattern, you will become tired, hence the reason why it is best to tack the pattern to the window to take rest periods., Use as required.

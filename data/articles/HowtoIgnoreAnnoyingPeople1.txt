 Anytime you encounter rude or annoying behavior, you have the option of simply walking away from the person. While it's not always possible to get away from someone who's annoying you, it does work in many situations., If you find you often run into the same annoying person in public, try to avoid that person by going a different way. You may also be able to avoid him or her by going through the area slightly earlier or slightly later., When you can't just walk away, the best thing you can do is stay quiet. Staying quiet does not make you weak, and does not make them the "winner." Some people are annoying because they're after a reaction. Don't give them that satisfaction.In addition, not responding helps you regulate your own emotions, so you won't snap on the person or someone else you meet later., When a person is speaking, don't give any acknowledgment of having heard him or her. Meaning, don't even incline your head to the person or jump if he or she starts talking more loudly., Even nonverbal responses, such as rolling your eyes or making faces, can egg the person on. Try not to say anything to the person, but also try not to engage the person nonverbally, too. Any kind of gesture that lets them know they're getting to you will only make things worse.

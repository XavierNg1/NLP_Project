 Even young babies can begin to understand cause and effect: they cry, for example, and someone comes to feed, change, or comfort them. Maximize this natural way of learning by responding to your baby and interacting in various ways. Make faces to get your baby to laugh; pick your baby up if he or she reaches out for you.;
, Babies and toddlers learn through play, so offer a variety of toys suited to your child’s developmental level. Your baby can learn that shaking a rattle creates a sound; your toddler can learn that pressing certain buttons may make a toy light up or make a noise.
 As your child grows and understands more and more, you can enhance their understanding verbally. So, for example, you can say, “oh, you didn’t eat your lunch, and that’s why you’re hungry again already” or “oh, you were too rough with that balloon, so it popped.”

, Toddlers can grasp cause and effect best with a practical demonstration. Puncture a balloon with a pin, and see what happens. Or go to the kitchen sink with your toddler, and pour water into a cup until it overflows. Ask your toddler what happened, and why. Repeat with other household objects and procedures.

 Believe it or not, petroleum jelly (i.e., Vaseline) can be a powerful stain-removal tool when it comes to lipstick. Using petroleum jelly to remove lipstick from fabric is easy â€” start by using a finger to gently blot the surface of the stain with a small amount of the jelly.


Don't work jelly into more of the fabric than is necessary to cover the stain, as, in sufficient quantities, petroleum jelly can be hard to remove from fabric itself. If you are eventually left with a separate stain from the jelly, use rubbing alcohol to treat it., Next, with the jelly still on it, toss your garment into the washing machine with a load of laundry. Set the washer to the normal settings for your garment (check the care label if you have any concerns) and let the wash run as normal.
 When you take your garment out of the wash, the stain should have improved noticeably. If some lipstick still remains, consider repeating this method or using one of the other cleaning suggestions in this article to finish it off.

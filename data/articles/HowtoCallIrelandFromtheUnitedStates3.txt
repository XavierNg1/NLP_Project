 Apple has the built-in FaceTime application which allows for free international phone calls between their devices. FaceTime is pre-installed on all iOS7 devices as well as some earlier iOS versions, so there is no need to download an app.iPhone 4 was the first to have FaceTime and all iPhones made after that also have the app. Other Apple devices with FaceTime are iPad 2 and later, all iPad minis, and iPod Touch 5th generation.If you used or purchased your device in United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, it may not have the FaceTime App pre-installed. You can purchase FaceTime from the App Store on your device.
You may need to update your FaceTime app to enable the voice call feature.
 When you are using an iPhone, open the FaceTime app by selecting Settings > FaceTime > Use your Apple ID. Enter your Apple ID to sign in to FaceTime., If you are using an iPhone, it will already have registered your phone number and the email associated with your Apple ID should appear when you log in. To check the email address listed or add others, choose Settings > FaceTime > Add Another Email.You can add several email addresses to your account, allowing you to contact people using various email addresses.
You can call someone in Ireland using their email address associated with FaceTime. You do not need to have their phone number.
 FaceTime calls are made using the internet instead of cellular service. This is why you are not charged like you would be for a regular phone call. On the other hand, that means that the call requires data. If you have limited data, this could eat through your plan rather quickly. When you are connected to wifi, you can use that service and save your data.Connect to wifi by selecting Settings > wifi > On.
Once you have enabled wifi, select the wifi service you would like to join and enter any necessary passwords to gain access.
When your phone is connected to wifi, the wifi radar beacon symbol will replace the data carrier on your display.
 You can do this in a few ways. If you you have entered this person into your contact list, you can select their name. The screen will show their contact information you have entered. Under the phone number(s), you will find the FaceTime section. Two symbols are listed. One is the video camera for video calls. Select the phone symbol for voice calls.If the person you are calling is not in your contact list, open the FaceTime app and enter their email or phone number in the box at the top of the screen.
You can also activate Siri and give the voice command “FaceTime audio…” and the name of the person you are calling from your contact list., If another call comes in while you are on your current call, you will have the option to decline the incoming call or end the current call and answer the new call. These two options will appear to replace the red “end” button.iOS 8 models and later also have a call waiting feature, which allows you to place your current call on hold while answering the other call.

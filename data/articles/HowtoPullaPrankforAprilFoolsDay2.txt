 You will need an ice-cream cone, white colored toothpaste, sprinkles, orange peels, shaving mousse, and lettuce.


Pick up the ice cream cone and place the orange peels and lettuce on the tip of the cone. Make sure they don't go way down on the bottom, and they should not stick out.
Put on the shaving mousse. Add enough until it looks like ice cream.
Top it off with a little toothpaste (whipped cream; wink wink).
Take a little piece of lettuce and ball it up. Carefully place on. Add a little more shaving mousse and toothpaste.
Now to be nice, put on sprinkles.
Serve. To whomever your pranking, say "I made you some ice cream!" When they taste it and spit it out, say "APRIL FOOLS!"

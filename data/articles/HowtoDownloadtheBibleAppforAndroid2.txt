 If you’re not yet signed in, click the “Sign in” button and sign in using your Gmail username (or email address) and password.
 Do so by typing “Bible” in Google Play Store’s search bar and clicking the magnifying glass icon. Select the first app in the list under the “App” heading, and you’ll be redirected to the Bible’s app webpage.
 Click on the green-colored “Install” button found on the right side of the page.


Clicking on “Install” will open a pop-up with the “Choose a Device” menu that lists all your Android devices registered to the account you used to log in. If you have several Android devices listed, you can select the one you want the app installed on.
Once you’ve selected the device, that Android unit will automatically start downloading the app and install it for you.

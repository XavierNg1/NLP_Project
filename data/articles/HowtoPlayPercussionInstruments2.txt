 Unlike the snare drum, the concert bass drum requires a range of mallet densities for different passages and styles of music. At the least, keep 1 soft bass drum mallet and 1 medium-hard mallet., Ideally, the bass drum should be slanted so that the head is at about a 45 degree angle to the ground. Hold the mallet with your dominant hand and place your other palm gently onto the head of the drum. Strike the head just off-center with the mallet and vary the pressure with your other hand to muffle the drum as needed., When playing a concert bass drum it is important that the sound properly resonates and fulfills its roll in a piece of music properly. In order to convey the low-pitched sound of the drum to the audience try striking the drum in a "scooping" motion as if you are pulling the sound from the drum., Because the bass drum's head is loosely tensioned and does not provide much rebound, the tendency is to strike it and leave the mallet against or near the head. Instead, make a conscious effort to follow through on each stroke just as you would on a snare drum or tom, returning the mallet to its playing position as quickly as possible.

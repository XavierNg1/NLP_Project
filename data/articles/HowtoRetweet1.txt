 Automatic retweeting basically involves clicking the retweet button Twitter provides. This will immediately share the tweet with your followers, without giving you the option to add a comment. It is a good option if you want to retweet something in a hurry, or if you have nothing to add.;
, You should see a "Retweet" link in the lower right hand corner, between the "Reply" and "Favorite" options. Click on the "Retweet" option.
 After clicking on the retweet option, a pop-up will appear displaying the highlighted tweet, asking you to confirm the retweet. Click the "Retweet" button on the bottom right hand corner.
 The tweet will automatically show up on your followers' feeds and on your own account as a retweet. The original tweeter's name will appear at the top of the tweet, while yours will appear at the bottom, beside the retweet symbol.

 Water is best, but fluids with added sodium and potassium (electrolytes) also may be beneficial. Avoid beverages that are high in sugar or contain alcohol -- or caffeine (such as coffee, tea and colas) -- which can aggravate your digestive symptoms., These include applesauce, banana, banana powder, yogurt, plain boiled-mashed potatoes and rice. Avoid high-fiber foods when having diarrhea or irritated colon, such as beans, nuts and vegetables. If you feel your symptoms are improving, slowly add high-fiber foods back to your diet.

Eat several smaller meals, rather than a few large meals. Space the smaller meals throughout the day.
Avoid irritating foods. Stay away from spicy, fatty or fried foods, and any other foods that make your symptoms worse.

 Let the oil warm up over medium heat as you prepare the fish.

Pan-frying is a popular way to cook lake trout. Other common cooking methods include smoking and grilling. Lake trout can be baked, as well, but that method is not quite as typical for lake trout.
 Mix these five ingredients in a shallow bowl or dish until thoroughly combined.

For a smokier taste, you could used bacon-flavored crackers instead of standard saltine crackers.
For a less potent garlic taste, reduce the amount of garlic salt to 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml).
 Beat the eggs and milk in another shallow bowl with a whisk.

In order to serve as an effective egg wash, the eggs and milk must be combined well.
The sides of the dish must be high enough to prevent the egg wash from dripping out. The bowl should have a wide mouth, though, so that it is easy enough for you to dunk the fish in it.


Hold the fillet over the bowl of egg wash for 30 seconds or so. Let the excess egg drip off.
If the fillets feel slimy or sticky, rinse them in cold water and pat dry with clean paper towels before dunking them in the egg wash.
 After coating all sides of the lake trout in egg, roll the fish in the crumb mixture to coat all sides.

Each fillet must be rolled in the crumb mixture gently. Otherwise, it could break apart.
Lightly shake each fillet over the bowl of crumbs once you coat it. The excess crumbs should fall off.
 Place the trout fillets in the hot oil and turn the heat up to medium-high. Fry until crispy and opaque on all sides.

Turn the fish once during the cooking process using a spatula. The fish must be flipped carefully in order to prevent it from flaking apart.
Once done, the fish should flake apart easily with a fork. The flesh should also be easy to remove from the bones, if you started with fillets that still have bones in them.
 Remove the trout from the frying pan and transfer to a serving plate.

If desired, serve with lemon slices, chives, and parsley.

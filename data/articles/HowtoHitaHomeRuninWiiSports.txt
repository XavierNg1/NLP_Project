 Use both hands if you wish, although you can swing faster with one hand. Holding it high will allow you a larger swing and so the more power you will be able to get into it. However holding the Wii remote low and hitting up will allow you to hit the ball higher, and so increase your chance of a home run. The only downside to this is that its harder to see the pitcher.;
, You don't want to swing too early nor too late. It may take longer to swing because the bat is probably farther behind you than you are used to, so start a little bit early.
, Finish the swing.

 Get your friends together and gather onto the local basketball, tennis, or outdoor hockey court (it's important that all courts include walls).
 In a tennis court or parking lot create goals by placing two objects a reasonable distance apart (obviously). But on a basketball court use the poles as goals, this will help increase accuracy, concentration, and overall skill level. Using this method of scoring on a basketball court is a unique form of calle in itself; it's called "pole." In a hockey court, goals are already provided.

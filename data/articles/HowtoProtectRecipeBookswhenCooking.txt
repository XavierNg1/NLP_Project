 If you're using a laptop, iPad, e-Reader, or iPhone, etc., in the kitchen to follow a recipe, be sure to do the following:


Keep the electronics well away from the food preparation area and the sink. Water and ingredients landing on the keyboard or screen can damage the electronics permanently.
Keep the electronics within quick walking distance from where you're working but away from steam, heat, and the ingredients. If you have a kitchen table or a high counter, these might make a good, safe space.
Avoid putting greasy, floury, or sticky fingers on the electronics. If you need to scroll or turn a page, wash and thoroughly dry your hands first, or call someone else to come and do it for you.

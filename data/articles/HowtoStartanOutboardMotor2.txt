 Electric start engines should be tilted down so that the propeller is in the water. This will allow the fuel to readily flow into the engine during starting. Keeping the engine tilted down also keeps the propeller safely in the water while starting.On rare occasions, boats are equipped with fully electric outboard motors. These motors still have electric starters, and the starting procedure is the same as the procedure for a fuel driven motor with an electric start.
 Electric engines require the key to be in the ignition before important features, such as the gearshift, will operate. Insert the key into the ignition slot, and if necessary insert the kill switch, too. This should enable you to shift the engine to neutral, An electric motor may have a manual gearshift that you can move to neutral. Alternatively, you may have to move the throttle to the neutral position. This will allow you to start the engine., You start most engines by turning the key to the “On” position. Some engines will have a start button that you must push. Once the engine starts, release the key or button.

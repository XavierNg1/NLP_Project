 This is the only major factor in the derivative.

Note: Taking the negative derivative and dividing it by the bottom denominator squared might seem like a load of mumbo jumbo but it is dx/dy 1/f = -f'/f^2 where f' is the derivative of f. Examples:

If a coefficient is there, multiply by the coefficient. For example, f (x) = 1/f , f'(x) = -f' / f^2.
As a more complicated example, let's set f(x) = 3x^2. Then the reciprocal is 1/(3x^2).
The negative derivative of the denominator is -2x because first we pull out the coefficient, 1/3; -2x becomes the new numerator.
The denominator is squared, leaving us so far with dx/dy f(x) = 1/3 (-2x)/(x^2).


This can be simplified to 1/3 (-2/x^3), or -2/(3x^3).

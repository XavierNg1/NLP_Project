 If you hang up on a telemarketer right away, you’ll probably be placed on the “no answer” list, and will be called again eventually. You don’t want to engage a telemarketer in conversation either, especially if you have absolutely no interest in their product or service.


The easiest way to handle a telemarketer is to say, “Please put me on your do not call list.”
If the telemarketer keeps interrupting you or a robot calls you, you might just have to hang up. If the same number persistently calls, report it to the FCC by calling 1-888-CALL-FCC or going to https://www.fcc.gov/.
 If you live in the United States, you can add yourself to the do not call registry. It'll then become illegal for telemarketers to contact you: https://www.donotcall.gov/. If you do get contacted by a telemarketer after putting yourself on the list, you can report the number that called you to the FTC or FCC.
 If they tell you a mutual acquaintance or other contact, consider taking the call. If they don’t or can’t tell you, or if they got your contact information from some data pool or list, ask to be removed from their call list and hang up., Be clear about conveying your annoyance with phone calls, especially if you might want to do business with or purchase something from that company but don’t want annoying callers. Make sure you provide them with an email address specifically for spam or sales deals.

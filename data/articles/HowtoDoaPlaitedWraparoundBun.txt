 This works best with fresh hair.
 Have one section down the middle, one to the left side and one to the right side. Tie these three sections up with a hair tie. (There should be no loose hair untied.) Make the middle section the largest.

Move the two side sections to the front of your shoulders so they don’t get in the way whilst you’re doing the bun as you don’t need them yet.
 You may need to put it in a ponytail first, to help you to form a bun. Don’t have the bun sitting right on top of the head as it will affect the length of the plaits. Make sure the bun is positioned horizontal to the top of the ears.

You may need to use bobby pins to hold the bun in place and to keep hair from coming out of place.
 Untie the hair and start on your first plait., These are now middle, left and right., Carefully holding all three strands, cross the right section over the top of the middle section. Now it should look like the right section is the middle section and the middle section is the right section., Next, cross the left section over the new middle section. They should now be switched, as they were with the previous section., Cross the right and left sections over the center, repeating until you run out or low on hair., Using a hair band, ribbon, clip or other styling choice, tie the hair off at the end, where the hairs become too short to fit in the plait., Once you’ve complete the first side you need to repeat the steps on other side to complete this plait., You have now a wraparound plaited bun.

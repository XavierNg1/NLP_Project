 Follow the pathway Applications -> Accessories -> Take Screenshot.


Note that the gnome-screenshot utility is only available through the GNOME Desktop Environment. You may not be able to access it from other environments.
 In the Take Screenshot dialog box that opens, choose whether you want to "Grab the whole desktop," "Grab the current window," or "Select area to grab." Also indicate if you want to grab the image after a delay.


Selecting "Grab the whole desktop" will automatically create and save a screenshot of the entire screen.
Selecting "Grab the current window" will automatically create and save a screenshot of the active window.
Selecting "Select area to grab" will turn your cursor into a crosshair. Click and drag this crosshair to create a rectangle around the area you want to select.
You can also set the number of seconds the grab function should wait before taking the screenshot.
 You can indicate whether you want to include a pointer or include a window border by checking the corresponding tickboxes.


Selecting "Include pointer" will cause your cursor to appear in the screenshot. Deselecting it will remove the cursor from your image.
Selecting "Include the window border" applies only if you choose to "Grab the current window." The border around your window will be included in the image if you select this box, but it will be erased if you deselect this box.
 Click on this button to take and save your screenshot using the settings you specified.


This completes the process.

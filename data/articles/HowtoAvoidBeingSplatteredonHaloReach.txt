 Make a mental note if there are drivable vehicles on it, and if the players in your lobby are reckless drivers.;
, If there are currently no vehicles, or you can confirm that they are otherwise destroyed or occupied, advance with confidence.
 If you see a vehicle coming, locate cover, quickly. Watch them if they are closing in on you.
 It's kind of hard to splatter a player who keeps dancing around a giant rock.
 If it is coming straight for you, do your best to lurch to the side.
 Depending on the vehicle, you can jump over it, walk past it, board it, or even outrun it.
 Use a Plasma Pistol to temporarily power it down. Proceed to either board or destroy it.

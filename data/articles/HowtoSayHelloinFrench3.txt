 There is no special greeting for the morning or afternoon.


Since bonjour literally means “good day,” you are essentially saying “good morning” or “good afternoon” when you use the term since morning and afternoon are both considered part of the daytime.
 The literal translation of this word is “good evening,” and it should be used to say “hello” in the evening or at night.The term can be used in formal and casual settings, but it is more likely to be heard in formal settings.

Bon means “good” and soir means “evening.”
Pronounce the term as bon-swar.

One way to greet a crowd of people in the evening is to state, "Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs," meaning, "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

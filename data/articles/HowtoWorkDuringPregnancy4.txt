 Resting when you’re at home is extremely important when you’re working and pregnant. You need to take care of yourself. When you get home from work, don’t spend the rest of your night running errands and completing tasks. You need to rest so you can be fresh for work and healthy for your baby.For example, you can do your grocery shopping online, hire someone to clean your house or do yard work, or ask family members to help you with tasks.
 Trying to get a good night’s rest can really help you feel better during the day. Try to get at least eight hours of sleep per night. This may seem impossible, but doing things like cutting out caffeine, not working out right before bed, and not drinking lots of fluids right before bed can help. You also should try to maintain a sleeping routine, where you go to bed and wake up at the same time.Try relaxing stress relievers to improve your sleep. Yoga, tai chi, meditation, and deep breathing can help make you feel better at night and during your work day.
 Though you may be tired, keeping up with your exercise while pregnant and working can help keep your energy levels up. Talk to your doctor to make sure what physical activity is safe for you.You can try walking before or after work or taking prenatal fitness classes.

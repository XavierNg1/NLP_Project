 The way you plan to style your hair daily is extremely important information for your barber. Ultimately, they’ll need to know what you want to do so they can make it possible. Let them know if you plan to:


Slick your hair back
Part it down the middle
Style it with hair gel in sort of a messy look., If you want something more than a simple cut, you should let the barber know the name of the cut. This might require you doing a little homework about the hair style you want or talking to other stylists or barbers., By bringing a picture of either you or someone else with the haircut you want, you’ll give your barber a clear idea of what you want them to do with your hair. Without a picture, they’ll have an incomplete account of what you want.


Flip through magazines like People, GQ, Men’s Health, or similar titles to find a picture of someone with the haircut you want.
 If you’re not exactly sure of what you want, you should probably ask your barber for their opinion. Ultimately, as a professional who cuts people’s hair all day, they’ll have a really good idea of what will look good on you and what won’t. All you need to do is ask., After the barber cuts your hair, you may need to ask them to make a few adjustments. This is normal, and you shouldn’t be ashamed to ask. Simply state, in a polite way, that you’d like them to fix something.


If your hair is too long, ask them to shorten it a little bit. Say, “It seems a little long, can we shorten it a touch?”
If it didn’t turn out the way you thought it would, say something like “I don’t think it looks exactly the way I imagined. Is there something we can do to tweak it a little?”

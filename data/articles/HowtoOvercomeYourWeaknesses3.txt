 Once your weaknesses are identified, you need a plan to beat them. Set goals for yourself with time limits. Under each goal, create actionable steps that allow you to stay on track and succeed.For example, if your public speaking skills are weak, make it a goal that you can give a confident presentation. You can plan out actionable steps like writing a speech, delivering the speech to an empty room, then to one person, then to several people. Eventually, you’ll be confident enough to deliver the speech to a public audience.
Tell other people about your goals to make yourself accountable for them. You may even ask a trusted friend or mentor to be an accountability partner. They should check in every now and then to see how far you have progressed.
 While you are working to overcome a weakness, work on things you are good at, too. This will keep your confidence up and help you get back to work overcoming the weaknesses. It also keeps you looking competent and skilled while you build your skillset even more.For example, if you are really good at writing speeches, you could help others write their speeches until you feel comfortable delivering your own.
 Your weaknesses are called weaknesses for a reason. It takes hard work and dedication to overcome them. Even if you fall short of a goal, acknowledge any progress that you did make. This will keep you in a positive frame of mind and help you pick up and continue overcoming the weakness.Even if you haven’t mastered the art of speaking to large crowds, give yourself credit when you speak up in a meeting or give a presentation to your colleagues.
Celebrate all of your successes. You can do this by taking photographs to commemorate them, making social media posts, or going out to dinner with friends.

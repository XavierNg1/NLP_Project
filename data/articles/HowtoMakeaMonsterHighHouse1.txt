 If you don't have one, look in thrift stores or ask your parents to check out a site like Freecycle, where they can put a "wanted" post on.


Or, simply use a suitably sized grocery box. Glue in cardboard floors to make different levels. Or, use shoe boxes stacked up next to each other to create dividers inside a larger cardboard box. Glue it all in place so that nothing can wobble and fall out.;
, You might even like to repaint the house in colors you like or that you think suits the dolls.


Ask your parents for help in choosing the right paints for the material that your house is made from. And always paint somewhere that has plenty of air flow and where the work surface is well covered.
 You can either buy suitable furniture or make your own (see below for a bed example). Use cardboard boxes, containers, washed bottles, etc. to recycle into doll's furniture.

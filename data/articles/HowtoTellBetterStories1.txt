 The most meaningful stories convey a message by relating it to an actual series of events. Illustrating a point by relating it to your own experiences will impart a personal, authentic quality. Draw on funny happenings, barriers you overcame, or lessons you learned.True stories are great for illustrating a message, but don’t fret if fiction is your forte. Telling a more imaginative tale still involves the same strategies, like sticking to a clear structure and delivering your story effectively.;
, Keep a journal to log your story ideas when they come to you. Try to keep one handy at all times so an idea never escapes you. Even if you just jot down a quick sentence or thought, you can return to it later and use it to craft a great story., A great story has a point. If you’re making a speech or trying to motivate a team, think of the moral of your story, or the point you’re trying to make. Look through your idea journal or think of a life experience that connects to that message.For example, if you’re trying to inspire your employees or coworkers to meet a deadline, you’d want to tell them a story that illustrates perseverance despite tough obstacles. You could convey that moral by recalling a time they succeeded as a team in the past despite the odds being against them.
 No one likes to hear a person go on and on about how wonderful they are. While it’s best to draw on your own experiences, try to make the hero of your stories someone other than you.For example, stories in which you play a major role could involve you learning something from a mentor or making a mistake. That way, your story will be more authentic, you’ll engage your audience by making yourself vulnerable, and you won’t seem like you’re just boasting.

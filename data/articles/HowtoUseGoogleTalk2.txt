Click on the big, blue "Download Plugin" button in the top right of the window.

After seeing the notification that your download has started, click on the downloaded file that ends with ".exe." The installer should handle everything for you.
 Go to https://gmail.com/ and sign into the account that you created earlier.
 Look on the left side of your screen to find the icons that correlate with this functionality. The icons should all be beneath your profile picture and name.


The icon that looks like a tiny person houses your contacts. Double-click on a contact's name to start a conversation with that person.
The icon that looks like a dialog box with a quotation mark will show past conversations you have had over Google Hangouts.
The icon that looks like a phone will let you make new calls to any of your contacts. Assuming that you are signed into the same Google account on your mobile device, you will see all the contacts from your phone as people available to call.

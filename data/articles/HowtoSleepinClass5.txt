 While doing this it is important to just keep your arms relaxed in your lap. This is one of the most comfortable methods. The downside to this method is it makes it quite obvious you are or are trying to sleep. The major benefit of this method is that it doesn't cause your arms or any other part of your body to "fall asleep" (no pun intended), thus allowing you to sleep longer without being awoken by your arms tingling in discomfort.

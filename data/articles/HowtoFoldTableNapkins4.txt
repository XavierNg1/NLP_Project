 In order to make a rose fold, you will need a square napkin, a level surface to work on, and a glass with a round bottom.

There are multiple variations of the rose fold that vary in complexity. This is a basic rose fold that can be used for decorative purposes. The rose fold also looks great with paper napkins to display with cocktails., Be sure to smooth out any visible wrinkles and orient the napkin as a square.
 Take each corner, one at a time, and fold it to the center of the square. Each corner will now become a smaller triangle with a point in the middle.


Repeat until all four corners are folded. Your napkin should now be oriented like a diamond.
Turn the napkin over. Make sure the folds remain intact while you flip the napkin.
 Now, you will repeat the same folding process with each corner. As you fold each corner towards the center, you will see two small triangles appear.
 The glass needs to be large enough to cover each of the four tips. The glass will keep the corners in place as you move to the next steps of the process.


Press down on the glass to hold it in place with your non-dominant hand.
 Pull the fold out gently until the tip is approximately 1/4 inch further out than the top corner..


By pulling the tips of the fold out, you’ll create the petal shapes of the rose.
Made sure you are still holding onto the glass with your non-dominant hand so the rest of the corners stay secure.
 Repeat the process of pulling the tip out with each of the remaining corners..


Remember to maintain the pressure on the glass so the rest of the napkin doesn’t unfold.
 Once each corner has been pulled out to make the petal shape, you can remove the glass. Now that the rose fold is finished, you can place it on a dinner plate to display. You can use this fold to display smaller bowls or plates that are placed on top of the inner corners.

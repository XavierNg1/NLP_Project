 There are 3 instant options: there is "Selection", which takes a screenshot of a part of your screen; "Window" Takes a screenshot of the tab you have open; "Screen" takes a normal screenshot of the whole screen. In addition to these 3, there is a fourth, "Timed", where you decide a set amount of time (by clicking the up and down arrows) and after that the app takes a "Screen" screenshot.
 To edit it's name, take a screenshot and select it (by clicking it once) and look for the space which says screenshot_(number). It should be on the lower right. Then delete the default name, and name it what you want!

, Do this by opening the Finder window where you want your screenshot to be, and drag the file from the SnapNDrag app to your folder.
 You can edit your screenshot using Apple's Preview, which is the default application used when you try to open your screenshot. Go to the folder with the screenshot, double-click the file and it should open with Preview. In Preview, click the icon with a pen inside a box (it should be in the top-right part of the Preview app). From there, you can add lines, shapes, crop the screenshot and a lot more!

 A dye made from coffee will give you a rich, chocolate brown color. Make a pot of really strong, dark coffee and let it cool down. Mix 1 cup of brewed coffee with 2 cups of leave-in conditioner in an empty shampoo bottle. Add 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds and stir.
 Divide your hair into four sections. Pin back three of these sections while you apply color to the fourth section. Work the dye into your hair, starting at the roots and working towards the ends with your hands. When you’ve applied to all four sections, rub the dye all over your hair as though you were shampooing your hair.
 Cover your hair with an old shower cap and leave this dye on your hair for about an hour. Start your timer when you have put color in the last section of hair.
 Gently rinse your hair with apple cider vinegar, which will help seal the coffee color onto your hair. Then rinse with cool water until the water runs clear.
 Use a towel or blow dryer to dry your hair. Alternatively, you can let it dry naturally. Because you haven’t used chemical-based color to dye your hair, your hair won’t be as dry and brittle and can therefore handle blow drying immediately after dyeing it.
 Water, soap and heat can lessen the dye’s hold on your hair and cause it to escape. Leaving your hair alone for three days will enable the dye to sink into the cuticles of your hair.

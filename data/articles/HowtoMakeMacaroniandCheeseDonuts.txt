 Place the cooked macaroni and cheese in a large bowl, scraping it out using a rubber spatula. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in fridge to chill and slightly harden, usually taking about 2-4 hours.;
,, Remove the macaroni from the fridge. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the macaroni and cheese into a food processor. Crack in the three eggs, one at a time, and then place the food processor onto medium. Blend for about two minutes until properly mixed.
 Prepare the donut pan by spraying non-stick greasing into each cavity. This helps to ensure that the donuts won't stick to the pan.


If you don't have non-stick greasing spray you can also spread melted over the pan using a pastry brush.
 Using a spoon, scoop the macaroni and cheese into the donut pan. Fill each cavity to the top and lightly pattern it with the spoon to spread it around. Repeat until the donut pan is full and there is no more macaroni.
 Before frying, the donuts must bake in order to keep their shape. Have the donuts bake until they are lightly crisped and the edges turn burn.
 Remove the donuts from the oven and have them cool for about five minutes. It's important to have the donuts cool to avoid having them burn and blacken while frying.
 While the donuts cool, prepare the pot or deep fryer with oil. Have it preheat until the oil is hot and starts to slightly bubble.
 Using tongs, place the donuts into the hot oil. Have them fry for about 7-10 minutes, until they crisp and resemble a light brown color. Remove the donuts using the tongs and place them on a serving plate covered with a napkin.
 Use the edges of napkin to soak up any excess oil from the donuts. Serve the donuts with tomato ketchup, cheese sauce, or your favorite mustard.

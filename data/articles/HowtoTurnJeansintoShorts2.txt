 Use chalk or a safety pin to mark where on the jeans you plan to cut them off: at the calves, knees, mid-thighs, or upper thighs. Remove the jeans once you've marked the spot.


Remember that the jeans will get shorter as they fray. If you want a line of fringe, the spot you mark should be about an inch below the length you want the finished shorts to be.
If you don't want fringe, mark a spot about 1/2 an inch below your desired final length.
If you plan to cuff the shorts, or fold them over a few times, mark a spot at least three inches below your desired final length.
 A table or desk would be preferable, since it is waist-high, but if you don't have a large enough surface you can lay them on the floor.
 Tilt it slightly up toward the outer part of the jeans. Lightly trace the cutting path with chalk. Repeat with the other leg.









The cutting paths should come to a slight point below the crotch, forming a "v" shape. This results in a more flattering final look than simply cutting the jeans straight across.
Don't pronounce the "v" too much; it should be quite subtle, unless you want the shorts to look shorter toward the thighs.
 Carefully cut in a straight line along the path you traced.









To get the best results, use fabric scissors, which are designed to cut through heavy fabrics like denim.
Don't panic if your line isn't perfectly even. When the shorts fray the little crooked parts won't be visible.
 Taking into account the extra inch or few inches shorter they'll be in the end, are the approximately the length you had in mind? You might decide you actually want bermudas instead of capris. Take a look and decide before proceeding.

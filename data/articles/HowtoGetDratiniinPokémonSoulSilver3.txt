, Dragons' Den Dratini are at a very low level. Lets say between Level five to Level fifteen.
 Ultra Balls are the best catching rate ball (besides Master Ball) in the game. Dratinis' are so annoyingly hard to catch so use Ultra Balls to probably speed up the catching part. Love Balls are used for the opposite genders. For example, your Pok√©mon is a boy, if the Dratini is a girl, the Love Ball has an advantage.

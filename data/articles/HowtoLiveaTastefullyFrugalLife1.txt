 Sales! Sales! You may think you need those fancy pair of shoes or that nice shirt, but do you really? Is the world going to be destroyed and life as we know going to cease to exist if you don't give in to your needs? No. So, wait for sales. There are always good sales if you look through your daily or Sunday newspaper, especially right before, on or after a holiday. And, usually sales last for the proceeding 2-3 weeks after a big sale to clear out merchandise. You could save anywhere from 50%-75%, particularly at major department stores.;
, Most clothing and shoe stores will have a clearance racks in the very depths of their stores, usually out of view. Luckily, those racks aren't too hard to find in the store. Many items are marked down and you can also save about the same amount as you would at a big sales event. The only drawback is that you may have to spend some time rummaging and sorting through the messy clearance area. But in the end, there are always great finds!

, Don't limit yourself to one particular store or brand. Believe it or not, if you shop around at different stores, both department and non-department stores, you will have better chances of finding the clothes you want and always at a good price. Different stores are good for certain items, and it's always best to shop at various locations to save yourself some money and get what you really want. And, don't ever exclude your local Goodwill or Salvation Army stores either. They are a good source for your shopping needs, too!

, When out shopping, try to think of buying things to go with what you already have in your closet instead of trying to buy a whole new outfit.
 There are plenty of forums online that are dedicated to helping you find good sales and discounts. If you Google enough, it won't be hard to find these sites.

 When preparing to look good for school, it's important to think about how you're going to spend your day and plan ahead. Your "look" for the day may need to be tailored for specific details.


If it's a school day, does your school have a dress code? Will you be outdoors or indoors? What is the weather like? Do you need to layer for temperature changes?
A presentation, evening event, science lab, or extracurricular activity could also affect what you choose to wear that day.;
, You look better and happier when you are comfortable. Throughout high school you are still growing, so always make sure you have enough clothes that fit. Make sure your clothes are clean and that they match. If you do not feel confident in matching, here are some easy hacks for matching:


Don’t mix patterns. Don’t wear a checkered skirt/shorts and a striped top. Instead, wear a solid bottom with the striped top, and save the checkered bottoms for an outfit with a solid top. Too many patterns can give you a dizzying appearance! Try to stick with just one pattern.
When in doubt, stick with neutral tones and one color. Neutrals include black, white, navy, brown, and grey. Just about everything matches these neutrals! It may sound boring, but you can make your one color and big and bold as you want without worrying about matching. , On a school day where you are going to write a lot, you may not want a chunky bracelet that's going to make a lot of noise on your desk. You can pick jewelry, a watch, a purse, a scarf, a hat, or any other accessories you may want to wear that day. When thinking about jewelry, gold and silver are always safe bets if you are concerned about matching. Again, keep in mind any dress codes you may be violating. You don't want to style your hair for a hat, only to have to take it off!

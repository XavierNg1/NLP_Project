 To start compassion meditation, you should be in a quiet, calm environment. This may be a room in your home or a relaxing place outside. Make sure you are not disturbed by others. Get into a comfortable position that you can relax in. This might be sitting down or lying on the floor.Turn off all electronic devices. If you listen to music, make sure it is relaxing, calm music.;
, The first thing you should do is to relax your body and focus on your breathing. Inhale through your nose, making sure to push your abdomen out as you do so. Exhale slowly, pushing all the air out. This should take two to three seconds.Continue breathing in this way for a few minutes.
Pay attention to each breath as you inhale and exhale. Put yourself in the moment and gain awareness of your breathing.
 During compassion meditation, you can focus on someone that you love. Choose a family member or friend who is very dear to you. Visualize them in your mind and visualize the love you feel for that person. Focus on how the love you have feels in your heart.Notice any sensations you feel. Do you feel warmth, openness, or tenderness towards this person?

, As you breathe out, continue thinking about your loved one. Imagine a light, bubble, or something else bright and positive that you can put your feelings into. Then, imagine the light, bubble, balloon, cloud, or whatever contains your feelings extends to the other person.As you imagine your warmth and love extending to them, imagine that the light, bubble, or balloon carries happiness, love, and peace towards the other person.
To yourself, repeat phrases of compassion for your loved one, such as, “May you be happy,” “May you not suffer,” “May you feel joy and peace.”

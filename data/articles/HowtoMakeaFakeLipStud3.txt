 Spirit gum will only work efficiently when applied to both your face and the rhinestone backing.Spirit gum may be available at drug stores during the Halloween shopping season (Late-September & October). For any other parts of the year, check out your local costume shop or an online website.
 Allowing the gum to become tacky will give it a proper hold onto the back of the lip stud. Try counting to sixty and testing the gum with your fingernail. It should feel tacky to the touch.When in doubt, itâ€™s better for the spirit gum to be too dry, rather than too wet.Do not use a blow dryer or another heat form to help the gum tack up faster.
 If your rhinestone is tiny, try using the tweezers to move it. When applying the rhinestone, cautiously stick it to your skin in one fluid motion.After it has stuck, do not move it.
 Press the rhinestone against your face gently. Maintain for approximately ten seconds. Once the ten seconds has past, your fake lip stud should be ready to go.

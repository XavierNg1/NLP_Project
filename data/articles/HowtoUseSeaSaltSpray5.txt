 Wash your hair using a normal shampoo and conditioner, then dry it using a low heat setting on your hair dryer.


It's best to avoid clarifying shampoos since they'll strip oil and texture out of your hair, effectively counteracting the sea salt spray.
You don't need to add other products to your hair, but if you'd like to add an anti-frizz serum, mousse, or other styling agent, do so after washing your hair and before moving onto the next step.
 Spritz sea salt spray through your hair from root to ends. Use a comb to evenly spread the product throughout your hair.


Apply a fairly generous amount of sea salt spray. Your hair should be somewhat damp to the touch, but it should not look or feel drenched.
 Gather your hair into your favorite updo or your favorite bun.


You can use this technique with nearly any updo, but it'll have the most dramatic effect on traditionally sleek styles like French twists and tight chignons.
When using sea salt spray with traditionally messy updos, the extra texture should slightly accentuate the style but won't make it look much different from usual.
 After pinning up your hair, apply a final, light spray of sea salt to your hair to help lock the style in place.


Essentially, you're using the sea salt spray as though it were a standard hairspray during this step.
If there are any loose locks hanging down from your updo, you can give them a gently twist after applying this final spritz to give them more definition and character.
 Allow your hair to air dry. Once it finishes, your hair is ready to show off.


The texture provided by the sea salt spray should help prevent your hair from sliding out of place, which may increase the longevity of your updo.
The additional texture should also give classic updo styles a chic, modern twist.

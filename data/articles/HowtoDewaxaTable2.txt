 Pour 1 cup of vinegar into a bowl and use a fork or whisk to mix the cream of tartar until the solution is thick. The cream of tartar will act as a natural abrasive that will help remove the wax finish., Smear some of the solution on a rag and work it in the direction of your table's grain. Continue working the solution into the wood until the wax finish begins to come off., Get a separate clean rag and saturate it in water. Use the wet rag to rinse off the table's surface. Make sure that there is no more vinegar and tartar solution remaining on the table., Once you're done rinsing off your table, you can use another clean rag or paper towels to thoroughly dry your table. If you notice there is still a wax finish, repeat the process until you remove it.

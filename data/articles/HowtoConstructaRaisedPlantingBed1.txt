 Using a wooden boat can be a great way to make your garden look unique but it can also help if you possess few building or carpentry skills. Search online listings like Craigslist or inquire around at local tackle or sailing shops to find an appropriate boat.


Find an old wooden rowboat (or similar). One which is no longer fit for use in the water will probably be cheapest.
Paint it whatever color you would prefer and drill a few holes in the bottom.
Place it in its final location, such that the boat is level. A trench may be necessary.
Line the bottom with gardening plastic, and place a number of rocks or other fill material to even out the bottom a bit.
Fill with dirt and plant whatever you desire.;
, You can purchase antique bed frames to make your gardening bed look quirky and unique. The downside, of course, is that it may end up at an awkward height for planting and it will be difficult to reach the center if using a very large led. A childâ€™s twin bed is recommended.


If you can only find a head- and foot-board, these can be attached to an appropriately sized bed as described below.
If the frame of the bed is intact with sideboards, you can simply add more sideboards to create a box within the bed. Measure for the boards and nail them (from the inside of the bed) to the posts. Fill with dirt and plant.
 Wine crates, orange crates, or any similar crate can be turned into an excellent planting box. Simply drill holes for drainage if there are none, fill with dirt, and plant. Place them on your gardening beds or on a flat or angled table to display.

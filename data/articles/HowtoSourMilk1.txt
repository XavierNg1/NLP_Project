 Fill a measuring cup with 1 cup (237 ml) of whole milk minus 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml). Next, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh lemon juice or white vinegar to the milk.You can substitute 2% milk or heavy cream for the whole milk if you prefer.;
, After you’ve added the lemon juice or vinegar to the milk, use a spoon to mix the two together. Be sure to blend them well so the acid is fully incorporated into the milk., Once the milk and acid have been mixed together completely, allow the mixture to stand at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. That will give it time to thicken up and curdle slightly so you’ll have sour milk.The recipe makes 1 cup (237 cup) of sour milk. However, you easily halve, double, or triple it based on your needs.

 If you want your boss to read certain documentation, create a top sheet summary of short, concise bullet points explaining the most important ideas contained in the document. Provide your boss with a general understanding of the handout to save time for more important projects that require direct collaboration.
 Create your own schedules for project dates and deadlines. Ask your boss if your project management ideas coincide with project expectations. If the schedules work, then you will have given your boss a pre-prepared agenda to follow, boosting their productivity. If they do not, you may have to make minor changes, but you will at least have a calendar to lessen the disorganization around the office.
 If you email your boss, the subject line should clearly state the intent or contents of the email. If you are sending them an attachment, write a brief summary in the body of the email about what the attachment is. This will make it easier for your boss to find the email later, and it will decrease the amount of time they spend searching for your communications. A good subject line should be no longer than 8 words long. You can indicate if you want a response. It should be specific. Example: “About Our Wednesday Meeting”; “Plans for ____ Project. No Response Needed”; “Increasing Our Traffic. Thoughts?” Do not use phrases in the subject line like “hello” or “how are you,” and avoid using all caps. , Don’t try to handle the organization of the office on your own. Work with your team and delegate tasks to those who are best equipped to handle them. This will spread the work out amongst your coworkers and ease the burden on your boss.

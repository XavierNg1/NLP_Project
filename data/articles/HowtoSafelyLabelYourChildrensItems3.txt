 Handmade card stock labels are an inexpensive way of labeling children's items that have hard surfaces. Additionally, you could turn this into a fun craft where your kids help decorate the labels. In all, you'll need:


Card stock
Markers (non-toxic, many colors)
Pencil (optional)
Scissors
Tape (durable, non-toxic)

, If you're labeling containers, you might want to use broad categories for your label. Labels like "Balls," "Puzzles," and "Animals" on containers can help cut down clutter. For personal or small sized items, you may want to use a first name or initials to signify whose it is.


If your children are especially young, you can draw simple designs with a pencil on your card stock to add flair to your labels. These can be colored in later.
Children who are a little older might want to outline label decorations with a stencil and then color, or draw their own freehand designs., Cut your card stock into small, label sized pieces. For larger items and containers, you may want a larger label so it is more visible. Write out your label message in marker in clear, large print so it is easy to read.


After your message is written, you or your kids can use markers to color in any designs you've added to the label., Use your tape to fasten all edges of your label to the hard surfaced object you are labeling. Make sure the tape is smooth and the label firmly attached.Tape with bubbling beneath its surface or loose edges will pull free more easily from the surface it's attached to and could become a choking hazard.
If the label does not feel secure, don't hesitate to pull it free and use new tape or a new label.

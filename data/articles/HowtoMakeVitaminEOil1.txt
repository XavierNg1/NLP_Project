 Use your measuring cup to measure out your oil. Since you will be using this oil on your skin and hair, you will need to make sure that the oil you choose is organic and non-comedogenic. Non-comedogenic oils will not clog your pores and are less likely to cause breakouts. Some good choices include:argan oil
hemp seed oil
sunflower oil
safflower oil;
, The funnel will help to make sure that you do not spill the oil. Insert the funnel into the bottle and then pour in the four ounces of oil that you have measured out. The dark brown or blue bottle will protect the vitamin E oil from getting degraded and oxidized by light.
 Leave the funnel in place and pour the vitamin E oil out of the caplets and into the bottle containing the base oil. Or, if you prefer, you can use a needle to make a hole in the caplet and then squeeze the Vitamin E into the bottle.


If you have vitamin E oil in liquid form instead of in caplets, then measure out about one teaspoon and add it to the base oil., To add a scent, add 3-5 drops of an essential oil of your choice. Pour the drops into the bottle containing the base oil and vitamin E oil. Some great essential oils to use include:rose
lilac
lavender
orange
lemon
peppermint

, Secure the cap on the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Then turn it right-side up and then upside down again. Repeat this inversion several times to make sure that the oils are all mixed together.

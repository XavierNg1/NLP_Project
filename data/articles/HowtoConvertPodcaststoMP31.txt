, Open the “File” menu from the menu bar and select “Add File to Library”. This will open a window to browse and select files on your computer.

On Windows, the “Preferences” option is located in the “Edit” menu.
 This option appears next to “When you insert a CD” on the “General” tab.
 This is located at the top of the Import Settings window and is set to “AAC Encoder” by default.
 This menu is located just below the “Import Using” menu. Here you can select a bitrate for your encoded mp3’s.


A higher bitrate denotes a higher quality (but larger) file.
If you encoding from a lossy source (for example: mp4, m4a, ogg) then the quality will drop even if you select a higher quality bitrate. Try to encode from lossless sources instead (FLAC, ALAC, wav).
 This is located in the lower right and will save your changes.
 Click the dropdown menu in the upper left, below the menu bar and select Music or Podcasts (wherever you added it).
 You can hold Ctrl (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd (Mac) while clicking to select multiple files at once.
 This will bring up another submenu with conversion options.
 A progress bar will appear at the top showing the conversion process. When complete, a copy of the selected file(s) will appear in your library in the new format.

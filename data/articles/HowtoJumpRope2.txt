 When you get better at jumping rope forwards, try going backwards. Start with the rope in front of your feet and throw it over your head to the back. Jump over it before it hits the back of your feet.
 To execute the "criss-cross" trick, all you have to do is cross your arms in front of you between each jump. It takes practice to get the timing right, but once you've fallen into a rhythm, you can work on alternating between crossing and not crossing the rope between each jump.
 Fold the rope in half while still holding on to each of the handles. Then, move the rope by crossing your right hand over your left and moving it toward your left hip, and then cross the rope again, so the right hand returns to the right hip. The right hand will essentially be drawing a sideways "8" in the air.









The shape made by the jump rope will create an "X" shape in the air, or a shape that looks a bit like a squashed bow tie.
Sway your hips to get the momentum of the rope going.
Once you finish making this shape, bring the right hand up and over to create a shape, or a "rainbow," to jump through.
Jump through the shape, make the "X" shape again, and keep repeating the process.
 Once you've mastered a few of these tricks, you can combine them together. Try doing the "cross-cross," jumping, and then doing the "side swing," for example.

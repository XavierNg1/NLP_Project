 If you have a personal PayPal account, PayPal allows you to dispute a transaction with a seller if you have problems with the product you purchased.


You can find a link to the resolution center by clicking on the PayPal icon on the upper-left side of your screen. If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, the link will be on the left-hand side, entitled “Resolve a problem in our resolution center.”
PayPal has a different process if you have a business account rather than a personal account.;
, PayPal's Resolution Center allows you to send a message directly to the seller to resolve any problems you have.


Click the button to “dispute a transaction.”
You will be redirected to a page that lists all of your transactions.
Select the transaction that you want to dispute by clicking on the open circle to the left of the transaction date, and then click the “continue” button.
 At this point, you will be redirected to a page that asks you to identify the type of problem that you want to address. There are two selections: “I have a problem with an item I purchased” or “I want to report a transaction that I didn't authorize or was transacted in error.” Click the circle to the left of the selection that most accurately describes your dispute, and then click the “continue” button.


If you chose, “I have a problem with an item I purchased,” you will be redirected to a screen that asks you to select either “I didn’t receive my item,” or “I received my item but it is significantly not as described.” Click the circle to the left of the selection that most accurately describes your dispute, and then click the “continue” button.
 Once you choose your category, there is a message box that allows you to compose a message directly to the seller through PayPal’s Resolution Center.
 Once you have composed your message, click the “continue” button. PayPal will record your dispute and send it to the seller.


PayPal gives you 180 days from the date your payment posted to dispute the transaction. If a transaction is more than 180 days old, you still can report the problem to PayPal., PayPal gives you and the seller the opportunity to exchange messages directly to attempt to resolve your problem.


While you're negotiating, PayPal places a hold on any funds related to the disputed transaction.When you open your dispute, PayPal sends the seller an email notification. You should receive a response from the buyer within seven days.
From the day you open your dispute, you have 20 days to negotiate. If you don't close or escalate your dispute within that time, PayPal will automatically close your dispute., If you're completely satisfied with the solution you've reached with the seller, you can close the dispute. Otherwise you can escalate the dispute to get PayPal involved.


Once you've closed a dispute, you can't reopen it, so make sure you're happy with the result.
If you want to escalate a dispute that involves your payment for an item you didn't receive, you have to wait seven days for shipment of the item after you open your dispute before you can escalate it.

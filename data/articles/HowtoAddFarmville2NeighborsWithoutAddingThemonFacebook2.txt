 Visit Facebook using Mozilla or Chrome web browser, and log into the account that you use to play Farmville 2.
 Type “Farmville 2” in the search bar at the top of screen. You will get a page result with an official verification (blue tick) on it. Click the page and click the “Play now” button. This will launch the game.


Alternatively, you can click the Farmville 2 shortcut link on the left panel of your News Feed page.
 If you’re opening the Farmville 2 for the first time, you will get a pop-up asking you to enable the Community Neighbor feature in your account. If that is not happening, scroll down to the bottom of the screen and click the “Settings” option located right at the bottom. From the options listed, check “Enable Feature” next to “Community Friends are here.”

, After enabling the feature, you will be suggested to other players as a Community neighbor. When you run out of money or energy, a “Get more free help and free gifts” pop-up will appear with two options: “Not interested” and “OK.” Click “OK.”


A list of Community neighbors with their pictures and an “Add” button at the bottom will be displayed. Click “Add” to add these Community neighbors. Once you add them, they will be displayed at the bottom of your game screen.
 When someone adds you as a Community neighbor, you will receive a notification. Click the envelope icon available at the top right of the game screen, and accept the request. Once accepted, they will also be added as your Community neighbors. Now, whenever you need help, you can seek out your Community neighbors for assistance rather than your Facebook friends.

 Puppies as young as three weeks old can be introduced to grooming by way of gentle brushing. Starting this daily process early will allow your Morkie to be comfortable and cooperative in the future. Let your puppy sit or stand for brushing, and praise it for staying still. If it fusses or moves, gently but firmly say “no” to assert that it must obey you., Morkies have a coat that is long, soft, and fine, and requires daily brushing to avoid tangles. Brushing also removes dirt, dandruff, and dead hair, and distributes natural oils through your dog’s coat to make it shiny. Once a day, brush your dog very gently with a slicker brush or pin brush. Although Morkies are a non-shedding breed, your pet may lose a bit hair when groomed, so brush it on an easy to clean surface (e.g. the floor, a tabletop, a mat specifically reserved for grooming).Start by brushing in the opposite direction of hair growth, then brush it in the direction of hair growth.
 The hair growing around your Yorkie’s forehead can get into its eyes and cause tears, which can stain its hair. Use a small comb to gently pull this hair away from your Morkie’s face. With small grooming scissors, carefully trim the hair just enough to ensure that it doesn’t irritate your pet’s eyes.If your Morkie has any mats or tangles that brushing cannot remove, gently cut them out with the grooming scissors.
 To clean away tears, prevent the growth of bacteria, and make your dog more comfortable, clean its eyes daily. Wet a soft cloth with warm water and gently run it over your Morkie’s eyes to clean tears away. If tearing occurs during the day, repeat this process., While you are giving your Morkie its daily grooming, check its skin and hair for any possible issues. Such problems could include fleas, ticks, skin irritation, dry patches, and inflammation. Daily inspection can reveal these issues early enough to have them easily treated by a veterinarian.

 You can also chop up a stump to remove it. To use this removal method, you will need a stump grinder. You can rent one from a home improvement store. This machine has a rotary cutter that will drill into and grind up the stump. It's a good method to use if you have a huge, stubborn stump you need to remove. Renting a stump grinder is probably the most prudent option, but if you have a lot of stumps to grind, it might be worth it to buy one.Get protective equipment, too. Goggles and a mask will protect you from sawdust and flying wood chips.
If you don't enjoy handling heavy machinery, call a local landscaper and explain that you have a stump that needs to be removed. You'll be able to pay someone else to do it.
 Use a chainsaw to level off the stump just a few inches from the ground. Remove any branches or roots that stick up too far off the ground so that the stump grinder will have a stable surface on which to operate.
 Put on your goggles and mask, and position the stump grinder over the stump. Then, following the manufacturerâ€™s instruction, move the grinder slowly across the stump's surface to grind it up to bits. Continue along the arial roots to grind those as well until the stump has been fully ground up.









Be careful not to get your feet in the way of the grinder. Wear heavy boots so you won't accidentally hurt yourself.
Make sure children and pets are safely away from the equipment before you begin operating it.
 Remove all of the wood chips and discard them (or use them as mulch, then fill in the hole with soil.









You might need to use an ax to chop out remaining roots.

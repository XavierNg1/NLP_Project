 Be prepared to tailor the lessons––something that works well for a group of 3.0 NTRP level ladies might not work as well with top ranked high school champs. Know your clients' age and skill levels, so you can plan the lesson accordingly. The effort you put in will be rewarded by the client's loyalty, as it will be clear you've made an investment in respecting your client's own needs.
 As you get better at coaching, you will start making up your own games and drills. These are great for advertising yourself, your specific skill set and making a special name for yourself. By giving names to your particular routines and games, your students will remember them for citing purposes and by word-of-mouth, you'll find more people get to learn about you and your teaching style.
 You are now a tennis coach, so enjoy being outside and make your work fun. Be open to all kinds of people and personalities because you will meet all kinds.


Give everybody a chance to be the best they can be. A coach is sometimes a very influential person in people's lives and your students will respect you if they can see that you respect your work.

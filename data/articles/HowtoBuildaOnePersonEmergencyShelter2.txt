 No quickly constructed shelter will help you from winds at this strength. Instead, go to a basement, or failing that to a room near the center of a building with no windows.
 A shelter is usually not the best option for an earthquake, although you can prepare in other ways. Earthquake survival is based on two main strategies:


If the tremor is mild and there is a relatively open space outside (no tall buildings), walk to it through the nearest exit. Do not use elevators.
If the tremor is violent or you cannot reach an open space safely, drop under or next to sturdy furniture and hold on.
 If you own a house and are committed to disaster preparation, dig out a basement or dig a bunker. Stock this with emergency supplies in case ordinary services are disrupted. You can also get a FRS or ham radio (you need a license though) for communication.
 An underground bunker is your best bet for protecting yourself from radioactive fallout. In general, the safest areas are indoors, with as many walls and thick furniture between you and the outdoors as possible. Insulating the walls with as much dense material as you can find will protect you further.Seal all vents using duct tape and try to close all doors.

Follow the prompts provided by the application to customize your horoscope information on Facebook. You may be prompted to select your astrological sign or enter your birth date.
Instruct the horoscope app to publish your horoscope to Facebook. In most cases, the horoscope app can be manipulated to automatically post your daily, weekly, or monthly update to your News Feed so it can be seen by your Facebook friends.
 This step can be performed if you only want specific friends to see your horoscope information.


Click on the downward-facing arrow located in the upper-right corner of your Facebook session.
Click on "Account Settings," then click on "Apps" in the left sidebar.
Click on "Edit" next to your horoscope app, then modify your privacy settings next to the field that reads "App activity privacy."
Click on the "Close" button to exit out of your app settings, and return back to your Facebook profile.

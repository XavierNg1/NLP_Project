 Make sure to use equal parts baking soda and water. Start by mixing 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of water with a spoon in a small bowl. Combine more if necessary. It's crucial to make sure the paste is thick enough to adhere to the rust.
 Using the rag, apply the paste and allow it stick to the rusted surface for a few hours or longer. Be sure to give the mixture enough time to set on the rust.
 Using steel wool, a wire brush, crumpled aluminum foil, or even a toothbrush, rigorously scrub the baking soda off of the tinware until there is none remaining. This process may need to be repeated a few times to get the entirety of the rust removed from the surface.

, No banner is the same size.
 If you want it to go with a specific color for a specific theme then try to match the colors.
 Maybe add some oddly colored flowers to your banner. Just make sure it leaves room for the text and doesn't clutter everything.
 Type what you need such as a title for the banner. You then need to resize it to the specific area you want it to cover. The text will still be small so before you make it huge and fit the box you need to experiment with the different types of fonts. Make sure it isn't odd font which doesn't fit with the color theme or the design.
 Try PNG or JPEG files because they're high quality files.
 You work should give an idea to the viewers of it that you're officially good at making banners.

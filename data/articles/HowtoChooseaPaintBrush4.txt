 How you clean your brush will depend on the type of paint used. Read and follow the cleaning instructions provided on the paint. Make sure to thoroughly rinse the brush and clean it immediately after each use. The sooner you clean the bristles the less likely paint will stick onto the brush.Push the bristles down on a flat surface while cleaning. This will cause the bristles to splay and will allow you to rinse out all of the paint from the center of the brush.
 Use a clean towel to soak up some of the excess water. Then rest the brush on the edge of a sink or work station and let the bristles hang over the edge. This will allow air to circulate around the bristles and will help the brush dry faster.You do not want to get the ferrule wet because this can cause the bristles to loosen and fall out over time.
 Place the handles of your brushes into a deep container with the bristles facing upwards. You can also put the plastic or cardboard coverings that came with the brush over the bristles to help hold the shape of the bristles.Alternatively, you can hang large brushes upside down. Usually large paint brushes will have a hole in the handle. Hang the brush from a nail.

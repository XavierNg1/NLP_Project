 Everyone should have their own dance experience. Enjoy the moment without interfering with others ability to enjoy it too. Don’t try to rub up against someone or dance so wildly that you run into others. Rave dance floors tend to be packed and other dancers could dance enthusiastically, so respect their space as you'd like them to respect yours. Bumping into other dancers is unavoidable, but try to keep your arm and hand movements in a proximity that still allows dancers around you to move freely.
 You have to respect peoples personalities as well as their space. Don’t make fun of anyone or pass judgment on a fellow raver. You’re all in this together.
 You wouldn’t want to accidently rub against anyone else’s sweaty body, so don’t subject a stranger to that. Keep your shirt on.
 Even if you feel like someone is violating your space, just walk away. Don’t push someone or initiate violence. In such a small crowded space that can lead to a lot of people getting hurt, not just you and your opponent.

 Hermione is very intelligent and does well in school. She loves to do schoolwork. Use your summer holidays to study everything that will come up next year. As Hermione once said, "I've learned all the course books by heart, of course. I just hope it will be enough.";
,,, Except about study...always criticize how they haven't studied enough!

, Don't tell him of course, but keep to your studies while he messes around with a few Lavender Brown-type girls. Wait around for him and have faith that it will work out, he'll realize you're the one in the end and you'll have your education. And I don't mean this in a "let him walk all over you" way. I just mean, don't give up on him. There's only ever one perfect guy for us Hermiones!

, Always listen to everybody who has that kind of power over you (e.g., teachers, parents, etc.) except when they are most certainly in the wrong...eg., Professor Umbridge.
 That's what the real Hermione Granger would do.

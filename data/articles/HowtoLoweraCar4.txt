 Hydraulics can be installed on 1, 2, 3 or all 4 suspension corners of your car.


Installing a hydraulic system also requires installing an internal control system, hydraulic pumps and batteries to operate the pumps.






One drawback to this method of lowering your vehicle is the large amount of battery power required to operate each hydraulic pump in the system.

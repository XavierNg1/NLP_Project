 Since one of your goals is amassing relevant email addresses, you’ll want to keep a master list and be sure to back it up. However, not all potential leads are the same. Some addresses are from people you know and have met. Others are from strangers who may or may not be leads.
 These might be your VIPs. These are past customers and hopefully repeat customers. You can offer them special deals and special treatment, since they’re a critical part of your business.
 These are people you have not met, or haven’t met yet, but who may be leads. Turn them from strangers into leads by enticing them with promotions that appeal to first-time customers. For example, a first month free promotion, no set-up charges, or free installation are all promotions that apply to new customers, rather than repeat ones.
 Listservs are applications that manage email discussion groups,and message boards are online discussion areas where people discuss specific subjects and troubleshoot. Find some lists and boards that are relevant to your business. Keep track of who is active there and learn more about them and their businesses. Ask questions, and if you know the answers to someone else’s question, answer it.
 An email newsletter is kind of like a more detailed social media post or a more exciting press release. Incorporate pictures, stats, quotes, and ideally try to have more than one person speaking or lending quotes to the newsletter. Include links to your site and your social media sites. Also, make some sort of call to action: take our survey, use this coupon, follow our Facebook page, etc.

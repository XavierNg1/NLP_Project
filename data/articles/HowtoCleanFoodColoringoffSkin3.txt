 You can also soak a washcloth with water, and use it to rub off any excess dye from your skin.
 Be sure to have more vinegar on hand. You will need it to re-soak the washcloth later.
 If the vinegar stings or burns, try mix one part vinegar with with one part water. This will dilute the vinegar a little and make it sting less.









If you got food coloring on your face, dilute the vinegar with water first. You can also use toothpaste.
 As you continue to work, the washcloth will absorb the dye. You will need to rinse it with fresh water when this happens. If you don't, it will transfer the dye back onto your skin. Be sure to re-soak the cloth with more vinegar after rinsing it. Keep rubbing the stain until it fades away.
 Make a paste in a small dish using two parts baking soda and one part water. Spread the paste over the stain. Rub your fingers over it using a gentle, circular motion.








Try not to rub too hard. Baking soda is abrasive and may make your skin feel raw.
 Baking soda does not always rinse off well, so this may take a while. Be sure to keep rinsing the area with soap and water until your skin no longer feels grainy.
 Most dyes should be gone by now, but you may have to repeat the whole process for very deep stains.

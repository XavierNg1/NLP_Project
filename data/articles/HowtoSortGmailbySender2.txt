 Locate the search bar at the top of your Inbox. Left-click once on the gray down arrow near the right side of the bar. This should bring up "advanced settings."You can adjust the settings here to create a fine-tuned search based on specific information you choose. Options include "From," "To," "Subject," "Has the words," "Doesn't have," and "Has attachment." You can also choose to search specific folders, dates, and message sizes.
 Click in the "From" search field, then type name or e-mail address of the sender you wish to search by. Both the name and e-mail address will work.


As you type, suggested contacts will appear beneath the text bar. Once you see the correct contact appear in the bar, you can stop typing and click on the contact's name to select it., After choosing the correct sender, hit the blue search button at the bottom of the advanced search window. Once you do this, Gmail should automatically search for all messages sent from your chosen contact. Those e-mails will be displayed on the search results page.


The search button is labeled with an icon that looks like a magnifying glass.
 You can utilize the same search feature faster if you know the correct keyword shortcut. Instead of accessing the advanced search option, simply type "from:" into the search bar and hit the magnifying glass icon to the right side of the bar. Note that you do not need quotation marks.


For example, to see all emails from your friend Susan, you might type: from:(Susan.email@gmail.com)

After hitting the search button or Enter key on your keyboard, you should be redirected to a search results page displaying all recent messages from your chosen contact.

 The easiest way to tackle this is to use a red wig. Even if it's short, there are synthetic clip-on extensions that you can get online which make getting the wig a lot easier.;
, It's technically pink, though you could pass off a red (or even blue or black) one in the pink one's place. If you have an InuYasha cosplay already, just use the top for that, or you can either make it, go thrifting at Goodwill for something like it, or buy it online. Kenshin does have a white under-kimono thing, so keep it in consideration when making/buying the cosplay.
 Unfortunately, the odds of finding a white obi belt lying around are very slim, so either use one the color of your top (as the kimono-shirt doesn't close normally) or make one. For the pants, either have Lady Luck in your favor and find some or buy them. Light grey non-baggy pants work very well too (it's what I use).
 Foam katanas are very good because they can't hurt anyone and are great in cosplay fights and cosplay skits because no one runs the risk of having their eye poked out. Plastic katanas are very legit, but may break in cosplay fights and have sharp tips. If you aren't going to be in a cosplay skit, plastic katanas are cheap and good-looking.
 You can put it on with face paint, or if you're in a rush, washable marker.
 Though he used to be a Manslayer, he has put that behind him and gone on with his life. Even when he fights, he doesn't kill unless he absolutely has to. (If you know Inuyasha, Kenshin is exactly the opposite of him.) Though Kenshin is forgiving, he will protect those close to him.

 Be willing to work around the seller’s schedule. Leave a contact number or email address in case the seller needs to get in touch with you prior to the visit.
 Look for anything that might have a negative impact on the quality of the binoculars. Lens quality is probably the most important factor here. If there are scratches of any kind, you should politely decline and consider a different option. Test out every feature before ultimately deciding whether or not you’re going to buy them.
 If you’re satisfied with what you see, you should either agree to pay the listed price or take your chances at negotiating for a lower one. Some sellers are firm in their valuation (and will often say so in their ads), but many are willing to at least entertain an offer. It is ultimately the seller’s decision.
 Congratulations! You are the newest member of the birding fraternity.

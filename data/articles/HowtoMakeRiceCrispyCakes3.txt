 You'll need to work fast once the mixture is ready. Save time in advance by lining a large, rectangular baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.


There's no baking involved in this recipe. You can use any large container, or a couple dozen muffin tins.
 Combine 3 tbsp (45 g) butter and 3/8 cups (120 g) golden syrup in a saucepan. Melt together over low heat while stirring, then bring to a rolling boil. Remove from heat.


Brown rice syrup will work instead of syrup, though it has a different flavor.
Just use a little less than Â½ cup if you don't have 1/8 cup measurements. This recipe doesn't need to be exact.
 Immediately pour the syrup into the pan, before it hardens. Stir in about 6 cups (150 g) crispy rice cereal, until coated and sticky. If you like, stir in chopped nuts, a spoonful of peanut butter, or a few mini marshmallows.
 Leave the mixture at room temperature or in the refrigerator until it hardens. Slice into chunks and serve.


Stick popsicle sticks into the pieces to make them easier to eat.

 After using dish soap and water to remove dirt or sediment, if the water stain remains, you can try using vinegar and water as the mixture instead.Make sure that you use white vinegar. Add equal parts vinegar and water into a bowl. You could use ¼ teaspoon white vinegar for every 32 ounces of water. You don’t need much vinegar.Take a clean cloth, dab it into the mixture, and then apply the solution on the water stained area of the carpet. You could also use a hand-held sprayer to apply the mixture to the carpet.
Again, you should press lightly onto the carpet. It’s the pH in the vinegar that helps remove the water stain from carpet.
 You won’t see the full effects of your efforts until the carpet is fully dry. You’ll want to back off, and let it do so naturally.


As the carpet dries, you should see the water stain gradually disappear. You may want to repeat the process if it’s vanished somewhat but not completely.
You shouldn’t apply heat to the carpet. Just make sure no one walks on it in that area until it dries naturally.
If the stain is a tough one or more deeply ingrained, you may need to leave the vinegar and water mixture on the stain for a few minutes before rubbing it away.
 After you're done with using the water-and-vinegar mixture, try using a steam iron to remove the stain faster.


Put a towel over the carpet on top of the water stain. Don't apply the iron directly to the carpet or you could burn the carpet.
Now, put the steam iron on low on the steaming function. This will direct hot steam toward the stain.
Put the iron on the towel for a few minutes, and press gently onto the towel. Then, remove the iron.

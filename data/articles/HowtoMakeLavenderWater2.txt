 Lavender water is so easy to make that it only requires a few basic supplies. Most of these can be found at craft stores or health food stores. If you have trouble finding anything, check online and consider ordering it. Here's what you'll need:Lavender essential oil
Distilled water
Witch hazel or vodka
Glass jar with a lid
Spray bottle
Funnel

, When you're making lavender water, the most important thing to get right is the ratio of the ingredients. Using just the right amount of lavender will ensure that your water smells divine but not overpowering. Mix up the following ingredients in the glass jar:


3 ounces of distilled water (you can use tap water if you don't have distilled)
1 ounce of witch hazel or vodka (this acts as a preservative and helps the lavender oil distribute throughout the water)
10 drops of lavender essential oil

, Make sure the lid is tightly screwed on, and shake up the jar to mix the lavender oil with the water. The witch hazel or vodka will help the oil mix well with the water.
 Place the funnel over the opening in the spray bottle. Carefully pour the lavender water through the funnel and into the bottle. If you have extra lavender water that won't fit in the bottle save it in the jar until you run out of liquid in the bottle.
 Spray it on your linens, your clothing, your furniture or your pillow. Lavender water has a calming effect, and using it is an excellent way to freshen up your environment and relieve stress.


Using lavender water is also a good natural way to relieve headaches.
Spray it on our skin before going outdoors as a natural insect repellent.

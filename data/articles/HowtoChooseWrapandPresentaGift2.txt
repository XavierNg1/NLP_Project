 Consider using a bag, an envelope, a box, or something else. Be creative!

, For instance, put a swimming costume in a beach bag, or wrap it in a towel. Put stationery supplies inside a pencil-case. Put knitted baby booties inside a knitted drawstring bag. Put a jewelry set inside it's own box to keep it together and untangled.
 For instance, tie it all together with a colourful ribbon, add some stickers, spritz it with some glitter spray, stick on an artificial flower, or add some sequins.

 Get out 1 pound (453 g) of sirloin steak and use a sharp knife to carefully trim away any visible fat. Cut the trimmed steak into strips that are less than 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide. Turn the strips about 90 degrees and cut the strips into bite-sized cubes.If you find more fat or silver membrane as you're cutting, trim it away.
You may be able to buy pre-cut beef tips at the meat counter.;
, Sprinkle the sirloin tip bites with lots of kosher salt and ground pepper. Use your fingers to stir the meat around so it's all coated. Set the meat aside and place a skillet on the stove. Turn the skillet on to medium-high heat and turn on the stove's ventilation fan.If you don't have a ventilation fan, try to open a window in your kitchen because the sirloin tips will smoke a lot when they begin to cook.
 Place 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter into the skillet. Let the butter melt and become a golden brown color. You may want to hold the handle of the skillet with an oven mitt and gently swirl the butter to keep it from burning., Put about half of the seasoned steak bites into the hot skillet. They should be in a single layer. Let the meat cook for 30 to 45 seconds before you stir it around.Don't worry when the meat sizzles loudly in the pan. This just means that the skillet is hot and browning the meat.
 Use a spatula to scoop up and flip over the sirloin tips in the pan. Ensure that the tips are in a single layer so they cook evenly. Saute the sirloin tips for another 30 to 45 seconds.The outside of the bites should be browned and crispy while the inside will be slightly pink and tender.
 Transfer the steak bites to a serving plate and saute the rest of the seasoned steak bites. Carefully pour any browned butter that's left in the skillet over the sauteed sirloin tip bites. Let them rest for a few minutes and then serve them.The bites will finish cooking as they rest. This is why it's important to avoid overcooking them in the skillet.

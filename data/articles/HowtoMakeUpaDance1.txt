 Do you want the dance to work with a song? Dances don’t necessarily have to be to music, although they often are. Look for a song that has a good rhythm or beat.Consider using a song that has a build up and then a drop. Music like this lends itself to a beat. Soft acoustic music might be harder to dance to.;
, If you’re making the dance with a friend, then you should probably include them in the creative process. If you want to have the dance work for a big group, that decision will play into the different moves you will use and the space you will need.


Understand that dancing with large groups of people can be much harder than dancing alone. However, it will be also be a lot of fun and the pressure won’t be entirely on you. Be prepared to organize constantly if you want to dance with a large group.
 Consider what style of dance works with the music you want to choose. If you plan to have no music that will influence the type of dance that you do too.If you have no music you’ll probably want to choose a dance that is more interpretive, rather than a standard hip hop dance.

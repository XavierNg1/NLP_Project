 Antibiotics called ‘broad spectrum’ antibiotics kill a wide range of bacteria.Guinea pigs are very sensitive to certain antibiotics, though, so your vet will be very careful with selecting an antibiotic for your guinea pig.Whichever antibiotic your vet prescribes, following the prescription instructions carefully.


Guinea pigs can develop a condition called antibiotic-associated enterotoxemia, which causes brown watery diarrhea, extreme dehydration, and hypothermia. Guinea pigs with this condition can die within one to two days of showing symptoms.If your guinea pig becomes extremely ill while on antibiotic treatment, take it your vet immediately.
 A diet high in roughage provides fiber that will help move food through the GI tract. Sometimes, though, a guinea pig may need medication to improve food movement. This medication should be used only if there is no obstruction or perforation (holes) in the GI tract.If food can’t move past the obstruction, the medication could worsen the GI problem.
 If your guinea pig’s abdomen is distended because of gas buildup, your guinea pig will be in a lot of pain. Your vet will prescribe a pain medication (carprofen, meloxicam) to relieve that pain.Pain can reduce food movement through the GI tract, which could worsen your guinea pig’s GI problem., Just relieving the gas-related pain won’t relieve the gas itself. A product called simethicone relieves gas.Other gas reliefs are also available, so your vet will recommend which product to use, and explain how to use it.


Your vet may want to perform a procedure to reduce the gas distension. For example, with your guinea pig anesthetized, your vet would insert a stomach tube down your guinea pig’s throat to its stomach to let the gas out.

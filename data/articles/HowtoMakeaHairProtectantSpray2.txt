 Pour 1 cup (237 ml) of distilled water into a spray bottle. Make sure the bottle is large enough that there is approximately 2-inches (5-cm) of space at the top of the bottle.You can use a plastic or glass spray bottle for the hair protectant spray.
 With the water in the bottle, mix in 1 tablespoon (13 g) of melted coconut oil and 4 drops of almond oil. It usually helps to use a medicine dropper to add the oils to the bottle.You can substitute argan or grapeseed oil for the almond oil if you prefer.
 When the water and oils are mixed in the bottle, squeeze a quarter-sized amount of your favorite conditioner into the palm of your hand. Carefully transfer it into the bottle with the other ingredients.You can use whatever conditioner that you like, but be sure that it contains silicones. They are the ingredients that help coat your hair to protect it.
 Once all of the ingredients are in the spray bottle, mix them together by shaking the bottle well. The spray may separate when you’re storing it, so remember to shake it before each use.Don’t be concerned if the mixture has some lather or suds after you shake it together. That’s entirely normal. The spray will settle into a milky liquid once it has time to sit.
 When you’re ready to use the spray, hold the bottle approximately 6-inches (15-cm) from your head and mist it over your hair evenly. Work the spray through your hair with your fingers, and heat style as usual.

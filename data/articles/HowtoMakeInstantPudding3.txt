 The bowl needs to be large enough so that you can mix everything together without the ingredients spilling over the sides.
 Cut a vanilla bean in half, then slice one of the halves open, lengthwise. Use the tip of your knife to scrape the seeds out of the pod and into your pudding mixture.


Put the remaining vanilla bean half into a jar, and save it for another recipe.
 If you added the vanilla bean to it, be sure to break up any clumps of seeds using the back of a spoon.
 Close the jar tightly, and shake it to mix everything together again.
 When you ready to use it, measure out Â½ cup (96 grams) of the mixture, and stir it into 2 cups (475 milliliters) of milk. Cook it over high heat in a saucepan, stirring constantly. When it begins to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Once it thickens, pour it into a serving bowl, and let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. You can serve it hot or chilled.

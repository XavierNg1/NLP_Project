 When you fold the bag, make sure the pattern is visible on the inside (if the pattern is not apparent on both sides). Trim any hanging thread.


Perform the same action with the lining by folding the lining piece of fabric in half and sew the seam. As with the large fabric, make sure the pattern is visible on the inside of the bag if it’s not printed on both sides.
 Keep pins along the seam to hold it in place while you sew. Trim the residual fabric after you’ve sewed the bag.


Sew the bottom of the lining’s bag the same way you sewed the bag. Also, trim the additional fabric post sewing.
 Using a fabric pencil, draw a line approximately 1 ½ inches from the point. Mark a twin line on the direct opposite corner, 1 ½ inches away from the point.


Sew along the marked line on both sides. Use pins to hold your sewing in place along the way.






Perform the same action to the lining by using the fabric pencil and drawing a straight line, demarking opposite sides of the bag. Sew along the lines.
 Now the pattern should be visible with the stitching hidden inside the bag.


Turn the lining bag inside out and place it inside the main bag. The lining should be slightly smaller than the main bag so it should fit snugly inside.






Pin bag and lining together in preparation to receive the binding.

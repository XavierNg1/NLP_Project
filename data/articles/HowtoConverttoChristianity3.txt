 A good way to examine beliefs of a church is to read the particular church's Statement of Faith, a list of basic beliefs and compare it to others.


There are many Christian denominations, including Anglican, Assembly of God (and other Pentecostal denominations), Baptist, Christian (denomination), Churches of Christ, Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox (Eastern, Greek, Russian), Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, and United Church of Christ. There are other Protestant groups, with some called "nondenominational", "not affiliated with (____)" or "independent (____)" churches of one kind or another.
Although all Christians share belief in Jesus Christ, each denomination has its own unique emphases on certain teachings, traditions, customs, and beliefs. Different groups form consensus on understandings of different doctrines about The Sacraments, The Triune God (versus Arian Belief concerning God), pastor, order of services, offices of bishop, presbyter, deacon, and such, marriage, healing, prophesies, praying to saints, speaking unknown tongues, formalities, rituals, written prayers, or informality, pray as the Spirit of God gives utterance, etc.
It is wise to research organizations very carefully and thoroughly before you get involved with them too deeply. Some people have had negative experiences because they rushed into a group too quickly before finding out all about it. Don't let yourself be rushed into a commitment to a group until you feel comfortable. Beware falling under the sway of religious cult leaders who won't respect your right to make your own decisions or who try to control your life in a manipulative manner.
 He or she may help you find all the answers to the questions you need to know.
 Find a church near you, or one that you like. Go to that church and talk to the pastor or priest, attend church services or mass whenever you can, and visit this Church any day of the week that your soul calls you to.

 Kidney infection begins as a urinary tract infection and progresses to your kidneys. It can cause permanent damage to the kidneys if itâ€™s not treated promptly.One or both kidneys may be infected, causing a deep, dull pain in the abdomen, back, side, or groin. If you have the following symptoms, seek medical attention as soon as possible:Fever, possibly with chills
Frequent urination
A strong and persistent urge to urinate
Burning or pain while urinating
Pus or blood in the urine (may be red or brownish)
Foul-smelling or cloudy urine
Seek emergency medical attention if you have these symptoms combined with nausea and vomiting, Kidney stones are one of the main causes of kidney pain. The pain starts when the kidney tries to get rid of the stone and has a problem doing so. This sort of pain generally comes in waves.Kidney stones often manifest in sudden, extreme pain in the lower back, side, groin, or abdomen.Kidney stones may also cause other symptoms, including pain in the penis or testicles, difficulty urinating, or a frequent, urgent need to urinate., The bleeding could be caused by trauma, disease, or drugs. Some bleeding disorders may lead to blood clot formation in the kidney. When the clot impairs blood supply to any part of the kidney, pain starts. This sort of pain also comes in waves but is generally felt in the flank. The flank is located between the upper belly area and the back.Other symptoms of kidney injury include:Abdominal pain or swelling
Blood in the urine

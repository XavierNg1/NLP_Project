 Try to get the full strand, rather than having it break in the middle.


Your hair should be dry, and it can have styling products in it. It is best, however, to leave styling products out of your hair while you’re testing it in order to get the most authentic results.
 Hold the strand of hair with your hands on both ends and pull. Stretch it gently.


Don’t stretch it quickly or else it will break too soon. The strand of hair will snap eventually, but you want to see how much it will stretch before it breaks., Watch how it begins to stretch like a rubber band and pay close attention to when it breaks. Highly elastic hair will stretch up to 50% its original length before it snaps.



High elasticity: If you can stretch the strand a long way before it breaks, you have high elasticity and very strong hair.

Medium elasticity: If you can stretch the strand somewhat before it snaps, you have medium elasticity.

Low elasticity: If the strand breaks almost immediately when stretching it, you have low elasticity and your hair may not be very strong.
 Your hair may have different elasticity on a different part of your head. If you pulled a strand from the crown of your head first, for example, try pulling out a strand from behind your ear or at the base of your scalp.

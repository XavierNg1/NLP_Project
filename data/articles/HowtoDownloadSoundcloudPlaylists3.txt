 Because they cannot provide a universal way to download playlists, SoundCloud allows artists to link to their downloadable albums or playlists on other sites. You can find out if a playlist can be purchased through another service if an artist has added a Buy button to their playlist.


SoundCloud artists do have the option to change the text on the button from “Buy” to something else. Some playlists will say Pre-Order, Purchase, or something along these lines.
 Artists often use services like iTunes, BandCamp or Spotify to sell songs and albums. The link from SoundCloud will likely link to one of those widely-used services, and most will require you to enter your credit card information before you are able to download your playlist.

 Tongue scrapers come in many shapes and sizes, but if you have a strong gag reflex, a low-profile model is likely your best bet. Scrapers that get closer to the roof of your mouth are more likely to trigger your gag reflex.

If even small scrapers are problematic for you, you can try using dental floss instead. Its ultra-low profile on your tongue should help keep your gag reflex at bay.You can even try wrapping a clean, damp, thin washcloth over your first two fingers and using that as your homemade scraper.
 The more of your tongue you can get away from the back and roof of your mouth, the better. In addition to helping keep your gag reflex at bay, this also enables you to place the scraper more precisely and see your progress more clearly., Place the scraper on your tongue as far back as you comfortably can, and draw it along the surface until you pass beyond the tip of your tongue. Make firm contact, but don’t press as though you’re trying to scrape paint off a surface.You’ll probably pull a lot of gunk off of your tongue, so rinse the scraper with clean water after each pass. Repeat the process until you’ve covered as much of your tongue as your gag reflex will permit.
 Rinse and spit with clean water or an antimicrobial mouthwash after you finish scraping. You can and should scrape your tongue every time you brush (either before or after brushing).

Brushing or scraping your tongue are equally effective at reducing bacterial buildup, so it’s not important which technique works best for you — what is important is that you clean your tongue regularly.

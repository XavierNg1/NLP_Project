 Because infants can't breathe out of their mouths yet, nasal congestion can become a serious condition, especially during breastfeeding. Because you can't simply blow a newborn's nose, you'll have to clean out the mucus via other means.
 Place the infant on a flat surface, with a rolled towel beneath the shoulders to tip the head back. Place a few drops of saline solution in each nostril, and wait 30 to 60 seconds.


To make your own saline solution, mix 1/4 teaspoon salt with 1/2 cup lukewarm water.
 Turn the infant on their stomach to help the mucus drain out. You have two choices when it comes to manual removal:


Roll a tissue into a small cone, and swab it around the nostrils. Do not insert cotton swabs into an infant's nose, ever.
Use a bulb syringe or nasal aspirator to remove mucus. Push out a small portion of air, insert the aspirator into the very front portion for the nostril, and gently release the bulb. Squeeze any mucus you remove onto a tissue.
 Nasal congestion can cause serious problems in infants if it continues for too long. Get help if you notice the following symptoms:


The congestion interferes with the baby's ability to feed.
The baby has a fever.
The baby's breathing is extremely labored and fast.

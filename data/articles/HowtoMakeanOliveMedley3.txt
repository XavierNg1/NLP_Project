 You want the cream cheese to have a smooth texture. Place the cream cheese in a mixing bowl and use an electric mixer to mix the cream cheese on medium speed until it's smooth., You should use about 1/4 of a cup of black pepper, but you can use more or less depending on taste. Stir all the ingredients together using a mixing spoon until everything is mixed evenly., Heat your tortillas over the stove or in the microwave, according to the directions on the package. Spread one layer of the cream cheese/olive mixture onto the tortillas.Stack a bay leaf and a pepper on top of the tortilla.
Roll the tortillas into a tight cylinder, keeping them parallel with the pepper.
You should have about 10 servings when you're done.
 You should refrigerate your tortillas for about two hours. Wrap each tortilla in plastic individually before refrigerating., When you're ready to serve the tortillas, remove them from the refrigerator and unwrap them from the plastic wrap. Trim the edges of each roll so they're even. Then, cut them into 1/2 inch slices.

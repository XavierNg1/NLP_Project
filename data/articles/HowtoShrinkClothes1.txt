 Different fibers, like wool and cotton, have different ways of shrinking, so you will want to determine what the garment is made of before washing it. Wool, for example, is a delicate material and is very susceptible to shrinking in the dryer. Cotton, on the other hand, is tougher, and will need to be in the dryer at a higher setting. Silk will generally shrink about 8-10% in the wash.Determine whether or not the garment is pre-washed. New clothes will usually shrink on the first wash. Pre-washed clothes tend to stay the same size and may need to be altered.;
, You can do this by hand or in a washing machine.


If you decide to do it by hand, heat a pot of boiling water. Place the garment into the water and let it boil in the water for several minutes, then remove from the heat.
Donâ€™t use fabric softener., For a cotton garment, run the dryer on high heat, checking occasionally to see whether it has reached the desired size. Once it has, remove it from the dryer and allow it to air-dry to prevent further shrinking.


Leave the garment in the dryer if you want more shrinking time.
Polyester and wool garments should be dried on medium heat until they have fully dried.
 Determine whether it has reached the desired size. A benefit about fixing the size of your clothes is that you can usually shrink it further or stretch it out if you went too far.
 Do this as many times until the desired size is reached. Remember that most shrinking will happen during the first wash. If you still want the garment to be smaller, then consider getting it altered.

 Pink eye is a common cause of itchy eyes, and usually begins in only one eye (though it can spread to both). Pink eye is caused by an infection with a virus or bacteria and is contagious, so see your doctor right away if one of your eyes is itchy, red, and swollen.Symptoms of pink eye include redness, irritation or a burning sensation, discharge or a crust in your eyes, and tearing.While pink eye may only begin in one eye, it can spread to both within two to five days.
 If your doctor determines that your pink eye is caused by a bacterial infection, they may give you antibiotics. Flush your eyes with cool water before use the medication exactly as directed. Antibiotics may come as eye drops or ointment.Viral conjunctivitis, and some bacterial conjunctivitis, can get better without medication. Your doctor will help you decide what treatment is best.
Your doctor may give you antiviral eye drops if your pink eye is caused by the herpes virus.
 Don’t wear your contact lenses until your infection is completely gone, or you may spread the infection or prevent it from getting better. You may need to throw away your disposable contacts, case, or cleaning solution to prevent re-infection – ask your doctor about this. If you use non-disposable lenses, clean them thoroughly before reusing them., To soothe the itching and swelling of pink eye, make a cool compress using a clean washcloth. You can use warm water if that feels better for you. Do NOT use the same cloth on both eyes., Pink eye can be highly infectious, so to prevent spreading it to other people, you should make sure to practice safe and clean habits. Wash your hands with soap and warm water frequently. Wash all sheets, pillowcases, and towels. Do not use makeup until you are healed, and dispose of any makeup tools or brushes that may have touched the infected eye.

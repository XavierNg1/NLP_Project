 For the best flavor, you want a brisket known as the "packer's cut." This brisket still has a layer of fat across the top called the "fat cap" and good marbling or fat streaks throughout. This extra layer of fat will retain moisture and flavor while the meat cooks.








Ensure that the brisket has a "prime" or "choice" label. If you don't see this label, ask the butcher about the origin of the meat to confirm you are purchasing a quality cut.
If you'd like to make more brisket, purchase an 8 pound piece and double the seasoning recipe.;
, Use a sharp knife to trim away the excess fat from around the brisket. You could also ask the butcher for a cut that is pre-trimmed.
 Place the spices and salt in a bowl. Use a whisk to mix them together until they're thoroughly combined.
 Sprinkle half the seasoning mix over one side of the brisket and use your hands to spread it around and rub it in. Turn the brisket over and season the other side.
 Choose one with high sides, since the brisket will produce a lot of juice as it cooks.

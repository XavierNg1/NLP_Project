 The map is 'Kino Der Toten', which can be accessed by going to the main menu and selecting 'Zombies.' Then you can select whether you do this in solo, or co-op with split-screen or Xbox Live/PSN.;
, The place the glitch takes place is in the Theatre itself. To reach this, from the lobby (where you spawn) run up the stairs and on the right side there is a door (750 points) unlock this, then go through the archway and to the door next to the 'Mule Kick' machine. (1000 points) once this door is unlocked, go down into what looks like the bombed-out remnants of a bar(?) And unlock the door at the bottom of the stairs (1250 points). After this, unlock the final door into the theater (1200 points) And hit the power at the far end of the room, next to the M16 Rifle.
 Walk up to the left side of the turret and very slowly, move your character over the stairs, and if you pan the camera down to your character's 'feet', you should appear to be 'floating.' Once the Hellhound round starts, the hounds should run towards you, but stop dead and start to bark at you.

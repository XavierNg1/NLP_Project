 Use your eyes and fingers to examine the skin covering the knee. Is the skin red or hot to the touch? Also look for any bulging areas of excessive swelling. These changes are not typical of swelling you should address at home. Call your doctor to get the knee checked out.Red, warm skin can be a sign of infection.
 Standing up, bend your knee gently through its normal range of motion. If you cannot fully bend or flex the knee, or doing so causes you pain, you should call your doctor for an examination., Holding onto a chair for support, gently bear a little weight by standing on the leg with the swollen knee. If itâ€™s too painful to do or you feel your knee cannot support your weight, sit down right away. Call your doctor, who can advise if you should go to your local urgent care facility., Close your eyes and focus on your pain level. While some mild discomfort is to be expected with swelling, if your pain registers as more than a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, it may imply a more serious injury. Make an appointment with your doctor to have the knee examined., Place a thermometer underneath your tongue to check your temperature. If the final reading is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) or higher, you have a fever, which could be a sign of infection. You should make an appointment to rule out anything more serious than routine knee swelling.

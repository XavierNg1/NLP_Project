 Without a good clipper, doing undercut hair for men can be difficult. Ideally, your clipper will be a single-length clipper. But if you want to do fading and tapering, you will need a clipper that allows length adjustments.The ideal clipper to do undercut hair for men is one of high quality and high durability. An Andis cordless clipper, for instance, is a popular option. As for corded clippers, an Andis or Oster model is preferable.
With a single-length clipper, choose one that is numbered one, two, or three. You could also use a number zero, but this tends to be too short. A clipper set at four or above is usually too long, though some men might want to “test drive” an undercut by getting the short part of their hair clipped with a number four clipper.
 The temples are the corners of the forehead’s hairline, and provide an important guide when trying to do undercut hair for men. The temples sit in different locations on each person’s face.To identify a person’s temples, first locate their hairline, the place where their hair meets their forehead. You might also be able to locate the temple based on the position of the ears. The tops of the ears, traced forward to the edges of the face, typically intersect the temples.
Trace the hairline to its outer edges on the left and right side.
When you notice the hairline angle up and out, you’ve located the upper temple.
 Disconnecting the undercut refers to the process of keeping the hair that remains long on top distinct from the hair that is cut short. To do undercut hair for men, disconnect the hair at the upper temple level.Imagine, in other words, drawing a straight horizontal line around the “lid” of the head that passes through the right and left upper temple. Cutting hair below this line short and keeping hair above this line long will allow you to achieve a quality undercut for men.

 Place 1 pound (454 g) of dried elbow macaroni into an electric pressure cooker. Add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter and stir in 1 tablespoon of yellow mustard, 1 teaspoon of hot pepper sauce, 1 tablespoon of kosher salt (or 2 teaspoons table salt), and 4 cups (946 ml) of water.You can use any type of dried pasta noodle you like, as long as you have 1 pound (454 g).
 Put the lid on the pot and seal it. Turn the cooker on to high pressure and let it cook for 4 minutes. The noodles will absorb the water as they cook., Keep the lid on the pot and release the pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once the pressure is removed, you can safely take off the lid. Stir in 1 (12 ounce or 354 ml) can of evaporated milk.At this point, taste a noodle to ensure that it's cooked enough. If it's too hard for your liking, use the simmer setting on your pot to cook it for a few minutes.
 Get out 16 ounces (453 g) of shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese and 6 ounces (180 g) of shredded parmesan cheese. Add one handful of the cheese at a time and stir it in until it's completely melted. Continue to add and stir in a handful of cheese until the noodles and cheeses are combined. Serve the classic macaroni and cheese while it's hot.If you like, you can transfer the mac and cheese to a baking dish. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top and broil it for a few minutes. This will give a crunchy texture to the top.

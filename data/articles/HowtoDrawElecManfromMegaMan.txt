,, Click it. Oh by the way, this is his official pose: , If you draw Robot Masters often, get a small pile of paper, and keep your pencil sharpener with you.
 But don't add the face yet!


Don't add the face because you still need to draw the holes for the mask. Holes, as in like holes for the eyes to see through.
 (Not the lightning bolt) Fill it in with the pencil, because it's always best to fill in the dark parts while you're still drawing.


Why? Well, first of all, it's FUN, and if you're just doing a black and white drawing, it's much less of a hassle to do it WHILE you're drawing then after you're drawing.
 It's the little thing that's goes above his arms. Draw the lightning bolt, then fill the thing in with the pencil!

, He has his arm raised and one of his hands are pointing at the sky, while his other hand his making a fist. Draw that.
 They come before the minor details. Draw them.
 Minors as in like face, holes for the eyes, eyes, that sparky thing, you know.
 Color, color, color him in!

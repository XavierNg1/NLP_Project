 Then draw three furry legs, and remember to make their hands and feet pointy. Then lastly draw the body of the baby Koala add also some small furs on its left side.


For this picture, the baby Koala or the “Joey” is hanging on to its mother. So make sure the baby Koala’s body is on the back of the mother Koala.
 Sketch three circles for its eyes, an oval for its nose, a furry mustache and then smaller furry ears inside its ears for its darker fur. Do a little cleaning up by connecting your drawn shapes to each other.
, Draw the baby Koala’s left hand, keeping in that you should not make the hands pointy because they do not have claws. For the final touches, add in claws to the mother’s hands and feet and then some lines to emphasize folds on their body.
 To outline draw thick lines or use a black pen or marker on your drawing, erase also your guidelines and inside lines to make your drawing tidy and clean.

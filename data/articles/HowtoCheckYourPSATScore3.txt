 The national percentile rating gives your standing compared to everyone else who took the PSAT on the same day that you did. The number is the percent of people you made the same or a higher score than.For example, if your national percentile rating is 92nd percentile, that means you scored the same or higher than 92% of the students who took the test on that day.
You will compare yourself to the national percentile of others in your grade level. If your are younger than a sophomore, you will compare yourself to the sophomore percentile., The PSAT is used as practice for the SAT. The breakdown of the PSAT shows you which questions tested which skills and what specific areas the questions covered. The PSAT uses a green, yellow, red system to let you know your strengths and weaknesses. Your areas of strength are in green. Areas that need work are in yellow and red.This can help you figure out which areas you should focus on as you study for the SAT.
For example, you may learn that you need to focus on vocabulary, algebra, or geometry. You may also learn that you need to go through certain sections faster so you finish.
 The PSAT breakdown allows you to check which questions you got right and wrong. The PSAT test booklet will be returned to you, so you can go over questions you missed and see what the correct answer is.The report will also show you the difficulty level of the questions, along with the specific area it measures.
 The PSAT also gives you a score indicating your college and career readiness based on your PSAT performance. The bar is divided into three colors: red, yellow, and green.Red means you are not ready and need to strengthen your skills. Yellow means you are close to the benchmark but not quite there. Green means you have met or exceeded the benchmark.

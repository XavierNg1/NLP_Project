 Just because you got a photo doesn't mean you got a good one. You will have to put some effort into it.;
, Most makes of camera will have a 50mm 1.8 prime lens that is pretty affordable. If you go to f1.4, then the price will be considerably higher. You could use an older lens if you have a digital and save money, but you have to be really careful about the electronics of your camera. Better safe, than sorry.


If you do have an old 50mm (or any other short prime lens), they are great using extension tubes and/or reversal rings.
 Your goal here is to make the lens work for you, instead of reaching for a zoom or a longer lens.
 One of the great things about a 1.8 (or so) prime lens, is that it has a fairly large aperture for you to use blur (bokeh) to good effect in your shots.
 You won't learn anything with it sitting on the shelf.
 It simply will not work. Get on the ground, or at the very least, on your knees.
 MEAN to shot the photo where just about everything is blurry but that one 'thing'. Try to shoot hyperfocal shots!

, Work on your composition.
 This is when you just hit the button on your camera, shoot off a lot of shots, and pray that one will be a good one.
 You can see the shot, figure out what went wrong, and fix it.

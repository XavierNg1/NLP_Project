 To make fake bones you will need old newspapers, masking tape, sheets of plaster cloth, a gallon of water, and several tea bags. You also have the option to paint your bones if desired.;
, Roll up several pieces into a tube shape. Roll others into small balls of various sizes. Make enough newspapers balls and tubes so that the ratio is 4 newspapers to balls to every 1 tube.
 Place two newspaper balls onto each end of the tube to create the most realistic bone shape.
 Use tea bags; loose tea is not good for this project because you do not want any tea leaves to get on your finished product. The tea will be used to dye the plaster cloth used in the next step., Plaster cloth is a cloth that hardens into an outer shell when it becomes wet and is then wrapped around a surface (such as your newspaper bones.) Dipping the plaster cloth into the tea will dye the cloth a yellowish grey and will give your bones an aged look.
 Squeeze the tea out of it by running the cloth between your middle and index fingers. If your plaster cloth is too wet when applied to the newspaper, your newspaper bone might lose some of its shape.
 Start at one of the ends of the bone and work your way down to the other end. Cover the bone in plaster cloth pieces. When the bone is entirely covered, place it somewhere safe to let it dry.Small bones should take several hours to dry. Larger bones may take up to a day to dry. Test your bones for dryness by touching them. If the plaster cloth still feels wet or slightly sticky, continue to let the bones dry.
 Only do this if you do not care for the aged coloring that the dyed plaster cloth gives your bones.

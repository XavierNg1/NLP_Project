 It is best to plant the seed straight in the ground where you intend the caraway to grow. Choose seed from the nursery, or a previous crop of caraway. Sow the seed in early spring. If you live in an area where the winter is not too cold, the seed can also be sown in winter (best for tropical area growth) but doesn't tolerate winter wetness.


Sow the seeds shallowly. Keep seeds about 15–20 centimeter (5.9–7.9 in) apart. If not, thin the seedlings to the most vigorous growers.;
, Compost, rotted manure, or hay are good choices.
 Watering is most important during dry periods.
 Use a complete fertiliser in the soil on planting, then use liquid or soluble fertiliser once or twice during the growing months.
 Pick the caraway seed heads when they have ripened completely. Do not wait for the seeds to begin to fall though. Spread them on a tray or open container to dry completely with the sunshine (a windowsill is fine).


If you want to eat the leaves, pick them in early spring when they're young and palatable. Roots can also be eaten when young.
 These should be stored in airtight containers until needed. Replenish each year.


If seed is not collected, caraway will self-seed every year.
 Caraway plants die down in winter. At this point they should be cut back completely to enable them to grow back robustly next spring.

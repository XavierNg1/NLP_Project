 Your time might be short due to your family obligations, so make your time count. Enjoy your time together and do activities that you both enjoy. Discuss the important things about who you are, your family, your kids, and whatever is important to you. Do activities that are fun and meaningful to both of you.


If you’re not sure about a date or a future together, listen to your gut feelings and keep your children and their children in mind if you’re considering moving forward.
 There may be times when one of your kids is sick or your partner can’t find a babysitter. Learn to love low-key nights of watching a movie at home or going on a walk together. While it’s nice to go on dates that include dancing or adventure, learn to enjoy quiet nights at home, too.Dress your take-out dinners up by adding candles and eating with real plates and silverware.
 When both you and your partner have kids, expect the unexpected. For example, if your ex is supposed to have the kids but you’re suddenly left with them on a night you planned a date, have a list of babysitters that can come through on late notice. Have a few babysitters available so that one can cover if another is busy.


Ask your partner if they have backup plans for last-minute changes and readily available babysitters.
 Blending two families can be a stressful process, so it is important for you to practice self-care and seek help if you need it. Try to set aside at least 15 minutes every day to use a relaxation technique as well.

You can try using yoga, meditation, or deep breathing to relax.
Talk to friends and family for support. You may also consider seeing a therapist if the stress gets to be too much for you.

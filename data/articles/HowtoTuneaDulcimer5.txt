 Play the correct D note using a pitch pipe, piano, or guitar, then use the bass tuning knob on your dulcimer to adjust the bass string. Continue tuning the bass string until the sound it makes matches the D note played by your other instrument.


When using a guitar, play the D below middle C by plucking the open fourth string.
If you do not have an instrument that you can use when tuning this bass string, use your voice. Hum a natural, comfortable note and tune the string to that sound. The results may not be quite as precise, though.
Note that the Aeolian Mode is also called the "natural minor" mode. It has a tendency to "weep" and "wail," and it works well with many traditional Scottish and Irish songs.
 Produce an A note using the bass string by pressing it down a little to the left of the fourth fret and giving it a pluck. Pluck the open middle string, then adjust it using its tuning knob until you can produce that same A note.


Note that this step and the bass tuning step are essentially the same for each method described in this article.
 Press the bass string at the sixth fret and pluck it to produce a C note. Tune the melody string using the appropriate tuning knob until it produces a sound that matches this C note.


You will usually have to loosen the melody string a little when making this adjustment.
The Aeolian Mode scale begins at the first fret and runs through the eighth fret. There is one additional note on the dulcimer below this octave and many additional notes above it.

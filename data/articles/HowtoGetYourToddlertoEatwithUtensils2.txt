 When choosing a fork for your toddler, choose ones that have a wide grip handle with a rubber coating for easy grip.


Look for toddler forks with metal prongs instead of plastic ones so that you are sure that it can penetrate the food, but make sure that the prongs are blunt or rounded so it wonâ€™t be dangerous for your toddler to use.
 Show her how to poke or stab the food in her bowl. It may take some getting used to before she can really tell the difference between the fork and the spoon; this means she may try to use a fork in the same way she would use a spoon. Some foods that you can give to your child so that she can practice stabbing her food include:


Boiled or cooked vegetables like potatoes or carrots that have been cut into chunks.
Chunks of fruit like melons, apples, watermelon, or bananas.
Chunks of chicken and small cut up pieces of bread.
 Try to keep your child from getting discouraged by giving her food that is easy to eat with a fork (see the previous step). Avoid foods that are harder to eat in order to keep her positive and motivated. When your child is able to eat harder foods, make sure to praise her for her excellent work.


Noodles can be a challenging food to eat with a fork. Make sure that you are right next to your toddler to provide support and encouragement if she is eating noodles like spaghetti.

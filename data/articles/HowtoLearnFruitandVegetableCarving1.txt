 Many eastern culinary schools, gourmet Asian restaurants, and chefs host fruit and vegetable carving classes. Do an online search to find classes being held in your area. If you can’t find anything, consider taking an online course. You can either pay for a series of specialized video classes or watch free classes on Youtube.

If you have a chef friend, ask them if they have any recommendations on where to learn fruit carving.;
, You will need a paring knife, a vegetable peeler, a melon baller, a “u” shaped garnishing tool, and a “v” shaped knife.You can get several different sizes of “v” shaped knives. If you purchase a range of sizes, you will be able to make many different kinds of cuts.

These tools can be purchased at specialty cooking supply depots or online.
Purchase a knife sharpener as well. If you sharpen your knives they will create better cuts.
 Start by peeling apples, yams, cucumbers, or any other fruit or vegetable with skin. Next, practice paring fruits and vegetables to get comfortable with your paring knife. Lastly, experiment with your other tools, such as your “v” shaped knife, to figure out the different kinds of cuts you can make.

For example, the “v” shaped knife is especially good at making thin, clean grooves. If you use smooth movements, you can make straight lines or graceful curves.
When using the paring knife, practice making straight cuts and curved cuts.
 Fruit carving can be very dangerous. Always carve away from your fingers, not towards them. Sharpen your knives often to prevent them from getting stuck in thick fleshed vegetables and fruits. If they encounter too much resistance, you may apply too much pressure and accidentally cut yourself.Consider purchasing protective woodcarving gloves. These gloves will insulate your fingers against the sharp edge of a knife.
If you carve a juicy or slimy fruit or vegetable, wash the handles of your tools often. This will help prevent them from becoming too slick to use safely.

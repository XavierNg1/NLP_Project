 You will know the mother is in labor when you hear little squeaks coming from the cage. Be very careful to not intervene during this process. The mother will give birth in 10 to 30 minute intervals. Either way, it can happen quickly, or take several hours.


If you disturb the mother, this can cause her to stress and possibly harm one of her babies., The birthing process requires a lot of energy from the mother. Make sure the mother has a constant supply of water and is continually fed a high protein diet throughout the entire process.Make sure the water bottle and food bowl are easily accessible for you so you can re-supply them without disturbing the mother. Do not resupply during or right after the labor process. Wait a couple hours before checking and resupplying.
 The mother is fertile again 24 hours after birth. Therefore, for the safety of the mother and her babies, do not put other hamsters back in the cage. Generally, you want to minimize contact with the mother for up to two weeks. Hamster babies will be mature enough to leave their mother at three to four weeks of age.


If you keep the babies longer than four weeks, make sure to remove the babies from the mother before eight weeks of age. Remove the babies into gender specific living groups, unless you want an explosion of hamster babies.At eight weeks, the hamsters will be able to reproduce and could possibly reproduce with the mother.

 Avoid overcomplicated slides that could distract the audience away from your intention. If you have a lot to say or show for one slide, stretch out the content over a few slides. If you are only using pictures in your slideshow, use one centered picture for each slide. If you have text and pictures, be sure to have plenty of white or negative space. Negative space allows the content to breath and will draw the audience in easier.


Limit the number of bullet points per slide. Don’t force people to read a lot while listening to you speak. In general, avoid being text heavy in your slides.Limit the number of words for each bullet. If a bullet has two or more lines of words, there are too many words for that bullet.
 When using digital photos it is a good rule to never “break” the image. Breaking an image means stretching it along the vertical or horizontal axis alone, or stretching a small image larger.Poor image resolution can detract from your slideshow by straining your audience.
 Creating a logistical flow is important in slideshows. There should always be some type of narrative even in photo-based slideshows.Think of it like a story or essay where the slideshow has a beginning, middle, and conclusion.


When sorting through your slides you can also decide if you want to break up any slides that are packed with content.
 Let the slides communicate with each other instead of clashing against each other. Use the same typography, colors, and imagery throughout your slides. Using a template can help keep a consistent flow. Templates can also become restrictive, so be sure to add your own message and creativity.

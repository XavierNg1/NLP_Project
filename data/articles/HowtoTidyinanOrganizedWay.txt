 What do you need to clean? Is it just a desk space, or is it multiple rooms? This can help you figure out how to plan your tidy-ing, like how much time you need.;
, For example, if you're cleaning your room, then you could separate it into desk, closet, bookshelf, bed and dresser. Also, if you have a messy floor, you should add that as a part to clean, too.
 If you're doing a bathroom deep-clean, you'll need cleaning tools like spray cleaner and a sponge. If your room is dusty, then you'll need a broom or a vacuum cleaner. If there's something you enjoy doing while you work that calms you down or lets you have fun while working, like music, then set it up. Whatever you do should not distract you from the task ahead.
 Decide how much time you need to spend cleaning, out of the time you have free. I'd suggest to try to get the job done in a day, because if you stretch it out for a long time chances are you'll forget about it eventually. Breaks should be placed in between work periods, and should be about 15 minutes long. Work periods should be 30 minutes to an hour long.
 You're ready to start.
 After a minute or so, start on a task that is pretty easy to get yourself started. For example, if your bed isn't made, do that first.
 As you do tasks, try to clean up each area well instead of pushing the mess into another area. If you do that, the mess will be infinite.
 Take breaks every once in a while, but don't make them too long. Keep yourself well fed so that you don't lose energy while cleaning. try to alternate from a hard cleaning task to an easy one. When you finish each task, cross it of a checklist or off of your map. If you want to move furniture around, feel free, because that can make room for other furniture, like a cozy reading corner or a window seat.
 Hopefully, you've finished, and most likely, it was worth it!

, It will feel good.
 But don't forget to clean up after yourself.

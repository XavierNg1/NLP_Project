 When you determine that you would like to remove or reduce your facial hair, consider consulting with your physician. They should be able to recommend and discuss various options, as well as provide warnings regarding the risks.
 Each of the above procedures has associated risks. Before undergoing any, it is a good idea to consult with your doctor about those associated health risks. For example, electrolysis cannot be used if you have a pacemaker.
 You and your doctor will also need to consider underlying health conditions. There are a number of conditions, some benign and easy to treat while others can be more worrying, which can cause more hair growth or hair growth in unusual areas.


Hormone fluxes, which can cause changes like these, are associated with age (making young teen girls and older women more prone to this problem).
Hair changes can also be caused by tumors in the glands which control hormones or in response to pregnancy or certain medications.
Look out for other symptoms associated with hormone disorders (like irregular periods, weight gain, acne, or hair loss). Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormone condition that affects up to 10% of women and is a cause of unwanted hair (also known as hirsutism). Medicines used in the treatment of PCOS can significantly improve excess hair problems.

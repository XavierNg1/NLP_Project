 If you have harvested your own ginseng root, wash it as soon after harvest as possible. Fill a bowl or bucket with water. Gently dip and swish the root in the water. Leave it out to air-dry away from sunlight.Do not scrub or roughly wash the ginseng, as this might break the fragile skin.
 Ginseng that has been steamed before being dried is called red ginseng whereas white ginseng has only been dried, not steamed. If you want red ginseng, then you should steam the root for one to three hours.You can use a pot and a vegetable steamer basket, but make sure that there is enough water to steam the root for the proper amount of time.
This step is optional. If your recipe calls for white ginseng, go straight to drying out the root.
 To dry the roots, place a rack or screen in a drying box or closet. Place the roots on the screen, making sure that they do not touch one another. Keep the temperature at 90–95 °F (32–35 °C) for two weeks. Do not use an oven, microwave, or window to dry the roots, as these may dry them out too quickly. Keep the roots away from the sun as you dry them.
Because ginseng roots must dry slowly over two weeks, you should not use your oven. Instead, you can use a a special herb dehydrator. This box will dry your roots out at a low, consistent temperature.

 A south-facing window typically works best. Basil thrives in full sun but needs at least six hours of sunlight a day to grow properly.
 If you cannot provide enough natural sunlight for your basil, use fluorescent grow lights or specially designed high-intensity lights instead. Basil plants receiving no natural light should receive 10 to 12 hours of artificial light.


Keep standard fluorescent lights a couple of inches (5 centimeters) away from the tops of your plants, and keep high output and compact fluorescent lamps 1 foot (1 yard) above the plants.
High-intensity lights should be two to four feet (61 to 122 centimeters) above plants.
 Direct an electric fan toward the plant, allowing it to rustle the leaves for at least two hours a day. Doing this prevents the air around the plant from getting too stagnant.
 A good pH level is usually between 6.0 and 7.5. Maintain this pH with an organic fertilizer. Since basil is primarily used for culinary purposes, many non-organic fertilizers may pose a potential risk.
 Test the dampness by sticking your finger into the soil about an inch (2.5 centimeters) deep. If the soil feels dry even at this depth, lightly water the plant.
 Pinching the tops off will encourage better leaf growth and will prevent your basil from becoming "leggy."

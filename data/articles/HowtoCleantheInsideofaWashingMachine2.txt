 The easiest way to do this is to turn on the hot wash cycle and interrupt it after the water has been filled. You could also heat up water in the kitchen and transfer it to the machine.
 Turn the washing cycle on for a few seconds to let so that the agitation function mixes the bleach and the water, then turn it back off and let the chlorine mixture sit for at least an hour. This will start lifting the grime, mildew and other substances inside your washing machine.


If you'd prefer not to use bleach, you can use a special machine cleaner instead. These are available for purchase at grocery stores in the detergent aisle.
For a natural alternative, add a quart of white vinegar instead of bleach or cleaner.
 After an hour, let the machine complete the washing cycle. At this point the inside of the machine is sanitized.


If the machine smells like bleach once the cycle is complete, fill it with hot water and pour in a quart of vinegar. Let it sit for an hour, then run the washing cycle once more.
 Use a vinegar water solution and a scrubber to clean the places where you insert powdered or liquid detergent. Dirt, hair, and other debris tends to pile up there, so cleaning these areas is an important part of keeping the inside clean, too.

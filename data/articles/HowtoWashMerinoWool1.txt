 Merino wool requires a very gentle washing liquid that will prevent bleeding of its color or damage to its fine fibers. Pick a shampoo, soap, or detergent that’s especially formulated for wool, like Woolite or Laundress Wool & Cashmere Shampoo.Never use fabric softeners or products with bleach in them on wool.
In a pinch, you can use a mild soap with a neutral pH, like a clear, fragrance-free dishwashing fluid for sensitive skin.;
, Measure out your wool wash soap according to the guidelines on its packaging. Add it to a basin with enough warm water to cover your garments.The water should be between 30 and 40 degrees C (about 85-100 degrees F).
If you have a really large Merino wool product, consider washing it in your bathtub or using a “soak” setting on your washing machine so that you have a big enough basin.
 Completely submerge your Merino wool garment in the water, and let it soak for 3 to 5 minutes. Then, swish the water through the wool garment slowly and gently for about one minute.Don’t let your wool soak for more than a handful of minutes since doing so can warp the fibers.
 Rinse your wool several times with a gentle stream of warm water to get the detergent out. Keep rinsing it until the water runs mostly clear of suds.Make sure that your rinse water is the same temperature as the water in which you soaked your Merino wool.
 Take the garment and squeeze it to get as much water out as possible.Do not twist or wring your Merino wool to drain the water.

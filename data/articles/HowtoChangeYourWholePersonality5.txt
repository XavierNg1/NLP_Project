 Alright, so clothes don't make the man, but they can help put you in the right mindset. Though this by no means changes your personality, it may help serve as a reminder to you of the person you are trying to become.


This can be as small as wearing a hat. If there is something that, to you, is indicative of this new person, keep it on your radar. You'll be more likely to stay in tune with yourself to reduce cognitive dissonance.
 The clothes and thought patterns may not be enough. Think about what this new person would do and do it. Would they seek out social interaction? Shun social media? Read The Economist? Whatever it is, do it.


You don't have to stay big -- the small things work too. Would she carry around a pink purse? Would he listen to a specific band? Get into character as much as possible.
 Now that you're picking up these new habits and probably these new friends and routines, you may feel a little jostled. What's important now is to embrace yourself, whatever and wherever you are. Sink your nails in and decide that you're staying.


Uprooting yourself psychologically is risky. If you've succeeded, you may need time to feel like you're truly "you." Relax. This feeling will come as long as you keep this desire close to your well-being.
 Did you really achieve what you wanted to achieve? Do other people think more positively about you now that you act and wear different? Are you willing to sacrifice yourself for a fake imitation of the ideal person?

Some people will decide that what they need is not a personality change, but an acceptance of who they are and a willingness to try to improve themselves instead of a full personality makeover but its up to you to make that personal choice. Make sure you are doing this for all the right reasons.

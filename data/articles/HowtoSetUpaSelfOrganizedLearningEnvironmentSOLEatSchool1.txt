 In class, students can sometimes be worried that they might ask a "stupid question". This can stifle learning if children are worried that their peers and teacher are judging them unfairly for a dumb question. As a teacher, you can show that there is never such a thing as a stupid question, and you can help children to see that it is often the person who has the courage to ask a question who is able to get answered what everyone else was wondering!


Have a class discussion about the worth of asking questions. Ask them how they feel about asking questions, who they are most likely and least likely to ask questions around, and why. This will help them to explore what may be holding them back from asking questions in different situations of their life.






Lead discussions by asking questions and getting class participants to do the same with each other.
Invite your class to be a question zone, one where nobody's question is ever ridiculed.
Help class participants to formulate questions themselves. Some of the participants may have a difficult time with question asking as a skill, so it's useful to give them the tools to do this.;
, Once a week, choose a one hour period during which SOLE activities are pursued as part of the usual coursework. The activities can even be based around existing coursework obligations that if that assists you with finding the space for it.


The SOLE activity will require about an hour to complete, although the first session may take a little longer due to you needing to explain what SOLE activities are about.

 This is the most polite way to avoid the conversation about religion. If someone brings it up, follow up with something unrelated without being too obvious.Try to raise questions that lead the other person to talk about different things you appear interested in.For example, imagine Cousin Marty says something like “Kids these days just aren't going to church. It's all that rock and roll they're listening to. Right?”
You could follow up with “Speaking of kids, I've been meaning to ask: how’s your daughter doing at college?”;
, If you know that you'll be talking to people who like to bring up religion, take charge and steer the conversation elsewhere. By being preemptive, you can stop the awkward conversation before it even begins.Be prepared with a few neutral conversation starters, like "So what did you all think of the last Game of Thrones episode?" or "Anyone have travel plans for the summer?"
Whenever you're around the person who likes to talk about religion, just lead with one of these neutral topics.
 Bringing someone new into the conversation can lead to a natural shift in topic. If someone won't drop the topic of religion, having a buffer also means you won't be stuck alone in an awkward situation.You can make the shift suddenly, like “Hey, isn't that Pam over there? Let's catch up with her! Hey Pam! Over here!”
Try to have a friend or ally be your buffer. They'll probably pick up on what's going on and try to help out.
 Sometimes not saying anything at all is the best way to get a point across. If someone brings up religion in an uncomfortable way, look at them and say nothing. It takes a little nerve, but hold the silence for a few seconds and then shift to a neutral topic. This should signal clearly that it's not an appropriate time to discuss religion.

 If you aim to do a video review like on TGWTG, you can get a video camera or webcam so that you can do reviews.;
, Before you can start filming a review of your own, think about what you want to review. It can be any book, movie or TV show you know of.
 Sometimes footage is used in reviews as it helps tell what it is, so getting footage from the movie, game or show you're reviewing will help with the review.
 Most Internet reviewers tend to do their reviews straight from their own rooms, now this is entirely optional, and you can do it outside as well if you like, but it's all about location.
 Before you can start filming, you need to pick out what kind of clothes you are going to wear. You don't have to look your best, but picking out an outfit that you like really helps.
 It is important that you get things sorted out for the review, so make sure everything is neat and tidy.
 To make sure that things go well for the review, remember to do some research on what you're reviewing to get 'psyched' up for it.
 Once you've got things set up, it's time to start filming the review, remember to speak clearly and to look directly at the camera when you're doing your review as it helps.
 You are free to add your own little sense of humor in there and you can put in as many jokes as you like, just steer clear of any jokes that are in bad taste or outdated meme references.
 You can do it character like on That Guy With The Glasses, or you can just be yourself, either way you are sure to have a lot of fun with your review.
 Once your review is finished, register on sites like that guy with the glasses or cinemassacre and once you're registered, put your reviews up on there and just have fun.

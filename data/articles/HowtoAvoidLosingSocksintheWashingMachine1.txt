 Use safety pins, clothespins, or just roll each sock pair together to keep them from drifting apart. Secure socks to their matches from the moment you take them off until they’re out of the dryer. At that point, take the clip or pin off and roll them into each other.


Keep a safety pin on one of the socks while you wear it so that later you can quickly pin it to its pair and throw it in the dirty laundry with ease.;
, If you don’t mind having all of your socks look the same, this is a good option that simplifies the sock washing process. Having them all look the same might cramp your style, and it doesn’t necessarily prevent sock loss, but it will save you from a lot of mismatch frustration., While this isn’t a sure solution, it’s probably the easiest habit to get into to keep your socks from wandering away. Before you fold and hang up your shirts, pants, and other large clothing items, sort through the socks and match them to their pairs.

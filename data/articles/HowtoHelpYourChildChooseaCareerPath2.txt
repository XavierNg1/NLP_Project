 Use the skills and interests that you identified with your child to guide your research. Include things like salary range, benefits package, and typical work schedule for each profession you research. You can find information about different career fields online, at career fairs, and by consulting professionals and companies in that field., Ask your child where they would like to live as an adult. Your career often dictates where you will be living. If location is important to your child they need to understand what their career options are in that particular location. The amount of travel you do for family, business, or vacation will also be heavily influenced by your career choices.


For example, a marine biologist is likely to live near an ocean. A coal miner does not typically reside in New York City.
 Common careers such as teachers, doctors, and lawyers are discussed frequently. Many children will have no interest in these fields, and should be exposed to newer or more unique fields. Science and technology fields are changing every day, as are the arts. Be open to looking at nontraditional careers as well as the tried and true careers.For example, the internet has given rise to a huge demand for bloggers. This profession did not even exist a hundred years ago, but it is now a viable way to make a living.
 You can find professionals in almost any field in the phonebook or online. Contact them and see if they would be willing to meet with your child. A first hand account is often more telling than the research statistics you find online. Have your child request a meeting with them and set out a list of questions to ask them. Some examples might be:What does their day-to-day work schedule look like?
What sort of education or training did they need to qualify for this position?
What is the typical pay for this profession?
Do they enjoy their work?

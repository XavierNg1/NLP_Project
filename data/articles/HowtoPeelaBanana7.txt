 When you're holding it correctly, you should place it down on a cutting board as it is.
 Use one quick swift cut of the knife to slice off the ends of each side of the banana.
 Be careful when you're doing this. Cut the banana peel gently so you don't slice through it or hurt the hand that is holding on to it. Once you cut it, just peel back the skin.
 This method works great if you're planning on slicing the banana to use it in a salad, or if you just like eating a banana without a peel.

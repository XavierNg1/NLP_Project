 To do so, either click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen or press the âŠž Win key.


On Windows 8, you'll instead hover the mouse cursor in the upper-right corner of the screen, then click the magnifying glass icon.;
, Doing so will bring up a list of matching programs, one of which is the Firewall itself.
 It should be the top result.
 This link is in the top-left side of the Firewall window.
 It's in the upper-right side of the window, just above the list of programs on your computer.


You may have to click Yes on a pop-up window after doing this before you can continue.
If you don't have administrator privileges on your computer, you won't be able to do this.
 The list of programs in the middle of the page displays all programs that Firewall is either blocking or allowing; you can scroll down it to find your specific program.


If you can't find the program you want to block, click Add another program and select the program from the resulting pop-up window.
 Doing so should remove the checkmark, thereby blocking the program through Firewall.


If there is no checkmark to the left of the program, Windows Firewall is already blocking the program.
Leave the two checkboxes to the right of the program ("Home/Work (Private)" and "Public") alone.
 It's at the bottom of the window. This will both save your changes and prevent the program from running on your computer.

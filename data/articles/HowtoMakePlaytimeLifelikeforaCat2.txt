Try a cat tree, or hang shelves on your wall that your cat can walk across. You can also encourage your cat to climb on existing furniture., It is important that your cat has lots of space to chase and play with its toys. Before playtime, try clearing a large space in your home like the living room floor. Remove any breakable furnishings or decorations.

 Pugs can be difficult to train. This is because they are strong willed rather than stupid. In fact, you could say they are highly intelligent because they work out what they want and then go ahead and do it regardless of your opinion. This does not mean you should give up on training, but just be extra patient and be prepared to put in the hours.Thoroughly acquaint yourself with recommended training techniques such as reward-based training. Getting you pug onside with rewards and then getting him to work for those rewards is what will crack the training in the end.
 If your pug isn't allowed on the furniture, make sure every member of the family applies this rule under all circumstances, even on the weekend. A pug given inconsistent instruction will select the version it prefers and inconsistency will make the training even harder.
 Pugs have a reputation for taking longer than other breeds to be housetrained. Crate training and using positive reinforcement may help you to housetrain your pug a bit faster.

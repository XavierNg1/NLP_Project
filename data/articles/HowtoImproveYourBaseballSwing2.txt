 Make sure they are moving in a slight downward motion, don't swing "uppercut". You will achieve it up 90 percent of the time.
 That is where the ball will travel fastest off the bat.
 You need to see where you need to make contact and where the ball is. Also you need to see the spin of the ball, to know if it will break.

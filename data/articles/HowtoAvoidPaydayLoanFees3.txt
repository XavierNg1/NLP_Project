 The best way to avoid payday loan fees and expensive interest rates is to find other ways to handle a short-term need for money.


Network with existing creditors. Before taking out a payday loan to meet the bills that are due at any given time, call each one of your creditors and ask about possible extensions that don't involve extremely high interest rates or extra fees. Often, unless they are totally maxed out on their credit, families can negotiate extensions on rent, utilities or some other costs.
Consider informal loans, small business loans, micro-lending and other forms of lending. Almost any other kind of loan will be much less expensive than a payday loan. Some of these loans are harder to apply for, and harder to get, but the end result will be less cost.
 Local counseling services can help consumers deal with short-term debt or long-term debt by offering practical solutions.


Make sure the credit counseling services are legitimate. Some predatory lending businesses dress themselves up as counseling services in order to offer debt consolidations that may only be scams. Get the details about how a third party will help you with your debt before handing over money or following other instructions.
 One of the ways that payday loan companies get customers is to reach out and grab them with flashy advertisements. Teaching yourself to follow what's behind an advertisement, rather than just responding to it, will help you avoid payday loan fees and other expensive services that are advertised through mass media.

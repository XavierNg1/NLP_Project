 You can find it at: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc.
 Enter "www.youtube.com" (without quotes) after all the IP addresses.
 Enter Ctrl + S, or go to File and select Save.
 Add a space or tab to the end of each IP address, then enter a name you want to use to reference this site. Use a name that firewalls won't have on their blacklists (blocked sites). Your new line should look like: 47.125.31.113 www.youtube.com

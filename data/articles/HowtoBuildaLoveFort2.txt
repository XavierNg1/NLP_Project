 For this love fort, the basic items you will need include: a bed, old curtains, twine and thumbtacks. You can also supplement your fort with additional decorations, like twinkle lights or candles.You can build this love fort alone to surprise your significant other.
You can also build your fort together as part of a romantic date night.
 Measure out your twine: each piece should be long enough to string over your bed and attach to both walls. Secure your twine to both walls using thumbtacks.If you have a four poster bed, the twine should hang just inches above the top of each post.
If your bed does not have a headboard or posts, the twine should be high enough that both people could sit upright in bed.
 Drape the curtains over the top of the twine. The curtains should be pulled taut, so the fabric creates a canopy over the top of the bed. It’s fine if the curtains drape a little, but if they drape too much, you may want to add additional twine to support them.If you have extra blankets and sheets lying around, throw them on the bed to make a cozy love nest.
If you don’t have curtains, you can also make this fort using a sheet.
 Sprinkle rose petals on the bed and create a trail of rose petals leading from the front door. Add a tray of champagne or wine and a plate of your favorite treats to eat in bed.Dim the lights and scatter lit candles around the room to create some added ambiance.
If you have a television in your bedroom, pop in your favorite romantic movie and cuddle up for a night of love.

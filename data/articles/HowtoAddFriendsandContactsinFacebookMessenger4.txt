 Messenger allows you to send Facebook messages to anyone on your Facebook friends list, even if they aren't using Messenger. The messages you send will appear as standard Facebook messages for people not using Messenger.
 Facebook offers much more advanced search functions than the Messenger app. Every friend that you add in Facebook can be contacted through Messenger.


You can search Facebook based on location, shared interests, and more. See Find People on Facebook for tips on finding people through Facebook's search features.

This should free the tile from other tiles. , The best way to avoid asbestos fibers filling the air is to do as little damage as possible to each tile. Use the hammer and chisel to pry the tile up from the bottom. Try not to break the tile as you lift it away from the floor., The adhesive that binds the tile to the floor may also contain asbestos.

 Almond milk can be drunk in the same way as milk. It can usually be found in 3 flavors: plain, vanilla and chocolate. The plain variety can be sweetened or unsweetened. Manufacturers recommend shaking the container of almond milk prior to drinking it as there may be some settlement at the bottom. Almond milk, in any flavor, can also be added to coffee or tea, just like normal milk or cream.;
, Almond milk can be used in smoothies instead of traditional dairy products. Simply combine fruit (frozen is best) and the almond milk in a blender and pulse it until it is combined. You can adjust the amount of almond milk to make your smoothie more or less thick.

Add 1-2 de-seeded dates (to your taste; the dates can be replaced with honey, if preferred).
Add 2 drops of vanilla essence (extract).
Add a dessert spoon of fresh cream (optional).
Blend all ingredients for few seconds. Pour the drink into a glass.
Add a pinch of saffron (kesar) on top (just a very very little because it's a very strong flavoring agent), to give it a delicious flavor.


Note: It is better to blend the dates alone first and then add the other ingredients, as dates may not crush up well when blended along with the milk.

 If your ingrown hair scars are severe or if they do not respond to treatment, then you should make an appointment to see a dermatologist. A dermatologist can examine your ingrown hair scars and determine the best treatment options for you.
 If your ingrown hair scars do not respond to natural remedies and over-the-counter treatments, then you may want to look into laser filler treatments. A few treatment sessions with a fractionated laser can help to even out the surface of your skin and encourage collagen production, which will help fill in any pitted areas. Other types of laser and filler treatments include:Ablative lasers. This type of laser treatment will flatten and smooth the surface of your skin.

Non-ablative lasers. This type of laser treatment will leave the surface of your skin as it is, but they will encourage collagen growth to help improve the appearance of your skin.

Filler injections. You can also get injections of collagen in conjunction with a laser treatment to help improve the appearance of scars, but you will need to repeat these injections every four to six months to maintain the results.

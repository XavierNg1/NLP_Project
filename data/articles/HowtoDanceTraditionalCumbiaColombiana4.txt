 As with the basic partner dance, the leader steps back on his or her right foot while the follower steps back on his or her left.


Continue holding hands as you step back.
 The leader lets go of the follower’s right hand and uses his or her left hand to guide the turn.
 The leader gently pulls the follower forward on his or her right foot. The follower plants his or her right foot, which he or she will turn on.


Almost simultaneously the leader also lifts the follower’s right hand and arm to begin the turn.
 As the leader turns the follower, he or she steps forward and to the side on his or her left foot and completes the turn, bringing them to neutral.


The count is 1 when they both step back, 2 when the follower steps forward and the turn begins, 3 when the leader steps forward and to the side to complete the turn, and 4 when they come back together to neutral.

 Hopefully, the pilots or one of the flight attendants will notice your child's curiosity and invite them to peek around the cockpit.;
, Don't make the flight attendants suspicious. Ask for permission to see the cockpit if you're not invited in.


Success generally depends on the proximity to the departure time. The closer to that time, the busier the pilots are and often cannot afford a visit. However, many pilots welcome the opportunity to have kids visit and to answer questions. Aviation is in their blood, and most pilots love to share their professional passion.
 Ask him or her politely, "Hi, I'm very interested in aviation. Do you mind if I step into the flight deck and say hello to the pilots?" Make sure you ask the flight attendant and do not just step into the flight deck. Although not illegal, it will not put you in the good graces of the cabin crew.
 As mentioned before, if the time is close to departure or the pilots are behind schedule you may not get a productive visit. Don't take this personally - wait until the flight is over and then ask to visit.
 If they are, it's best to wait until they are done. These tasks are very important and generally need to progress uninterrupted. When the pilots are done with their chores, knock on the door and say politely something like, "Hi, I'm really interested in aviation. Do you mind if I look around/ask a few questions?" Most, if not all pilots, will happily answer questions or show you the airplane if time permits.
 The procedure is the same.

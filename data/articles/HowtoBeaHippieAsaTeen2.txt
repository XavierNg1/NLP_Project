 Not all hippies are vegan or vegetarian, but being a hippie means having respect for your own body and this begins with the food you eat.Avoid processed foods like fast food or microwaveable dinners, and try to eat more vegetables and fresh fruit.


Have a conversation with your parents about making healthier food choices, and explain how natural and healthy eating is important to you.
You can join a local food co-op if you are struggling to find healthy food in your area, or your parents refuse to buy healthy foods.
Growing fresh herbs or vegetables in a garden is a good idea if you want to regularly eat like a hippie.
Pack your lunch instead of buying processed food at the school cafeteria.
 Hippies originated the pro-earth movement, and created Earth Day in 1970.Try volunteering at a local environmental activism nonprofit in your area, or donate to an environmental cause if you have extra money.


On the first Earth Day, 20 million Americans participated in peaceful demonstrations across the U.S.Your local community center will probably have opportunities to volunteer in a garden.
 Hippies aren’t bothered by everyday problems like other people are. Instead of ruminating on the negative, hippies always try to see the positive in every situation.


Being a pacifist and practicing non-violence is also another hippie belief.
If you’re the type to get worked up emotionally during conflict, practice meditating or doing yoga.
 Take every opportunity to attend outdoor festivals and talk to other hippies. Search the web for festivals happening around you, and ask your parents if you can attend. See if any of your friends want to go with you, so you don’t have to go alone.


There are different kinds of outdoor festivals including music festivals, outdoor film festivals, and art festivals.Make sure to check if the festival is for your age. Many of them are 18 or 21 and over.

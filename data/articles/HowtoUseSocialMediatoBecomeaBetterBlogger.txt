 Any social media that you subscribe to allows you to 'reach out and touch' people you don't even know. You can ask for ideas, thoughts, and opinions, and are pretty sure to get them.;
, This will give you plenty of fodder for topics and writing.
 At least the title. Use it for grabbing interest. A lot of the social media limits what you can put in all at once, so that helps you keep it short.
 Use your skill with interest grabbing titles and 'tweet' it, or 'like' it, or whatever else you like.
 There is lots of software out there that will allow you to keep current in a banner.
 Watch your contributions from others and your vocabulary will improve. Look up those words you are unsure about.
 Use your social media network to find other bloggers. Become part of their network and learn from them!

, Think two or three times before hitting the enter key.
 Ask for topic ideas, for ways to flesh out an existing article, etc.
 There are a lot of people out there with something to say, so encourage them to say it!

, Get the word out. Good work speaks for itself, but social media helps you to get others to find it!

, Having trouble coming up with something to write about...cruise the social media and check out trending topics!

, Use the social media to 'keep you honest'. If you have an audience, you are more likely to keep everything current.
 Knowing that you are liable to get a lot of views quicker should give you that extra encouragement to make sure your I's are dotted and your T's are crossed!

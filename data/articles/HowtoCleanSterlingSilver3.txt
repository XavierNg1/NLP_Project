 While the water is coming to a boil, line a glass or ceramic baking dish with aluminum foil. Make sure the shiny side of the aluminum foil is facing up., Then slowly add Â½ cup (4.06 oz) of white vinegar. You want to add the vinegar slowly because it will cause the baking soda to fizz. Once all the vinegar is in, mix the ingredients together until well-combined.Make sure the salt is completely dissolved. If not, the granules may scratch your silver.
 Then carefully place each piece of silver into the baking dish. Make sure they are lying flat and are not overlapping. Let the silver sit in the baking dish for 5 to 10 minutes. Use salad tongs to rotate and flip the pieces of silver to make sure each side is exposed to the aluminum foil., Place each piece on a clean cloth to cool. Then rinse each piece one by one with warm water. Use a soft, cotton cloth to dry the pieces of silver.Make sure to thoroughly dry pieces of silver that contain small crevices and etchings.
 Do not polish your silver with other types of fabric since these may scratch your silver. Remember that you can use nitrile gloves to avoid smudging while drying and polishing your pieces of silver.

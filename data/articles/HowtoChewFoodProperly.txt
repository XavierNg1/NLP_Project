 Do not eat while you are in a rush. Instead, allow yourself enough time so that you can take your time and chew thoroughly. Manage your time so you are not in a hurry.;
, It is important not to put too much in your mouth at once, as this makes it more difficult to chew the food thoroughly. The smaller the bites, the better.
 Although the exact number of chews vary with the texture of the food and the salivary glands of the person, the food should be a complete liquid and lose all texture.
 Do not gulp an entire mouthful of food down your throat at once. This can cause choking or damage to the esophagus.
 Give yourself enough time to let the food pass through your esophagus before putting more in your mouth. It is helpful to put your knife and fork down in between bites to avoid this.

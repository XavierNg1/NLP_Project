 For this recipe, you’ll need 2 lbs (907 g) of sweet potatoes (roughly 2 large ones), 8 ounces (227 g) of yellow potatoes (approximately 1 medium-size potato), and 8 ounces (227 g) of kale leaves. Wash them all under running water to remove any dirt and trace chemicals. Then peel the potatoes and cut them into roughly 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes. Next, if using fresh kale, remove the leaves from the stems and chop them into bite-size pieces., Place them into a large pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover them. Place the pot on your stovetop’s burner and turn the heat to medium-high. To bring the water to a boil faster, cover the pot. Once the water begins to boil, remove the lid and cook uncovered for an additional ten minutes, or until the potatoes turn tender. Then transfer to a strainer in the sink to drain the water. Leave them there for now., Return the empty pot to the stovetop. Add ½ cup (118 ml) of whole milk and ½ cup (118 ml) of heavy cream. Then stir in your kale, plus 10.4 ounces of Boursin cheese (295 g). Turn the burner to medium heat. Once the mixture begins to boil, lower the heat to simmer and cover the pot. Cook for roughly 5 minutes, or until the kale wilts and turns tender. Stir in ½ teaspoon of salt and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper and then remove the pot from the hot burner., Return the potatoes to the pot. Use a potato masher to mash them into your cheese mixture. As you do, add more milk as desired if the texture appears drier than you’d like. Taste for salt and pepper and add more if you feel it needs it, then serve.

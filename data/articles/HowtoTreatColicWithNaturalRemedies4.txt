 Some babies may need background noise to avoid overstimulation. If you introduce a series of songs you play each time they get fussy, this will allow them to become familiar with the noises and the routine of listening to them. You can even sing along while you hold your baby against your chest so they can benefit from the noise and the vibration of your voice., Music may be too much for some babies, and you may get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again. Household products can provide you with alternatives, although you may need help to run the vacuum.Donâ€™t put your baby on top of the dryer, even in their carrier. The vibration may cause the carrier to fall off the appliance.
 If you cuddle your baby close to the crook of your neck while speaking to them in low, soothing tones, your baby can both feel and hear your voice. This is especially effective for dads, whose deeper voices cause more vibrations., Your baby may be contrary and crave silence rather than noise. Give your baby a calming environment by keeping the room dark and quiet while you simply hold them. Your baby may need a break from motion as well.

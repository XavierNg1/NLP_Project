 Look for a short back, medium-length neck, proportional head, and friendly expression. Remember that things like a pretty tail or a nice color aren't important; however, don't buy a horse with an appearance that your child honestly dislikes.
 Ask him these questions:


Is the horse vice-free? (Vices include nipping, cribbing, chewing on wood, kicking, etc.)
Is he easy to catch and trailer?
Is he easy to walk, trot, and canter?
Is he sound, and does he have a history of lameness? (Sound means he isn't lame.)
What's his health history? (Verify this with the horse's veterinarian.)
Does he spook or shy?
Why are you selling him? (This should not be because of behavior or health issues.)

, Watch him carefully - does he spook, nip, or seem high-strung? Ask the owner if the horse has any ticklish places.
 Again, watch carefully for spooking or a high-strung nature. Does he throw his feet up high? Does the owner look uncomfortable? Look for a horse that quietly walks, trots, canters, and gallops, and who doesn't spook. Once the owner has rode the horse, your child can. Ask her if she feels comfortable and safe on the horse. If she doesn't, don't buy him.
 It's also possible that the owner will want to lease the horse to you. If you aren't experienced with horses, bring along someone who is to make sure the deal is fair.
 It's also wise to bring along your child's riding instructor, if she has one. Have the veterinarian give the horse an examination to check for health, and the instructor watch your child riding the horse to ensure a good match.

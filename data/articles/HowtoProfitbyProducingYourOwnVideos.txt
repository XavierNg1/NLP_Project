 There is an almost unlimited opportunity to produce videos because almost any area of interest can have a demand for videos. One of the best kinds of videos to produce are instructional videos. Because people are buying the information, the quality of the video doesn’t have to be like a Hollywood movie. It can’t look like you shot it in your garage with your camcorder and edited it on your VHS player, but it doesn’t have to look like a broadcast television show.;
, But, if you don’t want to be on camera yourself or don’t feel that you have the knowledge to create a video, it’s no problem. All you have to do is hire someone that does have the skills or knowledge.
 If you don't own your own equipment you can start out by renting although these days you can buy mini DV cameras so cheaply it frequently makes sense to buy a cheap one to start. Then, if you decide to really grow the business you can buy a more expensive professional camera.
 You can also buy software these days that is very reasonable that will allow you to edit your video on your home computer although you may want to buy an external drive to store the video because it is a lot of data. If you don't feel comfortable editing it yourself, you can always do your first one by hiring someone to edit. In most areas you can find someone who is qualified for between $50-$100 an hour. Once you have a finished master, you can either have a duplicating house make copies or if you want to do small numbers you can do it yourself with some very inexpensive programs.
 The first thing to do is of course create a web page that sells the DVD. There are many ways to market your website including banner ads, e-zine marketing, pay per click advertising and several other types. In addition, you could also place ads in print publications that cater to the area of interest for your video.

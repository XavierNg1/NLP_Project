 If you’ve purchased your flowers have a staging area so they can stay fresh in water. Complete any trimming or pruning so all you will need to do is transfer the waiting flowers to prepared cans., Perform this step carefully as you will need to make sure you don’t scratch or dent the cans.


Scrub any remaining glue from the label that may still be on the can. Use mild soap and warm water to gently remove any leftover glue.
 Don’t throw away contents but instead find another receptacle or container for the goods/coffee. Also, if you are throwing a party, consider using the coffee or can contents in your meal plan.
 Don’t soak or allow the cans to linger in the water as they could rust. Dry with a clean towel and set aside.
 You may want to either measure or simply cut an extra long strand.
 Center the bow in the middle of the can.
 Add a dash of 7-Up to extend the flower’s life.
 Arrange and position flowers once they’ve made it to their “final destination” (the table).

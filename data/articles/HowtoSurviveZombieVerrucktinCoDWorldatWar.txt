 There will be two people on each sides. If you're in the area where the Juggernaut is in, don't turn on the electricity, let your teammates on the other side turn it on. Keep killing zombies with your pistol until the ammo is out. When you're out of ammo, get a weapon such as the Gewehr.;
, The power needs to be turned on so you and your teammates can be together.
 If you have low points, tell your teammate to open it. Do not open the white door on the second floor, which is in your side. You have to keep it closed. If you have enough money, get the MP40. Once the power is on, go to the other side right away so you can be with your other teammates.
 It's a good idea to put them in corners. It will help you kill zombies, when they're trapping you.
 You have to be smart, don't just start picking up weapons. Be sure to take the best weapons. The machine guns and ray gun are the most helpful weapons.
 While that teammate is busy keeping the zombie distracted, tell your teammates to start getting weapons until the Teddy Bear is chosen. You need to move the mystery box to the other side. Once that's done, kill the last zombie and go to the other side where the mystery box is move.
 What you need to do, you and your teammates have to go that balcony in front of the Double Tap perk. Two people should be guarding the doors, and two should be guarding the window. If you guys are in trouble, turn on the electric barrier. And just relax and take a break. In round 10, do the same thing in round 9. Keep one zombie alive and make a teammate distract the zombie. Get perks. You have to get at least Juggernaut, Speed Cola and Quick Revive. Double tap is not really needed.
 Staying the balcony and keep turning on the barrier.
 And make them chase you. If you have the ray gun, it should be easy. If you don't, you're screwed.

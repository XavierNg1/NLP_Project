 When infusing an oil, you will want to choose something that has a middle flavor and accepts the taste of whatever is being cooked in it. Olive oil is widely available and easy to infuse. However, its own flavor can be too strong. Consider using extra virgin olive, peanut, grapeseed, or avocado oils. These oils all have lighter flavors.Choosing a lighter oil will help ensure that your oil has the taste and aroma that you want.
 Before you start, make sure that you wash and dry your orange to avoid introducing any pesticides into your oil. Then, use a zester, Microplane, or a peeler to grate off the orange peel. The number of oranges used with vary depending on the amount of infused oil you are making. In general, you need about 2 tablespoons (30Â ml) of zest for every cup of oil.Avoid removing any pith.
 Place the orange zest in a small saucepan and cover it with oil. Warm the pan over medium heat for about five minutes or until the oil begins to bubble. Do not let the oil and zest get too hot or it will begin to burn and ruin the flavor and smell.Heating the orange zest extracts the orange oil that will be infused with your other oil.
 Let the saucepan cool for a few minutes. For a milder infusion, use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces of zest from the oil while it is cooling. If you would like it to have a stronger flavor, leave the zest in the oil while it cools and strain it out before bottling.If you remove the zest during cooling, your oil will have a lighter coloring. If the zest stays in during cooling, you will have a cloudier coloring.

 Most communities have races all year long.


Consider choosing a 5K in spring or fall if this is your first race. That way, extreme temperatures will not slow you down or cause you any additional discomfort while you run.
 You want to have a minimum of 8 weeks to train. Look for races that are at least two months away.
 Many races are run for charity, so if there is an organization or cause you want to support, sign up for a race that raises money for that mission.



Pay any required entrance fees. These are usually no more than between $10 and $35 for a 5K.

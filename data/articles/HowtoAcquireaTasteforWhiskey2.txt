 Rather than just sticking to one type of whiskey, try branching out and tasting a variety of different brands from different distilleries. This will expose your pallet to new tastes and flavors, and really help you acquire a taste for whiskey.Some of the most popular whiskey brands include Bell’s, Ballantine’s, Black Velvet, Dewar’s, Crown Royal, Jameson, Suntory, and Glenfiddich.
 Different countries produce whiskeys that taste quite different from each other. To become a true connoisseur of whiskey, you’ll need to branch out and begin trying some varieties produced in other countries. Some popular whiskeys include:Scotland: Laphroaig, Glenfiddich, Bunnahabhain

Ireland: Jameson, Tullamore Dew, Bushmills

United States: Jim Beam, Jack Daniel’s, Wild Turkey

Japan: Nikka, Yamazaki, Hakushu

, Try whiskeys of different ages produced by the same distillery. Choose a whiskey you enjoy and try a younger one (three or four years) and then taste an older one (12-15 years). Compare them side by side and consider the different smells, flavors, and aromas that you sense in each.In general, it’s probably true that older whiskeys taste better (and are more expensive) than younger whiskeys because of the greater length of time that was spent aging the liquor. However, this isn’t true across the board.
Many people say that 8-9 years is the best age for most whiskeys.
 One great way to expand your knowledge of whiskey is to attend a whiskey tasting. Many local bars and distilleries will host events in which you are provided with an assortment of whiskeys and you even get to learn a bit about the products.


These events usually aren’t free, but it’s often a good value for the money.
Check your local bars for any information about upcoming events.
You might even want to consider hosting your own whiskey tasting for you and your friends.You could also consider taking a trip to visit a distillery.

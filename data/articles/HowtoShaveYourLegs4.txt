 The chemicals used will dissolve the keratin at the base of the hair shaft.









Having clean skin will make this easier as oils on the skin and hair will prevent the depilatory from working effectively.
Having unbroken skin will keep irritation at bay.
 Apply a warm washcloth to your legs to soften the hair. Moisten the hair for about three to five minutes. Dry your legs when done.
 Don't rub into the skin: the depilatory is designed to work without that.
 Leave the depilatory cream on for as long as the instructions tell you. Don't leave depilatory cream for longer than the time specifiedâ€”it could irritate, or even burn your skin.


Keep a timer handy so that you don't go over the limit. If your legs feel like they're burning before it's time to remove the cream, rinse it off.
 After you've finished, remove the product generally by scraping the residue with the plastic tool (if one is provided) and rinsing off whatever is left.









Use a damp washcloth in a downwards motion. This will clear away any straggling hair, and finish cleaning up your legs.
 Try not to use harsh products or treatments after using a depilatory cream for a day or two.

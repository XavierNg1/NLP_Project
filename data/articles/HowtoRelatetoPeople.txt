 What are their main goals? If you don't know, ask them (or their friends) what they want to achieve, and then look at the steps they are taking to move towards that goal. What someone is doing will make more sense to you if you know what purpose it serves.;
, Maybe they don't (yet) have what it takes to be where they want to be. Or maybe they do, but aren't there yet for another reason. Try to see an overall picture of their personality and link it with their goals.
 Imagine you have the same goals, characteristics and experiences as them. Look at how people treat the person you want to relate to and why. Imagine how other people would treat you if you were in their shoes. How would you feel? What would you do if you wanted to be like they want to be? Ask yourself these questions and compare the answers with their behavior.
 Imagine how you would feel if you experienced the same. Try to find out what caused it (but don't blame anyone, which is the opposite of relating to someone).

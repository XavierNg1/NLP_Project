 You can try ground turkey, chicken, or even buy an Italian sausage; cut it open, and use the seasoned meat mixture inside to form your patties.


If you are using chicken, turkey, or extra lean meat, mix a few bread crumbs into the patties to help them hold together better on the grill.
You can even mix diced onion, garlic, or bell pepper into your patties. Get as creative as you want!

, Add sauces or other seasonings to the patties before cooking. Experiment with plain burgers or try adding your favorite flavors before cooking. Here are some classic burger seasonings many people enjoy (try adding just a few tsp. or 0.5 ounces when learning how much you like; you don't want to over-season):


Salt and pepper
Finely chopped onion
Soy sauce
Worcestershire sauce
Barbecue sauce
Steak sauce

, Make sure you have the usual toppings, like lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. Don't stop there. Try grilling some mushrooms, bell pepper, or onions. Add some sliced avocado or jalapeno peppers. The options are almost endless. Get as creative as you want.
 Condiments can make the same burger patty into a totally new taste experience. Popular choices for a beef burger include ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, hot sauce, or even steak sauce.
 Toss a handful of Black Cherry chips onto your charcoals once they get hot. This will give your burgers a smoky taste. If you are using a gas grill, place Black Cherry chunks on the grilling surface, not the flame. Or, using an aluminum pie plate with holes punched in it, fill with black cherry chips and put on grilling surface.


Many people prefer the flavor or meat grilled over hardwood charcoal to traditional briquettes.

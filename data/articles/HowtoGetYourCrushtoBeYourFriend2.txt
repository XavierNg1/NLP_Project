 They may be able to give you advice on how to approach your crush, as well as help you make plans. Although you shouldn't completely accept their words, it's nice to have some people that you can rely on.
 If you spot your crush nearby, talk with your friends about a topic that your crush may like. For instance, if they're obsessed with lacrosse and your friend happens to play the sport, ask your friend some questions about it. Your crush might jump into the conversation. If you're focusing on subjects that you're unfamiliar with, be sure to do your research beforehand so that you have the right facts.
 It'll not only help you gain information about your crush but also show that you can get along with people. However, it's recommended that you form authentic relationships so that you don't appear fake. Otherwise, people might feel that you manipulated them for your own benefit.


Avoid simply using them. Treat them as if they're your friends, and they might invite you to hang out with them.

 Reinvigorate the soil by sprinkling a slow-acting fertilizer around the snowball tree a month after youâ€™ve put it in the ground. Slow-acting fertilizer delivers nutrients over a long period of time to keep your plant healthy., Cut off dead blooms or branches during blooming season, which takes place from March to July. Trimming dead growths from the plant will make the branches grow back healthier and bushier.


Use a sharp pair of gardening shears to cut off the damaged section., Suckers are offshoots of the snowball tree that look like thick branches growing on ground level. Because suckers are offshoots of the tree, they cause the tree to divide its nutrients and resources between the main part of the tree and the suckers. Use pruning shears to cut the sucker cleanly close to where its base meets the tree.Removing suckers allows the tree to retain all of its nutrients, making it much healthier.
 Check on your plant every week or so. If your area is experiencing a drought or has had very little rain, water your snowball tree. This is especially important when your tree is young and delicate.


Be sure to water at the base of the plant instead of over the top of the plant. Watering at the base ensures that the roots absorb the water.

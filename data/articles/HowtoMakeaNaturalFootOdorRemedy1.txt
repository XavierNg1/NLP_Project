 These products will absorb moisture from the surface of your feet, preventing the continued growth of odor-causing bacteria. Place 5-10 tablespoons of whichever powder product you choose into a dry container with a lid. Other natural powders which could be substituted for baking soda or cornstarch include talcum powder, baby powder, or arrowroot powder.
You can use a single absorbent powder, or a combination of two or several if you prefer.;
, Lavender, eucalyptus, and tea tree oils are all popular choices. Essential oils provide a lovely fragrance, and contain natural chemicals called tannins which kill bacteria. Start with 3 or 4 drops of whichever oil or oils you choose, and add more if you'd like the powder to have a stronger smell., This will mix the essential oils with your chosen absorbent powder. After you've shaken it, remove the lid and take a whiff to determine if you'd like to add more drops of essential oil.
 You might want to stand on a towel, or set your feet in the bath tub to avoid a mess. Sprinkle over the top and bottom of your foot, paying special attention to the spaces between your toes, where bacteria tend to thrive. If your feet are already sweaty or dirty, wash them first with warm water and soap. Consider applying your powder at the start of your day, before putting on clean socks and shoes, after a shower or bath, or just before bed.
You can also use your foot powder as a shoe deodorizer. Just sprinkle the foot powder into your shoe, making sure the shoe is dry first, then leave overnight.
 Don't make too much powder at once, since essential oils evaporate over time, losing some of their potency.

You'll need to research the specific type of hound dog you want to adopt in order to determine how much food they'll need and how large they'll grow.You should also find out what activities the hound dog you want is interested in. For example, some breeds are used for tracking, hunting, or running.
 The best way to tell if a hound dog is right for you is to just be around them. This will give you a good idea of how they interact with you and other dogs. Go to pet stores and ask to sit with the hound dogs, ask friends if they have hound dogs you could visit with, or go to the adoption agency to see the dogs they have.


Taking the time to interact with the dogs before you adopt one is also good practice for caring for a pet. You'll need to invest your time in taking care of an adopted hound dog.
 Once you've narrowed your list to a few different breeds, ask the veterinarian about any congenital conditions they may inherit. This way, you can be prepared about what kind of care you might need to give your hound dog.

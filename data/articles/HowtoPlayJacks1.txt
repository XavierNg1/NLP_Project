 All you need is a small bouncy ball and a set of jacks, which are six-pronged metal pieces. The number of jacks you need depends on which variation of the game you're playing: The simplest games can require just five, while more complicated ones can involve up to fifteen.









Jacks sets, which include a ball, a set of jacks, and a pouch to hold them in, can be found at most toy stores.
The ancient form of jacks was called knucklebones, because instead of today's modern metal jacks, the knucklebones of sheep or goats were used. ;
, Jacks requires a hard, flat, smooth surface for the ball to bounce on.









If you're playing outdoors, a wooden porch or a paved surface like a sidewalk or a blacktop is ideal.
If you're playing indoors, a hardwood or a linoleum floor works best.
It's possible to play on a table, but standing is better than sitting in a chair, because it gives you more mobility.
 Jacks can be played in pairs, groups of any size, or solo.
 There are a number of ways to do this, some more traditional than others.









The most traditional way is called flipping. Place the jacks in your two cupped hands, throw them into the air, and then catch as many as you can on the backs of your two hands, linked together with your thumbs. Toss them back in the air, and then catch as many as you can again, this time with your palms cupped again. The player who catches the most jacks goes first. It can be easier to catch the jacks if your fingers are spread apart a little.
Flipping can also be done using only one hand.
Use a simpler decision method, like rock-paper-scissors or a coin toss.

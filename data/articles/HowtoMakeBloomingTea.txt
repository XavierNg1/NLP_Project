, If you know what kind of tea is in the ball (white, green, or black) follow the guidelines in How to Make Tea when determining how hot to make the water. For example, if it is predominantly white tea, the water should not be boiling (170 degrees is best) when poured onto the tea. If the tea is black, bring the water to a full boil.
,, Taste the tea as it steeps to see if it has reached a desired strength.
 If you're not going to drink it all, pour it into another teapot where it can stay warm. Leaving the hot water in contact with the tea for too long can adversely affect the taste.
 You may be able to do this 2-3 times, depending on the size, brand, how much tea you made, and how long you steeped the tea the first time. Remember that after a few re-steepings, the flavor will not be as bold as before in other pots.

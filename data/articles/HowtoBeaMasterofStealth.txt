 You might be thinking that creeping around and being secretive is all there is to be stealthy, but there are quite a lot of other things to it. For example, if you never give too much away, you decrease the risk of anybody finding out any of your plans or surprising you. So when you're talking to somebody, don't talk too much about anything that you want to be kept quite low key. If you do happen to tell someone something, make sure they're the kind of person you can trust.;
, Try sneaking up and surprising your little sister while she's watching TV, try walking in a corridor without making any sound at all, try standing still and just being as silent as you can. Learn to walk softly and evenly, and to keep your breathing quiet, not panting all over the place. It may take some practice if you're clumsy and noisy, but this is something that anybody can learn if they try hard enough.
 Stealth is being able to move from location to location undetected, but this doesn't mean that if you've been in the same place 20 seconds you need to sprint out into the open. Stealth is where subjects in the area are unaware that you are anywhere near the location, having someone know you are hiding somewhere and is looking for you is not the same thing, though this is seen as part of the skill of mastering stealth as if detected should be able to slip away seamlessly.
 Be careful what you're standing on and how much noise it makes. Be careful about how you smell; are you using too much deodorant? Does it smell unnatural? Be careful of what you do. Move in time to the wind and other repetitive noises and lastly be patient it may take hours to move only a few hundred meters, but make a mistake and you could end up a lot worse than just bored out your brains.

 In the first throes of a new relationship, you may want to spend as much time together as possible. Try not to monopolize your boyfriend’s time. Instead, try suggesting that he tell you when he wants to be with his friends. If you tell him this, then he will know that you want him to spend time with his friends and that you don’t resent him for wanting to do so.


This is also a good way to avoid activities that do not interest you. For example, if you are not interested in going to a concert with his friends, you can tell him that you want him to have time with his buddies.
 When your boyfriend is with his friends, you don’t need to just sit at home alone. You can go and spend time with the people in your life that you enjoy. You and your boyfriend don’t need to be together all the time. In fact, spending time with your own friends will make you feel better as well!, Sure, you might want to be with your boyfriend when he is with his friends, but sometimes it’s better that he spend time with just them. Or, maybe you want to have time alone after you hang out with your boyfriend and his friends. Either way, don’t be afraid to take the initiative. Read that book that you have lying on your nightstand or take the walk you’ve been longing for. You know that you are in a good relationship if you can take alone time!This time is necessary for self-reflection. However, it is possible to use this as a tactic to make your partner more receptive to you. Try not to do this. You don’t use this as an excuse to avoid spending time with your boyfriend.
Some ways for asking for alone time are better than others, you don’t want to simply shout “I need alone time!” If you do this, you run the risk of giving the impression that you are feeling smothered by your partner. Instead, you should gently say in a calm voice, “Hey, I think I need to spend a few hours alone today.”

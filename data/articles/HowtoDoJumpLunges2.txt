 Lunges can put a strain on the knees. If you have a history of knee pain or problems with your knees, look for another exercise. Alternately, keep your feet closer together when you try a lunge. The closer your feet are together when you lunge, the shallower your lunge will be, and the less likely it is that you’ll hurt yourself.You could also try a reverse lunge.In this variation, instead of putting one foot forward, you put one foot behind you before dropping into the standard lunge position.
 If your forward leg hurts, increase the angle of your knee. In other words, don’t bend as deeply or lunge as far as you have been. If you continue to experience pain or have trouble balancing yourself, try to add some support by using skiing poles or leaning against a chair or weight rack to help you maintain balance., Many people find that one way to increase the challenge of lunges is to increase their speed. If you’re training to build endurance during climbing or skiing, for instance, increasing the pace at which you perform your jump lunges can be beneficial.If your knees twist, then you might hurt yourself. Always keep your knees, toes, and hips facing in the same direction when you are doing lunges.

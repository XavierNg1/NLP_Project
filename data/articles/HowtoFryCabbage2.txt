 Start by cutting the onions, peppers and cabbage into thin strips. Keep them separated for now. You can also dice a tomato if you plan on using fresh tomatoes in the dish along with or instead of tomato paste., Heat 2 tbsps of canola or vegetable oil in a deep pan. Put in the garlic and onions and sauté for 5-10 minutes, or until they begin to caramelize. Add the pepper strips and sauté another 5 minutes. Once the peppers and onions are soft, it’s time to add the cabbage.The onions and peppers should go into the pan first, not just because they take longer to cook than the cabbage but also to allow their flavors to be released into the dish.
 Place the entire head of sliced cabbage in the pan with the caramelized ingredients. Sauté for 15 minutes. Stir in ¾ to 1 full can of tomato paste to reach the desired thickness. Throw in salt, pepper, chili powder, coriander, parsley or cilantro and stir or toss.You may also use chopped fresh tomatoes in place of tomato paste. These should also be added along with the cabbage and may require an additional 5-10 minutes to stew.
If the mixture is too thick after incorporating the tomato paste, try adding a few ounces of water and covering the pan to let the liquids set up. This will also prevent the frying vegetables from burning or sticking.
 Cook the mixture together, uncovered, for approximately 15 minutes. This will allow time for the sauce to thicken up and the flavors of the individual ingredients and seasonings to mingle. When the cabbage looks soft and tender, remove the mixture from the heat and serve it while it’s piping hot!Recipes for fried cabbage with tomato sauce come from around the world, but are especially popular in Eastern Europe.
Cabbage stewed with tomato sauce can be served as a hearty side dish, or as a main course with a starchy component like steamed rice, potatoes or fresh bread.

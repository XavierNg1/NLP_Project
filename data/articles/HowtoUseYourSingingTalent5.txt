, Your username could be your real name, or it could be a stage or band name, if that is how you would like to become known.


Make sure your account is public so that people can see it. This will also help when you use tags or hashtags that people search.
 Many laptops today come equipped with webcams, so you could use that, if you own a laptop. You can also buy webcams to install on desktop computers.


Other options include setting up a tripod with a camcorder on it or having someone record you with a camcorder or smartphone.
 You can perform covers of songs you like, or you can write and perform your own original songs.


You will also need to decide if you want to sing a capella or if you want instrumental background music. If you want background music, you will need to decide how to make that happen. Play guitar, piano, or another instrument yourself, or use karaoke versions of songs (i.e. only the instrumental with no lyrics). Be sure to get the appropriate permission to use any instrumental music in the background of your videos.
 This does require some skill in video editing. If you make a mistake, it would be best to edit it out before sharing your video on your social media account.


You could also consider doing several takes of the video until you get one with which you are happy.
Consider adding credits at the end of the video to highlight your own work and/or to acknowledge others who helped you record or accompany your singing.
 Once you are satisfied with your videos, share them on your social media account. You can use popular tags or hashtags so that your video comes up in searches, and you can share them to other social media platforms to get more views.

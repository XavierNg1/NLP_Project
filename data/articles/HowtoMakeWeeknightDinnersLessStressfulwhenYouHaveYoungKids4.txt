 Young children like familiarity, especially with foods, and often refuse to eat new things. Forcing a child to eat something they don’t want will interfere with them learning how to manage their own food consumption. Introduce new foods along with other options so that your child can choose what they want to eat., Offer at least once food item that your child likes at suppertime, but do not cook multiple meals at once. For instance, if you make pork chops and fear your child won’t eat one, offer other side items with the meal (e.g. baby carrots, bread). Let your child fill their plate with whatever foods they want to try, and don’t push if they refuse your main course., Avoid complaints about dinner by letting your kids be involved in the process of planning it. Shop with children to allow them to choose items to be included in the meal (e.g. choosing carrots instead of cauliflower). When you serve supper, point out your kids’ contributions to dinner and remind them that what they are being served is what they chose., To get kids excited about their meal and to give them a sense of responsibility, involve them in the preparation process. Depending on their age, give them simple tasks to complete as part of the kitchen routine. Even very young children can stir ingredients or sprinkle seasonings onto other ingredients.Complete potentially dangerous tasks, like chopping vegetables, prior to inviting your children into the kitchen to help cook.

 With the leg and foot held in their natural positions, align the pin of the goniometer to the center of the ankle joint.


Since the subject will need to move the foot back and forth, it might be best to instruct the subject to lie flat on his or her back. The leg should be straight at the hip and knee, and the foot should stick straight up at its natural point.
Hold the goniometer to the bottom of the foot. The pin should line up to the approximate center point of the ankle joint, and both arms should be closed and straight out over the sole.
 Instruct the subject to bend the ankle outward. At his or her full extension, adjust the movable arm of the goniometer to match this new position.Do not move the pin or stationary arm.
Read the rotation measurement on the center dial, beneath the center line of the movable arm.

The expected rotation is 40 to 50 degrees, but the full range exists between 0 and 90 degrees.
 Instruct the subject to bend the ankle inward. Once he or she reaches the full extension of the joint, adjust the movable arm to match the new position.


Keep the pin and stationary arm in their starting positions.
Read the rotation measurement as before, looking at the center dial to find the value beneath the center line of the movable arm.

The full range exists between 0 and 90 degrees, but the average is about 20 degrees.

 To start, place your butter and sugar in a large a mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to gently mash the two together until you have a smooth, even consistency.This works best if you let your butter come to room temperature before you begin cooking.;
, From here, add the eggs and vanilla to your dough. Mix them in using a mixing spoon until the texture is smooth throughout. You may have to beat the eggs slightly to get them to mix with the rest of the dough., Add the dry ingredients, which include the flour, salt, and cocoa powder gradually. If you add them too fast, they will be hard to mix into the dough.Once the dry ingredients are mixed in, add the pecans and gently stir them until they're mixed into the dough.
 Cover the mixing bowl with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Place the dough in a cleared out place in your refrigerator. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes. This will get the dough stiff enough to roll into balls., To bake, roll the dough into one inch balls. Then, place the dough on an un-greased cookie sheet. Make sure to leave about half an inch of space between each cookie.Bake the cookies at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
When the cookies are done baking, transfer them to a cooling rack.
 Once the cookies are cool to the touch, place some confectioner's sugar in a bowl. Roll each cookie in the sugar until it's coated in sugar. You should be left with cookies in the shape of small, white balls.

 Because the body of your candle will glow in the dark, you can create vivid patterns by covering up parts of the candle with a black marker. Draw shapes or patterns around, making sure to cover the coloured area thoroughly.


If you want to create a glow in the dark shape on your candle, you can "reverse draw" something, by colouring in the area around it and leaving a stencilled shape. This is perfect if you're making your glow candles for Halloween and want to make glowing shapes of spiders, ghosts and other assorted spooky denizens.
 A mirror offers a great opportunity to double the effective light of a "glow in the dark" candle. Place a table mirror near your candle for an extra glow. Mirrors by themselves can be used to spooky effect, so there shouldn't be anything stopping you from incorporating one into your presentation.
 Although there is a certain joy in making things from home, there are at-home and professional outlets that sell beautiful custom-made candles online.Looking at some of these candles may be good if you're not a DIY type.
 If you're looking for fresh ways of spicing up your "glow in the dark" candles, it may be a good idea to check on what other people have done first. You may choose to follow the idea someone else has designed. Better still, seeing the creativity of others may trigger an original idea of your own.

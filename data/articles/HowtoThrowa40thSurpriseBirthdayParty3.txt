 After the guests arrive bring your honoree to the party room blindfolded (optional) with the special blindfold.
 Take several fun photos of your blindfolded (optional) honoree and each of the guests holding their special humorous sign. Don't tell the honoree what the signs say. Put the signs in an envelope before you remove your honoree's blindfold. Later, print the photos and place them into an album side by side with the signs, or if you have the equipment project them at your party (or have a second party to view the photos a few weeks later).
 Now take a series of photos with each of your guests and your honoree and the serious signs. Later, print these photos and place them in an album along with the original signs.
 Spend about a minute a year discussing each poster board. Be sure to tell a humorous story and/or a major accomplishment for each year, and maybe tell the most significant event going on in your hometown that year. Play or sing the honoree's favorite song of the year.
 Each guest lights a candle and says something nice (and maybe something humorous) about the honoree. This provides a great opportunity for the emotional, close photos. You could do this right before cutting a nice birthday cake.

 If possible, choose a liquid measuring cup that has marks for fluid ounce on it.


Unlike ounces, fluid ounces are a measurement of volume. A single fluid ounce does not necessarily equal a single ounce.
Use a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry measuring cup. Liquid measuring cups have pour spouts and handles, while dry measuring cups have an even rim.






Fluid ounces are part of the American Standard system. The Metric system uses milliliters and liters.
Most graduated cylinders and beakers only measure in milliliters, but if you can find one with measuring marks for fluid ounces, these options are also acceptable.
 Slowly add your substance to the measuring cup until you measure out the desired amount of fluid ounces. If your pour too much into the container, simply pour a little of it back out.


You should keep the measuring cup on a steady surface, like a table or counter, when measuring out your substance. Look at the cup at eye level, from the outside of the cup, to ensure an accurate measurement.If you are trying to measure the fluid ounces of a set amount of liquid, you can pour the entire amount into your cup at once without having to worry about doing so a little at a time. Make sure that none of the substance splashes out as you work, though.
 If you want to measure out a second liquid as you combine it with the first, you need to make sure that you write down or otherwise note how much of the first liquid you measured out. From there, you can pour the second liquid into the first and measure it as you did with the first.


Note that your new measurement will need to equal the sum of the amount of fluid ounces you measured for your first liquid plus the amount of fluid ounces you need for your second liquid.
Repeat as needed until all of your liquids have been measured out.

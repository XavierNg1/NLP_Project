 Run each potato under cool water and use your hands or a soft sponge to scrub it clean of dirt.;
, Using a sharp knife or vegetable peeler, remove any blemishes or green spots.
 Dry potato skins absorb oil, butter and seasonings better, making the potatoes more flavorful.
 Before wrapping your potatoes in foil, use a fork to poke a few holes across the skin. This allows the heat to vent from the potatoes for even cooking.
 Tear off sheets of foil for all the potatoes you plan to cook and wrap them tightly in the foil. Be sure the potatoes are covered completely.


You can roll them in the foil and pinch the sides closed or fold the foil over them and fold the sides.
 Turn on your grill and adjust the heat to high. Spread your foil wrapped potatoes out over the grill. Place them close together and on the hottest part of the grill.


If you are cooking many potatoes, you can pile them in even thickness over the hottest part of the grill. This way, once the bottom row begins to char, it will be time to flip them.
 Close the grill lid and let the potatoes cook for 40 minutes. If cooking multiple rows of potatoes, flip half way through cooking time. When you first try this method, you might want to use slightly shorter cooking times and check the potatoes (unfold the foil with tongs; the steam will be hot enough to burn). If they are not fully cooked, rewrap them and grill for a few more minutes.


If they're too charred but not done in the middle, put them back on, away from the hottest part of the grill, and cover the grill.
The amount of heat and the size of the potatoes determine their cooking time. Generally, when grilled with the lid down, whole foil wrapped potatoes take 30 to 45 minutes to cook through.In the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking, you can remove the potatoes from the foil and return them to the grill, unwrapped. This will brown the skins.

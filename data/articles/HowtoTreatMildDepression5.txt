 Keeping a journal can be beneficial for understanding how your environment affects your mood, energy, health, sleep and so on. Journaling can also help you process your emotions and gain insight into why certain things make you feel a certain way., Even if you write only for a few minutes, it can be helpful to jot down your feelings and thoughts.
 Make it easy for yourself to write when the mood strikes. Consider using a simple note-taking application on your phone or tablet computer.
 Don’t feel like you need to write complete sentences if it’s easier for you to write phrases or bullet points. Don’t worry about spelling, grammar or style. Just write to get your thoughts out on paper.


If you require more structure, you can seek out people who teach journaling; you can read books about journaling; or you can use websites to keep online journals.
 Use your journal however you want. You can keep everything private, share some things with friends, family or your therapist, or start a public blog.

 When shopping for catnip, opt for brands that are organically grown. In addition to being pesticide and chemical-free, organic catnip is generally fresher and more effective than lesser quality catnip. Organically grown catnip is sold in fresh, dried, flake, pellet, oil, and spray forms., Catnip is more or less potent in different forms, depending on the level of nepetalactone present. When you buy loose catnip, look for kinds that have fewer stems than leaves and blossoms. The latter contain more of the chemical and have a stronger effect.Dried catnip can be safely chewed or ingested by cats, and may be inserted into toys, or simply sprinkled around your cat's play area in a small amount (e.g. approximately one tbsp, or 0.5 oz).
 For a lighter concentration of catnip, purchase a spray, which will have lower levels of nepetalactone. Catnip spray can be used to steer your cat towards certain toys or furniture in an effort to keep it away from others (e.g. spraying your cat's bed to keep it away from the couch). Look for a spray that contains all-natural ingredients, and no chemicals or preservatives., Buy a catnip plant to have a constant, fresh supply of the herb, or grow catnip indoors. If you have a garden, grow catnip plants outdoors. Make sure plants get plenty of sunlight and moisture. Cut off leaves as needed to give to your cat to chew, paw at, rub against, or eat.Fresh catnip can be dried and stored for later use.
 To preserve the effectiveness of catnip, store it in the freezer. Freezing will prevent the herb's essential oil from drying up, which would reduce the effectiveness of the herb. Place catnip in a freezer bag or plastic container and seal it firmly before freezing it. Remove catnip from the freezer and thaw when needed.

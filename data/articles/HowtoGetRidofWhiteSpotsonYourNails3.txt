While usually not harmful, white spots on nails can sometimes indicate underlying problems like anemia or liver issues.Also, in the event you have nail fungus, you may need prescription medications., If you suspect fungus is the cause of your white nails, see a doctor for a prescription for an oral anti-fungal medication. Typically, these medications are taken for six to twelve weeks and should eventually eliminate symptoms of nail fungus like spots.Make sure you discuss any existing health problems you have before taking an anti-fungal medication. Anti-fungal medications can cause rashes or damage to the liver.
 A doctor may also prescribe an anti-fungal cream or polish that you apply to the nails. You usually apply the cream to your nails for a set period of time. This can range for a few weeks to up to a year.

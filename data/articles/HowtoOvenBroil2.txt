 If your recipe calls for oil and/or spices, place these on your meat now. Be sure to season both sides of the meat. Using oils or herbs and spices is totally optional when using your broiler., Once your meat has been brought to room temperature and seasoned, it is ready to go in the oven. Set the meat on the broiler pan of your choice, and place the pan in the oven directly beneath the broiler.If your broiler is in a drawer, slide the drawer out and place your broiler pan inside.
If your broiler is in the top of your oven, place your pan on an oven rack in the highest position.
 For thin to medium-sized cuts of meat, you will want to wait 7-10 minutes before flipping the meat. If you are using thicker cuts (or if you prefer your meat very well done) wait closer to 15 minutes, then flip., After your meat has been flipped, place it back under the broiler and close the door. Wait an additional 5-10 minutes for the meat to finish cooking., The safest and most accurate way to determine the doneness of your meat is to check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer. When your meat reaches the appropriate temperature, remove it from the broiler.Here are some guidelines:


Medium rare meat = 145 degrees F (63 C)
Medium = 160 degrees F (71 C)
Well-done meat = 170 degrees F (77 C)

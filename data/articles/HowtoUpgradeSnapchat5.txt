 If you are using an iPhone 4 or 4s and your device is jailbroken, you can install a Cydia tweak that will trick Snapchat into thinking your iPhone is a newer model. With this tweak, you'll be able to used Lenses on unsupported devices. This requires that your device be jailbroken and Cydia installed, which is beyond the scope of this article. See Jailbreak an iPod Touch for instructions on jailbreaking iOS devices (the instructions are the same for iPhones and iPads).
 Follow the iPhone method above to make sure that your Snapchat app is as up to date as possible.
 You'll find the Cydia app on your iPhone's Home screen. Cydia is the jailbreak package manager, and you'll be installing the Snapchat tweak using it.
 This tweak is available from the BigBoss repo (one of the defaults), so it should appear without any fussing with Cydia's sources.
 Make sure you're on the page created by Jon Luca DeCaro.
 This will take you to the installation queue.
 The file is small, so it should only take a moment to download.
 Once the tweak is installed, you can begin using Lenses in Snapchat immediately. Be aware that because your device isn't actually supported, you may encounter errors or glitches.Snapchat may take longer than normal to start when this tweak is installed.

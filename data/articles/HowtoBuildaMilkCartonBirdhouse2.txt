 Milk left inside the carton can mix with birdseed and go moldy. Ensure that the container is properly dry before proceeding.
 Simply glue it back into its original shape.
 Enamel paint will last longer outdoors but acrylics can be used if you don't mind faster weathering. Do at least two coats to ensure an even covering, allowing for drying time between coats.
 Think of a surfboard style shape if you're stuck for an image.
 Do not cut the top off; the idea is to create flaps from the wings that you will bend out a little, leaving the wing holes sitting just underneath. Leave a good amount uncut at the top.
 Cut out the entire shape. This now becomes the owl's "tummy".
 Glue them next to each other, as these become the owl's eyes. Glue the broad part of the cap onto the carton, with the open part of the cap facing outward.
 Glue the smaller caps inside the larger caps, only this time, face the broad part outward, only gluing the open part of the cap to the first caps.
 The eyes are now complete.
 Glue this directly under the eyes, with the painted side facing inward and the unpainted side showing outward as the beak.
 This provides the perch for the bird to sit on while eating the birdseed.
 Thread either twine or thin wire through this to create a hanger for the owl-shaped birdhouse.
 Fill with birdseed and await the birds.

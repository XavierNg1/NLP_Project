 If you are trying to make an excuse, you must have a reason. If it's a reason the person you are supposed to meet will understand, offer it.If your reason is about you, it might not offend. If you are too tired, too sick, too overworked, or too depressed to meet up, say so.
You might say, "I'm so sorry to cancel, but I've been feeling really down and I don't think I'm up to spending time with anyone."
If your reason is about the person, you might offend them if you offer this as a reason to miss the date. Avoid saying things like "I'm not in the mood to see you," or "last time we hung out it took forever and I was bored."
If you just don't want to date them, however, you should tell them instead of just canceling the date.;
, If you have a romantic date with someone you aren't actually interested in, tell them. If you don't like someone who likes you, you will have to tell them eventually. Canceling on them repeatedly until they get the idea is not the kindest way.


If you realize you want to cancel a date because you aren't interested, call the person and say so.
You might say, "I think you're great, but I'm just not emotionally available to date you right now."
If you're interested in someone else, say, "I have feelings for someone else, and I can't really see past those at this time."
If you just aren't dating at the moment, tell them this. "I'm not up for dating right now. I'm just spending time with friends."

, If you don't want to keep a date with someone, create a conflict that will prevent you from going. For instance, you might schedule a doctor's appointment for that time. You can then contact your date and tell the truth without going into too much detail.


You might say, "I have a doctor's appointment when we were supposed to meet up. I'm sorry! Can we make a new plan?"
You will have to suggest a make-up date if this is your technique. Only create a conflict if you are willing to meet up later.

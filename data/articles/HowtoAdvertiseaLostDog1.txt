 Your vet is invested in the health and well-being of your pet, and letting them know will likely get you some space on their office bulletin board to place a flyer. More importantly, though, vets know other vets, and it is possible that your missing dog could end up at another vetâ€™s office. Letting your vet know your dog is missing allows them reach out into their community to see if anything comes up.Make sure your vet has up-to-date contact information for you, and a recent description or photo of your dog if they have not been into the office for awhile.;
, Contact the animal control department in your city or town, as well as any nearby towns. Let them know that you have a missing dog, and provide them with a comprehensive description of your pet. This way, if Animal Control picks up your pet, they will know to contact you first.Leave your full name and contact number with the Animal Control offices, along with contact information for a friend or family member in case they cannot reach you immediately.
Contact al Animal Control departments within a roughly 60 mile radius of your residence.
 In addition to Animal Control, contact all shelters within a 60 mile radius of where your pet went missing. Provide them with a description of your pet, and ask if anyone has brought in a dog matching that description recently. If not, leave your contact information with the shelter so they can notify you if your pet does come in.Also notify breed rescues, even if the rescue is for a different breed than your dog. Breed rescues often take different breeds if they think a pet is lost or abandoned.
If any local dog daycare or boarding facilities also help house rescues, call those facilities and ask them if anyone has brought in a dog like yours.

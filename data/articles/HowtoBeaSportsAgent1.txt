 Most sports agents have at least a bachelor's degree. Some schools will offer a degree in sports management. You might also want to major in business management or marketing.


Study business, negotiation, marketing and law. The skills and principles you learn in these classes will help you develop your skills as a sports agent.
Get involved in extracurricular activities. Even if you are not a natural athlete yourself, pay attention to the sports teams at your school and develop relationships with players, coaches and others involved in the teams. This will help your communication and networking skills.;
, You will naturally gravitate towards the sports you love to watch, but watch all sports developments. Figure skaters and tennis players will need an agent just as much as professional football players.



Get to know how players are recruited, what the toughest parts of contract negotiations are and what brands and companies look for in a spokesperson.
Read everything you can in the sports news during draft season and even in the post season. As a sports agent, these times will be more important to you than the regular playing season.
 As in any industry, you will need to get your foot in the door somewhere and pay your dues. An unpaid internship is one way to do this.


Find opportunities with groups such as the NCAA on job sites such as the Sports Job Board.
Expect to do a lot of paperwork as an intern. You may not be negotiating on behalf of Derek Jeter, but you will get a chance to see what a player's contract looks like, read scouting reports and develop marketing materials for specific athletes.
 This is an essential skill for a sports agent.


Use your internship or other opportunities to develop a contact list. Get used to introducing yourself and staying in touch with people who can help your career.
 You will need to be very good at these two skills in order to be successful.

 This is crucial to fish health. Read the article on Fishless Cycling.;
, You need to test mainly for ammonia and nitrites - the two main causes of fish death and illness. These should both always be at 0. Nitrate and pH are also important- nitrates should stay below 20, and pH should not fluctuate.
 For a normally stocked community tank, changing 20-25% of the water every two weeks is enough, but in smaller tanks or heavily stocked tanks, more is needed. These are crucial to reducing nitrates, and if present, ammonia and nitrites.
 Look out for physical changes, like white spots, torn or damaged fins, white fluff, red sores or physical changes such as tumors. Spotting disease early makes treatment a lot easier and makes it a lot more likely for your fish to survive.
 Feed as much as they will eat in a few minutes and no more. Excess food will feed snails, which eat fish eggs and damage aquarium plants, or rot at the bottom of the tank. Give your fish frozen or live foods such as bloodworm once a week for variety. A small chunk of zucchini or broccoli, the same size as your pleco or other plant eaters, tied to a weight and sunk, will keep vegetarians in the tank happy. Only leave the vegetable in for two to three days/nights. Only put the vegetable in the tank once every three weeks.
 If these get into the water, they are highly toxic to fish.
 Doing so adds to stress of the fish, making them more susceptible to disease. Nipped fins can get infected, weakening fish and leaving them exposed to ailments that normally wouldn't bother them.
 Remember that few treatments can be used together. Check with an aquarium shop if in doubt.

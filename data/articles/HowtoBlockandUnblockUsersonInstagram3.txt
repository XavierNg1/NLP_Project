 You can only delete comments from within the Instagram app.
 You can delete comments that users leave on your photos or videos, or comments that you have left on other photos or videos. You cannot delete comments that others have left on other users' photos. Open the list of comments to delete specific comments.


On mobile devices, tap the photo to open it and then tap the comments underneath the picture.
On the Instagram website, click the photo to open the comments.
 Tap the comment (Android) or swipe it to the left (iPhone). This will allow you to delete that specific comment.
 The process is a little different for each version.


On Android, tap the Trash button at the top of the screen.
On iPhone, tap the Trashcan and then tap "Delete".
On the Instagram website, click the "X" next to the comment you want to delete and then confirm.

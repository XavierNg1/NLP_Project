, A hayride can be traditional or modern. The traditional version will use a horse and cart filled with hay.

Alternately, it might use a vintage truck filled at the back with hay.
 Not everyone has fun around hay; for those with allergies to dried plant material, this could set in train respiratory, nasal, and eye reactions that mar the experience. If you know this is the case, children or adults who might be affected are probably best to while away the time on a different activity. Alternately, seek advice from a health professional about anti-allergy medications.
 Hay is fun but messy. Wear old clothes that you don't mind getting dirty and filled with burrs, sticks, etc.
 If your kids or fellow adults are a bit concerned about mussing about in the hay, tell them it's fine. Let the kids roll in it, jump on it before the vehicle starts moving, so that they can familiarize themselves with it.
 Hayrides hearken back to times when the harvest was a whole-of-family or even community affair and it was a good occasion to bolster the spirits of the hard-workers collecting the hay for storage by cracking jokes or telling stories. A good hayride will encourage this tradition still.

 There’s no reason to be shy about going out to eat alone. In fact, it can be pretty nice to go wherever you want, order whatever you want, drink whatever you want, and have a whole table to yourself.If you feel like being a bit social, sit at the bar to eat. People sitting at the bar tend to be friendlier and more open--and to have better stories.Go to one of your favorite restaurants and order the meal you’ve been craving. Bring a book along if you’d like, or enjoy your meal while people-watching.
 If your house is usually full of people waiting to use the bathroom, take this time to spend as long as you want in the bathroom. Use all of your favorite bath and body products.


Draw a bath and pour in some bubble bath or your favorite essential oil. Light candles, turn on music, and allow yourself to relax or have a leisurely shower.
 Make an appointment at a salon or walk in for a spur-of-the-moment treat.


If you don’t want to spend money on a manicure, give yourself one at home. Don’t just paint your nails, give yourself the works: file your nails, soak them, and use several coats of polish. If you still have time and supplies left over, give yourself a pedicure, too.
 Having time all to yourself offers a great opportunity for sleep--take advantage!


Indulge in an afternoon nap, or go to bed as early as you want.
If you’re alone in the morning, sleep in or wake up make breakfast and go back to bed, breakfast in bed!

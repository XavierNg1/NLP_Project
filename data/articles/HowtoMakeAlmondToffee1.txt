 Arrange the almonds single layer on a baking pan and place in a 350ºF/180ºC oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Shake the pan occasionally and turn the almonds so both sides become golden brown.;
, The butter can still be cold––simply chop it into small pieces and mix well with the other ingredients.


Place the sugar, butter, corn syrup, salt, and water in a large pot and simmer on medium to low heat, stirring occasionally.






Heat until the mixture is golden brown or, if you are using a candy thermometer, at 300ºF/150ºC.
 Add the vanilla and half of the baked almonds. The mixture may bubble up when you add the vanilla and almonds, so be prepared.
 Allow to cool at room temperature. Depending upon the temperature inside your home, cooling times may take up to 30 minutes.

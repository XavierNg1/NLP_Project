 Add both ingredients to a large bowl. Stir them together thoroughly.
 Place the bowl in the refrigerator and leave it there until the mixture is fully chilled (about one hour). The cold temperature will help the slime solidify and reach the ideal consistency., Stir it well (the ingredients will have separated again). Let the mixture warm up just enough that it flows slightly.
 It can really be any size but the standard size is 1x6x6 inches (25x150x150mm). Run the styrofoam on your hair or on your carpet several times to give it a static charge.
 Place the piece of styrofoam just in front of the slime before you start pouring. It should be about 1 inch (25 mm) away from the flow of slime. The static electricity will cause the slime to stop flowing and appear to take on a life of its own.








Wiggle the styrofoam around and the slime should follow it. Your kids will be amazed!

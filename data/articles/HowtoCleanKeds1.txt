 Before you clean your Keds, you should take out both the laces and any inserts inside of the shoe. The laces can be cleaned in the washing machine, by hand in the sink, or simply replaced. You should set aside the inserts until you are finished cleaning. If they are smelly or dirty, you may want to replace them.;
, Use a toothbrush or scrub brush, and gently work your way around the shoe to remove loose dirt before you begin cleaning. You may also tap together your shoes to help knock off dust. This will make your job easier when cleaning., You will need a cup of water, one tablespoon of baking soda, and two tablespoons of white vinegar. Mix these together in a bowl until they form a paste., Using a toothbrush, apply the paste to the shoes. Scrub thoroughly to dislodge dirt. Work your way around the entire shoe. You can use the paste on both the soles and the canvas.Do not use the toothbrush again after cleaning your Keds with it.
 Use cold or lukewarm water to rinse the paste off of the shoes. Let them dry for 24 hours. Stuff the insides with newspaper, and set them in a dry area away from direct heat. You can let them dry in the sun if you would like.If your Keds are still dirty, try washing them in the sink them after this step.
Stuffing the shoes while they dry allows them to keep their shape.

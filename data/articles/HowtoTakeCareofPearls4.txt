 These elements can dry out your pearls, causing them to crack.
 If the threads begin to fray, you should have your pearls restrung.
 Even if you do not notice visible signs of wear on the strand, the string will likely start to fray by then.
 This way, if a string breaks, you only lose a single pearl. Moreover, a knotted string keeps your pearls from rubbing against one another, which helps reduce surface scratching.

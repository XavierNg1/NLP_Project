 Because your intestine doesn’t absorb nutrients the way it should, you might not get all the calcium you need from your food. If you have low calcium, talk to your doctor about whether you should take a calcium supplement. Calcium promotes strong bones and is important for keeping your bones healthy.The average recommended daily dose is 1,000 milligrams (mg) for adults up to age 50, and 1,200mg for adults age 51 and over.Because people with Crohn’s may not absorb nutrients well, ask your doctor what is an appropriate dose for you to take.;
, Your body needs vitamin D to promote bone growth and so that your body can absorb calcium.If you’re too low in vitamin D, you may need to take a supplement. Ask your doctor if this is appropriate for you.
 Not everyone with Crohn’s needs to take medicine to prevent weak bones – you may be able to manage the risk with diet and supplements. However, you may qualify for medical therapy if a bone density scan shows your bones are dangerously weak. Ask your doctor about options. They will discuss with you the best possible therapy and weigh the risks and benefits. Some medications that treat osteoporosis include:Bisphosphonates
Estrogen
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
Denosumab

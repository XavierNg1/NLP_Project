 Many laptops have a "hidden" keypad that is enabled when you turn on the Num ⇩ key. Find this option to the left or right of your keyboard.


If your keyboard has these features, then you'll see little numbers or words written in small font on the bottom of the keys, sometimes in a different color.
 You can find it on either side of your Spacebar.
 This is the Alt Code for π. Remember to use the Alt Codes, which are nine numbers that are written on the side of your 7, 8, 9, U, I, O, J, K, L, and M keys in a different color, such as light blue or yellow. Do not use the normal number system to type in this code.


On most keyboards, this code will come from typing KK7 or 9OM, but you should look at the actual Alt codes to be sure.
 The pi symbol should appear.
 Press the key again to turn it off. This will return your keyboard to its normal settings.

 There are 4 ways your iPhone can connect to the internet to-date.


The first way is GSM/GPRS represented by a dot. It's the slowest of the connections and has a speed of about 32-114kbps. It is the most common network to find if there is no EDGE network.
The second way is EDGE represented by an E. It's a moderate connection and has a speed of about 400Kbps. It's more common than GPRS so, if you have 3G disabled, you will most probably find an EDGE network.
The third way is 3G. It's represented by its name. It's the best mobile connection and has a speed of about 200-1024Kbps (1Mbps). If you have 3G enabled (by Settings -> General -> Network), you will mostly have 3G which is the fastest of all the connections.
The last, and fastest way is Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi (aka Wireless Internet) is represented by a symbol. If you have Wi-Fi enabled and you're connected to a Wi-Fi Network/Hotspot you will see that symbol. It's speed depends on the ISP and the network. It mostly is 1-24Mbps. The most useful connection - although not mobile. If you want a mobile connection consider having 3G.;

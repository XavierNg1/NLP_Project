 You will need to decide whether you want to install wood sheeting or boards and in what size and wood type. You can research the various styles and colors online or at your local hardware supply store to help make your choice.;
, Use a tape measure, begin at 1 end of the first wall, and extend the measuring tape along the length of the wall until you reach the other side. Repeat this step on any other walls you wish to panel, and record the results so you can take them with you to the store.
 Most manufacturers offer guides that can calculate how much paneling to purchase. If you are unsure, ask a sales associate for help.
 This will prevent the wood from shrinking or expanding once installed.
 Use a level to make sure the paneling is plumb or even. Use a compass to mark the corner edge of the panel so you can cut it to fit tightly in to the corner, and make sure to draw the compass down the adjoining wall as you go. This will copy any wall unevenness on the panel board and make for a tighter fit.
 Use a fine-toothed blade to avoid fraying or shredding the wood.
 Replace the paneling flush against the wall, and nail it to the corner with wood-paneling nails. For best results, use a nail gun, but a hammer will also work. Place the nails in the dark groove surfaces to achieve the best look.

 This lamp is simple and easy to make. It requires few supplies, making it perfect for emergencies. Here's a list of what you will need:


Squat mason jar or bowl
100% cotton cord or lamp wick
Craft knife
Scissors
Cork
Nail and hammer
Olive oil
Water (optional);
, You can get a cork from a wine bottle or purchase a bag of craft corks from an arts and crafts shop. You can also use sheet of cork that's at least Â¼ inches thick.
 Cut your cork horizontally using a craft knife. If you are using a flat, squat cork, you don't need to cut it. The cork will help keep your wick afloat.


If you are using a sheet of cork, cut it into a small circle or square. It needs to be small enough to fit inside your jar, but large enough so that it won't sink under the weight of the wick.
 The hole needs to be wide enough for the wick to be able to slip through, but not so wide that the cork slides off when you hold the wick upside down.
 The wick should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) above the hole.
 Hold the cork so that it is about two-thirds to three-fourths of the way up the side of the jar. Trim the wick down until the end touches the bottom of the war.


If you don't have a jar, you can use a pretty glass bowl instead.
 Olive oil is great to use, because it burns clean. It does not contain harmful chemicals, and it does not leave behind bad smells.


If you want to save on oil, use one part water and one part oil.
 Try to float it as much in the center as you can.
 This will give the wick enough time to absorb the oil and make it easier to light.

 Often ankle boots have zippers on the sides that can have tassels attached to them. You can also choose ankle boots with a fringe that runs along the top opening of the boot.
 This can either be shorts, a skirt, or pants, as long as your bottom piece is high-waisted and fastens above your navel.


If you choose pants, make sure that they fit tightly.






Choose a paisley patterned bottom for an extra vintage feel.
 If you choose a pattern for your bottom piece, choose a solid for your top piece. If it is cold outside, put a jean jacket over your shirt, as long as you are not wearing denim pants.
 Doing so will cause your waist to appear smaller.
 You may also want to add a headband or ribbon of some sort.

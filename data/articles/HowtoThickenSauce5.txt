 Using eggs as a thickening agent works best with custards, puddings, and rich cream sauces.
 As you whisk the egg, slowly ladle in small portions of your warm sauce (such as your Alfredo or pudding). This is called tempering the egg, which means that you slowly heat it so that you can add it to something hot without it immediately cooking and scrambling.
 Once youâ€™ve added enough liquid, continue whisking for a few seconds so that the egg is fully incorporated into the liquid.
 Bring the sauce to a boil and simmer until it has thickened.

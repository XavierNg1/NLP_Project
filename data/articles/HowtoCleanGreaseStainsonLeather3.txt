 To create a simple and effective homemade leather cleaning solution, you'll just need the basic ingredients to make a loaf of bread:









3/8 cup of distilled water
1/8 cup of sea salt
1/2 teaspoon white flour
1 tablespoon baking soda

, Use a spoon or fork and work your salt water, flour, and baking soda into a kind of a paste. This is highly effective in gently lifting grease from leather without affecting the leather grains of your item.









Alternatively, you can try a mixture

, Find a less visible spot on your item to "patch test" the cleaning solution of choice. If your leather is dyed in any way, any kind of cleaner can affect the color, so pick an out-of-the-way patch to test it on.
 Use a small amount of the mixture on the cloth and be extremely gentle. You want to use the same basic principle as the quick-fix method, gently dabbing and letting the cleaner do the work. Don't make it worse by scrubbing.
 Be gentle and allow the area to dry completely before attempting to clean again. It might take several applications to completely eradicate the stain, or shrink it considerably, but allow the leather time to rejuvenate before you clean it again.
 There are many different cleaning solution recipes used with varying degrees of success. Try different recipes if you can't get the spot as clean as you'd like. Use the same basic method for cleaning, but try different combinations of natural products you've got on hand.Some have reported success using:









Equal parts water and white vinegar
Equal parts lemon juice and cream of tartar













One part of vinegar to two parts of linseed oil

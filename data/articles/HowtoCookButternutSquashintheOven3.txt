 Line a large baking sheet with shallow sides using parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.
 Use a vegetable peeler to shave off the peel and a sharp knife to cut the squash into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices.

Cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top and bottom of the squash. Discard pieces.






Use a serrated vegetable peeler to remove the thick skin until you reveal the orange flesh beneath.






Use a metal spoon or melon-baller to scoop out the seeds and fibers inside.






Make width-wise slices, cutting from side to side, that are each about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.
 Drizzle the oil over the baking sheet and directly over the slices.


Olive oil works well, but you can also use walnut oil or other types of vegetable oil.
Drizzle half of the olive oil over the baking sheet. Dredge each slice in the oil, turning it over so that both sides get covered.






Drizzle the remaining oil directly over each slice.






If desired, you can also spray the slices with cooking spray.
 The amount of salt you use is a matter of personal taste, but start with anywhere from 1/2 to 1 tsp (2.5 to 5 ml) for the entire batch if you are uncertain.
 The slices should begin to turn a slight golden brown around the edges.
 Flip each slice and sprinkle with additional salt. Continue baking for 15 more minutes.


Use tongs to flip the slices since they will be too hot to handle with your bare hands.
 If your broiler has multiple settings, switch it to the low setting.
 The squash should begin to turn dark brown in some places.


Monitor the squash closely. If some portions cook faster than others, remove them first.
 After pulling the charbroiled slices out of the oven, let cool for 5 minutes or so and serve warm.

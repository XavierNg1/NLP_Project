 If reconciliation is absolutely impossible, and you’ve made every effort to resolve the conflict with your roommate, it may be necessary to agree to find a new living situation. This may involve moving to a new dorm room or apartment, or allowing your roommate to leave so that you can find a new one.
 Whether you live in an apartment or a dorm, there are policies in place that govern who is responsible for the property. If your names are both on a lease, or you are both assigned to a dorm room, then there are definitely rules that determine when and how you can move out. If you live in a dorm, make sure to understand the residence hall policies regarding roommate conflicts and changes. Some colleges will require you to go through the steps of mediation before requesting a roommate change, and others have trained students who will help you through the process.
If you live in an apartment and both of you are on the lease, notify your landlord or leasing office that one of you intends to move out, and inquire about whether or not a new roommate can move in. Most leases will allow for this, but have different procedures and policies.
If you live in an apartment and you split the deposit with your roommate, discuss how the deposit will be repaid to the tenant who is leaving. The leasing office may need to be involved in this process, so definitely check into this.
 Once you’ve separated from your roommate, try to remain on friendly terms. You may look back on your time together with fondness one day. Even though it didn’t work out, you shared a significant time together. Besides, sometimes even the best of friends simply don’t live well together.

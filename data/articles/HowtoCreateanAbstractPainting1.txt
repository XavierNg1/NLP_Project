 You can buy a ready made canvas of any size in a craft store. It will be prepared for immediate use; however, there are no rules saying you have to use a primed and stretched canvas. In fact, abstract artists often use unstretched, unprimed canvases.If you prefer a colored background, buy a jar of Gesso to prime the canvas and give it a touch of color. The primer should dry quickly.;
, Decide whether to use acrylics or oil paint. Acrylics have no odor and are easy to work with since they dry fast and can be painted over if you make a mistake. Oils, on the other hand, aren't usually used because they take longer to dry, have an odor, and do not allow you to paint over mistakes.
 Pick whatever brushes you like to use with the paint you've already chosen. You might also consider using a palette knife to apply paint, giving it a textured look. While some artists like to use an easel, many abstract artists choose to place their canvases directly on the floor in order to be closer to the work.If you're unsure about what colors work well together, think about picking up a color chart/wheel. This will actually show you which colors compliment each other.
 Depending on how messy you're planning on getting, it's wise to change into an old shirt or painting smock. Wearing something you're not worried about will allow you to focus more on the painting or process of abstract art.


You may want to lay down newspapers to prevent drips or spills, especially if you plan on flicking paint or laying the canvas on the ground.

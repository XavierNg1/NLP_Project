 If you use the Google Search app or Google Search bar on your Android device, you can change the language your results are displayed in. You can do this by opening the Google app, which you can find in your App Drawer.
 You can open the Google app menu by swiping in from the left, or by tapping â˜° on the left end of the search bar at the top of the app.
 A list of available languages will be displayed.
 This will only affect your search results. The Google app will still use whatever language your device is set to.
 If you want to change the menus and interface language in the Google app (and all of your other apps), you'll need to change your system language.


Open the Settings app on your device. You can find this on your Home screen or in the App Drawer.
Select "Language & input" and then tap the "Language" option at the top of the menu.
Select the language that you want the interface to use. This will apply to all of your apps and system settings.

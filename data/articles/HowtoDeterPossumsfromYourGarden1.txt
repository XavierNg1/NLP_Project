 Possums seem to be fond of new growth on deciduous vines, fruit on fruit trees, and some of the new growth on pruned evergreens. Possums damage the plants when they eat the new growth, so this needs to be prevented.Possums may remove all of the buds, thereby weakening the plant, creating bare patches, and making it easier for plant diseases to take hold.Keep this in mind when planting new plants in your yard or when planting a garden. If you plant things a possum doesn't like, such as prickly and smelly plants like a tea tree or geraniums for example, they are less likely to be destroyed.;
, For example, there are cloth bags that are made to cover individual fruits in a tree. Each one can be covered separately.This will stop the possums from getting to the fruit and does not interfere with the growth of the fruit.You can also use old plastic plant pots with a slit down the side to protect individual fruits or vegetables. Place the fruit inside the pot, so that it is mostly covered but can still grow.
 Instead of keeping possums out of your yard, you can just try to keep them out of specific garden beds. The best way to do this is to create a full enclosure out of chicken wire.


This may make tending your garden a little more difficult but it will assure that your plants survive.
 Possums may make their way into your eaves or other access points on your house or shed. Possums trying to get into your garden shed or house eaves can be deterred by covering openings with permanent covers, such as pieces of wood, or by using anti-bird netting over any holes or entrance points. Just make sure that the possums are not inside the shed or eaves when you cover them, as you could trap them inside.
If you're not sure how the possums are getting in, patrol the area at dusk and watch for possums leaving their den.

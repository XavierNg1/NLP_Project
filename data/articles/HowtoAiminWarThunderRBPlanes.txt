 One of the best ways to learn how to aim is simply by practicing. As time goes on, you will eventually get used to the bullet drop, and the muzzle velocity. Easy ways to practice include:


Creating a custom battle on realistic difficulty, and playing against bots until you get the feel of the guns.
Playing an arcade battle, but turning off the lead angle indicator in your options.
Playing realistic battles until you can aim properly.;
, It is hard to know how far to lead without developing an instinctive feel for where to aim. A good tip for leading when your enemy is in a hard bank, is to start your aim two plane lengths in front of the enemy, and try to keep it there. Since you won't be able to keep your aim two plane lengths in front of them, eventually you will hit the sweet spot, and get some hits. For jets, you have to lead twice as far ahead as you would for props. It takes some getting used too but if you start shooting approximately 2 seconds before the enemy plane passes through your cross hairs, you should get some hit.
Â Going head on is never a good idea, but sometimes you get forced into a head on situation. In 95% of head ons, you will have to aim slightly above their plane. This is because your bullets begin to drop as they leave the plane. By aiming slightly above the enemy, your bullets will "fall" into them. On the off chance your enemy is diving into the head on, you need to aim below them. Otherwise they will fall faster than your bullets and you will miss! Vertical targeting slightly negates this fall of your bullets as it angles the barrels of the guns upwards.
 Tracer belts light up like fire crackers when you shoot them, so you should be able to see where your bullets go, and correct your aim from that.

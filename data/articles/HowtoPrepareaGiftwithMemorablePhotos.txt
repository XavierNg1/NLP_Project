, Those can include photos of different emotions, different dressing styles, and past/present photos.


You may also want to keep photos of different occasions with other people, such as pictures of  achievements/awards and other special occasions.
 If something won't set for formatting, you can skip it. Try to format the photos in different shapes, which adds beauty to your gift.


You can use a program such as simple PowerPoint for formatting. In PowerPoint, you have different formatting tools, which make your photos look even more beautiful and the way you want them to look.
 Be sure to choose one that won't dominate your photo. Try choosing a background of the occasion for the gift, a background related to the gift receiver's favorite color/place, a background with more plain space, or a background filled with small units such as flowers or images.
 Arrange them in a beautiful pattern. Try to fix them in  an order of occasion/sequence. They should appear in a "go for overall" look, and not  in very different shapes (which may look odd).


Keep a minimum number of photos in order to leave some space for other additions.
 Decorate the remaining empty space with cute little things which the receiver loves, such as some cute cartoons holding flowers, the receiver's favorite items such as cars and pets, numbers/letters made with jewellery like pearls and diamonds, and God's idols.
 Border your background if you'd like, and if you want to show more creativity. Choose the border which suits your background. Select it depending upon the occasion/anything which may highlight your background.
 See the bigger picture like a slideshow, based on what you have done with all the beautiful fillings. Choose whether you want to give the gift printed on a cup, or in the form of a lamination photo frame. This may help you decide on your size limits and pixel of your creation.

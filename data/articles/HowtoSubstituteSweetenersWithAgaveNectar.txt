 batter, dough, liquid, etc. The best substitutions are sauces, syrups, some drinks, desserts, and salad dressings. Mostly because of their liquid states.


Liquid Sweeteners






Honey - Substitute 1 for 1, like replace a cup of honey with a cup of agave syrup.
Maple Syrup - Substitute 1 for 1, like replace a cup of maple syrup with a cup of agave syrup.
Brown Rice Syrup - When you replace a cup of brown rice syrup, use 1/2 to 1/3 as much agave, and increase other liquids in the recipe by up to 1/2 a cup.
Corn Syrup - When you replace a cup of light corn syrup, be sure to use 1/2 as much agave, and increase other liquids in the recipe by up to 1/3 of a cup. Like corn syrup, agave nectar will not crystallize.


Granulated Sweeteners

White Granulated Sugar - For each cup of white sugar that you are replacing, use 2/3 of a cup of agave and reduce other liquids by 1/4 to 1/3 cup. This substitution will also work for Demerara Sugar, Turbinado Sugar, Evaporated Cane Juice, or Sucanat.
Brown Sugar - For each cup of brown sugar replaced, use 2/3 of a cup of agave and reduce other liquids by 1/4 cup. Because the moisture content of Brown Sugar is higher than that of white sugar, liquids may not have to be reduced as much when substituting agave nectar.

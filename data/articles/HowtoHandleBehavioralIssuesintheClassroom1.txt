 This is because it will put pressure on students to comply with the classroom rules and procedures since they know they are being watched. This strategy is a preventative strategy, meaning that it will help prevent negative behavior from occurring.


Intervene immediately if one student is bothering or bullying another.
Students may act out if they feel that you aren't paying enough attention to them.;
, Students may behave oddly because they are overwhelmed, or it's the only way to communicate.


Flopping on the floor or noncompliance usually mean that a student is overwhelmed, and may need a short break.
Drinking from the sink probably means they are thirsty.
Difficulty staying in their seat probably means they need more activity in their day.
 Move around as you teach, and don't leave your back facing the class for long periods of time (Evertson 135).
 This will allow you to help students who need it, but also keep an eye out for warning signs of stress. It may be difficult to monitor students during individual work as well, since some students may need extra help and attention than others, who may become jealous.


Encourage students to ask their neighbor for help before asking you (Evertson 135).

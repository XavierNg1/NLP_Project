 Both green and black olives may be cured in brine, a mixture of salt and water that preserves the olives and gives them a salty taste. This method takes longer than water brining, but it's the best method to use for ripe olives. Manzanillo, mission, and kalamata olives are commonly cured in brine.


Inspect the olives to make sure that they are as unbruised as possible. Look for holes left by insects or birds. If the olives were treated with chemicals, rinse them off before you begin the brining process.
You may want to sort the olives by size. A batch of olives will cure more evenly if all the olives are a similar size.
 In order for the brine to be able to reach the insides of the olives, you'll need to slit the olives to let the moisture in. Make a vertical cut down the olive using a sharp knife; make sure not to cut the pit.
 They need to be stored in containers that can be sealed against the air, and glass is best for this purpose. Pack the olives into jars, leaving an inch of space at the top.
 Mix 3/4 cup of pickling salt with a gallon of cold water. Pour the brine into the jars so that it completely covers the olives. Seal the jars and store them in a cool, dark place, such as the pantry or cellar.
 During this time the olives will begin to brine. Leave the jars undisturbed to allow the salt and water to seep into the olives.
 After one week, drain the olives and discard the medium brine, which will be full of bitter flavor. Keep the olives in the same glass containers.
 Mix 1 1/2 cups of pickling salt with one gallon of water. Pour the strong brine over the olives to completely cover them. Seal the containers.
 Keep them in a cool place out of sunlight. At the end of two months, taste an olive to determine whether the bitterness level suits your taste. If not, change the brine again and store the olives for another month or two. This process can be repeated until you're happy with the way the olives taste.

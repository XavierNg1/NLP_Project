 There are a number of different Apple and Android-based mobile devices that you can use. Each of these devices has its own accessibility features, some of which might work better for you than others.The accessibility features should be intuitive and easy to locate on your phone or tablet, so you can adjust them as necessary. Unlike with a computer, you may need to adjust your settings more frequently to account for changing lights and other circumstances that affect your ability to see your screen.
Look for the device that is not only accessible, but also feels right for you to hold and carry around.
 Immediately after purchasing a new tablet or smartphone, open the accessibility menu and work with the vision settings until you can see and navigate your screen properly.If the text on the menu is too small for you to see before you make adjustments, ask someone to help you. Many retailers will help you set up your new device at new extra charge after your purchase is complete.
 With a wireless keyboard, your device will be just as accessible as your computer is. You'll have access to all the same applications, features, and shortcut keys that you already know., Especially if you don't have much experience using computers, you may have trouble remembering keyboard shortcuts or navigating accessibility menus. A device with a voice-activated speaker can enable you to use the internet without needing any of these features.These home devices, such as Google Home or Amazon Echo, are connected to your home wi-fi. By speaking to them and asking them questions, you can use them to access the internet to get information and buy products or services.
You also can use these devices to listen to music or podcasts, as well as having them read news and entertainment articles to you.

 The "it" person is the person who must find the hiders in their hiding spots, but who now has more of a job to do. Make sure at least three or more people are playing, but do not include too many, lest the game become too crowded and difficult.;
, The "it" person must close their eyes and count to a certain number. Ten is the most popular number used. When the "it" person is counting, this is the chance for the people hiding to go and hide. The "it" person must also count out loud.
 and seek the people hiding. The people hiding are allowed to move spots if found, as the game is slightly changed. The "it" person must tag one of the people hiding in order for that person to be "it".
 However, it's not recommended for the people hiding to continually change hiding spots, or the game will become unfair and hard for the "it" person. The person hiding is allowed to run if they are found by the "it" person.
 Like hide and seek, it's possible to cheat in Hide and Seek Tiggy. Cheating is either changing spots or using certain tactics to ensure you are never "it", but the ways to cheat will not be revealed on here.
 This game has no time limit, and neither does hide and seek.

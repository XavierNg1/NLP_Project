Long-term side effects may include: increased risk for heart disease and decreased kidney function.A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that may give you a more effective diet for weight loss or help you include healthy, lean sources of protein into your high-protein, meat-focused weight loss plan.

, When you're trying to lose weight, even with a meat-based diet, it's crucial to have a nutritionally balanced meal plan. Writing down a few sample days can help you plan accordingly and help you to include a variety of foods and lean meats.


Take a few hours of your free time to write up your meal plan. Include lean meat and protein in most or all of your meals.
Also make sure to include a variety of fruits, vegetables, dairy and 100% whole grains (if you're including these in your diet). Consuming a variety of foods from each food group is essential for a balanced diet.

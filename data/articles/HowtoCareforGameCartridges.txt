 Remember not to think of a cartridge's extra mass compared to discs as armor. They are still sensitive to heat and battering, and the bottom is always opened up, exposing the chip.;
, Make sure to never turn off the console while you are saving. You could lose data. To prevent burning out or shorting the cartridge's internal chip make sure the console is off before removing the cartridge.
 Load the cartridges directly into the system so the chip goes in place. If a cartridge resists insertion, do not force it. Make sure it is around the right way, and if the problem is somewhere persists the cartridge or the console may have been damaged.
, Use Windex or other similar off brand cleaner on a Q-Tip to clean the connector. Do not spray liquid directly on contacts, and avoid excessive liquid. Simply blowing into the cartridge opening can remove most dust, but be careful not to spit, as this can cause extra damage.
 Many third-party companies sell cartridge cases. These offer and extra level of protection from dust, heat and general damage. You can still purchase cartridges for many consoles, such as the N64 and the Game Boy Advance.

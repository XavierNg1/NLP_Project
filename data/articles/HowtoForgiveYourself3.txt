 As the philosopher Derrida once said: “Forgiveness is often confounded, sometimes in a calculated fashion, with related themes: excuse, regret, amnesty, prescription, etc.” .


Forgiveness is a two-way street. You may not be able to forgive yourself unless you learn to forgive others. You may need to let others into your life to help give you the support and structure to forgive yourself.
Talk to loved ones to support yourself while you grapple with self-forgiveness.
 To forgive yourself, you must be aware of what you need to forgive. Writing out a detailed step-by-step guide may help you focus on what is important and give you the structure for an apology to yourself or others. Take into consideration the following aspects of creating a solution to ask forgiveness:


Declare or ask for the apology using direct language. Do not step around the issue. Say “I’m sorry” or ask “Do you forgive me?” directly. You do not want to be ambiguous or come across as insincere.
Investigate how you can actually fix a solution. If you are asking forgiveness from another, figure out specific actions that can help make amends. If you are forgiving yourself, ask yourself what steps you need to take to move forward with a healthier outlook on life.
Promise yourself and others that you will strive to be better in the future. An apology is empty if you will not follow through with it. Make sure you do not repeat the same mistakes.
 If you ask for forgiveness for others, you will feel better about yourself.


Sometimes, clearing the air can help to resolve an existing issue. It may also help to show that you were internalizing a bigger issue than was actually present. Asking for forgiveness has been proven to bring more favorable outcomes and provide stronger relationships

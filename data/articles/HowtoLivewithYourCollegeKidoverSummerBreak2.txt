 Instead of being an authoritative adult, listen to and respect your kid’s decisions, ideas and opinions. Additionally, try to avoid doing everything for them and spoiling them.For example, let them make dinner for themselves a couple nights a week.
If you are discussing an important topic, listen to what they have to say and then give them your opinion.
 Try to avoid bothering your kid about household and work responsibilities once they get home. Instead, let your kid take it easy for a week. This will allow them time to unwind from the stress of finals, as well as time to adjust to the changes of being home again.For example, instead of bothering them about sleeping in, let them sleep in the first week they are home.
 Don’t expect your kid to get a full-time summer job or a paid internship right away. Give them time to find work that they like and want to do. Let finding work be their responsibility.Also, be aware that today many internships are unpaid. However, they look great on a resume. So try not to give your kid a hard time for not finding a paid job or internship. Instead, be supportive and congratulate your kid for their effort and motivation.

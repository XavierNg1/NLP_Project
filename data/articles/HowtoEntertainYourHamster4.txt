 Pet your hamster and talk softly to it.
 Just hang out there together. You can meditate or relax, your hamster can explore safely in the confines of the closet.


Lift up long-hanging clothes unless you want your hamster climbing up them in no time, possibly ripping them if they're delicate.
 Let your hamster have free roaming rights as you sit and do your homework.


Be sure to let others know to knock before entering, to give you time to find your hamster and put it back safely in its cage.

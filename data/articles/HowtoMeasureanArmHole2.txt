 Choose a shirt with comfortable, appropriately sized arm holes. Spread this shirt out flat over a hard surface, like a table or desk.


Smooth out the material so that there is no bunching around the Armhole area.
The sleeve length of the shirt does not matter. It can even be sleeveless as long as it has an actual Armhole. Do not use a tank top with spaghetti straps, a halter top, or a strapless top, though.
This method is good to use if you do not have a helper to assist you in taking a traditional Armhole measurement.
 Make sure that the front of the shirt faces up. Position the starting (zero) end of the tape measure at the top of the Armhole seam, then carefully adjust the tape measure along the curve of the seam until it reaches the bottom.


You will need to keep the tape measure on its side as you wind it around the Armhole seam.
Keep the tape measure aligned to this seam as precisely as possible.
The resulting measurement corresponds to your Armhole depth. It is only about half of your full measurement, though.
 Flip the shirt over to the back. Smooth it out, then measure the back Armhole seam with your tape measure.


As before, position the starting end of the tape at the top of the Armhole seam. Extend the tape down the curve of the seam until it reaches the bottom.
Your front and back Armhole depth will usually be the same. The back Armhole depth can occasionally be larger by as much as 5/8 inch (1.6 cm), though, so it is best to take both measurements separately just to be safe.
 Add the front Armhole depth and back Armhole depth together to calculate your total Armhole measurement.


This is only an estimate of your true Armhole measurement, so it is not quite as accurate as a traditional measurement would be. Nonetheless, this estimate should still produce satisfactory results in most instances.

 If the lock in question is not attached to your own home, secure permission from the property owner before proceeding. Breaking and entering is a crime!

, Bobby pins or hair pins work best, but you can also use heavy-duty paperclips, or other stiff bits of wire. First create your pick by opening out one of the bobby pins or paperclips until it is straight. Then bend the last 1/8" of the pick up at a 20 degree angle. If you are using a hair pin with plastic-dipped ends, you will need to scrape the plastic from the end of the pick first using a pair of pliers, the ground, or even your teeth, in a pinch.
 Take another bobby pin, or open up a paper clip and then fold it in half, and bend this into an L-shape. The tension wrench needs to be fairly sturdy, so make sure and use a heavy-duty paper clip or hair pin. You can also use a small flat-head screwdriver, or similar item that fits into the bottom of the keyhole as a tension wrench. 







, First insert the tension wrench into the bottom part of the lock, and rotate it in the direction you would turn the key to unlock it to place tension on the lock. Maintain this tension throughout the process. Then slowly wiggle the pick into the top part of the lock using a gentle up-and-down motion. You should hear a series of clicks as the various pins in the lock are raised. When you have successfully raised all of the pins, the tension wrench will suddenly rotate freely and unlock the door.









It is possible to pick most locks in a matter of seconds, but it takes a little practice. If you get frustrated, just take a deep breath and start again.
This technique also works on many deadbolts and padlocks, as well.
Picking a lock in this fashion looks extremely suspicious, and is likely to result in your neighbors calling the police. If you are a kid, call your parents and let them know what's going on before you start, and be prepared to show the police proof that you are breaking into your own home, garage, etc.

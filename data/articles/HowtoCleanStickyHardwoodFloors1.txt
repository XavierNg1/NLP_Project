Opt for a pH neutral soap that is vegetable based. Mix ¼ cup or 60 milliliters of dish soap in a bucket of warm water to create an effective cleaning solution., Vinegar may prematurely dull or damage hardwood floors. It can, however, be an effective way to clean sticky floors. Try mixing ½ cup (120 mL) of white vinegar with 1 gallon (4 L) of warm water. Use a soft, nonabrasive cloth to scrub the sticky area.

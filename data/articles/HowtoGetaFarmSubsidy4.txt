 The FSA administers many different programs that provide disaster relief. You can find summaries on this convenient fact sheet: http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/disaster_assistance_program.pdf. Generally, the following programs are available:


Funding to rehabilitate damaged farmland.
Funding to restore rural private forests destroyed by natural disasters.
Emergency assistance for producers of livestock, honeybees, and farm-raised fish.
Emergency loans to help producers recover from losses caused by natural disasters.
Assistance to orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate.
Compensation for grazing losses suffered due to drought or fire on Federally managed land.
 Each disaster program has different eligibility requirements which cannot be summarized here. You should stop into your FSA office to check whether you qualify. To qualify, you generally must be in areas designated by FSA as eligible for disaster relief. There are also requirements for eligible livestock. For example, the following livestock are covered for grazing losses due to drought or fire under the livestock forage disaster program:alpacas

, You must submit a completed application and required supporting documentation to your local FSA office. There will be different deadlines depending on which disaster program you are applying for.


For example, you must submit your application within 30 days after the end of the calendar year in which you suffered a loss if you are seeking assistance under the livestock forage disaster program.If you are applying for tree assistance, then you must apply within 90 days of the disaster or when it became apparent that you suffered a loss.

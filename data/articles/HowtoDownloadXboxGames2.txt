 You can reach it at marketplace.xbox.com.
 Make sure it's the same account associated with your Xbox console.
 You can purchase Xbox 360 and Xbox One games from the website.
 Games will be organized into a variety of categories, or you can search for a specific title.


There are a bunch of free demos available on the Xbox 360 that you can download without a credit card, as well as some free-to-play games (though these aren't sorted into a free-to-play category).
If you have an Xbox Live Gold account, there will be free games available for you to download each month.
 You'll be asked to confirm that you want to purchase the game. If you have money in your Xbox Live account's wallet, that will be used to purchase the game. If you don't you will need to provide another payment method.


If you've previously purchased the game, you can begin downloading it immediately.
Even if the game is free, you will need to "Buy" it to confirm that you are adding it to your account.
 If you purchase an Xbox One game, it will begin downloading automatically as long as your Xbox One is connected to the internet. For the Xbox 360, you'll want to check your download queue:


Click the "My Account" link underneath your profile name after purchasing the game.
Click the "Manage devices" option.
Select "Xbox 360 Download Queue". This will display all of the items set to download to your console. You can adjust the order if you'd like.

 This method is not guaranteed to return gunpowder. Gunpowder is randomly available in chests, as one of many possible items. But you'll at least get something else for your efforts even if there is no gunpowder!

, Dungeons are small underground structures made from cobblestone or mossy stone. They only spawn within solid blocks, so mining may be a more effective way to find them than exploring caves.In the upcoming 1.9 edition for PC, you can also find gunpowder in desert temple chests., Each dungeon has a monster spawner that sends out a steady supply of mobs. Fight your way to the spawner and place a torch on it to stop more monsters from showing up.
 Alternatively, if you want to avoid the spawner, dig around the sides of the dungeon to reach the chests. Chests are usually located around the walls of the dungeon, allowing you quick access and getaway if you come in from the sides.
 This is the fastest way to collect the loot and chest. If there is gunpowder inside it, you have got what you came for!

 This will form a decorative waistband that you'll attach to the leggings with hot glue. You can cut any pattern you desire into the sequin fabric, like wavy lines or straight lines, for example.


You'll need the gold sequin fabric to be long enough to fit around the waistband of your leggings., Lay the leggings out flat on your work surface with the front side facing up. Apply a line of hot glue to the waistband of the leggings. Then:


Quickly press the front of your cut, gold sequin decorative waistband into place on top of it. Take care not to burn yourself on hot glue.
Repeat this process on the reverse side of the leggings so that your gold sequin waistband wraps all the way around and is on top of the waistband of the leggings., If you find your pants to be a little plain, you can accent them in the same way you did to the top of the costume. You could use more circular, gold dot stickers, perhaps up and down the side of each leg.


You might also want to use your glue to attach other decorations, like fake gemstones and more.

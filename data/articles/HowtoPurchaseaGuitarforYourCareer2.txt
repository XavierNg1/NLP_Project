 Using your likes and dislikes ideas, start searching guitars that match what you like, even if you like just one certain part about it. Play that guitar or something similar to it to get a general idea of what you like about. Also search multiple guitars on-line as you would when physically browsing.
 For example, if you are broader shouldered than most, you may like guitars that are V or X shaped, much like a flying v or explorer type since they are wider than LP or strat styles.
 After searching and evaluating guitars start to diminish your selection to just a few that briefly matches most of your likes. If there are a few dislikes keep those guitars with the same selection. Keep doing this until you just have a few left to ponder over. When it comes down to the last, one or two dislikes doesn't particularly matter, your final option would just be the one that is the most favorable.
 Upon using your likes and dislikes for the guitar and the price also, purchase that guitar immediately, you'll never know who will take that guitar before you after all that work you've done to find that guitar or when the company will diminish that line of guitar. You don't particularly need to purchase the guitar, if you are just browsing an expensive guitar for example.

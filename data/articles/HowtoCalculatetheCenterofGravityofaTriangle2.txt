 Remember, the median is a line drawn from the midpoint of a side to the opposite vertex. You can use any median in the triangle.
 Make sure the measurement is exact.

For example, you might have a median that is 3.6 cm long.
 To do this, divide the length by three. Again, make an exact calculation. If you round, you will not find the center of gravity.

For example, if your median is 3.6 cm long, you would divide 3.6 by 3:3.6cm/3=1.2cm{\displaystyle 3.6cm/3=1.2cm}, so ⅓ of the median is 1.2 cm.
 This point is the triangle's centroid, which will always divide a median into a 2:1 ratio; that is, the centroid is ⅓ the median’s distance from the midpoint, and ⅔ the median’s distance from the vertex.For example, on a median that is 3.6 cm long, the centroid will be 1.2 cm up from the midpoint.

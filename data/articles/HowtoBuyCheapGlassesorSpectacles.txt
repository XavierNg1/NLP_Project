,, The Optician cannot refuse to give you this as you,or the N.H.S., have paid them for this test and you are entitled to a copy of the results of this test.
 The optician who tests your eyes must supply this and must allow you to take it away so you can give it to whoever supplies your specs. Without this you will have to pay the full amount.
 They will have catalogues with the frame styles pictured and you should be able to send for a frame sample if you want or perhaps use their website to look at a picture of yourself with different frame styles superimposed onto your face.

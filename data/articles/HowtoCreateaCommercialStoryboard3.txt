 Most people use drawing applications on their computers or purchase commercial storyboard software.


Drawing applications will allow users to sketch directly on the computer screen using a mouse or stylus and makes frames easy to delete, modify or rearrange. Some applications also allow you to add extensive notes under each frame or image.
Commercial storyboard software will usually already have templates for you to use and include numerous built-in tools designed specifically for commercial production.

 High-quality science might come from trusted governments, universities, individuals, peer-reviewed journals, and some nonprofit organizations. When checking a book or article for quality, it should be written by someone with significant experience in their scientific field. If youâ€™re reading a scientific article or textbook, the scientist who authored it should have a PhD and long experience at a university or research institution.Lay publications will, of course, likely be written by someone without a PhD. The author might even be a student. If the lay publication is trusted, you may consider it a reliable source.
Choosing high-quality sources means someone has already verified the science for you before you read it.
 Poor quality sources are those which have a vested interest in the scientific results or data they are verifying or refuting. For instance, if you read science produced by a fossil fuel company regarding the polluting impact of their products, the company is producing scientific research which could directly impact its fortunes. In such a situation, you should be skeptical of the data.Good sources will provide a high degree of transparency, and include disclaimers regarding funding sources. They will also name all participants in the scientific research.
 One way to verify the science you read is to check it against other sources on the topic. After reading a scientific article or publication, look the topic up in an encyclopedia or another trusted text. This way, you will learn what the consensus view on the subject is.Comparing the science you read against many other publications will help you determine whether the science you read is consistent with mainstream scientific thought.

 One common application used to convert BIN files is Power ISO. It’s a program that turns BIN files into ISO file formats, a much more readable file version. You can download Power ISO for free here: http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm.;
, Your computer’s installation wizard should run and install Power ISO on your computer.
 After the installation process is finished, click the shortcut icon from your desktop to open the application.
 Click “Tools” from the menu bar on the upper-left corner of the Power ISO window and select “Convert” from the drop-down list to open the Convert menu.
 This will open an Explorer window.
 Using the Explorer window, navigate to the location on your computer where the BIN file is, select the BIN file, and click “OK” to open it on Power ISO.
 Back on the Convert Menu window, set the destination file to “ISO” by clicking the appropriate radio button.
 Type in the name you want for the output ISO file on the text field provided at the lower part of the Convert Menu window.
 Click the “OK” button to start converting the BIN file into ISO.

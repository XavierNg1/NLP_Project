 Compound interest means that as your interest is earned, the interest goes back into the account, and you begin earning (or paying) interest on top of interest. As a simple example, if you deposit $100 at 5% interest per year, then at the end of one year you will earn $5 interest. If you return that to the account, then at the end of the second year, you will earn 5% of $105, not just the original $100. Over time, this can increase quite substantially.The formula for calculating the value (A) of compounding interest is:


A=P(1+rn)nt{\displaystyle A=P(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{nt}}




, As with simple interest, the calculation begins with the amount of the principal. The calculation is the same, whether you are calculating interest on money borrowed or money loaned. The principal amount is generally denoted with the variable P{\displaystyle P}., The interest rate must be agreed upon at the outset and should be presented in a decimal number for calculation. Recall that the percent number can be converted to a decimal by dividing by 100 (or, as a shortcut, moving the decimal point two places to the left). Make sure that you know the length of time that the interest rate applies to. The rate is noted algebraically as r{\displaystyle r}.For example, a credit card may advertise interest of 15% per year. However, interest is generally applied each month, so you may want to know the monthly interest rate. In that case, divide by 12, to find the monthly interest rate of 1.25% per month. These two rates, 15% per year or 1.25% per month, are equivalent to each other.
 Compounding interest means that the interest will be calculated periodically and added back to the principal amount. For some loans, this may happen once a year. For some, it may happen each month or each quarter. You need to know how many times a year the interest will be compounded.If interest is compounded annually, then n=1.

If interest is compounded quarterly, for example, then n=4.
 The term is the length of time for which the interest will be calculated. The term is generally measured in years. If you need to calculate interest for some other length of time, you will need to convert into years.For example, for a loan of one year, then t=1{\displaystyle t=1}. But, for a term of 18 months, then t=1.5{\displaystyle t=1.5}.
 Suppose, for this example, you deposit $5,000 into a savings account that pays 5%, compounded monthly. What will be the value of this account after three years?First, identify the variables that you need to solve the problem. In this case:


P=$5,000{\displaystyle P=\$5,000}


r=0.05{\displaystyle r=0.05}


n=12{\displaystyle n=12}


t=3{\displaystyle t=3}




, Once you have understood the situation and identified the variables, enter them into the formula to find the amount of the interest.

For the problem started above, this would look as follows:


A=P(1+rn)nt{\displaystyle A=P(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{nt}}


A=5000(1+0.0512)12âˆ—3{\displaystyle A=5000(1+{\frac {0.05}{12}})^{12*3}}


A=5000(1+0.00417)36{\displaystyle A=5000(1+0.00417)^{36}}


A=5000(1.00417)36{\displaystyle A=5000(1.00417)^{36}}


A=5000(1.1616){\displaystyle A=5000(1.1616)}


A=5808{\displaystyle A=5808}



Thus, after three years, compound interest will have amounted to $808, in addition to the original $5,000 deposit.

 The microwave will heat the butter from the outside in, so chop the butter into several pieces to increase the surface area that can be heated. This will reduce uneven heating, although you still shouldn't expect perfectly even heating in a microwave.
 Place the butter into a microwave-safe dish, then cover with a paper towel. Butter may splatter during the rapid melting a microwave causes. The paper towel should protect the microwave’s interior from these splashes.
 Microwave ovens are much faster at melting butter than the stovetop, but also much more likely to cause burning, separation, or other problems. Start out cautiously by setting the microwave to "low" or "defrost" if possible, then microwave your butter for ten seconds.
 The butter has most likely not melted by now, but because butter melts at a relatively low temperature, each ten second interval can have a dramatic effect. Stir to evenly distribute the heat and see if there are any chunks.



Note: remember to remove silverware from the bowl before returning it to the microwave.
 Replace the paper towel and zap the butter for another ten seconds, or five seconds if the butter is nearly done. Keep checking on progress until there are only tiny chunks remaining. Remove the dish carefully from the microwave, as it may be hot.
 The tiny pieces remaining can be melted with the residual heat. Stir the butter until the entire dish is golden and liquid.


Butter with greasy droplets or white residue on the surface has been microwaved too long. It can still be used for sautéing  or adding flavor to savory dishes, but may negatively affect the texture of baked goods.

 Some linen clothes have a lining on the inside. If you have pieces of clothing like this, you can turn them inside out to reduce wrinkling. This is especially helpful when you have to pack a suit jacket with a lining. Stick your arm in each sleeve, grabbing the cuff, and pull the sleeve inside out as you remove your arm.


Place lined linen on top of all other clothing.
 How much you have to fold will depend on the size of your suitcase, but aim for only 1 or 2 folds. For pants, fold in half lengthwise so the legs line up, then either fold in half from waist to cuff or in thirds. For shirts, fold sleeves across torso and try to fold up the bottom third only. For suit jackets, fold in half lengthwise so the sides lay with the shoulders matching up.
 If you only have 1 or 2 linen items, take one and drape it, unfolded, over both sides of the suitcase. Place a few other non-linen items on top of the linen item. Fold the remaining portions of the linen item over the other clothes. You can repeat this as you have room.


This helps the linen clothes by letting them form lighter creases than if they were folded up tight.

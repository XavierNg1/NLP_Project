 It will consist of a small ladder, a bar, and a sling.In order to adjust the height of the sling handles that hold the dog's abdomen, put some nails along the bar. Securely fasten the nails (or screws) along the areas where the handles hang off the bar. You will want to be able to move the handles further apart to raise your dog's rear end up, so each nail should be a few inches apart, so that the height can be adjusted gradually.
 If your dog can't walk on its front legs, then you will need to carry your dog to put it in position.
 You will want to hook the handles on the nails on the bar, beginning at the positions that are closest together.
 Put the handles at different positions on the bar, moving one side at a time, one nail at a time, until the dog's rear end is supported by the sling. When positioned correctly, the dog's rear end should be supported but not so high that their back feet are more than a few inches off the ground.


You should be supporting the back weight of your dog while you adjust the sling. Use one arm to hold the dog up while you use the other to move the sling handles.
 Your potty station should hold the dog up securely.
 The dog will learn to fall back and let the sling will hold it at the right position. The sling should be positioned so that the bladder is right behind the sling area and hence easy to locate and express.


The whole process takes only 5 minutes to accomplish, and if necessary, one person can do it by himself (for a 70 pound dog!).

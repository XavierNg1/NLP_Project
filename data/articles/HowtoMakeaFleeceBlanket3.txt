 The edges don't have to line up perfectly, but they should be reasonably close. Insert a straight pin every few inches to secure the pieces together.









If you can't identify the right side of the fabric, ask the staff before you leave the fabric store. You can also wash the fleece several times, then select the most attractive (least pilled) side of the fabric as your "right" side.
 Use a uniform 1/2" to 1" (1.25 - 2.5 cm) seam allowance. You have two options for how to finish the fourth edge:









Turn the blanket inside out through the open edge. Hand- or machine-stitch all the way along the final edge, securing the two pieces together.
Stitch along the fourth edge, leaving a 4-inch (10.16 centimeter) opening. Turn the blanket inside out through this opening, so both right sides face out. Hand-finish the 4-inch opening with a blanket or whip stitch.

Or skip the sewing entirely. Cut 1/2" to 3/4" (1.25 - 1.9 cm) wide fringe on all sides of the blanket. Tie the two pieces of fleece together, one paired set of fringe ties at a time. See below for directions.

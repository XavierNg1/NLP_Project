 If you are studying for a test that will be held in a quiet room with a ticking clock, it will be easier to recall the information if you study in a similar environment, like a library or study-hall.Try not to study on the couch or sitting on your bed, since you will probably be taking the test at a desk.
 This means you break a piece of information, like the number 8374668809, into smaller chunks: 834 466 8809. You can better remember the information in smaller groups than as one long sequence, or by each individual piece of information.Identify the larger similarities in the information you are trying to memorize--like a significant date or location--and categorize the remaining information under these headings., Mnemonic devices are tricks used to organize information into easy to remember statements, images, or words. A common mnemonic device is Every Good Boy Does Fine, which presents the musical notes on a treble clef (EGBDF) in a simple statement.


There are almost limitless ways to come up with mnemonic devices. Try making up rhymes, creating acronyms, or an easy to recall visual image.
 Instead of a single marathon cramming session, which can exhaust your brain, schedule yourself for two study sessions with a break in between. You can learn twice as much information in two three-hour study sessions than you can in one six-hour study session., Just reading the information isn't always enough--you need to make sense of it, too.Summarizing requires you to think about what you've just read, distill it to the essentials, and re-learn it.When you've finished reading, try to look at the subject from the broadest perspective (this is a book about history) and then keep narrowing it down (this a chapter about World War II; this is a section about the Battle of the Bulge) until you are examining the important lessons, themes, and facts you should take away (this was the last great German offensive, the massive casualties destroyed the German Army).If you don't want to mark your text book, summarize each paragraph in a notebook. You can even rip this page out and carry it in your pocket to study on-the-go.

 Wash 3 ripe tomatoes and 1/4 pound (113 g) of mushrooms. Slice the mushrooms and chop the tomatoes. Place them in a 4-quart slow cooker. You'll also need to chop 1/2 cup (50 g) of peeled shallots. Put the shallots in the slow cooker with the vegetables.If you don't have shallots you can substitute one peeled white or yellow onion.
 Add the rest of the seasonings to the crock pot and stir the mixture together. You'll need to add:Â½ cup (120 ml) dry white wine OR vermouth
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons onion powder
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried parsley
Salt and pepper to taste

, Put 4 chicken thighs into the slow cooker and turn them over, so they're coated in seasoning. Put the lid on and turn the slow cooker on to LOW for 6 to 7 hours. Or you could turn it to HIGH for about 4 hours.If you want to use a whole chicken instead of just the thighs, cut the chicken into serving-sized pieces.
 Insert a digital thermometer into a thick piece of chicken to see if it's finished cooking. The chicken should be at least 165 degrees F (70 C). You can serve the chicken marengo with cooked rice, pasta, or crusty bread.

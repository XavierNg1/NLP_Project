 In 2012, the best time to spot these meteors in is October 21, 2012, before dawn., Check the moon phase to see if its brightness might interfere with seeing the meteors. In 2012, waxing crescent moon setting before midnight will create a dark sky ripe for meteor watching.If the weather is going to be cloudy in your area, though, you might be out of luck. If it's only cloudy on the peak night, you can try watching the meteors on other nights between the 17th and the 25th., The further you get away from city lights, the better you'll be able to see the meteors. In the Northern Hemisphere, you'll want a spot where you have a clear view in an east/southeast direction (no trees or tall buildings on the horizon). In the Southern Hemisphere, you'll need to look in the east/northeast direction., That's the best time to spot meteors because Earth moves into the debris field as it rotates into sunlight., The easiest thing to spot might be Orion's belt, a group of three stars in a straight line. Envision this belt as the "waist" of an hourglass. In the Northern Hemisphere, the hourglass will lean to the left. In the Southern Hemisphere, it'll lean to the right. To test yourself, try finding the Orion constellation in the introduction image of this article.
 The radiant is the central point from which the meteors will emanate. In the Northern Hemisphere, it'll be just left of the hourglass, as if the upper left hand star is pointing to it. In the Southern Hemisphere, it'll be below the hourglass, as if the lower right corner is pointing to it. (These approximations are given for mid-hemisphere latitudes; the orientation will vary slightly depending on how far you are away from that latitude.)

 Alternately, have a rag or piece of old clothing nearby. Use this to clean pastels from your fingers, as needed.Also clean off the pastel sticks as needed.
 Make the underpainting of your drawing. Then slowly build up layers and colors to create depth and intensity. Add a background last to make your object really stick out with defined edges.For example, draw a loose sketch of a light-colored piece of fruit. Create shading with colors. Finish up with a dark background.
Another technique is to make the background first using oil pastel in one direction. Then layer more colors on top. Try both techniques and see which one works best for you!, Put your artwork in the refrigerator for twenty minutes. Then warm your pastels in your hands to achieve better coverage.Use this technique if your paper isn’t allowing you to add more layers.
 Draw freehand by sketching with light pressure to the edge of the pastel’s tip. Make choppy, tiny markings to achieve a stippled look.Create “blanket” strokes by making thick, fast squiggles. Use thick, vertical strokes to create hatching.Blanket strokes and hatching work well for backgrounds.
Experiment with different strokes and pressure on a scrap sheet.
 You can blend and mix colors on your paper or on a palette first. Practice using blending to make shadows and reflections. You can make a final blending with baby oil or other liquids.Try the baby oil blending technique on a practice drawing first. Soak a cotton swab in baby oil. Smooth it over your work to blend. Allow it to dry overnight.
Use water for a smooth wash of color. Try turpentine, linseed or other oils for oil pastels that aren’t water soluble.

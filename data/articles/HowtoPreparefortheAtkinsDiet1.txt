, This will help you to determine your long-term weight loss goal. You should consult a healthy weight chart from a reputable organization like the National Institutes for Health or talk to your doctor to determine your healthy weight range.
 Choose a goal near the middle of your healthy weight range. You can always choose to lose more weight later.
 If your long-term weight loss goal is too overwhelming, setting smaller goals can help to keep you motivated. For instance, work on losing 1 dress size or work to lose 10 pounds. Then, set another short-term goal. As you continuously string these short-term goals together, you will eventually meet your long-term weight loss goal.
 For example, if your first short-term goal is to lose 1 dress size, visualize yourself fitting comfortably into your clothing or imagine buying yourself a new outfit in your new size. Having a vision of what meeting your goals will be like will also help to keep you motivated.

, Gastrointestinal stasis is a serious condition in rabbits. If you see any of the symptoms, or suspect that your rabbit has gastrointestinal stasis, you need to get your rabbit to the veterinarian as soon as possible. This is an emergency and needs to be treated immediately.


Hesitating or taking a wait-and-see approach may kill your rabbit.
 If you notice the changes in your rabbit and take him to the vet, the vet can treat GI stasis. With treatment, your bunny can get better. The vet may prescribe medicine to help reduce the bad bacteria that has backed up or to help stimulate the digestive system. An IV can help soften the build up in the intestines.Your vet may suggest feeding your rabbit with a syringe so the rabbit can get the nutrients he needs.
Your bunny may need pain relievers to help with pain from the gas and bacteria backed up in the intestines.
 GI stasis is primarily caused by a diet that is too low in fiber. Other causes of GI stasis may include stress, not drinking enough water, pain, and a foreign object in the gut. However, the vast majority of cases are caused by an improper diet.


When a rabbit doesnâ€™t eat the right food, the digestive tract stops working. Bad bacteria and gases build up in the intestines, which causes pain and decreases the appetite. The rabbit stops getting nutrients he needs.

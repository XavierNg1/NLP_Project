 Vinyl is a bit like skin, and cleaning your hot tub cover will have an effect similar to opening pores. Cleaning the vinyl will help it better absorb a conditioning protectant. A freshly cleaned vinyl surface also gives dirt and grime a stronger foothold, so you should always condition the cover after cleaning it to prevent it from quickly getting dirty again.Most covers are made of vinyl, but some are made of acrylic. There’s no need to apply a protectant to an acrylic hardcover.
 After cleaning and drying the cover, spray its top with a vinyl protectant to condition it and protect it from damaging sunlight. Use a clean microfiber (or other lint-free) cloth to evenly distribute the protectant over the cover’s top surface.You can also use saddle soap to condition your cover.Avoid using petroleum-based products to condition your hot tub cover.
 A good quality cover can cost hundreds of dollars (US) and is instrumental to maintaining your hot tub. While it might seem silly to cover a cover, you should keep a tarp over your hot tub and its cover if you don’t plan on using it for a period longer than six weeks.Protecting the cover from outdoor elements using a tarp can extend its life.

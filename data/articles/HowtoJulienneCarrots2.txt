 While a mandoline is often safer to use than a knife, it is still extremely sharp and can be dangerous if you don’t use it properly. Make sure to set the tool on a flat, even surface, so it doesn’t move around as you’re julienning the carrots.The best surface to put the mandoline on is a cutting board that is secure on your countertop so it won’t move around either.
 Mandolines typically come with multiple blades that allow you to cut vegetables and fruits in a variety of ways. For julienning the carrots, you’ll want to use the julienne blade. On some models, it may be called the stick blade.On some mandolines, you have to attach the julienne or stick blade manually. On others, you simply move the blade into place. Consult your instruction manual to see how to adjust the blade.
If your mandoline has multiple julienne or stick blades, pay attention to the thickness to ensure that you julienne the carrot to the right size.
 Because the blades on a mandoline are so sharp, you run the risk of cutting yourself if you move the carrot directly over the tool with your hand. Most models come with a food guard, which serve as a barrier between your hand and the blades. Stick the carrot on the prongs on the guard to ensure that it’s firmly in place.If your mandoline didn’t come with a food guard, you can purchase one separately.
If you feel like you don’t have control over the carrot with the food guard, you can also purchase a stainless steel mesh hand glove that protects the hand holding the carrot from the blades.
 When the carrot it firmly on the food guard, run it over the blade to julienne the carrot. It typically takes several swipes over the blade with the carrot to julienne the entire piece.

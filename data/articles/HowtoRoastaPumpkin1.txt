, Cut the pumpkin in half with a large knife. Scoop out the stringy innards of the pumpkin along with the seeds. Set the seeds aside and prepare toasted pumpkin seeds later.
 Puncture the outer skin of the pumpkin with the tip of a large chef's knife. Set the knife into the groove created by the puncture and slowly sink the knife into the pumpkin using a rocking motion.

Garam Masala
Cumin and curry powder
Clove, cinnamon, and brown sugar
Maple syrup
Red pepper

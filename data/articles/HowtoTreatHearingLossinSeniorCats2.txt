 If you have an indoor/outdoor senior cat with hearing loss, you should stop letting it go outside. All cats, especially those that are deaf or hearing impaired, are safer indoors. A deaf or hearing impaired cat is less likely to evade threats like automobiles or aggressive animals., Turn lights on before entering a room. A deaf cat can still feel vibrations, so stomp and clap to announce your presence and avoid startling it.If possible, keep carpeting and rugs to a minimum so your cat can sense more vibrations through the hard floor., A deaf or hearing impaired cat wonâ€™t be able to respond to you when you call for it. To prevent it from getting lost or stuck in a hiding spot, you can attach a small bell to its collar. That way, you can easily locate your cat without having to search the entire house.

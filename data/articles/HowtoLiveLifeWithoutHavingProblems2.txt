 Go down your list of problems one by one and ask yourself several questions. What is causing it? Is it a friend? Is it something else? Start with the first problem; identify it. Is it major or not? Now find out the cause. Why did it happen? Remember that you shouldn't ever completely change yourself to solve a problem.

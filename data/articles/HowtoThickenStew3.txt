 This is a good way to use them up! When they're boiled enough, mash them.









Add dollops of mashed potato to the stew. Potato is nice and bland, so it won't wreck the flavor of the stew.
Keep adding until enough of the liquid has been soaked up and the consistency of the stew is pleasing.
 Then restore the mashed potato to the stew. This will help to soak up some of the liquid better.









You can also mash other vegetables like carrots and parsnips and return them to the stew. The mash will absorb the liquid better than whole vegetables can do.
 Add a tablespoon of instant mashed potato and mix it around.









See how much the liquid thickens, stirring to help the thickening.
Add more in gradual amounts if needed. Always add gradually, to avoid overdoing the potato, as it does alter both flavor and texture.

 Keep the medical resume up to date with current phone numbers, email and fax information, if applicable, as well as your full name and other important identifiers.;
, Many applicants for medical jobs showcase their relevant degrees, certifications and other formal educational bona fides high up toward the top of the first page of a medical resume.
 Objectives are part of many types of resumes. For the medical field, they should showcase exactly what you want to do within a very diversified work environment. For example, surgeons and other kinds of doctors will often include objectives related to skilled inpatient or outpatient procedures, along with good patient communication. Other professionals will highlight objectives related to reaching out to the public in a healthcare setting.
 Not all medical jobs are the same, and in fact, many of them fall into several distinct categories. Use these to your advantage when crafting a particular medical resume for your job applications.


Outline relevant clinical skills. Having skills in a surgical area, skills related to various components of general surgery, or even routine care skills, such as phlebotomy (drawing blood), can make a job applicant more qualified. When this kind of information is on your medical resume, you may be one step ahead of the game.
Identify coding or billing skills. If you work in medical environments handling complex insurance statements and billing documents, it can be extremely helpful to have some billing or coding skills mentioned in your resume.
Show customer service skills. If you have prior proof of your skill in reaching out to patients, this can make your medical resume more appealing and attractive to potential employers.
 In addition to all of the education, skills and experience that you have accumulated, you may want to mention any relevant extracurricular activities that will make you appear more well-rounded on your medical resume.
 It's a good idea to limit the length of your medical resume. This gives readers a better chance of going all the way through it and getting a full picture of the qualities that you bring to a job position.
 In the final edit of a medical resume, you can look for anything from typos to style issues, as well as a final scan to make sure that you have identified all of your strengths.


Have someone else cross-check your resume. Feedback never hurts and we do not always see our own errors.

 If you got your dog from a dog breeder they should have information about the dog's heritage, known as its pedigree. Even if you got your dog years ago, the breeder should still have this information for you.


A dog's pedigree is important for good and ethical breeders to know about, as it is key for making sure that their dogs are well bred and not inbred.
 Talk to your veterinarian and ask them if they think that your dog might be a Welsh springer spaniel. Your veterinarian likely sees hundreds of dogs every year, so they may have a good idea about how to identify that breed.


You can also ask other people who deal with dogs professionally, such as dog groomers and dog trainers.
 There are companies that now offer DNA testing kits for dogs.This type of testing can determine which breed strains are present in your dog. For example, a DNA test might be able to tell you that your dog is 60% Welsh springer spaniel and 40% Sussex spaniel.If your dog has any purebred relatives, the test should be pretty accurate. However, if your dog is a mix of a variety of breeds, the test will be less accurate.

 Take a large, sharp knife and cut the grapefruit horizontally into two halves.If you are unsure where the top and bottom of the grapefruit are, find the two dots, or navels, on the grapefruit at opposite ends. These are the top and bottom of the grapefruit.
Think of these dots as the “poles” of the grapefruit, like the poles of the earth. Turn the grapefruit on its side and cut where the equator line would be, through the center of the grapefruit.;
, Cut along the line of the grapefruit where the skin and the sectioned flesh of the grapefruit meet. Use a small, serrated knife to cut along this circle. Try to keep as close to the skin as possible so you are not cutting away any of the fruit., Take the serrated knife and cut in diagonals around each wedged section of the grapefruit. Essentially you are freeing the fruit of from the skin and the membrane of the grapefruit. , You can stop here if you wish. However, some like to use a scissors or knife to cut out the membrane around the fruit of the grapefruit.


This is fairly work-intensive, and you will probably lose a little bit of the fruit as you are cutting out the membrane.
Many like doing this because by the end you will be able to easily eat the inside of the grapefruit and won't have to concentrate on scooping out each section.
 Many people sprinkle sugar on top of grapefruit to counter its tart flavor. If you wish, sprinkle about a teaspoon of sugar over the grapefruit. The grainy texture of the sugar can also be a pleasant counterpoint to the softness of the grapefruit. , Grapefruits prepared in this way fit perfectly into bowls. Put each grapefruit half in a bowl that is a similar size. Accompany the grapefruit halves with a small spoon. To eat the grapefruit, use the spoon to scoop up fruit of the grapefruit. The fruit should easily dislodge from the grapefruit since you spent the time to cut around the membranes.

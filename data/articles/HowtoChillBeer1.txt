 You will need to make sure you have enough for each bottle or can. Once you’ve gathered enough, douse each in water. They should be completely wet, but not dripping. Too much water will cause them to stick to the beer completely and removing them will be difficult.;
, Make sure the middle of each can or bottle is completely covered, as those portions are what will chill faster. If you're using paper towels, try using two instead of one for a thicker covering.
 Make sure to place the beers slightly apart as they’re likely to stick together if they’re touching. Once in the freezer, each beer should take 8-15 minutes to chill. Also, remember to watch the time, because leaving the beers in the freezer for too long may cause them to explode.To avoid any possible injury, try putting each beer in a Ziploc bag in case they crack or break open. This will make removal both safer and easier.

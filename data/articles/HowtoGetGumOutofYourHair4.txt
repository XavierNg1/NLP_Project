 Ice works by hardening the gum and allowing it to be chipped out of the hair.









This method is known to be more painful than other methods, because the cold gum still has to be yanked out of the hair., If your hair is very long, you can close your hair inside the freezer. For those with short hair, apply an ice cube to the affected area and wrap it in a plastic bag. Hold it there for twenty minutes.









You can also apply salt water to your hair beforehand to lower the freezing temperature of the ice.
 When the gum is hard and breakable, you will be able to chip it out of your hair. If it starts to soften, freeze it again.









If the gum is too stuck to your hair to pull off, you can add a small amount of cooking oil to it and freeze it again.

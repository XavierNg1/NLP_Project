 The only way to block game notifications completely is to use the desktop version of the Facebook site. You can't change these settings from the mobile site or the Facebook app. You won't be able to block all game notifications permanently, but you can block individual games as you come across them.
 Click the â–¼ button at the top of the page and select "Settings".
 You'll find this in the left menu of the Settings page.
 If you're constantly getting invites and notifications from a specific game, you can enter it into the field and block it completely. You'll see a list of matching titles appear as you start typing. Select the game from the list and you will no longer receive notifications and invites from it.
 If the majority of your game spam comes from a certain person on your friends list, you can block any future invites from that person. The person will not be notified that you have blocked game notifications, and will remain on your friends list. No other form of communication between the two of you will be affected. Type the name of the person into the "Block app invites" field and select the person from the list that appears.

 The National Institute of Health recommends that a person suffering from a kidney stones should drink 2 to 3 quarts of water a day.If you're feeling nauseous, try taking small sips as often as you can. This will help flush your kidneys as well as encourage that little mass to move.;
, Get a heating pad and place on the side(s) experiencing pain. Additionally, you can try getting into a hot shower, allowing the water to spray onto the afflicted area. These provide temporary relief, as they are methods of distraction for your body.


The heat allows your mind and body to focus on an additional stimulus, taking the full focus off the kidney pain. The heat not only distracts the mind but also relaxes the tender, swollen muscles around the kidney. This allows some of the muscle tension to ease up, thus making it easier for the stone to work its way down.
 Advil or another medication containing Ibuprofen will help with the inflammation caused by the stone (and can be used in addition to narcotics prescribed by your doctor).However, these cannot be taken if you are pregnant.
 Have someone rub your back or press their hand or fist firmly into the painful kidney. Laying flat on your stomach with a pillow under your pelvis might help. Do not be afraid to ask for help. This will also give your loved one a sense of being useful. Though you are experiencing extraordinary pain, your family and friends are experiencing the pain of not being able to do anything to help you.
 There is no shame in vocalizing your pain. Most grown men who have experienced kidney stones will tell you there is no worse pain, and some women even place the pain above childbirth. Letting your frustrations out does not make you a wimp in this situation!

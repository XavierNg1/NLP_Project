 One of the biggest challenges in creating a single text between two or more writers is merging the work into a consistent, shared voice. This can be complicated due to varying writing styles among the writing partners. The best way to do this is to actually work on the writing together. However, when this isn’t possible, you’ll need to merge your separate work into one document and smooth out the differences together as a team.Watch out for things like varying tone, word choice, and sentence structure.
 When two people work closely together on a single project, it’s inevitable that differences will arise. You need to figure out a way to navigate these instances together in a way that doesn’t upset either party and ends in a result both people can agree on.When a dispute arises, try to honestly communicate with your writing partner in a respectful manner. Since you both have the same end goal (completing the project), this is often an effective method.
If you just can’t seem to agree on something, try getting a neutral third party to listen to both sides and help you determine a course of action that is acceptable to both of you.
 If you are co-writing a book with another person, it’s possible that costs will be incurred and that profits could potentially be made. You both need to have a clear understanding about how these costs and profits will be divided among you so that these expectations are clear from the beginning.Additionally, since you are co-creating something with another person, you’ll need to establish in what ways both partners are permitted to use the work in the future. Can you publish or quote from the piece in separate forums? These are things you need to agree on ahead of time and establish in a written contract. This will protect you both in the end.

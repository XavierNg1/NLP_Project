 of warm water into a glass jar. Be sure to choose a jar with a lid, so you can store your gel to use later. A mason jar or an old cosmetic jar are both good options.
 Unflavored gelatin can be found in most grocery stores on the baking aisle. Resist the temptation to use flavored gelatin; the sugars and dyes in flavored gelatin aren't good for your hair.
 Drop 2 to 3 drops of essential oil into the jar to create a fragrant gel. Essential oils can be found in many health food, hobby and specialty stores. Don't add too much essential oil, since these substances are strong; a little goes a long way.


Essential oils are highly concentrated liquids that have been derived naturally from the stems, flowers and roots of plants. They contain the purest essence of plants and can benefit the condition of skin, hair and organs.
Essential oils that provide the most benefit to hair health are lavender, coconut, rosemary and tea tree oils. You do not have to limit your options to only these oils for this hair gel recipe. You can also choose an oil that has a fragrance that is pleasing you.
 Make sure the gelatin is completely dissolved and the oil gets distributed throughout the liquid.
 If you leave it uncovered it may get contaminated with food particles or other debris, or pick up the smells from the food in your refrigerator. Keep it fresh by covering it with a lid.
 Put the covered jar in the refrigerator and allow the gel set for 3 to 5 hours. Within that time it will begin to take on a solid form, like jello.


Your hair gel will be ready to use after it has set. Check the consistency before using. It should be similar to that of store-bought hair gel.
Use the same amount of this hair gel as you would any store-bought variety. The amount you need will vary according to the length and thickness of your hair.
 If you let it sit out of the refrigerator, it will turn back into liquid.

 The first major difference between a young a dog and an older dog is the amount of energy and stamina they have. Most senior dogs will not be able to play as intensely, or as long, as younger dogs of similar breeds. This can be a benefit for busy families, who don’t have the time to exercise a young dog.Dogs of any age still need physical and mental stimulation.
Playing fetch, going for a short jog, or playing hide-and-seek with a treat can help keep your dog happy and healthy.
 Senior dogs, even those that are very healthy, need to be seen by the vet more often. Senior dogs should visit a vet at least twice a year. This visit should include blood work, urine analysis, and a full body examination. Additionally, senior dogs should be seen annually for a dental cleaning and exam.A basic veterinary visit can range from $45-200. Additional "geriatric" screenings (such as blood work and chemistry, urinalysis, and x-rays) can run around $100.
Having your dog's teeth cleaned can cost anywhere from $300-500. If they need additional dental work, this will cost more.
 Most shelters and adoption centers will be able to provide you with a comprehensive health report for a dog you are interested in adopting. By reviewing this information, you will be able to decide if you can meet the animal’s needs. Many older dogs will have no significant health problems, some will have very manageable health problems, and some may have more serious health concerns.

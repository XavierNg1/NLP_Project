 Let your friend know that they can trust you. When your friend feels very sad and possibly angry, allowing them to see that they can trust you can be a big help.
 Tell your friend something along the lines of: It's okay now. I am here to help, and you can trust me with anything. " This will help them open up and feel safe.
 Your friend may not be open up at first, and that's okay. You know how it is to be in their place, and what you can do is help them to feel better. If they say, "I don't want to talk about it " then you can say that, if you don't know the problem, it's harder for you to understand and help. If they still don't want to open up, say that's fine. If you push them too much, they may not open up to you or anyone. Let them be until they feel ready to talk., Hopefully you can be somewhere at home when this happens, but if you are in a more public place like school, get excused to go to the bathroom with your friend. You need to talk to them in private. You don't want anyone else to hear what you guys are talking about., Give your friend a big hug. Even if you or your friend are not big on hugs, it will help. It will give your friend the much needed proof that you care about them, and you support them., If they cry, that's fine. Crying is good, and lets out the pain. If you want to cry with them, go ahead. It shows them that you are not ashamed to be crying or to see your friend crying.

 As of right now, Wesker has the advantage of Jill providing gun fire for him. To negate this effect, run to the right side of your starting position and head for the blue door.


Stay behind the column by the door to avoid Jill's gunshots.
If playing co-op, one partner should shoot Wesker to draw attention away.
The partner in cover should shoot Jill with the flash rounds in the grenade launcher.
 When it ends, Chris should turn around and head up the stairs and into a hallway.


As Chris, take cover at the end of the hallway and wait until Wesker comes. Then, shoot him quickly as many times as possible.
As Sheva, wait for the above situation to unfold by hiding behind a column. Then when Chris starts shooting Wesker, head up into the hallway he's in and then shoot Wesker from behind while he fights Chris.



If he dashes then run away and repeat step 2.
If he is stunned then run up to him and complete the quick time event.
, Shooting him while he holds the rocket instantly ends the fight. Make sure he fights the person not holding the rocket launcher so it's easier that way.

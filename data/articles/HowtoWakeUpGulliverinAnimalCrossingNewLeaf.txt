 Walk around all the beach areas in your town. You will be able to see him easily; he's a seagull, and he’ll be lying on the ground, knocked out.;
, Once you find Gulliver, simply talk to him by standing close to him and pressing “A.” You will need to do this many times.


Gulliver will respond, indicating that he’s confused and doesn’t remember how he arrived on your town’s beach.
 If you talk to Gulliver enough times and effectively wake him up, he’ll ask if you’re willing to help him figure out where he was heading. You should always say yes, considering there is no penalty for getting the answer wrong.


Upon agreeing to help Gulliver, he will describe things he remembers about his destination. Then you will have to choose between four different locations.
The answer can be figured out using common knowledge.
 If you answered Gulliver’s question successfully, then he will send you a letter the next day with a gift that represents the country he’s visiting.


His gifts are usually unique furniture pieces that cannot be obtained otherwise.

 Go to Feedburner and type in the URL of your blog and click "I am a podcaster!" In the next screen, configure the elements for your podcast. These are the elements that directly relate to the podcast. Your feedburner feed is your podcast.


Go to one of the hosts you can find online and sign-up there (this may take a while). Then go to your files, and upload your MP3 file.
Make a post on your blog/website -- the title of the post should be the title of that episode of the podcast, and the content will end up as the "Show notes" or the "Description." Put in a little about what you talk about in your episode. At the end of the post, put a link directly to your media file.
 In a few minutes, Feedburner should add this to your feed, and now you have an episode! You can submit it to iTunes or a number of other podcast directories to get it known. You may want to wait, however, until you have some experience, so that your podcast will be compared as a fifth episode to another's first.


Submitting a podcast to iTunes is fairly simple. The podcast page in the iTunes store has a large button that asks for the RSS link and some additional information about the podcast. A podcast can also be submitted via the Web through the link in the iTunes FAQ.Ping the appropriate podcast directories when a new show is updated.
Put the appropriate subscription buttons on your website so people can subscribe to the RSS podcast feed.

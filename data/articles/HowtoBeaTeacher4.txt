 Rules such as: No cell phones on during class; keep your hands to yourself; say only kind things; do as your teacher says; be on time; what to do if you miss a day of school; lawful activities, etc.
 Perhaps five or six, at the most, but these are not " the situational procedures". You will need several differing procedures that the students must know or that you must explain at the time of necessity. An effective way to decide rules is to let your classes help decide reasonable rules and consequences, and this way your class should follow and help you to enforce them because they have bought into the ownership of them. They can also decide for some fun things like the point values and reasons for shooting at various distances for the ball game, etc. (see above).
 By the same token, be moderate and let a student occasionally have an "oops!", for example:


Give them each a credit, call it an "oops!-card", when students are good for a certain length of time, then they can trade their oops!-card which allows them to miss one night's homework or for some other reward.

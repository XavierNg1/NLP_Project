 Add an oval, which will be a basis for the head. Your image should look like a woman in a long skirt to begin with, mostly because Aladdin's outfit is comprised of very loose-fitting clothing and that's just how his profile is.;
, Add a few ovals to serve as arms and legs. Add more ovals and circles for hands and feet.
 Draw even more lines and semicircles, so the arms start looking more muscular, and start connecting shapes.
 His vest is open on his chest and his pants are baggy (a little bit puffy, even). His hat is a fez, and it sits squarely on his head, which is tilted slightly back.
 Draw the facial features: eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth as seen here. Sketch his chest and the lining/patch of his pants, as well as his fingers and toes.
 Try to make some lines softer and add extra details where needed.
 Now color your creation! You can follow the illustration here or give him your own unique look, whatever you want to do.

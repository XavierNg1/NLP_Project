 Most treadmills are equipped with settings that allow you to choose from a variety of workout programs; such as intervals, inclines, and other routines that can keep you entertained.


Browse running programs and routines using the controls or dashboard buttons on your treadmill. You can also consult directly with the treadmill manufacturer to determine how to program or use certain routines.
 Although treadmills may not provide the most versatility in regards to a complete body workout in every aspect, you can choose to focus on either strength training or cardio training.


Practice strength-training and muscle-building for your thigh and calf muscles by slowing down your pace and setting the treadmill on the steepest incline.
Focus on an intense cardio workout by using no incline and running at the fastest possible pace you can manage.
 This practice can be especially entertaining and motivating if you work out with a friend or other acquaintance.
 Setting and working toward a daily goal can keep you entertained and focused throughout your workout as you strive to meet your goal.


Set goals that determine the length of your workout, the distance you run or walk, or the amount of calories you burn. For example, if you ran 2 mi (3.21 km) yesterday, set a goal to run 2.25 mi (3.62 km) today.

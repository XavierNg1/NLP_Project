 Keep in mind that every minute that you spend on social media takes a minute from some other more productive activity that you could put your time towards. Some of these things could include learning a new language, playing an instrument, hanging out with friends, exercising, learning a new recipe, or reading a book.

Consider your relationships that have gone lacking because of your social media addiction. Your significant other or children may be feeling neglected because of it.
Your social media addition could be hampering your life and relationships and keeping you from your goals.
 Perhaps the most constructive and certainly the most fun way to battle your social media addiction is to get out of the house and have some fun. Call up your friends and go out to a movie or have dinner. Go bowling, swimming, running, or shopping. These are healthy and fun ways to combat your addiction while relaxing., You might find that your social media addiction developed because you used a site to communicate with someone as opposed to calling them. You might have gotten caught up on the site awaiting their response and developed an addiction from that. However, try to have conversations with friends and family via phone rather than social media apps., In order to prevent yourself from relapsing or not keeping your commitment to cease social media usage temporarily, spend more time with your family and friends. Go visit your grandparents and do errands for them, and hang out with your mom more. Hang out with siblings and friends more during this time as well and resist using your phone, even if they are., Once you have more free time from social media, you will be better able to invest in other things. Perhaps you have been considering a career change or thinking about going back to school. Take this time to research schools and jobs. A change might be just what you need to create a healthier, happier and more electronically detached life.

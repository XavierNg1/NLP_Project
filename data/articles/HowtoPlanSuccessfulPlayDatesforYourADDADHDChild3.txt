 During the play date, pay close attention to the ways your child interacts with the other child. Notice if behavior patterns emerge. These will give you an indication of what you might need to work on with your child.


For example, if your child keeps getting upset when the other child asks for a toy, you might need to work with your child on sharing.
 While a play date is supervised by a parent, you aren’t necessarily an active participant in the activities. Provide assistance or refereeing when necessary, but let your child be the host. Let him show his friend where the bathroom is, for example.


For young children, such as preschoolers, you’ll probably need to have a more active role in directing the play date.
 Don’t be too quick to step in to fix problems. Let your child negotiate with his guest. It’s important that kids work through some arguments or conflicts on their own. This will help them build self-esteem and understand how to work with others to resolve problems., A child with ADHD needs to feel that he is being praised more often than criticized. Praise your child when he behaves in an appropriate way at the playdate. Even if he only shares one toy instead of three toys, praise that sharing effort. It’s important that you promote the positive behavior and give him positive feedback.The positive input must significantly outweigh the negative input to counterbalance feelings of failure that your child may encounter in a typical day., After the play date is over, talk with your child about it. Ask what parts he liked and what parts he didn’t like. This will help you in planning future play dates.


This type of chat will also help your child feel acknowledged and as though his needs and feelings matter.

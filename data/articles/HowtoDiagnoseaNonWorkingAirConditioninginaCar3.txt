 It is normally located in front of your radiator. If there are leaves or other dirt or buildup blocking it, remove them and clean the area.
 If your air pressure is normal but the air is hot, you may have a compressor problem. Checking to see if the compressor clutch is engaging is a simple visual inspection. The compressor is usually located towards the front of your engine, just inside the grill of your car.









Your car should be running with the AC on to check the compressor clutch.
The compressor looks like a small motor with a large wheel on the end. The wheel (which is the compressor clutch) should be spinning. If it is not spinning, you have a problem with your compressor., It should be tight. If it is loose, you need a new compressor belt.
 One of the most common AC temperature problems is low refrigerant. The AC system is closed, so refrigerant should not be lost unless there is a leak.








Look for oily residue on or around hoses that attach AC components together. Oily spots may indicate a refrigerant leak.
You may consider using an electronic leak detector, which can detect much smaller quantities of refrigerant.
There are also some testers that use dye, UV light, and protective glasses to find leaks.
If you do find a leak, you will likely need to hire a professional to repair the leak. You will probably need new parts too, as many of the components cannot be repaired or patched.
 If your AC blows cold initially but then stops being cold after some use, it could be freezing. Excess air and moisture in the system may lead components to freeze (literally).








Freezing can also be caused by an oversaturated receiver/drier or accumulator.
Turning the system off for a while and letting it thaw will temporarily solve the problem.
If the problem is persistent, you may need your system to be flushed or evacuated with a vacuum pump.

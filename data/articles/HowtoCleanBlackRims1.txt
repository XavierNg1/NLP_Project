 You can find a number of waterless cleaners on the market. These cleaners are relatively effective on wheels, and they can make it fast and easy to detail your black rims. Also, you'll need several microfiber cloths throughout the process.Look for one that says "waterless" on the bottle, such as Chemical Guys Waterless Car Wash and Wax.
Consider getting black, edgeless microfiber cloths. Because they are edgeless, they are less likely to scratch your rims.
Waterless cleaners can be used on any kind of rim. However, make sure it is safe for the type of finish you have, which is most likely a painted aluminum alloy. You don't want to use anything harder than you'd use on your car's finish.;
, The rim needs to be covered in the cleaner as you start cleaning it. Spray it down well. It doesn't need to be dripping off, but the whole surface of the rim needs to have the cleaner on it so it can start breaking down the gunk., Using the microfiber cloth, rub the rim down. Make sure to get in all the nooks and crannies to get all the dirt out. Rub both the spokes and the inside edges of the wheels, as it can all get dirty from road debris and brake dust.

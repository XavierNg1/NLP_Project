 You can purchase either fresh or frozen chicken breasts. If you choose frozen chicken breasts, however, keep in mind that you'll have to completely defrost them before broiling. You can broil chicken breasts with or without skin.;
, To do so, you can use your fingers or a pastry brush. The olive oil adds flavor and helps the seasonings adhere better to each chicken breast.
 Choose from pre-made or homemade seasoning combinations. Nearly all seasoning will include both salt and pepper. Other herbs and spices could include any combination of garlic, thyme, fennel and more.
 Depending on the make and model of your broiler, this could take up to 10 minutes.
 Spray with a nonstick substance to prevent sticking. Space each chicken breast several inches from each other so they don't touch while broiling.
 The meat should be approximately 5 to 6 inches (12.5 to 15 cm) from the heat source.
, Broilers are extremely hot and chicken can easily burn if not monitored. Place foil on the edges of the chicken breasts if they begin to brown to prevent burning on the thinner parts of the chicken.
 Don't use a fork to turn over the chicken breasts. Piercing the chicken will cause the juices to escape and make your chicken dry.
 Additional basting keeps the chicken moist, even when broiled at extreme temperatures.
 Cooking times will vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breast. Chicken is done when the juices run clear and it has reached an internal temperature of 170 degrees Fahrenheit (about 77 degrees Celsius). This can be checked with a meat thermometer.

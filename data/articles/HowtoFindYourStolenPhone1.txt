 If you’ve lost a traditional (non-smart) phone that does not have internet connectivity, you won’t be able to track the phone online and will have to use other methods. Begin by calling the phone. If you’re lucky, the person who stole your phone may answer. Alternately, if your phone has simply been misplaced (e.g. on a taxi seat or a subway car), someone may answer who can meet you at a location to exchange the phone.If you call your phone and someone answers, say “Hello, this is , and you’re holding my cell phone. The phone is important to me and I need to get it back; is there a location where we could meet and exchange the phone?”;
, Even if no one answered when you called your phone, it’s still worth texting it. The thief may eventually change their mind, and decide to return the phone to you, its owner. Send a brief text that provides your contact information and asks for the phone to be returned. If you think it would help, you could also promise a reward to the individual if they return your phone.To do this, you’ll need access to another cell phone. Ask a friend to borrow theirs. If you’re not near a friend, a kind stranger may allow you to borrow their cell phone to text yours.
 If someone—whether or not it’s the thief who initially took your phone—agrees to meet with you to give your phone back to you, take safety precautions. Arrange to meet with the individual in a public place—such as a city square or transit station—during daylight hours. If possible, don’t go alone; bring a friend with you for the sake of companionship and safety. Ask your friend to bring their phone, so that they can call the police if anything illicit happens.

Even if the individual returning your phone sounds friendly over the phone (or over text), you should still plan to take precautionary measures.

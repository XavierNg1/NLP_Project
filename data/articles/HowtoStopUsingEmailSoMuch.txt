 Admitting you have a problem is the first step to solving it.;
, Set the alarm for a period of time, after which you must close your email program. Don't make this period of time any longer than half an hour.
 Only open it once or twice a day. Don't let its "ping" distract you into emailing all day long. Be daring and leave it closed for several days. See how you feel and find other things to occupy you.
 Keep this email address as your "must check everyday" email and keep your other, more bloated email as a weekend hobby. Use this email address as the one that you have subscriptions sent to so that you don't become bogged down in them.
 Create folders that you can instantly divert incoming emails to for checking at later times. Create folders for emails from friends, from groups you've joined, from news sources, from charities etc. You can come back and read some at a different time and only pay attention to those that need immediate attention. More importantly, press that delete button - if you've read it and it's not worth replying to, or it's junk mail or it's a subscription newsletter and you've noted it etc., then delete it. Don't let it clutter up your mailbox making it harder for you to navigate around and stopping you from being efficient with your emails.
 People will soon get the message that you don't reply instantly or send back huge emails all the time. Reserve the email for special things like anniversaries, sending photos or cheering someone up.
 It's an old tradition that has its value. People love receiving letters and postcards, even postcards from your hometown. And love notes are always better handwritten.
 Go on a vacation and don't even try to find a computer terminal. See how life used to be before computers existed. The emails can wait.

 If you do not have enough funnels for each jar, you can use the same funnel for all of them. Simply fill one jar before removing the funnel and using it to fill the next.
 Use a large ladle to make the process cleaner and easier. Fill the jars, leaving only 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of headspace or empty space at the top of each jar.
 Stir in 2 Tbsp (60 ml) of lemon juice into each of the three quart-size jars of tomato sauce. Lemon juice is a strong natural preservative and will keep your tomato sauce from spoiling more effectively.
 Make sure that the lids are tightly secured, but avoid over-tightening them since doing so may cause the lids to pop off their tracks. Wipe away any excess tomato sauce with a clean, dry towel.
 Make sure that they are well positioned so that they do not slide around or strike against each other. Fill the canner with enough water to completely cover the jars with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bring the water to a boil before you start the time.


Alternatively, you can use a clean stockpot to boil the jars, as well. You may need to place a rack or a dish towel into the bottom of the pot to prevent the jars from sliding around, however.



Boil for 40 minutes if you are at an altitude of 1000 feet (304.8 m) or less.
Boil for 45 minutes at an altitude between 1,000 feet (304.8Â m) and 3000 feet (304.8 m and 914.4 m).
Boil for 50 minutes at altitudes between 3000 and 6000 feet (914.4 m and 1.82 km).
Boil for 55 minutes at altitudes above 6000 feet (1.82 km).
 Allow them to dry and cool in a draft-free area overnight. Do not let the jars touch as they cool.
 Press the center "button" on each lid. If it does not move, the jars are sealed. If it moves up and down or makes a popping sound, the jars have not sealed. You will need to reheat the contents of the jar before attempting to can them again.

 This will ensure that there's no ice already present.;
, A freezer doesn't need to be set much cooler than 32℉ (0℃) and the fridge section may usually be set as high as 40℉ (5℃) without compromising food quality.
 Less air means that less water in that air will be available to condense and form ice on the freezer coils. At times when you don't have a lot of food taking up space in the freezer, fill up drink containers—milk cartons, plastic orange juice bottles, and similar containers—with some water and let those freeze. The big blocks of ice you make in this way will keep the freezer fuller and colder.
 Don't stand there with the door open and gaze in, looking for something good to eat. Be quick. When you are getting ready to open the fridge to make a sandwich, plan on pulling out everything you need all at one time. Cold cuts, cheese, lettuce. Don't forget that mustard your spouse likes for some unknown reason. If you are going to be baking, take the eggs and the butter and the milk out all at one time. This way you open the door only once.


If your memory fails you, keep a list of what is in the fridge on the fridge door. That way, you'll know what tasty snacks are in there and can make the decision before opening the door, allowing you to grab them quickly. This list can be very useful for shopping if you also note what has been eaten, allowing you to see what you're running out of and need to restock.
 If you see ice starting to build up, physically remove the ice crystals as best you can, but be very careful - you don't want to damage anything (a strong wooden spoon is often a good way to chip at ice without harming the fridge materials). Once loose, use your hand to sweep out the fallen ice crystals and drop them into the kitchen sink to melt.

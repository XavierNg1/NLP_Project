 If you can't find any molasses, use brown rice syrup instead. Mix just enough for the recipe. For example, if your recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar, use 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of molasses.
 Stir everything together with a fork.
 Give your substitute a taste. If it tastes too sour, add some more molasses or brown rice syrup. If it is too sweet, add more lemon juice.

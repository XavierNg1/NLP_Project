 We all know that it's fun to dress up for different holidays. Let your dog have a seasonal wardrobe, too. You can create different collars for different seasons. Think firework printed fabric for the Fourth of July and hearts for Valentine's day.


Look for materials during holiday off seasons. For example, you'll be able to find lower prices on Christmas prints during the early spring and summer.
 Some dog collars are intended to be more decorative than functional. If this is the case, you should feel free to experiment with a variety of materials. For example, consider ribbons. There are many specialty stores that sell beautiful colored and printed ribbons. This would work especially well for small dogs.Leather is also a great option for dog collars. While it is more expensive, it will also last longer.
 While it can be fun to make your dog look stylish, make sure that you are considering his comfort. For example, if you have a puppy, make sure that the collar you make is adjustable and allows him room to grow. You never want a collar to be to tight.Avoid using twine or any material that will chafe or irritate your dog's coat.

 Catching Pikachu in the wild is a little more difficult, but is possible. He can appear anywhere, but he has been reportedly found frequently near power plants and science museums, presumably because of his connection to electricity. If you have a power plant or another source of electricity local to you, this may be a good place to check first., Trainers have also seen Pikachu appear as late as 3am. Try waiting until very late to up your chances of encountering Pikachu in the wild.
 When Pikachu is near, you'll see its silhouette appear in the sidebar in the bottom-right corner of your screen.
 If you see a Pikachu silhouette in your nearby list and then see rustling grass on your map, you may be in luck. Head to the grass and a Pikachu may appear.
 It's time to try to catch it!

, Swipe the Pok√©ball towards Pikachu to attempt to capture it. If you don't miss, and if Pikachu doesn't burst out of the ball, it's yours!

 Hide your fort by putting it behind bushes, trees or even the side of your house. If you decide to use a tent, place it behind any large structure in your backyard, like a garage or shed.;
, If you have a shed in your backyard that is not used all the time, this is a great place for a secret spy fort. Paint it a dark color, such as olive or dark brown to make it blend in. Make snow bricks to stack around it if there's snow outside that's easily packed.If you can't use paint, pile leaves and twigs around the shed and put branches on the top.
 Pitch a tent that is a natural color, like green or brown. Don't use one brightly colored. Prop large branches up beside it so that they touch the top like a teepee., Make sure you paint the playhouse a neutral color, since they are normally too bright for secret spy forts. Cover it with a dark tarp and lots a leaves to camouflage it even more.
 Dig a ditch or look for one already made. Place a board over the top and cover it with dirt and any surrounding brush, like leaves or grass. Use a tarp or sheet, if you canâ€™t find a board, and hold it in place with stakes or nails.

 There are 10 different kits. Six of them (necro, spider, herobrine, elf, giant and snowman) you need to be a VIP to use. The others (human, athlete, mage and vampire) you can pay for using nooks except for the standard one, human, which is free.;
, This is also where you will re-spawn. You will have some weapons in your inventory; these are what you will use to fight.
 There are two easy ways of finding people to kill. The first one is: run to their spawn- there are four bases, each are in the corners (quickly, before they have time to go anywhere else). The second one is: run towards the middle. Most people run towards the middle as soon as they spawn, and you will probably find some people there as well.
 You could either charge right at them or you could sneakily lay in wait with your trusty bow.
 You might just win!

 All you have to do is go to your home directory ("home")

, This should be designated here. If you can't see ".minecraft" within the home directory folder, then you haven't set Linux to show hidden folders and files. To show them, press Ctrl+h.The file is called ~/.minecraft/screenshots

, As with the others the "screenshots" folder, this will be in the ".minecraft" directory. You should be able to access the picture of your choice.

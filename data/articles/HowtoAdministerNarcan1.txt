 Prepare the nasal syringe immediately after giving several rescue breaths (if necessary). Pry or pull off the yellow caps. There are usually two – one at each end of the syringe.A syringe is not a needle, it’s a plastic device that holds the needle – or in this case, what the Narcan screws onto.
You can find Narcan through the getnaloxonenow.org website.;
, The tube of Narcan (also labeled naloxone) may have a red cap. Pry this off and discard it., Grip the clear plastic wings of the nasal atomizer (the cone-shaped applicator), and insert it onto the syringe. Gently screw the Narcan container onto the barrel of the syringe.Do not prime or test the spray. It is single-use and can’t be reused.Some Narcan nasal sprays come in single-use, pre-assembled packages. They contain two needle-free devices, one to use in each nostril., Lay the victim on their back and tilt their head back. Place the white cone applicator into one nostril of the victim’s nose. Give a short, hard push onto the end of the capsule to spray the Narcan. Deliver half of the container (1cc).Repeat the process immediately in the victim’s other nostril.

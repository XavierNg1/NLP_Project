 Whether you're having a tea party with your stuffed animals or launching another one of your action figures into a jungle, spend time with your toys, and create your own adventure with them. Give no limits to your imagination!;
, Pull out your sketchbook and doodle on the pages. Sketch out a new character or improve in your art. You could also use art books as a reference to guide you in your drawing.
 Since long, idle hours are now in your hands, spend a few minutes in organizing your room. Pick up the trash from your floor or sort all the junk from your closet. However, avoid turning on the vacuum, or its noise may rouse everyone in the house.
 Not only is this an effective way to stay awake, but your productivity will increase. It also will benefit the wikiHow community!

, While the television may not be an option, you could use your computer and other hand-held devices, such as your cell phone. Turn up loud, energetic music to keep your interest perked, but using headphones or earbuds are recommended to avoid waking up the entire house.


Be careful about turning up the volume too high. Not only could that possibly damage your eardrums, but someone else might hear the music.
 Stand up. Do some yoga. Do a handstand. Just make sure you are quiet!

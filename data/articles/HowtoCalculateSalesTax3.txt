 Let's say you bought a computer, listed at $1,200, and the total bill came out to $1,266, meaning that the sales tax was $66. What is the sales tax rate?


Take the tax rate and divide it by the original price: $66 รท $1,200 = .055
Convert the decimal into a percentage by moving the decimal point two places to the right: .055 becomes 5.5%
Your original sales tax rate is 5.5%

 Since Italian Greyhounds are prone to gum disease and other dental issues, their teeth require daily brushing. Using a small dog toothbrush is preferable to using gauze or a pad wrapped around a finger.Your dog might resist brushing, but it’s an essential part of keeping your dog healthy. Be confident and decisive about brushing, but do your best to avoid overwhelming or scaring your dog.
Your dog will eventually accept brushing as part of its routine if you keep up with it daily.
 Trimming nails is important, since overgrown nails can cause leg problems in dogs with fragile bones. Clip your Italian Greyhound’s nails every one to two weeks, or when you notice a clicking sound when your dog walks.A dog’s nails shouldn’t touch the floor. Check your dog’s gait, or the way it walks, to make sure it doesn’t put too much weight to the backs of its paws due it overgrown nails.
Using a nail grinder or hand file rather than clippers reduces the risk of removing too much nail, which can cause pain and bleeding.
 Italian Greyhounds are fairly low maintenance, aside from tooth and nail care. Use a sink, basin, or tub to bathe your dog as needed, such as if it smells or just got into something messy.


Keep an eye on its coat for dust or dander, and brush once a week or as needed.
Check its ears a couple times a week and clean out any wax or debris using gauze wrapped around your finger. Avoid using water to clean out ears.

 In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice and zest, the herbs de Provence, and the minced garlic cloves. Use a wire whisk or fork to beat everything together until you have a smooth, consistent texture., Throw the olives into the mixing bowl. Shake the bowl or use a spoon to stir until the olives are evenly coated in the seasoning.It's easier to coat the olives by tossing the bowl slightly. It's a good idea to cover the bowl with plastic wrap first to make sure none of the olives fall onto the floor or counter.
 Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight to allow it to marinate. Make sure to cover the bowl first. As it marinates, stir it occasionally. You can serve it the next day.If your medley doesn't get eaten in a single night, it can be stored in the refrigerator up to a week.

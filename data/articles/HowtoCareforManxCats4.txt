 Manx cats need regular checkups to stay healthy and keep them up to date on their vaccinations. Take your Manx to see a vet as soon as possible after you get her so that she can get all of the necessary vaccines. At her first veterinary visit, she will get a thorough physical exam and a test for feline leukemia.


Make sure to make annual appointments for your Manx and make an appointment if she seems ill as well., If you do not plan to breed your Manx, then you should spay or neuter him to prevent any unwanted kittens and protect your Manx catâ€™s health. Spaying and neutering is the best way to keep the pet population down, prevent pet homelessness, and it can also protect your Manx from certain diseases and conditions.Cats that are not spayed or neutered may engage in hormonal behaviors such as spraying and fighting. Spaying and neutering may also protect your cat from certain health issues, such as enlarged prostate, uterine infections, and some forms of cancer., Some Manx cats are born with spinal defects that can cause problems with urination, defecation, and walking. These issues are usually obvious by the time the kitten is six months old, but if these issues are detected then it will be necessary to euthanize the kitten.If you notice that your Manx is not urinating, defecating, or that he is hopping with his back legs instead of walking normally, then take him to see your veterinarian right away.

 You can use basically any type of food that breaks down into symmetry, for example, graham crackers, orange segments, etc. Graham crackers are good for fractions, such as thirds and eighths. You can use the guided lines to break up the food into equal parts or use a knife to make bigger pieces.
 Instead of using the 1 cup, instruct the child to use a smaller cup (1/4 cup) and let them count out loud how many fourths equal to a cup (1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 1). You might want to have a separate bowl for their counting, just in case there's too much of an ingredient.

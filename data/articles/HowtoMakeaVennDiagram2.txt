 "SmartArt" is in the Insert tab. Look under the Illustrations group., Look in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic area. Find the one marked "Relationship." In that area, you can select a Venn diagram. For example, you can choose a "Basic Venn" by clicking on it. Click "OK" to select it and create the diagram., After you select "OK," the diagram will appear in your document. It will have "TEXT" in each of the main parts of the circles. You can click on the "TEXT" to add your items to the circles., You must insert text boxes to add text to the overlapping portions, making it a bit more difficult than the text you just added. Click the "Insert" tab. Under it, choose "Text Box," and then click "Draw Text Box.", Use your mouse to draw a text box in the overlapping part. It should be small enough so it doesn't go outside the lines of the overlapping portion. Type in your text.The textbox will be drawn white. Click on the textbox, then click on the "Format" tab at the top. Under "Shape Fill," select "no fill," and under "Shape Outline," select "No Outline." That way, the textbox will now match the Venn diagram's colors.
Add textboxes for all the overlapping areas.
 If you don't like the colors, you can change them by clicking on the Venn diagram and then choosing "Change Colors" under the Design tab. Select a new color from the drop-down menu.

 Dust a surface with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll each sheet of pastry puff into a square that’s roughly 12 x 12 inches (30.5 x 30.5 cm). Take a knife or pizza cutter and divide each square into nine smaller squares of equal size., First, dice up your pepperoni slices and mushrooms. Put those in a large mixing bowl and add your mozzarella and a ½ teaspoon of Italian seasonings. Stir them up until they’re evenly mixed. Place equal amounts of filling on each pastry square. Use your spoon to drag the filling diagonally from one corner to its opposite., Brush water over the edges of each square. Fold them in half diagonally, with the spread-out filling along each one’s crease, so they look like triangles. Pinch the wet edges together where they meet to seal each pocket., Then, in a small bowl, crack and whisk your eggs along with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of water. Take a pastry brush and cover each triangle with the egg wash. Then dust them with the remaining Italian seasonings., Set your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). While that heats up, place your baking sheets in the refrigerator to keep the pastry chilled in the meantime. Once the oven’s ready, transfer the baking sheets and cook for about 15 to 18 minutes, or until the pastry turns a golden color.

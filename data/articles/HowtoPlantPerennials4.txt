 Because there are so many different species of perennials, watering requirements vary based on the specific plant. Keep the soil around the perennials moist, but not soggy. To prevent fungal diseases, water in the morning or early afternoon.
 Mulch will hold moisture in the soil and prevent weeds from growing. Apply 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) of mulch around the plants. Do not allow the mulch to actually touch the stem or branches of the plant or it may reduce air circulation necessary for healthy growth.
 If the soil is rich and amended with organic matter, fertilizing may not be necessary. Otherwise, fertilize with either a slow release granular or liquid fertilizer as needed. Do not over fertilize perennials, which can cause root injury or kill the plants.
 Some taller perennials, such as delphiniums, peonies, phlox and hollyhocks, may require staking. To support the stems, place wooden stakes in the ground and tie stems to the stakes with twine.
 Regularly deadhead faded flowers to keep the plants looking healthy and promote new blooms.
 Perennials may start to look scruffy or leggy after blooming. Most late spring and early summer perennials benefit from clipping after blooming.
 Perennials will continue to grow larger each year, but their continued growth may cause crowding in a garden. To keep the plants healthy, dig perennials out of the ground and split them into smaller chunks. The best times to divide perennials is in the early spring or fall.

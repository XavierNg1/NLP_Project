 There are a few reputable websites such as National Rail and The Train Line, where you can view train timetables, travel information and purchase discount tickets.
 You will be asked to provide your departure station, arrival station, date and time of travel, how many adults and children for which you will be purchasing tickets and if you have any railcards or memberships that provide discount travel.
 You may find that train tickets are cheaper when traveling during off-peak times. Prices will typically also vary depending on which class you would like to sit in on the train. First class is typically most expensive.
, You will need to use a credit or debit card to purchase train tickets online, and you will need to retrieve your tickets from your departing train station from a self-service ticket machine. If your departing train station has no self-service ticket machine you can't make the online purchasing.
 You will need to provide the same card with which you made the payment in order to retrieve your train tickets.

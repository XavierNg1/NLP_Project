 Mix 2 cups (450 ml) of sugar with 3 cups (750 ml) of cold water in a large bowl until the sugar is dissolved.If desired, you can also add 1/2 tsp (1500 mg) ascorbic acid to the syrup to help prevent the apples from browning.
 Transfer the apple slices to the bowl of syrup and mix with a spatula or large spoon until the slices are thoroughly and evenly coated.


You could also coat the apples by pouring the syrup and the slices into a large plastic bag and turning the bag multiple times to coat the apples.
 Use a slotted spoon to transfer the apple slices from the bowl of syrup to a resealable, freezer-safe plastic bag.


Squeeze out excess air from the bag as you seal it.






Do not worry about draining off the excess syrup. You do not want large globs of syrup in the bag, but some syrup is necessary to help preserve the apples.
If desired, you can also use a freezer-safe plastic container instead of a bag.
 When kept this way, frozen apples can retain their quality for 6 to 12 months.


Syrup-packed apples are best used for uncooked desserts and fruit cocktails.

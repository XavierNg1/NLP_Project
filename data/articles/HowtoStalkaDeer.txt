 It's best to wash your stalking clothes by hand without any of the fancy modern fabric cleaning products, since these often have a whitening agent in them to make the clothes seem extra clean. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the clothes then reflect more UV light (which is in the deer's visible spectrum). You'll stand out like a beacon to him if you use these cleaners. (An analogy would be someone stalking you in the fields wearing one of those Dayglo vest that builders and traffic wardens have).;
, Before trying to stalk a deer you ‘’must’‘ be relaxed. Most people get overexcited when they spot a deer so you must remember to stay calm.
 Deer tracks look like two parallel almond-shaped prints that are pointed on the top end. Follow the tracks in the direction of the pointed end.
 Try to avoid following the deer if there are any big rivers or heavy bush to walk through, because deer will run right through it when they are spooked and you will never be able to follow the track.
, If the coyotes and wolves are hungry enough, there is a chance that they will attack humans, so be careful.
,, If you hear the deer call back, you know you are within viewing range. Set up and wait for the deer. Once it is close enough to you, try to make the shot.

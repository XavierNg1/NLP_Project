 Deep muscle techniques like Neuromuscular, Rolfing, and Myofascial Release are designed to get rid of problems in your body that can reduce flexibility. Only go to a massage therapist who is trained in these modalities because injury could occur if the therapist doesn't know exactly what they are doing. A standard massage can help as well, since it will improve circulation to the muscles, allowing them to repair any damage.
 The heat of both of these environments can relax your muscles and aid flexibility. This should be used in conjunction with other methods, however, as it will do little on its own. Hot tubs and saunas are easily found at local fitness clubs and community pools.
 There is a small amount of evidence that acupuncture can help with flexibility.At any rate, it is well demonstrated to relieve muscle pain and improve blood flow, both of which can help flexibility exercise regimens.

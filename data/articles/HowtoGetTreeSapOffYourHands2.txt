 Do not just spray a bunch of WD40 on some fabric and try and rub it out. Make sure that your solution, no matter what it is, won't ruin your clothing or surface by finding an inconspicuous "test area." Place a small drop of the cleaner on this surface and rub it in. Return 20 minutes later and check to make sure that the surface didn't discolor or warp as a result., Using cotton-balls dipped in rubbing alcohol (90% whenever possible), rub the sap stain with a circular motion to lift it from the fabric. This works for clothes, carpets, and curtains. Try and remove the sap before washing and drying your clothes, as this can harden the sap and make it impossible to remove., Mineral oils will gently remove the sap from your car, floors, or any other hard surfaces it might adhere to. The gentle, oil-based cleaner will need to be rubbed into the sap, but it should pull it off quickly.
 Odd as it sounds, a couple of squirts from some powerful bug spray can loosen the sap off of fabrics, flooring, and car roofs. Squirt the surface with spray and let it soak for a few minutes, then try and rub it away.

 Write them so the 3 is directly above the 2, the 1 is above the 0, the 7 is above the 5, and the 4 is above a blank space.


You can write a 0 underneath the 4 if it helps you keep track of which number is above which other number. You can always add zeros in front of a number without changing it. Make sure to add it in front of the number and not after it.
 Always start from the right. Solve for 3-2, 1-0, 7-5, and 4-0, putting the answer to each problem directly underneath the two numbers in that subtraction problem.


You should end up with the answer, 4,211.
 These numbers are the same length, so you can line them up easily. This problem will teach you something new about subtracting integers, if you didn't know it already.
 This is 4 - 8. This is tricky, since 4 is smaller than 8, but don't use negative numbers. Instead, follow these steps:


On the top line, cross out the 2 and write 1 instead. The 2 should be directly to the left of the 4.
Cross out the 4 and write 14. Do this in a small space so it's clear the 14 is entirely above the 8. You can also just write a 1 in front of the 4 to make it 14 if you have the room.
What you just did is "borrow" a 1 from the tens place, or second column from the right, and turn it into 10 in the ones place, or furthest column to the right. one 10 is the same as ten 1s, so this is still the same problem.
 You should now have a 6 on the far right of the line where your answer will be.
 This should now be 1 - 1, which equals 0.


Your answer so far should be 06.
 9 - 5=4, so your final answer is 406.
 Say you're asked to solve 415,990 - 968,772. You write the second number underneath the first, and then realize the number at the bottom is larger! You can tell this immediately by the first digits on the left: 9 is smaller than 4, so the number beginning with 9 has to be larger.


Make sure to line the numbers up correctly before comparing them. 912 is not bigger than 5000, which you can tell if you've lined them up correctly, since the 5 is above nothing at all. You can add leading zeros if it helps, for instance writing 912 as 0912 so it lines up well with 5000.
 Whenever you subtract a number from a smaller number, you'll get a negative number as your answer. It's best to write this sign before solving, so you don't forget to include it.
 Your answer will be negative, as you showed by writing a - sign. Do not try to subtract the larger number from the smaller and just make it negative; you will not get the wrong answer.


The new problem to solve is: 968,772 - 415,990 = -Â ? Look at the Tips for the answer after trying to solve it.

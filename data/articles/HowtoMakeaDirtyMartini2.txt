 This will be a little sweeter, and often benefits from a little extra vermouth. While vodka martini's are much more common these days, there is no reason to stay tied to trends without trying out both drinks for yourself.


There are bartenders who swear by gin up and down the coast in place or vodka, and those who ardently defend vodka. The thing is-- they're both right, so try both!

, A shaken martini actually "bruises" the vodka or gin, chilling it for longer, mixing in the olive juice, and taking some of the flavor of alcohol out. But for a drink with a bit more "umph" in it, got for the stirred martin, James Bond be damned.
 Sour, herbal vermouth is, in some circles, essential for any martini. But a growing legion of bartenders is swearing off vermouth, believing it is a bit too strong of a flavor that detracts from the simple, classic flavors in the drink.


You can also cut the vermouth in half -- adding just a splash to get a little kick without overpowering the drink.
You might add a touch more olive juice in place of the vermouth., The higher quality the the olives, the better the martini. But even cheaper olives will be good if you pay attention to how much brine you're adding. Everyone's perfect ratio is different, so feel free to play around until you find yours.

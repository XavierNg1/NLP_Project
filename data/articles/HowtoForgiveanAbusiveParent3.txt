 Accept that the abuse was not your fault and that you didn’t deserve to be hurt. Let yourself feel angry, sad, betrayed, or whatever other emotions you’re experiencing. If you feel like you lost part of your life to the abuse, or if you’re not happy with the way you coped, forgive yourself and commit to moving on.Be gentle with yourself as you heal. Remember that recovery is an ongoing process that can take years.
Part of being self-compassionate is believing that you’re worthy of love and help, so open yourself to other people’s kindness as well as your own.
 Take a look back at your family history and think about what kind of childhood your abusive parent had. Consider whether they were mistreated or abused themselves. If so, they may have thought it was normal to treat their own child the same way.

A family history of abuse doesn’t excuse abusive behavior, but it can help you understand why your parent acted the way they did.
 Think about all of your abusive parent’s flaws, and consider whether you’ve experienced those same flaws in your own life. Empathizing with your parent might be the last thing you want to do, but it can help you see them in a different light and move closer to forgiveness.For instance, if your parent couldn’t control their anger, ask yourself whether anger has ever gotten the better of you.

 The smallest bin you should get is 106 quarts. If possible, buy the bins with 110-120 quarts. These cost around $11-$15, possibly even more depending on where you are buying from. Common stores to buy bins from are Walmart, Target, Hobby Lobby, Lowes, Home Depot, etc.;
,, Cut out a wire a little bit bigger than what you just marked.
 Be sure to be patient, slow and steady so you don't crack the plastic.
 Place florist wire or wire insert down and begin to lace the picture wire or other wire through the florist wire or wire insert. Lace through all drilled holes.
 Do this twice on the wide sides and once on the long sides. Drill on the TOP, not near the bottom of the bin.

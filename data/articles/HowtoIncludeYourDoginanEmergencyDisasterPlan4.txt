For example, trees may have fallen, new smells may have entered your yard, etc., During a disaster, your yard and home may be altered. Check to make sure that everything is safe before allowing your dog to freely roam around. For instance, wild animals may have taken up shelter in your home or yard during the disaster, and/or power lines may be down, causing hazards in the area., Your dog’s behaviour may change after an emergency. For instance, energetic and friendly dogs may become aggressive or defensive as a result of a traumatic experience. Monitor your dog’s behaviour and keep them in a secure and safe environment until they begin to act normally again.

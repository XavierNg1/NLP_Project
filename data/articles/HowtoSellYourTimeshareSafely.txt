If you have plenty of time and/or you're willing to list for an extremely low price, you can try consumer-to-consumer portals. Timeshares generally run for between $1- $100 on websites like eBay or Craigslist.
If you're looking to make a little more for your timeshare, or you don't feel confident handling the legal aspects of timeshare sales, you may want to work with a professional timeshare broker. Brokers work to connect interested and qualified buyers with sellers like you.;

If you're listing your timeshare for sale on consumer-to-consumer sites, research your competition. Determine the average sale price for a timeshare unit similar to yours. Then set your price and monitor closely. You'll want to be readily available to answer the questions of any potential buyers.
 If you're choosing to work with a timeshare broker, be sure to research their licensing and check to see that they are BBB Accredited. BBB Accreditation helps to ensure that the brokerage agency you're working with is reputable and has minimal client complaints.
 Hire a closing company to handle the legal details and place the money safely in escrow. If you're working with a licensed timeshare broker, they'll most likely take care of this step for you. Ask your broker which closing company they'll be using and research them as well.
 Now breathe a sigh of relief! You've sold your timeshare without paying an upfront fee!

 Instead of emphasizing your child’s physical appearance, focus more on your child’s qualities, characteristics, and abilities. This can help support your child’s body image by helping them create one based on their entire person, not just their looks.Emphasize the importance of abilities like being good at school, participating in sports, or playing an instrument. Let them know that their qualities, such as humor, inquisitive nature, and kindness, are things they should be proud of. These things make them a worthy person.
Tell your child, "You are so kind. This is such an important quality" or "I love that you are inquisitive and ask questions. Let's find ways to answer your questions together."

, Focus on your child’s positive qualities, not their faults. Praise your child for their qualities, talents, and looks. Make sure the compliments are sincere and not fake. Making your home a positive place helps support their body image by making them feel secure, safe, and good about themselves.Never tease your child for their faults or perceived weaknesses. This encourages a negative body image.
Tell your child, “Your hair looks nice today,” “I’m proud of the score on that test,” “Your dancing is looking great,” or “That was a really kind thing you did for our neighbor.”

, Letting your child get involved in activities where they feel good about themselves helps promote a positive body image. Trying new things, interacting with peers, and doing something they enjoy and may excel at can help your child feel good about themselves.Even if your child isn’t great at the activity yet, they can still develop a positive body image through hard work and practice.
Ask your child what they are interested in and encourage them to try new things. These activities can range from sports to music to art to volunteering.
For example, let your child take piano or guitar lessons, dance lessons, martial arts, or painting classes.

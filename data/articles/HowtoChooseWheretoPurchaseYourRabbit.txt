 They all have their advantages! The main kinds of suppliers are:



Pet shops. Sell a wide range of rabbits and are often cheap; however, bad pet shops can sell you sickly, underfed, immature rabbits at a high risk of dying.

Rescue centers and SPCA's. Are more likely to sell adults, and will often take the time to match you up to a suitable pet, as well as the fact that you will be rescuing a rabbit who had a bad start in life; however, some rabbits may have psychological problems, and you are less likely to find kittens (baby rabbits) and pedigrees.

Rabbit breeders. Are more likely to stock good specimens of certain breeds, and supply all ages of rabbits; however, like pet shops, they may only be in it for the money, abusing the female rabbits and turning them into breeding machines, and feeding to the bare minimum.

Friends who have rabbits. This is usually the best choice. You are more likely to know the mother and possibly the father, so have a better idea how the rabbit will turn out, you can ask your friend for help with your rabbit later on, and you can visit often to choose your favorite bunny.;
, Target people who you know have healthy, happy rabbits and ask them what breeder/shop/rescue center they recommend.
, Ask questions that have one right answer, that you know the answer to, and see if they are answered correctly. If not, that probably isn't the best place to get your bunny. Make sure:


There is no overcrowding
The surroundings are clean, and do not smell
The rabbits look happy and healthy
Every enclosure contains at least one container of clean water and hay

, By now you should have only one or at the most two. If there are still two left and you can't decide, look at their rabbits and decide which one has the rabbit you want.

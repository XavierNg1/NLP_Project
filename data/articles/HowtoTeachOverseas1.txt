 While there are some programs that do not require formal teaching qualifications, the best positions abroad are given to people with either a teaching degree or a certification. Seeking teaching credentials in 1 of the following ways will teach you how to make lesson plans, structure a class and more.


Seek an undergraduate degree in education. Attend a college or university that trains and tests teachers. This is the best way to get an international teaching position in something other than English. People who receive degrees in science, math, literature and administrative teaching positions will be able to apply for jobs at national and international schools abroad.
Seek a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certificate. These courses are available in class and online around the world. You will learn to teach English to people who are not native speakers, and jobs will mostly be available abroad. Through a number of different courses, you learn how to teach English abroad. Look for a program that offers TEFL and job placement assistance.
Seek an English as a Second Language (ESL) or Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) certification. While similar to TEFL, these certifications are often used within native English speaking countries to teach travelers and recent immigrants to speak English. If teaching English is your passion and you want to teach abroad and domestically, then this is a good option.;
, An overseas teaching position will require a work visa and passport. Look for positions in countries where visas are issued to your nationality.
 International schools use the British GCSE method, the American AP method and the International Baccalaureate (IB) method. Find a certification or course that addresses each system.

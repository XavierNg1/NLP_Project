 Purchase a degreaser concentrate if you’ve already tried wiping the surface down with a homemade cleaner, or if you just want to use a professional-grade detailer. You can find degreasers for car interiors at your local automotive or home improvement store.Since it’s a concentrated product, you’ll have to dilute the degreaser when you’re ready to use it.
 If you’re using a store-bought degreaser, you’ll need to dilute it before using it on your car vinyl. Mix one part degreaser with four parts of water. Then pour your solution into a clean spray bottle., Spray your diluted degreaser or homemade cleaner directly onto the scuffed vinyl.Scrub with your magic eraser using smooth, even motions until you’ve removed the scuff.For tight spaces that you can’t spray directly, you can spray the scrub pad. If the space is too tight for the scrub pad to access, try using a hard bristle toothbrush.
 The vinyl surface texture will determine the number of scrub pads you’ll need. Smoother surfaces will most likely require only a single pad. If the texture is rougher or more rubberized, you’ll likely wear through a pad and will need to replace it as necessary until you’ve removed the scuff., When you’ve finished buffing out the scuff, you’ll be left with residual cleaner and light debris. Wipe it away using a dry microfiber cloth. Using microfiber will leave you with a lint-free finish.

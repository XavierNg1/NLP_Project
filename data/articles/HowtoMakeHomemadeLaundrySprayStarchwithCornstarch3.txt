 The cornstarch in a homemade spray has a tendency to settle at the bottom of the spray bottle when it’s sitting on the shelf. Before using the spray always give the bottle a good shake to ensure that the ingredients are mixed.The cornstarch is less likely to separate if you use the heated method to make it, but it’s still a good idea to shake it before each use.
 Lay the item of clothing or fabric that you want to smooth out on flat surface. Lightly spray the item with the cornstarch mixture across the entire surface.A little bit of the spray goes a long way so don’t oversaturate your fabric.
 After you’ve applied the spray, run your iron over the fabric to smooth it as you normally would. Work until you’ve removed all of the wrinkles and added whatever creases you’d like to the fabric.Be careful when using a hot iron. It’s easy to burn yourself.

 As social anxiety is considered to be a spectrum, you should take some time to think about just how big an impact your social anxiety is having on your life. If you are just a little nervous about public speaking, but manage to get through it okay in the end, you probably don’t need any professional assistance, just some practice and confidence.


If, however, you feel that your social anxiety is actually preventing you from doing things that you want to, or need to do, then you should consider speaking to a therapist or counsellor.
If self-help and talking to friends and family hasn’t made an impact, look for a professional you can talk to., If you have decided to seek professional support to deal with and overcome your social anxiety, you can start by making an appointment to see your normal doctor. You may benefit from talking it through with her, and asking about the different options available to you. Although your doctor may not have specialist knowledge of social anxiety, she will have some general knowledge and will be able to advise you on the next steps.


Ask for a referral to a therapist who has experience with social anxiety.
Your doctor will be able to make a personal recommendation to you.
A doctor’s recommendation may be more reliable than testimony on a website or some promotional material.

 First-time homebuyers can use $10,000 of their Traditional IRA funds towards the purchase of a new home, without incurring a 10% penalty for taking the money before the age of 59 Â½. The IRS defines a first-time homebuyer as someone who has not owned a primary residence during the past two years. Even if you owned a home more than 2 years ago, you will still qualify as a first-time homebuyer.
Owning a cottage or recreational property does not impact your status as a first-time homebuyer.;
, If legally married and buying the property together, you and your spouse may each withdraw $10,000 from your Traditional IRAs without penalty. The $10,000 per-person limit is a lifetime limit, so you can't withdraw $5,000 twice in two different home situations.


You can also qualify for the $10,000 exemption if you're helping your spouse, child, grandchild or parent buy a home. , You will need to pay federal and state taxes on the money you take from your Traditional IRA, as it will be considered income by the Internal Revenue Service. This may significantly lessen the total amount available to purchase a house.


For example, if you are in the 25 percent tax bracket, your $10,000 withdrawal will translate into only $7,500. , Failing to meet this deadline means that you will have to pay a penalty to the IRS. Remember to retain a dated copy of the purchase or construction contract, and copies of the documents you sign.


The penalty paid to the IRS in this case is 10% on withdrawn money. In addition, the withdrawal is taxed at the same rate as your regular income.
In addition to a downpayment, your IRA money can be used for other acquisition costs, including building or repairs to the house, closing costs and financing fees.

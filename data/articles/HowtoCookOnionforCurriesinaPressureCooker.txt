 This will allow the juices of the onions to get cold and ensure that the process of dicing them is easy on the eyes.;
,, They do not have to be perfect or finely diced. A rough chop is fine. Place them in a pressure cooker.
 Once the pressure has been reached, cook the onions for 15 minutes. Each pressure cooker is different. Some have a continuous sound while others have a whistle go off every few seconds. Once you hear the sound, you start the time from there. But do read the user manual for your pressure cooker to get the best instructions.
 This means you let the pot cool down so you can open the lid (always be careful when opening a pressure cooker—again read the user manual).
 They should almost resemble applesauce in color and texture.
, Now you have sautéed onions ready to use when needed.
 To make curries, just add a small amount of oil to a pot on low-medium heat and add 3-4 cubes (depending on amount of curry you are making). Let the onion cubes melt slowly and then add the remaining ingredients. The onions are fully cooked so you don't need to cook them much further.


Use the cubes for other dishes that call for onion flavor. This can include other stews, chiles, and soups.

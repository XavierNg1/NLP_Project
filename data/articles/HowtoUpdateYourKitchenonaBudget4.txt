 Choose a simple, timeless print or solid color to keep your kitchen up-to-date, and avoid "retro" patterns like paisley or tie-dyed.
 An armoire can be changed into a pantry and an old table or dresser can be used for an island. You may need to refinish the pieces before they will be suitable for use in your kitchen, but a fresh coat of paint and a glossy sealant can transform them quickly and cheaply.
 A dull, tarnished faucet can make a kitchen look grungy and out of date. Extravagant faucet models can be expensive, but even an inexpensive, simple model is a good way to give your kitchen a fresh facelift.
 If you have chairs with cushions on them or towels hanging off the refrigerator door, change them out. Towels being looking grungy fairly quickly, but thankfully, kitchen towels can also be fairly cheap. You can also buy new chair pads to replace any old pads with dated patterns or rips and tears.
 Like other elements, extravagant lighting fixtures can be costly, but you can get relatively inexpensive ones that will be just as effective at lighting your kitchen and will be a huge improvement on an outdated design.

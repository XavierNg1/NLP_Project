 Golden's are like this. They even look like they're smiling sometimes (see pic)!;
, Some Golden's have this habit.
 Try to play so much that you tire yourself out for a the rest of the day and all of the next day too. To do this try these activities: going for really long walks and runs, run around in a field, play Frisbee, play tug of war (only sometimes though, not too often), play catch, play tag, play keep away, wrestle and weed your garden(try it without a weed whacker if you can). Also, to playfully tease people who you are friends with, stick out your tongue at them, gently grab their hair (only if it's okay with them), and pretend to punch or kick them. However, don't really punch or kick someone.
 Never betray them or leave them when they 'aren't fun anymore' or when they need you. Or anytime actually, unless they are dangerous or potentially dangerous.
 Of course you should get down and dirty sometimes, and roll down hills and all that, but make sure that you always take a bath or shower afterwards. Wash your hair regularly, and comb or brush it a lot. Also brush your teeth. Golden have bad breath sometimes, and don't need baths so often, but you aren't all dog, sorry you're also a human. Besides, Golden have a beautiful fur coat, so you should take care of your alternative to fur: hair.
 Golden are not good guard dogs, unless the victim hates being licked, but, like any dog, they can always protect the ones they love if needed.
 They are the leaders of your pack. No dog ever challenges the pack leader.
, Do cute things and say cute things as much as possible.
 Also, try to be friendly, playful, nice, and good with kids.

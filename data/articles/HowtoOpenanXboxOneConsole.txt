 There are no screws that secure the attachment of the side panels of the Xbox One. You can simply use a small flat head screwdriver to snap open these panels. From there, you just need to detach them on both sides.;
, Similar to the Xbox 360, the rear part of the Xbox One can be pried open. Still using your screwdriver, pry the tabs open at the back of the unit to unlock them. Remember to put a bit of pressure to the parts that has been unlocked already to prevent them from snapping back in.


You can use another screwdriver by sticking it in between unlocked tab gaps to make sure they won’t lock back while you pry open the rest of the tabs.
 After unlocking the rear panel clips, you can now easily open the Xbox One’s casing. This console does not have a faceplate like the Xbox 360 so there’s nothing much to be done on its front panel to do this step. In a way, this makes opening an Xbox One casing easier compared to its predecessor.
 Upon opening the casing, you will be greeted by the Wi-Fi board and its IC’s rested on top of the Xbox One’s inner casing. You can simply detach them by using the Torx 8 (T8) screwdriver.
 Use your T10 screwdriver to remove the screws that secure the top panel of the inner case. There are a total of 9 8x64 mm Torx 10 screws to be removed.
 Slowly lift up the top panel right after clearing all 9 screws. Now, the core of the Xbox One is exposed. From here, you can either choose to remove its Litton Blu-Ray drive or its 500 GB SATA II hard drive for upgrade or repairing.


You can also dust off your Xbox One motherboard or clean its fan while it's exposed.

 Right outside the Skandia Town, you will find a cabbage to your left, a few steps away from the Traveling Priest. Pick it up and then read the description of the item. It mentions a Tiny Bunnyhop near the Logging Site, and you can use the Cabbage to lure it.


The Tiny Bunnyhop can be found at x:251, y:247, between the sleeping lumberjack and a lumberjack chopping a wood.
 After feeding it with cabbage, the bunny will start following you.
 Right across the street you'll find a little girl named Millia.
 You will be rewarded for your effort with a new title, Pet Whisperer, which gives you another +8 Damage bonus.

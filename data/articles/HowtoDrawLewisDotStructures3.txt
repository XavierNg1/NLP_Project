 The atomic symbol for an ion will the be the same as the atomic symbol for the atom that formed it. Leave enough space on the paper around the symbol to be able to add electrons and brackets later. In some cases, ions are polyatomic (more than one atom) molecules and are designated by writing the atomic symbol for all atoms in the molecule.To create the symbol for polyatomic ions (such as NO3- or SO42-), follow the instructions for “Creating Lewis Structures for Large Covalent Molecules” in the above method.
 Generally, atoms are neutral and do not carry a positive or negative charge. However, when an atom loses or gains electrons, the balance of positive and negative charge in the atom is altered. Then the atom becomes a charged particle known as an ion. On you Lewis structure, add any extra electrons and remove any electrons that were given up.When drawing the electrons, keep the octet rule in mind.
When electrons are lost, a positive ion (known as a cation) is formed. For example, lithium loses its one and only valence electron during ionization. Its Lewis structure would just be ‘Li’ with no dots around it.
When electrons are gained, a negative ion (known as an anion) is formed. Chlorine gains one electron during ionization, giving it a full shell of eight electrons. Its Lewis structure would be ‘Cl’ with four pairs of dots around it.
 Counting dots on every atom would be a tedious way of determining if that atom had a charge. To make the structures easier to read, you need to show that your structure is an ion with some charge. To show this, draw brackets around the atomic (or polyatomic) symbol. Then, write the charge outside the brackets in the upper right corner.For example, the magnesium ion would have have an empty outer shell, and would be notated as 2+.

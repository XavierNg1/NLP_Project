 Tap the Home button to exit the Settings then tap the App Store on your iOS device to open the App Store.
 Tap the “Purchased” button on the bottom toolbar, and you should now be able to see all your purchased apps under the country where you changed to. Swipe up and down to scroll through them.
 Instead of browsing through your apps, use the search field located on the header. Key in the name of the app you’re searching for, and all the apps matching the search parameters will be filtered.
 Tap the cloud icon beside the app or apps you want to download. Since you already own these apps, you won’t be asked to pay for them again. The selected apps will be downloaded to your iOS device.

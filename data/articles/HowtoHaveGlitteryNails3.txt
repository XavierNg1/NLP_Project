This will help your nails to grow longer, keep your hands clean, and make your hands more soft.



This can be whatever color your glitter is, if preferred.
If you want to have more fun with this, paint your ring and thumb finger a different color.



You can sprinkle less glitter on the different colored nails so you can see the color of them.
 When your nails are dried completely, put the glitter back in the container and you are done!

 If your first attempt at resignation was an email or fax, be sure to actually resign in person. A letter of resignation should merely be a form of documentation (though this is very important), but your message should come directly from you. Your boss is less likely to refuse you to your face., If your boss has not accepted your resignation, double-check that you are not violating a contract of employment. If you are, begin taking steps to get out of it. If you are not contractually bound, you can move forward with making your resignation stick.
 Before you confront your employer, practice what you are going to say. This will ensure that you explain all the essential details and stay focused.You could say, “I have decided it is time for something new. My last day here will be November 1. I know you may have a hard time understanding, but my decision is final.”
If your employer pushes back you can re-state that final line: “My decision is final.”

, Review any employee documents (like a handbook or contract) to learn how to resign in the appropriate way.Some companies actually want employees to resign and leave the same day.
Other companies want employees to provide significant notice.
Some companies require written documentation of resignation, submitted through specific channels.
 Now that you know the company’s protocol, systematically follow it. Be sure you are following the guidelines exactly, as it will be one less snag your boss can hold against you.

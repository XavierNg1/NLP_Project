, This can help you to know you are not alone in what you are feeling.
 This is very important when you have CGD. Talking to a therapist does not mean you are weak and crazy, however, it can help you work through how you are feeling and address any core issues that are worsening how you feel.

 Sometimes people with CGD feel that life is not worth living anymore. If you feel this way or have suicidal thoughts, talk to a trusted friend, family member, mentor, pastor, or other responsible, trustworthy adult. You could also ask for help from an organization, such as the crisis textline (text to 741-741) or a suicide hotline.. If it's an emergency, call the Emergency Services.
 It is okay to remember your loved one; you don't have to forget your loved one to "move on." However, if you are preoccupied continually with thoughts of your loved one, it can be unhealthy. It is important to find ways to remember them, such as making a scrapbook, planting a tree in their honor, or visiting their graveside, while still finding ways to live in the moment.


You may want to find new ways to socialize, get involved with community service, keep a journal of the (even small) good things that have happened, etc. You may want to have a professional assist you in doing these things.

 You'll need to be running Android 5.0 or later with the latest version of the Google app in order to use this Google Now command.
 This will enable Google Now.
 You'll see the Flashlight toggle appear in the Google Now app.


You can also type "flashlight on" into Google Search to accomplish the same thing.
 When using Google Now, you can't disable the flashlight through the Quick Access Panel. You'll need to turn it off through Google Now. You can either say the command or tap the slider in the Google Now app.

 Exchange requires special handling because Exchange has access to files and databases at all times. Using backup software that can't handle this can result in skipped files and incorrect backups.
, Offline backup will stop the Exchange database and services. Online backups can be run while the Exchange server is in use.
 Full backups back up everything. Incremental or differential backups backup changes in exchange stores, directories or folders and takes less time to run.

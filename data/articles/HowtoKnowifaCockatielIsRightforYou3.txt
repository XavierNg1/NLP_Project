 Some pet stores sell young birds that do not eat adult food yet. This can be a problem. An unweaned bird may beg you for food, and you may have to hand-feed them for several weeks. Before purchasing a bird, make sure that it has been fully weaned.If you’re uncertain, you can put a deposit on the bird, and ask to return in two or three weeks to pick it up. If the bird is still healthy, you can take them home.
 Cockatiels are typically very social birds. Before buying, ask to hold the cockatiel. While any bird can bite if they are surprised, an ideal cockatiel should not be afraid of you. Give the bird a few minutes to get used to you before you make any judgments.Hold out a finger, and see if the bird hops onto it. If so, they have already been tamed.
Even if they do not hop onto your finger right away, a social cockatiel will probably come up to you when you approach the cage.
If the bird hisses, backs away, or hides from you, they may have a bad temperament.
 A healthy cockatiel will have clear open eyes and smooth clean feathers. They should be alert and energetic. Give the bird a quick inspection to make sure they are generally healthy.The feathers over the body should lie flat. If the feathers are ruffled or patchy, the bird may be stressed or ill.
If the cockatiel is sitting with the feathers puffed up and the eyes half-closed, it may mean that the bird is sick.
Check the beak to make sure that there are no cracks, flakes, or crookedness.
Lift up the bird, and examine their underside. If it is wet or dirty, it may mean that the bird has diarrhea.
 Within three days of purchase, you should take your cockatiel to an avian vet for a full health exam. Birds don’t always show signs of sickness, so this visit will be important in identifying if there are any problems.An avian veterinarian is a vet that specializes in birds. You can look up a local avian vet at the Association of Avian Vet’s website.

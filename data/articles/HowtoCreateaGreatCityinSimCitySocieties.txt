 This can make for an interesting post on the SimCity websites. Prepare to make captioned screenshots so you can create an album of your city's evolution.;
, There are a few different methods in which you can design your roads and buildings. You can use a system of town squares, where you build a simple quadrilateral shape for your road, line it with essential buildings like banks and grocery stores, give the small district a name, and place an ornamental fountain or monument in the middle. Eventually, you can build up on these and create many different "squares" that are connected by subway. This eliminates a lot of carbon emissions, and is appealing to look at. This is a mere suggestion; keep in mind that there are many other types of layouts that you can use. You can even make one up if you want to.
 There is no cleaner way to supply your city with energy than wind farms. There is no carbon footprint, plus they are interesting to look at and make your city skyline look very sophisticated.
 While a Baroque fountain adds points to your total Prosperity, it can get in the way. Sometimes such a concept along the lines of "too much of a good thing isn't very good" is valid in this situation. One or two monuments in a three-square radius are pretty to look at, but if you place one everywhere you have extra space, they don't look as sophisticated; your city looks overdone.
 Tall skyscrapers can add an interesting effect, but if there are too many, your skyline can look messy.
 See what your city would look like to an actual person walking down the street. This will give you a better idea on what you do well and what you need to improve on.
 If you have a ton of Knowledge, but you are lacking in the Authority area, then the next time you have enough money to buy something, pay attention to that.

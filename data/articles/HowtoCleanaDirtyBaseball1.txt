 A simple pencil eraser can remove most stains from white leather, including grass stains and scuffs. Using a small eraser, such as one on a pencil top, can help to clean up a small scuff or mark on a particular spot on the baseball.You can also use it to rub away dirt from the whole surface. However, you might want to get a larger eraser for cleaning the entire ball.


You can use any type of common eraser, including ones made of rubber, vinyl, or art gum.
Try to find an eraser that is either white or free of any intense color. Erasers that are dyed bright colors like pink may rub off onto your ball, making an even worse mark.
Don't use this method on an autographed baseball. The eraser is likely to remove ink just as readily as it will dirt.Don't use this method on stains that are still wet, which can spread the stain. Blot away excess liquid with a moist paper towel and wait for it to dry.;
, Be sure to also wash your hands before you begin and wipe down your work area.
 Press the eraser against the surface of the ball. Rub the eraser back and forth over the spot you wish to clean, just as you would erase a mark off of a piece of paper. Repeat this motion until the dirt or marks come away.

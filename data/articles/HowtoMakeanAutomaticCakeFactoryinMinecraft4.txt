 If there is an uneven bulge, move everything around a little bit, just enough to smooth it out. Bulges make it look unprofessional, so you might want to fix anything structurally.


If there is a weird hole in the wall, patch it up, or a bad accident could happen.
Patterns are tricky, so make sure it looks like right. Redo the floor if it doesn't, and try not to completely block of the room during construction.
For safety measures, inspect the building before anyone comes in so you know everything is safe. If griefed put TNT next to a pressure plate and someone stepped on it, your workers might not come to work ever again.
 Build a little stream and a bridge going over it. Line it with flowers, and have benches and tables along the way for players to rest on. You can even add in little special features like a beach or a place to have fun on the way home. Swap out stone for a prettier, more natural material, like red sand or gravel. Grow trees for shade, and don't worry about mob-proofing it. Just tell players to have a sword handy on the commute to and from work.
 Make sure it is all hidden, and test it to ensure it works. If not, have someone else try to use it while you inspect it, and find out where it went wrong. Once you fixed that area, test it again to see if there are any other errors. Fixing this before the factory opens is a plus.

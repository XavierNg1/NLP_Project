 Use a high quality, oil-based paint. You can either spray, brush, or roll it on depending on what look you are trying to achieve. Buy the appropriate painting tools depending on which tool you want to use.


Spraying the paint on will give it the smoothest look, rolling the paint on will add a little texture, and brushing the paint on will add a ton of texture.;
, You can find many high quality waxes at a home improvement store that are specifically made for metalwork. Ask for that type of wax when you go to buy it. You will use the wax after the painting is finished for a final seal.
 If your stainless steel is relatively new and hasn’t already had years of abuse, you may need to do some damage to it yourself. Stainless steel has such a smooth finish that the paint has a hard time sticking to it. If your stainless steel has been scuffed up over years of used, the paint might stick. Otherwise you will need to use a sander to scuff up the paint. You don’t need to destroy the stainless steel, just add some scuff marks to simulate normal usage.


You can rent a sander from your local home improvement store.
If you don’t want to rent a sander you can try doing manual abrasion. Grab a wire sponge and spend some time scraping at the stainless steel with the sponge. This may be able to simulate scuff marks too. , You need to rid the stainless steel of any grease, dirt, or other debris. It’s a good idea to use a specialized steel cleaner or a degreaser, both which can be found at a home improvement store. If you use a cleaner, note the drying time listed on the bottle. Wait that amount of time before continuing your project.

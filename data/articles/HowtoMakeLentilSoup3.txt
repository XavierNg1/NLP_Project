 Place 2 tablespoon (29.6Â ml). olive oil in a Dutch oven that is 6 quarts large. Wait for it to heat up for at least one minute before you add more ingredients.
 Add 1 cup of chopped onion, 1/2 cup of finely chopped carrot, 1/2 cup of finely chopped celery, and 2 tsp. of kosher salt to the Dutch oven. Cook these ingredients until the onion becomes translucent. This should take about 6 or 7 minutes. Stir the ingredients a bit to combine them.
 Now, add the rest of the ingredients to the oven: 1 cup of peeled and chopped tomatoes, 1 pound of lentils, 2 quarts of chicken/vegetable broth, 1/2 tsp. of coriander, 1/2 tsp. of cumin, and 1/2 tsp. of grains of paradise. Stir the ingredients well to combine them. After that, heat the oven to high heat and wait until you've brought the ingredients to a boil.
 Cook the ingredients for the soup at a low simmer until the lentils are tender. You can test them with a fork from time to time. If you'd like the consistency to be a bit thicker, then you can puree the ingredients in a stick blender before serving.
 Enjoy this hearty soup with a baguette. It should only take a few minutes to cool down and to be ready to eat. If you have leftovers, just refrigerate the soup and enjoy it for the next few days.

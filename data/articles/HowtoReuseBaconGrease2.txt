 Rub a small amount of cooled grease on a small cut to lubricate and alleviate redness and swelling.
 Clean area first and then rub bacon grease over the splinter and cover with a bandage. Let grease/fat sit on the skin overnight and then remove the bandage the next day. The grease should soften the skin and loosen the splinter. If the splinter is being stubborn, repeat and try again.

 Cows tend to get in a bad mood after a cold bath and don't behave for the rest of the day.;
, If possible, tie the cow to a wall or the side of a building and not a post, so the cow can't walk in circles or get tangled up in the rope. Leave no more than 50cm (1.5 feet) of rope, so the cow has just enough room to eat hay or grass from the ground. If your cow has never been washed before or has a poor disposition, try tying her with a shorter rope.
, Be extremely careful at the beginning as you can never be sure how your cow will react to the water. If you want to clean the head and face, save that until later and be very careful not to get water in the ears or soap in the eyes.
 Large chunks may need to be cut out if it's possible to do so without making the cow's coat look different.
 They can work like combs to remove anything stuck in the hair. Be aware of the power of your pressure washer and don't hurt the cow by using it on sensitive areas like the belly, udder or face.
 This can be done one side at a time, then the legs and feet. Baby shampoo works well, but there are many products available specifically for washing animals that make your cow a brighter white or have better hair. Using your hands usually works fine for most of the cow's body and upper legs but a hard brush works nicely around the feet and a curry comb can help loosen up dirt on the back.
 Don't leave any soap in the fur.
 If she lies down on straw still wet, the bedding will stick to her and she won't stay clean.

 One way to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety on your honeymoon is to try to limit how much alcohol you drink on the trip. Drinking a little bit of alcohol can be celebratory and relaxing. But drinking copious amounts of alcohol can lead to high emotions and a killer hangover. You may end up feeling more anxious and on edge if you drink a lot of alcohol throughout the day on your honeymoon.You may also consider having less caffeine when you are on your honeymoon, such as coffee, soda, or caffeinated tea. Caffeine can end up making you feel anxious and stressed, especially in high amounts.
 Exercising can help you release any anxiety and allow you to feel energized. You may try squeezing in a morning run when you are on your honeymoon or take an exercise class at your hotel or resort. You and your partner may try working out together on your honeymoon as part of your plans so you can both feel energized on your trip.You may also pack light workout gear like a tension band in your luggage for the trip. This way, you can use the tension band in your hotel room as part of a morning exercise routine, leaving you feeling relaxed and calm for the rest of the day.
 Though you and your partner should want to spend lots of quality time together, you should both also try to have alone time on your honeymoon. This may be as simple as taking time to read alone by the pool while your partner goes for a swim. Or you may end up taking a nap in the hotel room while your partner goes for a run. Try to give each other some space so you can also have alone time as part of the trip.You may talk to your partner about the importance of having alone time before you embark on your honeymoon so you are both on the same page. Having time on your own is an important element of a healthy relationship and you and your partner should try to integrate it in your honeymoon.

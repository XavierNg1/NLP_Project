 You can make crumbles all year using seasonally fresh produce. Try blackberries and strawberries during the summer or pears and rhubarb during the spring. If you use fruit that is considerably tarter, you may need to adjust the sugar. For example, rhubarb will require extra sugar.


Frozen fruit can also be used in crumbles. Don't thaw before covering it with crumble topping. Simply top and bake.
 To add a heftier chewy texture to your crumble topping, consider adding oats. Replace half of the flour with oats. This will give your crumble a bit of a granola taste.


Remember to keep some flour in your topping, even when using oats. Flour acts as a binder and keeps the topping together. It will also help soak up juices from the fruit.
 Nuts can add flavor, nutrition, and crunch to a crumble. Use your favorite nut, or try pecans, walnuts, or hazelnuts. They're best if you use roasted nuts and chop them before adding them to the topping.


Make sure nuts are well mixed into the crumble topping. If simply scattered over the topping, they're likely to burn.
 While apple crumble is great on its own, try adding a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of ice cream over it. Or pour cr√®me anglaise, a rich creamy custard, over the warm crumble.


You don't have to stick to vanilla ice cream. Apple crumbles work well with caramel or dulce de leche ice cream.

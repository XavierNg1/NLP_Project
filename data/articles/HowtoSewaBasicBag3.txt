 You can buy new fabric or opt to reuse a burlap sack that once held rice or coffee beans.
 Each strip should measure 4 inches (10 cm) by 18 inches (45 cm).
 This piece should measure 18 inches (45 cm) by 45 inches (115 cm).
 Remove 4 long strings from each of the long sides of the large piece of burlap. Cut away any unraveling, if necessary.
,


Fold the burlap in half and pin the sides together.
Use the needle threaded with the burlap string to stitch along each long side twice, making two parallel seams on each side. Leave the third side open.
 Fold 1 inch (2.5 cm) down. Pin it in place and use the burlap-threaded needle to sew it down.
 Reverse the bag so that it is right side out.



Fold each of the handle strips in half lengthwise and pin together.
Sew the edges with the burlap-threaded needle, but keep 1 end open.
 Reach into the ends that you left open and gather the fabric with your fingers until you can grasp the sewn end and pull it through.
, Stitch each end of one handle into the same side of the bag, leaving enough space to have a loop for your hand to hold or to fit over your shoulder.


Sew two short seams separated by approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) across the handle ends. Do the same on the other side.



Stitch some eye-catching fabric to the inside for a liner.
Glue or sew rhinestones and beads to the outside of the bag. When using glue on burlap, place a piece of cardboard inside the bag so the glue doesn't seep through the fabric and glue your bag closed. Let the glue dry for 4 to 6 hours.
Cut scraps of gingham into letters to form words and glue those to the bag.
Or, glue brightly colored cloth swatches or symbols to it.
Print a design on the bag with a stencil and fabric color.

 To diagnose periodontal disease, a veterinarian will examine your dog’s teeth and measure the gingival pockets (spaces between the gums and teeth) using a dental probe. A dental probe is a fine metal probe marked in millimeters that can show whether the gingival pockets are normal or too deep.If the gingival pockets are more than two millimeters deep, then your dog's veterinarian may make a diagnosis of periodontal disease., Since much of the damage caused by periodontal disease may be beneath the gum line, your dog's veterinarian may x-ray your dog’s mouth to help make a diagnosis of periodontal disease. X-rays will reveal whether the alveolar bone (bone connected to the teeth) is healthy, or if it has become soft and brittle., Treatment options will depend on the severity of your dog’s periodontal disease. In some cases, your dog’s veterinarian will recommend cleaning your dog’s teeth while your dog is under sedation, but other cases may require tooth extraction (pulling out teeth).


Keep in mind that multiple professional cleanings may be necessary to save your dog’s teeth.Talk to your dog’s veterinarian about the best course of treatment for your dog.
 After your dog has been treated for his periodontal disease, you will need to provide good dental care for your dog at home. This will include daily tooth brushing with a special dog toothbrush and dog-friendly toothpaste.


Never use human toothpaste on your dog because it can make him sick.

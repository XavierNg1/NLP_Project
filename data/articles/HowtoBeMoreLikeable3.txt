 In order to become likable, it is important that you show the world that you are proud of yourself. Having your own unique style will prove to them that you have confidence in yourself.
 Keeping clean is an important aspect of being likable. Although you may have a wonderful personality, people will be hesitant to come near you if you smell bad. It is best to groom yourself daily, which includes regular showers and facial cleansing. You can invest in an excellent shampoo and conditioner to tame your hair. In addition, to making you more presentable to others, maintaining personal hygiene also minimizes your risk of illness.Shaving is an important aspect of grooming. Apply shaving cream or soap before removing unwanted hairs with a razor. Be sure to periodically rinse out your razor to prevent hair from clogging it.
Apply deodorant or an anti-perspirant on a daily basis in order to prevent body odors.

Wash your hands. Do so before meals and after partaking in dirty jobs (e.g. gardening). While doing so, remove dirt from your fingernails in order to maintain a healthy appearance.
 It is important that you brush your teeth twice a day for about two minutes, as well as after meals. Also, brush your tongue to remove bacteria and promote fresh breath. Replace your toothbrush every three months or when the bristles are worn out. Additionally, floss every day before bed to discourage plaque from building up in between your teeth. Take care of your lips by applying chap stick, especially during the colder months.
 For example, if your eyes are a unique color, use a hint of mascara and eyeliner to draw attention to it. However, understand that makeup is optional and does not have an impact on how likable you are.

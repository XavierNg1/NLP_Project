 Engage in erotic repartee. Exchange compliments and praise. Verbalize your feelings, thoughts, desires, dreams and interests.
 Hug your partner often and touch them gently. Smell and look nice for each other. Wear the outfits they tend to favor. Enjoy delicious beverages and meals together.
 Hold hands, stroke hair, rub feet, neck, and shoulders. Laugh together.
 Literally! Choose activities that get your blood pumping like hiking, biking, walking, running, swimming and wrestling!

, Spend time in your community, with your friends and family, and maybe even volunteer. Travel together. Hang out at coffee shops and wine bars instead of at home on the sofa.
 Our sexuality runs deep, sometimes deeper than we know. It okay to be frustrated, to hit walls, and to have to regroup.


Remember what your reasons and goals are, and remove yourself from situations that pressure you one way or another (that includes friends and family).
Include your partner in these moments. Repeat as necessary.

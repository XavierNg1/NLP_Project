 When you're at the beach looking for a potential guy, you have to make yourself feel pretty and have the confidence to go up and talk to him. (Don't overdo it with the makeup, you're at the beach after all.)

, If you want to find a hot guy at the beach, you need to look around first. Look at places like the concession stand or in the lifeguard seats, in the water surfing, or playing games on the sand. Be sure to check that your chosen guy's not with girlfriend already.
 Try to make eye contact with him. This will help you to get his attention and maybe even get him to come up and talk to you. Ways to attract attention include:


Wave at him as you walk by.
Throw a ball in his direction and run to fetch it.
Let your dog run near him. Chase after your dog.
"Lose" your sunglasses near him, then go searching for them.
Have a friend chase you around and eventually get near to where he is.
 Once you get his attention, smile and be friendly.
 Introduce yourself. Keep the conversation lively and interesting; show him that you're smart and cool and are keen to get to know him some more.Then once the ice is broken, you can start flirting. Things to talk about include:


Go up and say hello. Make a conversation about whatever the guy's doing, such as walking a dog, throwing a Frisbee or playing sport.
Ask if you can join the game he's playing on the beach.
Ask if he'd like to get an ice cream or drink with you.
Tell him you've seen him at the beach before and ask whether he lives nearby. (Only if this is the case.)

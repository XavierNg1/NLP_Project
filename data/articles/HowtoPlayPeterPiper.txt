 A blackboard, whiteboard, large piece of paper etc. will all suffice. The trick though, is to mix up all the words so that it is difficult to make out the verse clearly.;
,, The rest of the players must sing, to any familiar tune (Yankee Doodle, for instance):


Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
Now if Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
Where is that peck of pickled peppers,

,, If a mistake is made in pointing, the player takes her place with the rest and another player is out. Each one is given a turn.
 It is an achievement, if done successfully, and some suitable gift should be given as a prize.

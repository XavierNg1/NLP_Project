 The most common early symptoms are a fever and a sore throat, as well as sore and swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck. This may or may not be followed by abdominal pain, vomiting, and/or chills.


With a Group A Strep infection, your tonsils are often coated with white chunks (called "exudate") that can be seen if you open your mouth very wide and look in a mirror.
A sore throat caused by Group A Strep usually does not have a cough, which is one way that you can differentiate it from other infections.;
, The scarlet fever rash caused by Group A Strep is usually red with a rough feel, similar to sandpaper. The rash may be the first symptom to appear, or it may appear up to seven days following the onset of other signs and symptoms.


The rash typically begins by affecting your neck, your underarms, and your groin area.
The rash can then spread to affect other areas of the body.
The rash is often accompanied by a very red tongue (called a "strawberry tongue"), a flushed face, and red lines in various skin folds including the groin, armpits, knees and elbows.
 Therefore, if your child develops these symptoms, it is important to bring him or her to a doctor immediately. Keep in mind, however, that Group A Strep infections and scarlet fever can develop in people of any age.

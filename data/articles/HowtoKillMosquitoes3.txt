 Still water is breeding grounds for mosquito larvae. Regularly empty all rain barrels, kiddie pools, pet water dishes, and other water containers. For puddles and other sources of water you can't pour out, add an insecticide targeted at killing mosquito larvae.



Always read the warning label on insecticides to find out if pets or young children could be harmed by drinking the treated water. Products that use bacterial agents to kill the larvae, rather than chemicals, are typically safer for other animal life., These are sources of standing water, and therefore mosquito breeding grounds, that you may not have thought of. Eliminate clutter from your yard often, especially during rainy weather.
 Keeping your lawn well-mowed and your shrubs trimmed back reduces the chance that pools of dew or rainwater will be trapped.Water your garden only as much as needed, making the soil moist but not soaked or covered in puddles.

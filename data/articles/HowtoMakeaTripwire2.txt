 A standard 20 or 24 ounce bottle is fine for this purpose.
 Mark the middle of the bottle. Use a hacksaw or scissors to cut the bottle in half. You'll use the top half of the bottle for this trap., Use sandpaper to smooth the edge of the bottle. Also, tape over the edges with duct tape., Stretch the rest of the balloon over the bottle opening. It doesn't have to go over all the edges. It just needs to stretch across the middle in a single band., Part of a Popsicle stick would work well for this project. It should be shorter than the balloon band is wide. Round the edges., Place hot glue on the piece of wood. Glue down a strong piece of string across the wood., The balloon should go across the width of the balloon band. Let the strings go down on either side. Pull the ends through the mouth of the bottle, going from the inside of the bottle to the outside., Tie a knot in the thread that rests partway down the inside of the bottle. , Use three pieces of sharp wood that are longer than the half bottle. Glue or tape them them on to each side. They should stick out past the mouth but not out past the other end. You'll use these to stick the tripwire in the ground., Use a small piece of wood that barely reaches across the mouth of the bottle. Tie a long string to the end., Tie the other end of the string to the top of a small stake. A Popsicle stick will work for this part as well., Place the small stick under the knot. Angle the wood across the mouth of the bottle., Push the stakes in the ground, being careful not to pull the trigger.To truly prank your friends, you need to disguise the trap somehow. However, you can't hide the top of the bottle, as that will release your trap.
 Stretch the string out to the stake. Shove the stake in the ground., Tip flour or water into the balloon trap., When the wire is tripped, the balloon will throw the flour or water into the air, getting it all over your friend.

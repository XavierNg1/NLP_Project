 Smart Connect is the app to use when you want to sync your Android device to a Sony smartwatch. You can get it for free on Google Play.
 Open your device Settings, tap “Wireless and Networks” and then “Bluetooth.” Slide the toggle switch ON to enable Bluetooth.
 Do this by tapping on “Make device discoverable” and on “OK” from the same Bluetooth screen.
 Do this by long-pressing its Power button until the pairing screen appears with a watch and mobile icon on it.
 Tap “Search for Bluetooth devices” on your phone, and select the smartwatch when it appears in the results. A new screen will pop up displaying a code.


Check that this code and that on your smartwatch matches, then tap the checkmark on your smartwatch to confirm. Tap “Pair” on your phone to connect the two devices.
 Locate the Smart Connect icon on your home screen or app drawer. It’s the one that looks like a smartphone with a blue S over it.
 On the screen you will see a symbol of a smartwatch. Below this will be an “Enable/disable” button.


Tap “Enable” button to enable the smartwatch. It will begin syncing with your Android device.

 If you think that you might have offended or upset someone, take a moment to read back over your correspondence. Make note of anything that could have potentially offended them and address it.

You can say “Hey, earlier when I was talking about Father’s Day, I forgot what you told me about your dad. I hope I didn’t upset you.”

, Remember that unless someone says “I’m angry,” you don’t know for sure. They could be sad, excited, annoyed, or completely content. They might be too busy to respond to your message or to respond at length like they normally would., Look back over their latest messages or posts and assess how positive or negative each word is. For instance, if someone says “I love going to that delicious restaurant”, we know that at least two of those words are considered positive. If they say “I loathe looking at his evil face” however, at least two of those words are negative. Look to their words one by one to derive their underlying meaning., When someone is angry, they might lash out and be hateful towards others. Notice if they have said anything rude to anyone or if they have been deliberately offensive to them in any way. These are all signs of anger.

For instance, if they call someone ugly or an idiot, they might be mad.
 Some people use curse words regularly in speech and others use them only when upset. If your normally mild mannered friend all of a sudden begins cursing on a Facebook post, then they might be angry about something.

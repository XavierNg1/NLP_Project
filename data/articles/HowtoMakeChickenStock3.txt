 Any soup you can dream up - from chicken noodle to broccoli to asparagus - tastes better when it's made with homemade stock. Substitute your homemade stock cup for cup for whatever your recipe requires.
 This is another dish that tastes infinitely better when it's made with homemade stock.
 Chicken stock takes a lot of time and effort to make, so you may want to make a huge batch you can store for later use. Put it in a food storage container that's tightly sealed, and freeze it for up to 5 months.


You can freeze the stock in convenient portions that you can thaw out when you want to make a batch of soup by freezing it in 1 - 2 cup food containers.
Freeze the stock in ice cube trays if you need it for recipes that require just a little stock.

 As you know, the double quote symbol " has special meaning in Java (displaying text). Whenever you want to ignore one of these meanings, use the escape character \ (backlash). This character tells the compiler that the next character is part of an alternate instruction.


Make sure you are hitting the backslash key, not the forward slash. The backslash key is next to the } key on most English keyboards.;
, These two characters together are called an escape sequence. Each escape sequence has a special meaning. In this case, \" just means "insert a double quote symbol here,", without interpreting it as the beginning or end of text.


You will need to use this sequence for each individual double quote you want to display.
 The escape sequence does not affect the rest of your code. There is no need to type anything else to return to normal programming.
 One common mistake is to leave out the plain old " mark in your program. Remember that \" is just for display, and does not remove the need to encase your display text in quotation marks. Here's an example:


1. The string for displaying "Hello" is \"Hello\"

2. To instruct the compiler to print this text, we wrap it in quotes: "\"Hello\"".
3. Here's what this looks like in a complete line of code:

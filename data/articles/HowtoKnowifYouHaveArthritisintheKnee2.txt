 Probably one of the most important treatments for arthritis is losing weight, though many people find this difficult. Reducing the amount of weight your knees carry, decreases the load and damage to the joint and can lower your risk of osteoarthritis., Limiting certain activities may be necessary and learning new exercise methods may be helpful to prevent or reduce arthritis damage.Aquatic exercise is an excellent option for patients who have knee problems.
Using a cane or a crutch in the hand opposite the affected knee will help decrease the demand placed on the joint.
 Many joint supplements contain molecules that are naturally made in the body, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, and are important for healthy cartilage in your knee joints.Although joint supplements may control pain, it is now clear that they do not regenerate cartilage. Good studies have shown that there is no better benefit than placebo, but risks are minima (other than to your wallet), so most orthopedists advise to give it a try.
Some doctors recommend you take joint supplements for a period of three months to see if they provide any help.
Over-the-counter joint supplements are not typically controlled by the FDA. You may want to consult your doctor before taking these supplements.

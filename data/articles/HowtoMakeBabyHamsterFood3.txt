 Although many adult hamsters get water through vegetables, it is also important to provide water--especially to babies.Place water drinking tubes low enough so the babies can reach them.Make sure water is filtered and sans chlorine.Change water every day.Never give your hamster chocolate, alcohol, or caffeine. These substances can harm your pet!, Hamsters need salt to keep water in their system. Salt generally keeps them healthy as well. In nature, they might lick rocks to receive needed sodium. To give a similar experience, buy salt licks at your pet store., When you want to feed your pet anything new, especially fruits and vegetables, speak with your vet first.Particularly, avoid treats that have a high sugar content. Vitamin and mineral supplements are also likely unnecessary but to be safe, speak with your vet first before giving your pet supplements.

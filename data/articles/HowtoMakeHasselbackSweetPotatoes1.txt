 Place 3 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Carefully hold the handle of the saucepan and gently swirl the butter as it melts. Continue cooking the butter once it's melted so it begins to foam. It should slowly turn brown and smell nutty. Remove it from the stove and pour it into a small bowl.It's important to take it off the heat as soon as you smell the butter browning. Butter can quickly overcook and burn.
If you don't want to brown the butter, you can just substitute olive oil for the 3 tablespoons of browned butter.;
, Wash 2 large sweet potatoes and use a sharp knife to carefully slice away a thin, horizontal piece off the bottom of each potato. This will give you a sturdy base to cut the potatoes. Slice down through the sweet potatoes every 1/4-inch (6.3 mm) taking care to leave 1/8-inch (3 mm) at the bottom. You should also turn on the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).If you cut completely through the sweet potatoes when you make the thin slices, the sweet potatoes will fan out and fall apart as they bake.
 Set the sweet potatoes in a roasting pan and sprinkle them with 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Take the fresh thyme and pull away the leaves. Tuck 2 teaspoons of the fresh thyme in between the sweet potato slices. Pour the browned butter over both of the seasoned sweet potatoes.You can use a pastry brush to spread the brown butter evenly throughout the sweet potato slices.
 Place the sweet potatoes in the preheated oven and cook them for 45 to 55 minutes. Test the potatoes for doneness by poking the center of a sweet potato with a small knife. It should be soft and easy to pull the knife out. Remove the sweet potatoes and serve them right away.Larger sweet potatoes will take slightly longer, so check your sweet potatoes earlier, if they're small.

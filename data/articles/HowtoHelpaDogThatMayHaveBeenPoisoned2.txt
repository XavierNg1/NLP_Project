 If you think your dog is suffering from poisoning, they will likely need veterinary attention. Call ahead when you’re on your way, so that they can prepare for your arrival. (This will also ensure they are open.)If your vet is closed, bring your dog to a 24hr emergency animal care facility.
Bring evidence to the vet with you. Bring the packing and remnants of any poisonous item your dog may have eaten with you. This will help the vet determine treatment.
 The APCC is only a call away, everyday, year round. Aside from your vet, it is the best resource for any animal poison-related emergency. The center’s number is (888) 426-4435, and they charge a $65 consultation fee for the phone call., Your dog may continue to vomit and have diarrhea, even after seeing the vet. Try to make your dog as comfortable as possible, and keep them somewhere it will be easy to clean up any messes. Provide ample water and feed them according to your vet's recommendations. Most importantly, administer medication exactly as directed.

One pound halibut, chopped into 1/2-inch cubes
1 teaspoon salt
3 Tablespoons lime juice
2 ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced
1/2 cup diced tomatillos
1/4 cup diced onion
1 jalape√±o, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped
2 Tablespoons olive oil

,, Toss the pieces to be sure they are evenly coated.
 Toss to make sure they are evenly coated.
 After about 30 minutes, the flesh should be opaque. If the flesh is still translucent, allow to marinate for another 15 minutes.

 Mix the ingredients until the sugar is completely dissolved.
 Place a sifter over the bowl with the sugar, water, oil, and vanilla essence. Take a spoon and gently mix the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda. Then, sift the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.
 Once you've sifted the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, combine the mixture well by beating it or stirring it.
 Place your pressure cooker over medium heat, and wait for about 5 minutes.
 Take a little butter or oil, and grease the cooking tin for the cake.


Most pressure cookers come with two cooking tins.
 Mix the batter and juice.


The lemon juice reacts with the baking soda, allowing the cake to dry well.
 Once the cake batter is in the tin, tap the sides of the tin to eliminate air bubbles.
 Then, place the tin with the cake batter on top of the first tin. Cover your pressure cooker. Bake the cake over medium heat for the first 5 minutes.
 Move the heat setting from medium to medium-low (for example, from setting 5 to setting 3), and cook the cake for 35 minutes.


Insert a toothpick into the cake to make sure it's fully cooked. If the toothpick comes out dry, the cake is ready. If the toothpick is wet, cook the cake for another 5 minutes then test again.
 Then, let your cake stand in the pressure cooker for about 5 minutes.
 After 5 minutes remove the cake from the pressure cooker, and let it stand for about 10 minutes to cool.
 Finally, take your cake out of its tin, and place it onto a plate. Pour a little powdered sugar over the cake, and cut into slices. Enjoy!

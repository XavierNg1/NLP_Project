 A PAC, or Porting Authorization Code, is a unique alphanumeric code that is used to transfer an existing cellphone number between mobile network carriers. This way, a user can still retain his or her mobile number even after switching to a different service provider.


Different countries have different guidelines regarding the issuing of PAC to subscribers. Basically, all you need to do is to contact your service provider and ask for your Portability Authorization Code. If you meet your respective country’s guidelines on PAC, the service provider should readily issue one for you.
You can get your Porting Authorization Code either for free or with a fee, depending on your network carrier’s policies.
 Call the customer service department of the carrier you want to switch to after you get your PAC. Once you give your new carrier your mobile number and its PAC, they should be able to process your request right away.


Depending on the region, Porting Authorization Codes can only be used after a specific amount of time from the date of issuance (ranging from 2 days up to a maximum of 30 days).
 Your new carrier will issue you a new SIM card that uses your old number from your previous carrier. You should be able to use it normally like you did before, but you’ll now be using the products and services of your new carrier.

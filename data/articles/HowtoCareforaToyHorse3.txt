 Tie the horse up outside the stable, or put it into the paddock. If you are skipping out the stable, just pick up the manure. If you are mucking out entirely, pick up all the bedding and manure and put it into the wheelbarrow. Use the broom to sweep any excess bedding into a pile before picking up. Take the wheelbarrow over to the muck heap and empty it, before getting fresh straw from the bedding shed. Air the bedding out by tossing it in the air before spreading it out neatly in the stall/stable and putting the supplies away.
 Measure out the correct amount of feed before taking it back to your horse. When you put the feed back, check your horse's water and hay net. When your horse has finished, use a bucket sponge to wash out the bucket. Dry it before putting it back into the horse's stall.
 Gently place the saddle cloth over its back, then put the saddle on and do up the girth. Slip the bridle over its head with the bit rings either side of its mouth. Mount your horse or give the horse's reins to its rider. Take your horse through some basic moves for dressage, go for a trail ride or go over some jumps! Do whatever you want.
 Sponge the horse down and put on a light sweat sheet. Walk your horse in the shade of some trees before putting it away.
 Clean the saddle by scrubbing all over. Clean underneath and the girth as well. Clean the bridle by folding the sponge over the straps and running up and down.
 Soak the hay in a bucket of water for a bit. Once thoroughly soaked, hang the hay net up again.

 Use a mortar and pestle or a meat tenderizer to gently press the crackers into powdery crumbs. Gather about 3 tablespoons.
 You may want to slice them on the thinner side or even dice them.
 In a chilled bowl mix ingredients just until combined. Avoid excessive mixing. You want your mixture to be a syrupy consistency.
 Be sure you have washed your mason jars thoroughly with warm water and soap.


Break up a couple pieces of graham cracker and place the chunks at the bottom of the jars.
Pour some cream over the graham cracker pieces until the crackers are covered.
Layer the mangoes on top of the cream. Repeat until you reach the top of the jar.
Cover the top with your crushed graham crackers.
Chill. Close the lids and refrigerate for at least 4 hours so the cream has time to harden.
 You will need a spoon to eat this delicious hand held treat. Make several and surprise party guests with their own individual cake!

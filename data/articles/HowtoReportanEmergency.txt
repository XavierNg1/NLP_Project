 Before you report an emergency, make sure the situation is genuinely urgent. Call for emergency services if you believe that a situation is life-threatening or otherwise extremely disruptive. Here are some genuine emergencies you should report:


A crime, especially one that is currently in progress.A fire.
A life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate attention.
A car crash.;
, The emergency number varies by country. In the United States, it's 911 and is 112 across most of Europe.
 The first thing the emergency dispatcher will ask is where you are located, so the emergency services can get there as quickly as possible. Give the exact street address, if possible; if you're not sure of the exact address, give approximate information.
 This information is also imperative for the dispatcher to have, so he or she is able to call back if necessary., Speak in a calm, clear voice and tell the dispatcher why you are calling. Give the most important details first, then answer the dispatcher's follow-up questions as best you can.


If you're reporting a crime, give a physical description of the person committing the crime.
If you're reporting a fire, describe how the fire started and where exactly it is located. If someone has already been injured or is missing, report that as well.
If you're reporting a medical emergency, explain how the incident occurred and what symptoms the person currently displays.
 After the dispatcher has gathered all the necessary information, he or she may tell you to assist the person or people in need. You may receive instructions on how to give emergency medical treatment, such as CPR. Pay careful attention, and do not hang up the phone until you are instructed to do so. Then follow the instructions you were given.

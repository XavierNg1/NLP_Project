 For waxing to work, there has to be enough hair on your legs for the wax to latch onto. Let your leg hair grow to at least 1/4 inch (1 cm) in length.
 A couple of days before you wax your legs, use a mildly abrasive body scrub to exfoliate them. Do this ahead of time to avoid possible skin irritation problems.
 Just before you wax, sprinkle talc or baby powder on your legs. The powder will absorb any oil on your skin, and the wax sticks more easily to the hair.
 Heat the wax as directed by the manufacturer. Be sure not to overheat the wax—the resulting wax burns can be very painful.
 Have a seat on a surface that can be easily cleaned—waxing can be messy. Apply the wax carefully in a thin, uniform layer. Hold the applicator at a 90° angle, and apply the wax in the direction of hair growth. Don't forget the feet!








, Make the skin taut with one hand, and remove the strip with the other. Pull the strip in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Pull quickly—the slower you pull, the longer the pain.









Keep your hand as close to the skin as possible when you're pulling. It'll be less painful that way. Remove all the wax.
Apply a damp cloth over your legs if needed, to soothe any irritation.
 Soak a cotton pad with a bit of body oil, and apply it on your legs.
 After waxing, use a topical or spray-on antiseptic (containing salicylic acid) to disinfect the area, stop ingrown hairs from forming, and sooth irritation.

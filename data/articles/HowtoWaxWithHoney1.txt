 In a pot or microwave-safe dish, pour ¼ cup (59 ml) honey. Add 1 cup (200 g) of white sugar, then 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Stir to combine evenly.The texture will appear grainy when first mixed.;
, If you’re using the stovetop, turn the burner to low or medium heat and stir periodically as the mixture heats up. If you’re using a microwave, nuke it for 10 to 30 seconds. Then remove the dish, stir the mixture, and repeat as needed, for a combined cooking time of roughly a minute, depending on your microwave’s strength. In either case, remove the mixture from before it comes to a boil or starts to cook.If using a high setting on a microwave, stick to 10-second bursts in between stirring so you don’t overheat it.
Use a food thermometer to check its temperature. The mixture shouldn’t rise over 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius).
 Even though you didn’t bring your mixture to a boil, keep in mind that it’s still pretty hot. Give it a chance to cool down to the point that it’s still warm, but safe to touch. Give it 15 or 20 minutes at least before testing with your finger.Once that feels fine, apply a very small dab to the area that you’re going to wax to test it, just in case it’s more sensitive.
If you’d like, stir in a few drops of your favorite scented oil as it cools for a more fragrant wax.
 Give your mixture a stir with your spoon. The grainy texture should have thickened and grown smooth during heating. If it seems liquidy, stir in another tablespoon of sugar and return it to heat.Remember: since it’s already hot, it shouldn’t take very long for the extra sugar to melt and combine with the honey, so don’t overdo it.

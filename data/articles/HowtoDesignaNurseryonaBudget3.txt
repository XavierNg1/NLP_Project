 You don't need to splurge on fancy bedding for your baby's crib. You can stick to plain colored sheets and blankets over decorative colors, which may be more expensive. If you can't afford a large printed blanket, go for four smaller printed blankets.Make sure any bedding you get is baby safe. You can save money by foregoing things like extra decorations while still buying from a reputable company.
 Dressers can be pricey, but many stores sell bookshelves for relatively cheap. If a dresser is out of your budget, get a bookshelf instead. Fold and stack your baby's clothing in this shelf.If you want a little more organization, invest in baskets and storage bins. You can use these to separate your baby's toys and clothes.
 You can save money by thinking ahead. Do not buy items exclusively for a baby's room. Look for items that will age along with the child. For example, a dresser with cutesy cartoon animals may not fit in a nine-year-old's room. However, a brightly colored dresser with something like stripes or polkadots will still be acceptable as your baby gets older.

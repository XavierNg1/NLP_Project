 Finding the perfect snow isn't necessary for this method. Use any snow that even slightly packs together. Keep in mind that you will be aiming for quantity over quality.


Pick up one handful of snow and toss it to your other hand.
Move as quickly as you can.
Use this method for speedy snowballs, not for accurate or powerful snowballs.
 Use both hands to quickly squeeze the snow into a rough snowball. Press the snow together firmly between your hands just one time. Spending too much time shaping or packing these snowballs isn't necessary.


Try packing the snow one handed by simply squeezing the snow in that hand.
Don't worry about the shape of the snowball.
 Utilize this method to quickly make many snowballs. Store them in a stockpile for easy use in a fight. Making more of these snowballs is easy, so don't worry too much over how many you may or may not have.


Make as many as you can in between battles.
Stack them loosely, donâ€™t worry about organization.
Throw them as you make them if you are in a pinch

, Using these quickly made snowballs will prove difficult in terms of accuracy and power. Having a great number of them makes up for this shortcoming. Take aim and quickly throw your stockpile at your target. Make it your goal to have as many snowballs as you can quickly flying towards your target.


Try throwing a few at a time with one hand.
Use both hands to pick up and throw your snowballs.
Throwing a large number makes up for poor accuracy.

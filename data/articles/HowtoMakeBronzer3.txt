 Use a funnel to help guide the oil into the bottle, if necessary. Make sure that you get coconut oil that is already in a liquid state. This is very important. Plain coconut oil is solid at room temperature. If you can't find liquid coconut oil, try another fast or medium-absorbing oil:Fast absorbing oils include: apricot kernel, canola, grapeseed, hazelnut, and safflower.Medium-absorbing oils include: argan, jojoba, olive, sunflower, and sweet almond., Not all oils smell great. If you'd like something that smells nicer, you'll need to add some essential oil. Start with 20 drops of your favorite essential oil. Close the bottle, shake it to mix, and add more dropped if needed. Popular choices include: bergamot, lavender, and sandalwood., Use a fork or mini whisk to get all of the clumps out. This is so that you can see what color it will be before you add it into the oil. How much you use of each powder depends on how dark you want your oil bronzer to be.


Use more cocoa powder if you want a darker color.
Use more nutmeg for a sunkissed look.
Use more cinnamon for additional glow.
If you want something shimmery, use 4 teaspoons of bronze or copper cosmetic-grade mica powder instead of the cocoa, nutmeg, and cinnamon., Use a funnel to help guide the mixture into the bottle.
 Keep shaking until the oil is a uniform color.
 Spread the oil over your arms and legs to give them that healthy, sun-kissed look. Remember that this is not a sunscreen, and that it will not protect you from getting sunburned.

 For some breaks, your vet may put a cast on your dog. The cast helps keep the dog’s leg at a certain angle and reduces movement. A cast can only be placed on certain locations on the body due to the way it fits on the dog. For a simple crack in the bone or a non-displaced fracture, then a cast may be sufficient.Puppies heal much more quickly than older dogs, so they may also get a cast.
 For more complex fractures or breaks, your dog may require surgery. Breaks in adult or older dogs often are repaired through open surgery. During surgery, the dog is given an anesthetic. The surgeon opens the tissues overlying the bone to gain access to the fracture.


One method used in surgery is to stabilize the bones using a metal pin which is passed up through core of the bone to realign the fractures. Alternatively, the vet may use special metal plates which are screwed either side of the fracture to hold everything in place.For exceptionally complex fractures where the bone is broken in several pieces, an internal-external fixator is used. This is where pins are placed at right angles to the bone and the pins supported on an external scaffolding system.
 Regardless of the treatment method, it is essential your dog is rested for the duration of the healing time. The recovery time for your dog will vary depending on the age and severity of the break. The recovery time can range from five weeks for a growing puppy to 12 weeks for a typical adult dog.Complications, such as movement of the implant or infection, can considerably delay healing and may raise the need for revisional surgery.
Make sure to limit your dog’s activities, give your dog any prescribed medications, and follow your vet’s post-op directions exactly to ensure a speedy recovery for your dog.

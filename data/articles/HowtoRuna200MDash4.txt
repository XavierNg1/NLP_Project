 If you’re in a gym class or on the track team, your coach will make sure you’re conditioning yourself properly. However, if you’re working on your speed and endurance on your own, you’ll have to design your own drills to get yourself into the best shape. There are plenty of resources available through an internet search, but some basic drills include:Warm up with 2 to 5 minutes of light jogging and a core exercise like crunches, run six to eight 200 meter dashes at 75% effort, cool down with a 2 to 5 minute light jog and leg stretches.Good stretches include sitting with your legs in front of you while reaching for your toes, and holding the soles of your feet together with your knees bent in a butterfly stretch.Sprint drills: warm up with 10 minutes of jogging, then alternate 100 meters each of sprint, walk, jog. Rest for 3 minutes, then repeat this 100 meter sprint-walk-jog., A 200 meter sprint is a speed endurance challenge, so you’ve got to build your aerobic endurance level if you’re going to succeed. If you’re running a 200 meter, practice by running 300 and 400 meter distances. Running longer distances will make shorter distances that much easier.
 When you’re training, work on keeping your eyes on the track and finish line. Research shows that if you look around elsewhere for just a second, you slow down. Make your focus and concentration priorities during practice.

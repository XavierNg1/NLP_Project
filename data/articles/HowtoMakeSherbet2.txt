 Add the zest from 2 limes, ½ cup (118 ml) of lime juice, 2 cups (473 ml) of half and half, and ½ cup (100 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Stir the mixture together until all of the ingredients are blended and the sugar has dissolved.Chill the bowl that you plan to use to mix the ingredients in the refrigerator for about half an hour.
Make sure that the half and half is extremely cold before mixing it with the other ingredients.
If you want your lime sherbet to be green, you can add a few drops of green food coloring to the mixture to tint it.
 Once it is fully mixed, pour the sherbet mixture into your ice cream maker. Process the sherbet according to the manufacturer’s instructions until it reaches the consistency of soft serve ice cream.If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can transfer the mixture into a freezer-safe container and freeze it for approximately 6 to 8 hours. Stir the mixture every hour to until you achieve the soft serve texture.
 After you’ve finished processing the sherbet in your ice maker, transfer it to a freezer-safe container. Cover it well with plastic wrap, and chill it in the freezer until you’re ready to serve it.Any type of metal baking pan or loaf pan works well for storing the lime sherbet in the freezer.

 Expat Shield is a free program for Windows that allows users to create an IP address in the UK so that you can access any online program being shown in that country. Because it gives you a UK IP address, you'll be able to access sites as if you were in Britain.


However, you won't be able to access country-specific sites from elsewhere.
If you want to watch BBC iPlayer, you'll have to pay a small amount for Elite Access.

 Go to iTunes and right click on the song and select get info ( or for Mac Users press Apple + I), Type in the correct artist name and other info. If you're editing multiple songs by the same artist, click the first song, then hold down CTRL (or Apple) and click the others by that artist, Right-click one of them and select get info (or press Apple + I), just as you usually would. iTunes will ask for confirmation to edit multiple songs' info; click continue.;
, Find out their names.
 Put the main artist in the artist section and after the song list the second artist's name as a featuring credit.


Originally in iTunes: Name: Song, Artist: John Doe & Jane Doe
In this way: Name: Song (feat. Jane Doe), Artist: John Doe

, Add album artwork to the album if you wish.
 This way you will not have two pointless albums; one for an original song and one from a "Greatest Hits" album.
 You can even subdivide further and put "Movie Soundtrack", "Broadway Cast Recordings", "TV Show Soundtrack", etc. Don't worry about most other genre classifications however (Rock, Pop, Indie). It takes even longer to edit those and it's not really worth it.
 Go through and find duplicate songs. Also, you can click File at the very top and select "Show Duplicates".
 Enjoy your new found simplicity and organization.

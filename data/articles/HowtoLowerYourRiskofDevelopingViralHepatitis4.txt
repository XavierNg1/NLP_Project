 There are five strains of hepatitis, and while they all share some basic similarities there are also some key differences in precisely how each strain spreads from one person to another.


Hepatitis A is transmitted through the ingestion of fecal matter from an infected person, which means that it very often travels through contaminated food and drink. #*Hepatitis A is rarely fatal, and generally does not cause lasting liver damage.
Hepatitis B is contracted by coming into contact with blood, semen, and other bodily fluids from an infected person. Birth, sexual contact, and sharing needles are all common modes of transmission. Hepatitis B can lead to chronic liver diseases, and can sometimes be fatal.
Hepatitis C is spread when a person comes into contact with the blood of an infected person, typically through sharing needles, a bad blood transfusion, and sometimes birth. Hepatitis C can sometimes lead to chronic liver diseases.
Hepatitis D is transmitted through infected blood and blood products. Hepatitis D requires the presence of DNA from Hepatitis B in order to spread, so those who already have Hepatitis B are the only ones at risk for developing Hepatitis D.
Hepatitis E is transmitted through infected fecal matter, and is most common in regions with poor overall sanitation, where the virus is very often waterborne.
 In some cases, people with hepatitis donâ€™t even know they have it because they experience no symptoms. For those that do experience symptoms, however, here are some of the most common ones:


Fever
Jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin
Fatigue and general bodily weakness
Stomachache
Diarrhea
Loss of appetite
Nausea

, By learning how the hepatitis virus is transmitted and taking steps to prevent its appearance and spread, the likelihood of hepatitis infection occurring in your community is reduced.

 Visit the Google Voice website, and enter your Google email and address in the given text fields. Click the blue “Sign in” button to proceed to your Google Voice account.


Note that if you are already logged into any of Google products, like Gmail or YouTube, Google will not ask you to log in again. This is because Google has made it possible for users to use one account across all of their products.
 Click on it to see your already saved contacts. These contacts will be displayed in the middle of the screen.
 You do this by ticking the checkbox beside the contact name. Immediately, a pop-up window will appear having the name of the contact you selected with Call Contact, SMS Contact, and Edit Google Voicemail options.
 This will take you to the screen for choosing the voicemail. Under the “When this contact goes to Voicemail” section, you can choose a pre-recorded voicemail or you can record a new voicemail greeting.
 To choose a pre-recorded voice mail, click the drop-down menu under “When this contact goes to Voicemail” section to see a list of greetings you have recorded. Scroll through the list, and click on your preferred greeting to have it set. Complete the process by clicking on the “Save” button at the bottom of the page.


To record a new greeting, click the “Record new voicemail” button. Google Voice will then call you on the forwarding phone. It will take a few seconds before your phone rings. Pick up the call, and record your voicemail greeting when prompted. Google Voice will then automatically save and set the recording for that contact once the call is terminated.

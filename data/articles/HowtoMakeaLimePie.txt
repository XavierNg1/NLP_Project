 Cut the limes into a half. Squeeze out 2/3 cup of lime juice. Try not to get any pulp into the cup, if you do then try to remove it, because it will taste very bitter in the pie.;
, Add the 2/3 of the Cool Whip into the bowl. With 2/3 the can of condensed milk.
, Add the lime juice into the mixture and mix until you can no longer see the juice.
 Drop two-three drops of green food coloring and mix until color is evenly distributed. The food coloring gives it a better appearance and makes it look like a prettier lime pie.
, Use a rubber spatula for easy scraping.
 Use the cheese grater to lightly grate the peel and sprinkle it on the pie. This step is optional.
 Get out the cover that you saved and place it on top of the pie. Get the aluminum folds and close the pie, securing the cover.
 Place in the freezer for at least 5-6 hours.

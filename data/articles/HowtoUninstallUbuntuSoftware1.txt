 Ubuntu comes installed with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) package manager that lets you remove programs within a visual window. This is useful if you aren’t comfortable with command lines.


Click on System, then select Administration. From the Administration menu, select Synaptic Package Manager.
Some of the more recent versions of Ubuntu do not come with Synaptic preinstalled. To install it, open the terminal and type:sudo apt-get install synaptic

If you are using Unity, open the dashboard and search for “Synaptic”;
, In the left frame, you can sort the listed programs by category. The installed programs (packages) will be listed in the upper frame of Synaptic.


Oftentimes programs are referred to by their abbreviated names. For example, Media Player would be called “mplayer”. If you are unsure of the shortened name of the program you want to remove, search for it online before trying to delete it.
 Select Mark for Removal from the menu. You can do this for as many packages that you wish to uninstall.


You can select Mark for Complete Removal to remove configuration files along with the program files.
 Once you are finished marking all the packages that you want to remove, click the Apply button at the top of the window. The package manager will ask you to confirm the changes. Click Apply again to accept the changes and remove the programs.

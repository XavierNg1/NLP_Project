 This step should be repeated over and over until your manuscript is polished. You may discover that entire portions of your story aren’t working, or that you need to write in a new character. If you’re working with an illustrator, you’ll find that the addition of artwork can change the tone of your story. Go through several passes until you have a manuscript you’re ready to show people.


Learn to let go. While it can be hard to discard work you've spent hours and hours perfecting, only to find it doesn't fit or really work, it's part of being a writer. Knowing what to leave out is an essential part of the art of writing. To gain objectivity, take time away from your work and come back refreshed.
Check spelling and grammar as you go. Every refinement helps to improve the end quality of your book.
 Start by giving your manuscript to family and friends. It isn’t always easy to get a straightforward reaction from loved ones who might want to save your feelings, so consider joining a writing workshop or forming a writer’s group so you’ll be able to get honest feedback on your manuscript.


Remember to show your book to your primary audience: children. Read your manuscript to kids and pay attention to whether they seem to “get it,” which parts make them bored, and so on.
Consider whether your book appeals to parents, teachers and librarians. They are the ones who will be purchasing your book, so it should be interesting to them, too.
Once you’ve got feedback from a variety of sources, edit your manuscript again.

 Use the drawing you’ve created, and lay each strip of wood where it needs to be on the drawing.


To keep pieces secure while you lay them out, stick two sewing pins into the foam board at each joint. Cross them over the wood to secure it.
After you’ve completely laid out one side, remove the pins one joint at a time, and glue the strips of wood together with wood glue.
Use the wood glue sparingly. If you want to, you can dilute it slightly with water. As a rule of thumb, if you can see the glue, you’ve put on too much.
The glue will dry in about half an hour. Just before this point, you should take a damp rag, and wipe off any excess glue.
If you have the time, it’s best to leave this side to dry for an additional day or two. After that, remove it from your foam board template, and repeat the process for the other side of the bridge.
 Before you start to glue, pin your roadway to the foam board.


Put a thin line of glue on each edge of the roadway. Push your sides against the roadway. Use straight pins around the edges of the sides to keep them in place while the bridge dries.
 The lateral bracings of the bridge are the cross sections, often forming “X”s, on top of the trusses.While your bridge is still supported by pins around its sides, glue on your lateral braces.
If you need to, you can use clothespins as tiny clamps.
Again, let your bridge dry for as long as possible.
 Now, your bridge is ready for your class or competition.


If you’re testing it with weights, make sure you do wait a full two days for the glue to cure.

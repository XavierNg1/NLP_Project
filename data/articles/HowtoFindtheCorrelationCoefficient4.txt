 Correlation refers to the statistical relationship between two quantities. The correlation coefficient is a single number that you can calculate for any two sets of data points. The number will always be something between -1 and +1, and it indicates how closely connected the two data sets tend to be.For example, if you were to measure the heights and ages of children up to the age of about 12, you would expect to find a strong positive correlation. As children get older, they tend to get taller.

An example of negative correlation would be data comparing a person’s time spent practicing golf shots and that person’s golf score. As the practice increases, the score should decrease.

Finally, you would expect very little correlation, either positive or negative, between a person’s shoe size, for example, and SAT scores.
 The arithmetic mean, or “average,” of a set of data is calculated by adding all of the values of the data together, then dividing by the number of values in the set. When you find the correlation coefficient for your data, you will need to calculate the mean of each set of data.The mean of a variable is denoted by the variable with a horizontal line above it. This is often referred to as “x-bar” or “y-bar” for the x and y data sets. Alternatively, the mean may be signified by the lower-case Greek letter mu, μ. To indicate the mean of x-data points, for example, you could write μx or μ(x).

As an example, if you have a set of x-data points (1,2,5,6,9,10), then the mean of this data is calculated as follows:


μx=(1+2+5+6+9+10)/6{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=(1+2+5+6+9+10)/6}


μx=33/6{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=33/6}


μx=5.5{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=5.5}




, In statistics, standard deviation measures variation, showing how numbers are spread out in relationship to the mean. A group of numbers with a low standard deviation are fairly tightly collected. A group of numbers with a high standard deviation are widely scattered.Symbolically, standard deviation is expressed with either the lower-case letter s or the lower-case Greek letter sigma, σ. Thus, the standard deviation of the x-data is written as either sx or σx.
 The summation operator is one of the most common operators in mathematics, indicating a sum of values. It is represented by the upper-case Greek letter, sigma, or ∑.As an example, if you have a set of x-data points (1,2,5,6,9,10), then ∑x means:

1+2+5+6+9+10 = 33.

 Take the gem with pincers and breathe on it. Real diamonds disperse moisture at once, so the stone will remain clear. Fakes will have spots of moisture on them and if you breathe on them for some time, it will begin condensing, while real diamond will remain clean.
 As diamonds disperse heat immediately, the real stone will remain cold after heating them by a lighter for 30 seconds. This is a standard check you can and should require to be done in your presence.
 Diamonds are not silicon, they are carbon and their inner structure prevents light from passing through directly â€“ that is why they are so shiny. Place a stone on a paper with a text. If you see only a black spot, this is diamond. In case you see some lines and shapes, this is obviously a fake. Placing a real diamond on a dot on a sheet of paper will result in a black spot visible through it. Fake will show circle instead.

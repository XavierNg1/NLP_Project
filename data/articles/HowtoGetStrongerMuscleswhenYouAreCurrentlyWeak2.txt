 Without a proper diet, your efforts at the gym are useless.
 Use the Internet to determine how many grams of protein you should eat a day (based on weight and physical activity). Great sources of protein include:


nuts and nut butters
quinoa
beans and other legumes
soy milk
cheese
egg whites ( Avoid egg yolks as each yolk contains cholesterol roughly 4 times the daily need)
lean meats, poultry, and fish
tofu and tempeh
protein supplements made from whey, hemp, or pea protein.
Sprouts are a great source of proteins for vegans.

, Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains. Opt for nutritionally dense foods that are low in fat and high in fiber.


Stay away from soda and sugar. Drink alcohol in moderation.
Avoid tea and coffee as much as possible as both tend to dehydrate muscles leading to low muscle volume.

 When you find yourself worrying, immediately get out of your head by getting in touch with a friend. Strike up a conversation about a relatively neutral topic unrelated to your worries. You can give your friend a heads up that you are worrying and need a distraction.


If your friend is reasonably logical and grounded, you might talk through your worries with him or her. He may be able to give you a recommendation on how to fix the problem (if there is a feasible solution), or help you to see how irrational a worry can be.;

”Tomorrow is a brand new day”
”Don’t sweat the small stuff”

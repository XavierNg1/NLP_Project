 Futures are highly leveraged and largely used by institutional suppliers or purchasers to lock in prices for shipments and reduce price-movement risks. Hedging with futures should be employed only by experienced, professional investors willing to accept the risks involved.
 If you are long a stock and you want to reduce downside risk, you will want to short contracts. If you are short a stock, and you want to reduce upside risk, you should buy contracts.
 As with options, you will want to watch for the strike price, premium and time frame you prefer. The difference with futures contracts is that you are obligated to fulfill the contract at the time of expiry. Look for the appropriate strike price in the appropriate time frame.


Suppose you are a supplier wanting to sell a shipment of silver for at least $14.00 an ounce in July. The price of silver is $14.00 now (March), but you cannot sell now because your shipment is not in yet, but you fear a price drop. This is when you would write a July Silver contract for $14.00.
In July if the price is $12.00, you will have locked in your sale at $14.00 and saved yourself $2.00 on each ounce. However, if the price rises to $16.00, you will still have to fulfill your contract, and sell your silver at $14.00, losing $2.00 an ounce. Thus, with futures you lock in a return at a certain price at a certain time.

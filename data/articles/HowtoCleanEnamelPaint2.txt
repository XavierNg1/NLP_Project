 Before you get started, apply a small amount of the cleaner on an inconspicuous spot on the wall. Rub it in, and then wipe it off. Carefully inspect the area to ensure the color of the paint isn't negatively affected.


Even if it seems to be fine, only use abrasive cleaners when absolutely necessary., Mix equal parts of baking soda and water to create a thick paste. Use your fingers or a utensil to apply the paste directly onto the stained area. Gently scrub the area with a non-abrasive sponge. Rinse with clean water and dry thoroughly., Magic Erasers can be useful for removing tough stains left behind by small children. Wet the sponge, then wring it out. Scrub at the stain until it disappears. Use the less abrasive side of the sponge so that you don’t scratch up the wall., If dish soap, baking soda, vinegar and Magic Erasers all failed to remove the stain, create a stronger cleaning solution. Mix a gallon of water with 1 cup (120 mL) of ammonia, ½ cup (60 mL) of vinegar, and ¼ cup (30 g) of baking soda. Use a gentle sponge to rub the solution into the stain with a circular motion.Rinse the solution away with a sponge dipped in clean water. Dry the area thoroughly.

 Tap the "Shop" icon in the middle of the screen to open the PokéShop. Here, you'll be able to purchase items that can't be found in regular gameplay (as well as obtaining larger quantities of items that can be found in gameplay).
 PokéCoins are the virtual currency that you will exchange for various goods in the Pokéstore. You can find them about halfway down the PokéShop's menu. Since you are spending real money to acquire PokéCoins at the PokéShop, it's useful to know how much they'll cost you. In the United States, the prices for different increments of PokéCoins are as follows:


100 Pokécoins - $0.99
550 Pokécoins - $4.99
1200 Pokécoins - $9.99
2500 Pokécoins - $19.99
5200 Pokécoins - $39.99
14500 Pokécoins - $99.99

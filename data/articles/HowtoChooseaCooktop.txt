 Find out whether your kitchen uses gas or electric power. This will determine whether you can buy a gas or electric cooktop, unless you want to pay to change the power source.


Consider gas cooktops. They allow you to control the heat easily, with a range of 500 to 15,000 British thermal units (BTUs).
Research electric cooktops. Electric cooktops heat up faster than gas cooktops. However, they respond slower to heat changes. They range from 10,000 to 12,000 BTUs.;
, A cooktop with coils is the more traditional type, but smooth cooktops are becoming more popular because they are easy to clean and have a sleek appearance.
 If you tend to cook often, or make a lot of food at once, consider a cooktop with 6 burners. Otherwise, choose a cooktop with 4 burners.
 Cooktops offer burners in a variety of sizes to fit most pots and pans, with burners ranging from 7 inches (17.8 cm) to 12 inches (30.5 cm). If you use larger cookware, get an appliance with large burners.
 Sealed burners allow pans to stay near the flame so that they get hot while using minimal heat. Open burners heat up fast, but require more energy to cook with because pans are farther away from the blaze.
 Some cooktops offer a bridge that connects 2 burners so that larger pans can be placed on top and heated through. Other cooktops feature lights that show you when the surface is hot, or small burners ideal for heating up sauces.
 Most cooktops are either 30 inches (76.2 cm) or 36 inches (91.4 cm) wide.
 Some cooktops allow you to lift the surface to catch crumbs, while others feature removable grates to dispose of crumbs.
 Common colors include black, white and stainless steel, but other colors may be available, too.

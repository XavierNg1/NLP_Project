 Cards do get lost and stolen, so review a company's policy regarding procedure in case this happens. If a company does not provide transparent policies regarding losing your card, do not work with that company. This could lead to financial troubles down the road., You don't always need to be using your prepaid card. Some companies charge what is called an "inactivity fee," which essentially means you pay money for not spending money. This can slowly diminish the funds in your prepaid card over time, so avoid cards with inactivity fees.Companies who charge inactivity fees also frequently charge deactivation fees. You should be able to deactivate your card at any time without penalty, so watch out for deactivation fees as well.
 Check terms and conditions regarding overdrawing your account. If a card has a lot of unexpected fees, it's easier to overdraw your account. Make sure there is overdraft protection and that you're not charged large fees for even small overdrafts.

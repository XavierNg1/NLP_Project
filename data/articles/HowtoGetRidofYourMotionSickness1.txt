 You should discuss your options, even over-the-counter and home remedies, with your doctor before treatment. This is especially true if you have medical problems, allergies, are pregnant, or are treating a child.Remember that most of the available options will make you drowsy, and they should be taken about 30 minutes prior to your trip.


Gravol or Dramamine (Dimenhydrinate), from the anti-histamine family, is an excellent option.It is available over-the-counter and helps to reduce motion sickness. Other antihistamines including diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can also be helpful, especially for children.
Zofran (Ondansetron) is a prescription anti-nausea medication that your physician may offer you if Gravol or Dramamine alone is insufficient.Other anti-nausea medications may also be recommended.;
, Ginger is a natural remedy for nausea.Drinking ginger tea, taking ginger pills (available over-the-counter), and even chewing raw ginger sometimes helps cure a person's nausea.


Sipping ginger-ale, or eating foods with ginger (such as ginger cookies, as long as they contain natural ginger and not just artificial flavoring) can also be of help.
 These are available over-the-counter and are called the Scopolamine Transdermal Patch.They are small patches that are placed behind the ear and release the anti-nausea medication slowly. They can last up to 3 days.


Place the patch behind your ear approximately 4 hours before you need it to kick in. Because it is more slow-release than medications in pill form, it is important to apply it well in advance.

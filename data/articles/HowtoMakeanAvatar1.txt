 A great way to get an idea for your avatar is to examine the community that you are posting in. Many people use an avatar that relates to the community in some way, and helps identify their interests.


For example, if you post in gaming forums, consider using an image of your favorite video game character. If you post on car forums, choose an image of your favorite make and model.;
, Nearly all forums require you to create a unique username, and many people base their avatar off of their username. This helps create a visual connection with your username, as people will quickly be able to tell who's posting.


For example, if you chose the name of your favorite comic book hero, you can use an image of that character as your avatar. If your username is "HorseRider", then you might want to choose an image of a horse.
 Everyone acts differently online than they do in real life. Take your online persona into account when designing your avatar. Your avatar should be a reflection of who you are in that community.


For example, if you've taken the time to cultivate a zany personality, your avatar should probably be off-the-wall and random.

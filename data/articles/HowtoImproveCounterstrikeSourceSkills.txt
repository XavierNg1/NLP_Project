's, and sometimes smoke's in the beginning of each round. You can usually suppress the enemy by throwing a grenade every minute or so. One strategy is to crouch by a wall that connects to a tunnel with and open ceiling. Being so close allows you to hear everything on the other side as if you were right there, so when you hear footsteps close in the tunnel, throw your flash bang and spray down the tunnel. You can also fake flash people with smokes. Helps a lot when you need it. Worth a shot if you only have a smoke left.;
, Call that you're throwing it.
, 2 shots at a time from the AK or the m4a1 will guarantee accuracy.
 The most effective way to shoot without getting killed is to always be moving but pause for a split second to pull the trigger when you have your shot lined up.
 Accurate shots are always more effective... why spray and hope the fifth or seventh bullet recoils up to the head when you can dink them with the first or second bullet? It takes practice to perform but it's worth it.
 Crouching is good if you get behind someone and don't feel like aiming for the head, or for hiding by short boxes or what have you. It takes time to crouch, time to stand back up, and makes you slow if you're in a firefight, and you have to readjust the height of your crosshairs if you want a headshot. Crouching does not change the accuracy of the first few shots fired, it only lessens recoil. If you play properly, recoil will be less of an issue.
 You will get headshots fast if you only have to adjust the side-to-side. It becomes more timing and less aiming when they step out into head-level crosshairs and increases your reaction time by a good clip. Very effective strategy!

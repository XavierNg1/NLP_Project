 If you have funds to invest, it's important to understand why you want to invest in gold in the first place. Make sure it's the right thing for you. Understand that gold mainly serves as a repository of value and as an investment hedge. Common reasons for investing in gold include:


Gold is always in high demand. It is a tangible product that can always be passed on without concerns for its desirability. Contrast this with antiques and collectibles, which are subject to fluctuations in fashion and style trends.
Owning gold can protect you from inflation or currency fluctuations. Countries often invest in gold when economic growth starts to decline. The more debt-laden an economy, the more it may have to pay for gold.
Gold can be another "string to your bow" when you seek to diversify your investment portfolio. Diversification is another reason to own gold. This is a cornerstone of sound financial management.
Gold is an excellent vehicle for protecting wealth over a long period of time (provided you store it securely).
During a period of civil instability, gold is a way to protect assets. It is portable, easy to hide, and can give you something to hang on to when everything else is crumbling.

 Sweet persimmons are typically tomato-shaped, and often sold under the name Fuyu in the West. If your persimmon does not match this description, read the ID guide above. You won't enjoy it if you follow these instructions with the wrong type of persimmon.
 Sweet persimmons taste best when firm and crisp. A ripe persimmon is orange or deep orange-red.A yellow persimmon is edible, but not fully ripe. Do not eat an unripe green persimmon, which will always taste astringent.You can eat it overripe as well, with a spoon. This tastes different, but you might like it.
 Rub the persimmon clean under running water. The peel is edible, so wash it thoroughly.
 Using a sharp knife, cut off the leaf-like flower and stem. Slice the persimmon into thin wedges or slices, as you would a tomato.


The skin is edible and usually thin. If you prefer to peel it, briefly immerse the whole fruit in hot water. Remove with tongs, then peel. This is the same process as blanching tomatoes.
 A sweet persimmon should be firm and crisp, with a sweet flavor. If there are seeds, remove and discard them.

 Your hair will need to be damp to use rubber bands to straighten it. You can make your hair damp by spritzing some water on your hair and combing it through. Or, if you have more time, then you can wash your hair and use a towel to dry it off.


Make sure that your hair is just damp. It should not be dripping wet.
 To straighten your hair with rubber bands, you will need a bunch of small rubber hair bands. You will probably need anywhere from 10 to 30 rubber bands depending on the length of your hair.


You can use small rubber hair bands that come in a plastic bag at most drug stores.
If you are worried about pulling out hairs with the rubber bands, then you can also use a bunch of thread wrapped elastic bands or even scrunchies.
 Use a brush or comb to get all of the tangles out of your hair. Then, divide your hair into two low ponytails on the sides of your head. Secure each one loosely with a rubber band a little below your ears.


Remember that the ponytails should not be high, but low and loose.
 Keep securing loose rubber bands around the hair in your ponytails so that there is a rubber band about every inch or so.If your hair is extra curly, then you may want to place one every half inch.


Do not make the rubber bands so tight that they will leave an indentation. Just make them tight enough to secure the hair.
 It will take a while for your hair to dry and become straight from the rubber bands. You can sleep with your hair secured with the rubber bands or just leave them in for a few hours. When you are certain that your hair is dry, then you can take them out.


Start removing rubber bands at the ends of your ponytails and work your way up.

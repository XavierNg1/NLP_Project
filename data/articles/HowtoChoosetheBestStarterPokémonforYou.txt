 Some people believe that they are three difficulties. Grass is hard, Water is easy, and Fire is medium. Don't believe this. It's not the same for all Pokémon games.;
, If you are not sure what to expect, then go for the Water type. It's the best for people that are new to Pokémon games. Grass types are for people that like a challenge, and Fire types are average.
 Just because your friend chose Water doesn't mean you have to pick that one too!

, Everyone has different things they like. If you like the ocean, choose Water. If you like the outdoors, choose Grass. If you like bright sunshine, choose Fire.
 That way you'll at least have an idea as to what the circumstances are.
 It pretty much comes down to this. It is totally your decision. If your friend tells you that's a bad one, you can bet their rival chose it too - and it keeps beating them.

 It's best to use cartridge/watercolour paper so it doesn't wrinkle up as much or let the water run through. Watercolour paper can be found in pretty much any art store or supermarket.;
, You'll want to do this lightly whilst either using a ruler or drawing around something. This is so you know where the paint and water need to stop - a bit like colouring inside the lines.
 Brush it on lightly and thinly - you don't want too much water as it'll spill cover the line and also make the paint harder to control. However, you don't want to make the water layer too thin, as it'll dry too quickly.
 Don't worry if it runs a bit in the water; that's the effect you want to see. Take a darker shade of this colour and add this to the edges of the cloud, as if defining it. Dot the darker shade through the cloud slightly as well to add yet more definition.
 Paint it black up until you reach the cloud and leave a gap between the black and the cloud. Take a navy blue and paint between the cloud and the black, blending the dark tones with the lighter tones.
, Once it's dried, Take a watery paintbrush loaded up with white and hold it above the painting. Still holding it over the painting, tap on the paintbrush so small white dots appear on the painting. Keep doing this until the painting looks like a galaxy filled with stars. For extra effect, you can turn some of the bigger dots into shapes like '+' to it looks like the bigger ones are shining.

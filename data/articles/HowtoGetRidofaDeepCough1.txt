 Keep the air humid by using a vaporizer or by taking hot, steamy shower, especially if the cough is dry. Sit close to the vaporizer or humidifier and breathe in deeply.Humidifiers are especially useful at night, so you can also place the humidifier near your bed. This can help thin secretions, which will make it easier to cough them out.


Take care to breathe in slowly since deep breaths can cause you to start coughing.
You can also try a cool mist humidifier for warmer months. These are also safer for use with children.;
, To keep your mucus thin and moving, you need to stay hydrated. Drink at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of water a day as a minimum.You should actually try to drink more when you have a cough. Warm fluids can help soothe your throat while keeping you hydrated.


Try drinking warm chicken or vegetable broths. If you get tired of drinking water, you can also drink juices or herbal teas.
 Depending on what's causing your cough (like acid reflux disease), you may want to eat small amounts of food more frequently throughout the day.The foods should be easy to digest, yet filling. The goal is to provide a constant supply of energy to your body so your immune system can do its job and heal your cough.


Be sure to include quality protein like fish and skinless poultry as well as complex carbohydrates like whole grains and vegetables.
 Help your body recover from the exhaustion of deep coughing by resting as much as possible. Try to take time off from work or school. You'll give yourself a chance to recover faster and you won't be putting your co-workers or classmates at risk of catching something.


If your child has a deep cough, keep her home from school. She's more likely to get her classmates or teacher sick.

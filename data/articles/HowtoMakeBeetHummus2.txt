 While it preheats, cut off your beet’s stem plus the majority of the root and then clean them under running water. Then drizzle some canola oil over it and wrap it securely in aluminum foil. Set it on a baking tray and roast for about an hour, or until it’s tender enough to easily pierce with a fork or knife., After it’s done roasting, place your beet in the fridge to cool it off. While it chills, drain your can of chickpeas in the sink. Zest your lemon. Mince your garlic. Measure out your other ingredients so everything’s good to go., Once it cools off enough to handle without burning yourself, peel the skins. Chop into quarters, then transfer the quarters to a blender or food processor. Pulse until it’s mostly smooth., Place all ingredients into the blender, except for the olive oil. This includes your chickpeas, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, pepper, garlic, and tahini. Pulse until the mixture turns as smooth as possible. Then slowly pour the olive oil in while keeping the blender running until it mixes evenly., Take a taste test. If desired, add more seasonings. If the texture is thicker than you’d like, blend in a small amount of water and test again. Once it’s right, enjoy right away or store in an airtight container in the fridge. Use within the next seven days.

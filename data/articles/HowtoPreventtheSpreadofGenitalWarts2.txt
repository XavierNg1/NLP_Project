 Though it may seem like a mood-killer, it's important to talk about your and your partner's sexual history before you have sex. If your partner has had unprotected sex, that puts you at a higher risk of contracting the HPV virus from him or her.It is important if you have had an infection in the past that you tell your sexual partner(s).
 If you only have one sexual partner whom you know is virus-free and only having sex with you, you cannot get the virus. If that's not an option for you, try reducing the number of sexual partners you have, as the more sexual partners you have, the more your risk of infection increases., If you're unsure of your sexual partner's history, try using sex toys instead, which can limit skin to skin contact. However, make sure to clean sex toys in soap and water, though make sure your toy is built for it first. However, the safest way to use sex toys is to put a condom on the toy., If one of your sexual partners has unprotected sex with other people, you should stop having sex with that person. Doing so will lower your risk of contracting the disease.If you suspect a partner may be having unprotected sex with others, do not hesitate to cease having sex with him or her. It is better to lose a sexual partner than to risk your health.

 In fact, the only animals you can buy with coins are sheep and pigs. These animals are not particularly space efficient, nor do they bring in a substantial revenue. There are a few other specialty animals that you can buy with only farm cash â€“ several special varieties of chickens and an orange tabby (at the moment). Usually, a few seasonal animals are available for a limited time.

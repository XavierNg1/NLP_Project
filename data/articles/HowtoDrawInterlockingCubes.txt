, this should look like it is part of the first cute you've draw. Do so by drawing a square for its front side. Then, add 2 shapes in form of an “L” on top and to the right of the square.

 Erase also inside lines and pencil marks to clean up your drawing.
 Alternatively, you can use a different set of colors.

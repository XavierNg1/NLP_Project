 It's located at https://www.twitter.com/. If you're logged into Twitter already, doing so will open Twitter's Home page.


If you aren't logged in, click Log in in the top-right corner of the window, enter your username (or email address) and password, and click Log in.
 It's the white field with "Search Twitter" written in it that's near the top-right corner of the Twitter page.
 It should be the name of a person whose profile you wish to follow. As you type, suggestions will appear below the search bar.


If at first you don't see the person for whom you're searching, try variations of their name.
 If the person for whom you're looking has a Twitter account under the name you searched, it should appear here; clicking it will take you to their profile page.
 It's on the right side of the Twitter page, on the same level as the user's "Tweets", "Following, "Followers", and "Likes" tabs. You should now be following your selected Twitter account.


You can always click a person's profile picture or name to navigate to their account, at which point you can click Follow to begin following them.

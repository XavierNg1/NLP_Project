 You don’t need to plant the lotus rhizomes directly into the bottom of the pond, you can also plant them in a container, which you can then put in the pond.


Planting lotus in a container is a good idea in a fish pond, as it helps the contain the lotus' spread.
A half barrel or big planter will also do fine for this.
 It’s important to use a round container so the corners don’t choke up as the lotus spreads into them. Don’t choose containers that have drainage holes: the water will come from the top not the bottom.


Also avoid using regular basket-type mesh planters that are commonly used to contain aquatic plants. The fragile lotus growing points will get snared up in any gap or corner and will be damaged.
Black absorbs heat well and A black plastic, round planter at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) wide and 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep (without drainage holes) is best.for lotus. The color is important, as black helps to absorb heat.
 Plant the lotus rhizomes into your container and place the container into the pond so the top of the soil in the container is 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) below the surface of the water.

 Sometimes specific people cause stress, whether it’s because of the nature of your relationship with them or because of their personality traits. Try to limit the time you spend with negative people, whether they’re friends who always focus on negatives or family members who constantly criticize you.Try to surround yourself with people with optimistic outlooks who support you and your goals. If they offer you advice or criticism, it should be constructive, productive, and meant to help you instead of simply insult or overwhelm you.
This can include spending more time with friends or finding new friends by joining a church or club.
 A regular chat with a trusted friend or family member can go a long way toward stress management and prevention. Find someone you can have a weekly vent session with to help order your thoughts before they become major stressors.Be sure to return the favor by letting them get things off their chest, too.
 Volunteering helps reduce stress and anxiety, and even lowers blood pressure. It can improve self-esteem, and can help prevent and manage depression in addition to relieving stress.Try to find a cause that you find especially meaningful. For example, if you love animals, call your local shelter to find out how can you donate your time. Evidence suggests that the more genuine your interests are, the more health benefits you’ll see.
 Talking to a counselor or going to a support group isn’t only beneficial when you’re actually experiencing stress or anxiety. Seeing a mental health professional can help you develop stress prevention techniques and vent about stressors before they become overwhelming.


A great listener is one of the best stress preventatives, and a mental health professional can be a solution if your friends or family aren’t the best options.

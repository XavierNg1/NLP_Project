 This could be a library, a beach, a park, or a diner. This will remove any extra pressure and nerves that she may have.;
, Compliment her on something that has caught your eye and never let her know your intentions.
 Many of my friends who are jocks have tried this. For instance, a big win at a school competition might just be a good time to kiss your girlfriend with passion due to school spirit.
 This works best at the end of a fun date such as seeing a movie or going swimming. You look her deep into her eyes, hold both of her hands, tell her that you are about to kiss her, and just do it.
 Let's say that you and your girlfriend are studying together and all of a sudden it gets cold. You move closer to her, allow her to lean into you, make sure that she enjoys you being in her personal space, tilt her chin, and give her a long kiss.
 In winter, you could buy mistletoe and hang it on a tree branch. You could then walk with your girlfriend, tell her to look up, whisper mistletoe, and kiss then hug her. Be creative.
 You cannot go throughout life being fearful of rejection. Girls love confidence, chivalry, and good hygiene. Be sure that the girl at least knows you well enough to determine that you aren't only interested in making out. Nice guys finish first and even if they don't, they get let down easy.
 Make sure that your lips are okay and that your breath is fresh. Dental hygiene is extremely important, and don't let her see you chewing gum right before you make the big move. Keep the kiss short, but not too short. Generally, about 10 seconds is ideal.

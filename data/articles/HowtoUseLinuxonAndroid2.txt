 8 GB or more is optional to fit the image file.
 This is mandatory because you will need four apps for the supports. Download all the apps listed:


The first app is called Android Terminal. This is part one of two for one of the supports.
The second app is called android-vmc-viewer. This is the second part for the first support. This is associated with the Android Terminal.
The third app is called the Complete Linux Installer. This is very important because the tutorial has an image needed for the installation. It's better to use small images since it doesn't take up that much space.
The final app needed is a file manager. Usually, your device comes with Explorer, but if not, you can use an alternative like File Manager (Explorer) by Rhythm Software.

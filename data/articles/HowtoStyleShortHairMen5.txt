 Combine small, equal parts of hair mousse and shine serum in the palm of your hand. Rub the product over your hands, then work it into your hair from end to root.









The shine serum adds pizazz to this look, but you can skip it if you don't have it. You must use a mousse or cream, however, to give your hair more holding power.
 Use a comb to push the hair at the sides of your head back and away from your face.









For the lower half of each side, focus on directing the hair back.
For the upper half of each side, start directing the hair upward and toward the top of your head. If the hair at your sides is long enough to reach the top of your head, you should direct it so that it does.
 Guide the hair on either side of your crown toward the center of your head. Both sides should meet together at this center.









Keep the hair relatively flat, allowing it to somewhat naturally over the crown. Do not direct the hair upward, back, or into a point.
 Allow the hair to air dry. Do not use a blow dryer.


Air drying the hair should allow any natural waves and curls to set in place, which is desirable for this type of style. Using a hair dryer, on the other hand, could cause the hair to dry too straight.
 After the hair dries, use your fingers to make any final adjustments to the style, then spray the entire thing with extra-hold hairspray.

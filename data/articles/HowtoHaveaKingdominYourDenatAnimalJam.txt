 You need to get a den that can hold tons of people at a time and can fit tons of items in it too. A proper idea is a castle, since it gives a royal appeal.

You might not want to have the small house den, the Volcano den (unless a wolf kingdom), the Water Park den, the Ol' Barn den, the Restaurant den, or the Sunken Ship den.
If you're a non-member, you'll have no choice as the Small House or Sunken Ship den as they are your only options. You can ask a member friend if you can use their den.
The Fantasy Castle is a good den to have for a castle; it just might not have a lot of room to raise a village in.
The Volcano den could be super cool if it was a wolf kingdom, but it is small. Instead of the Volcano den, use the Greely's Hideout den.
The Treehouse den is cool if you want a jungle kingdom, and it has some room for a town, although the Sky Kingdom is the best for use kingdom.
The Crystal Palace den is wonderful! It has room for everything a town people homes, and it includes a mine and dock for people to work in.;
, You need rooms in your castle.

You'll for sure need a throne room and a village. The king and queen and their children need rooms, and you want a garden, stable, rooms for the maids, and a ballroom and a dungeon. You can also add a forest, a pond, or more, if desired.
 Use things that makes sense, like fences in the dungeon, thrones in the throne room, In the ballroom, add disco balls and food (so it's like a party). Add cabins for the village, and plants in the garden., Visit Jamaa Township and announce your kingdom. Give out ranks and set out rules and roles for each person. Make sure you buddy everyone in your kingdom., Don't give everything to yourself. That will anger the villagers, and they will leave.

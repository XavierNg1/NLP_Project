 Start the jig by sticking your left foot out in front of you and then stepping on it, while simultaneously bringing your right foot directly behind it into a closed position. Your weight should shift from your front (left) foot to your rear (right) foot.
 At the same time, bring your left toe to meet your right knee.
 Do this while your left toes are held next to your right knee, and swing it as you hop again.
 As you complete this hop, take three more steps backwards beginning with your right foot. You will then be returned to the starting position.

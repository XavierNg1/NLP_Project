 With neon eyeliner, do not just choose your favorite color. As the eyeliner is so bold, it's important it compliments your natural eye color.Green shades work well with hazel eyes, especially olive greens.
Blue shades work well with blue.
Green eyes look great with deep purple. Hazel eyes that have hints of green also look nice with purple.;
, If you selected your outfit first, look to that for a guide. When wearing something very neutral, opt for a brighter shade. Bright neon eyeliner can make your look more dramatic if you're wearing something more played down.For example, say you're outfit is mostly brown or black and you have green eyes. Select the brightest purple neon you have. This will compliment your eyes and add some flare to a neutral look.
 If you're struggling to decide, you can pick more than one color. Your upper lash line can use one color, while you water line uses another. This can help if you have eyes that would match for more than one shade. For example, for hazel eyes with flecks of green, you can use a combination of green and purple., If you're doing a smokey eye for your main makeup and it looks dull, grab some neon eyeliner. With smokier makeup, brighter colors can help really outline your eyes and make them pop. Go for something like white neons if you're doing a smokey eye., If you want to use neons, but do not want something dramatic, go for darker colors. Rather than choosing a bright fluorescent yellow, for example, choose a yellow that falls more on the mustard yellow side. This can allow you to have a little fun with neon colors without creating an overwhelming effect.

 The spoon should be held upside down, with the handle resting against the rim and the mouth-piece touching the opposite inner side of the glass. If desired, special “black and tan” spoons are available for purchase and designed specifically for this drink.
 You want the Guinness to settle gently over the top of the “tan,” so take your time to get the perfect pour. This will also allow for the best head to form., For a unique twist on a classic black and tan, try a “black adder.” To create this, use the same process as explained above, but substitute the light ale with cider.

 Use a dark colored cloth to thoroughly cover the participant’s eyes and prevent cheating. A colored bandanna works well.
 The player is spun in a stationary circle five to ten times. Slight disorientation adds humor and difficulty to the game.


Spin the player an appropriate number of times for his or her age. You may consider not spinning young children.
The objective is minor disorientation, not excessive dizziness., Hand the blindfolded player a tail and allow him or her to attempt sticking or pinning it over the "X" on the donkey's rear end.


Help the blindfolded player to face the image of the donkey before beginning to walk forward.
Consider leading smaller children to the donkey, to avoid potential injury., The remaining players are blindfolded, spun, and allowed to pin a tail, one-by-one.


Leave all of the donkey tails pinned to the location they have been placed, until every player has had a turn.
Use a pen or pencil to write player initials at each tail placement, as they are pinned. Initialing is only necessary if the players’ names or uniquely identifying decorations are not already on their tails., The "winner" is the player whose tail is closest to the marked "X."


Remind young children that the game is about having fun, stumbling around, and being silly. It is not about winning or losing.

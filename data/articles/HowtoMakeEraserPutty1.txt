 All you'll need is a small disposable glass jar and a tube of clear silicone craft glue. This type of glue stays relatively flexible, no matter how dry it gets. Other types of glue will not work for this method., The size of your final eraser will be roughly determined by how much glue you add. Keep in mind that your glue will shrink slightly before it's ready. Be sure to add enough glue to make an eraser big enough to be usable.
 Leave the glue to set. This should take about 24 hours. Once it has congealed, it should look similar to dried wax. To double-check, touch the glue first. If it's still sticky, wait a while longer., Once it's no longer sticky, simply pick the now semi-solid glue up with your fingers. Roll and knead the glob around in your hands for a while. It should now be ready for use.
 Keep it in a plastic zipper bag or some other small airtight container. This will ensure that your eraser maintains its putty-like consistency over time.However, if you choose not to store your eraser this way, it should continue to be somewhat flexible and erase well even when completely dried out.

 This type of endorsement restricts the way the check can be used, specifying that only the person listed on the face of the check can cash or deposit it.By using this restrictive endorsement, you ensure that if you lose the check or need to have someone else deposit it for you, no one but you will be able to use the funds.


This type of endorsement is most effective if you are mailing your check for deposit, or are giving it to someone else to deposit on your behalf.
 Make sure that you conserve enough space to write the rest of the information you need. This signals that you wish to exercise your rights to the check writer's promise to pay. Your signature is required no matter what type of endorsement you exercise.


Note that if the signature is above "For Deposit Only," the check technically becomes a bearer instrument and could be modified by someone else.
 On the next line down, you can write your bankâ€™s name and your bank account number. This will ensure that the check can only be deposited at the bank you specify, and to the account you have chosen. Make sure you write the number of the account you want the check deposited into.


This is a restrictive endorsement because it specifies the account that you wish the check to be deposited to. This kind of endorsement is useful when you have someone else deposit your check, such as an employee. Anyone who has access to your check will only be able to deposit the check into your account.
While it may be a good idea to protect your check with a restrictive endorsement in some cases, you should also protect your bank account information. Your bank account number is important, and you should protect a check that you have endorsed with your account number to avoid identity theft or fraud. Place the check in a sealed security envelope and only allow people you trust to make deposits for you.

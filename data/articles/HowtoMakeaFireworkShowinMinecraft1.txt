 The items are:


1 dispenser
4 detector rails
8 powered rails
4 normal rails (for corners)
redstone
1 minecart
7 redstone torches
1 lever
Fireworks to fill up dispenser.;
, Put redstone on all four sides of the dispenser. Attach detector rails to the redstone that's attached to the dispenser. Place powered rails on both sides of all the detector rails. Connect the sides with normal rails. You should now have a square with a dispenser in the middle, redstone connecting the dispenser to the detector rails, and powered rails on each side of the detector rails.
 On the powered rail without a redstone torch, place down redstone connecting to it, leading away from the square. Place a lever that connects this redstone to the unpowered rail. Place a minecart on the unpowered rail and pull the lever.


If necessary, push the minecart to begin, or put an unpowered rail on a slope and put minecart on top of it, so when it is powered, it's already going one way.

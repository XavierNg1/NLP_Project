 Take a moment to do a quick posture check before you walk out in front of your audience. If you are slouching, you may seem like you lack confidence. Stand up as straight and tall as you can to ensure a confident posture. Keep standing tall as you walk out in front of your audience and begin your presentation., A well-organized podium will help you avoid any unnecessary fumbling as you speak. Before you start your presentation, you should take a moment to lay out your notes and any other materials that you will need. Before you begin your presentation, distribute any handouts that your audience will need., Making eye contact with your audience during a presentation makes you appear more authoritative and confident. Before you even begin your presentation, you should make eye contact with someone near the back of the room and hold it for a few seconds as you give your introduction. Then, continue to make eye contact with audience members as you present your material., One of the most boring ways to start a presentation is to tell the audience your name. If you want to make sure that they know your name, put it on the first slide of your visual aid or at the top of a handout that you distribute. Just don’t waste your precious opening by saying, “Good morning. My name is…”, It might seem normal to start your presentation with an icebreaker or with some information that does not have anything to do with your presentation. But starting this way will waste time and cause your audience to lose interest. To get your audience engaged, you need to give them what they came for right away. Start your presentation immediately to make sure that you don’t lose your audience’s attention.

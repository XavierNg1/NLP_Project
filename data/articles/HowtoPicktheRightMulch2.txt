 Instead of purchasing mulch by the bag, you should purchase it bulk. Pick up some mulch in bulk from your local garden center or get them to deliver it for you. If you purchase mulch by the bag, it will cost you more money. Of course, small bags of mulch are a little easier to transport. However, you will end up paying a little more for this convenience.For instance, you could save $15 dollars by purchasing a yard of hardwood mulch instead of the equivalent in bags.
 Instead of paying someone for delivery services, you should pick it up yourself. If you or a friend has a pickup truck or a trailer, go and pick up the mulch from a garden center., A nice hardwood mulch will cost you about three times the price of mulch from shredded logs. To save money, choose the cheaper shredded log mulches instead of hardwood, colored or other expensive varieties., Instead of putting your leaves on the curb, you should rake them into your organic vegetable garden. This practice will save you money, since you wonâ€™t have to purchase as much organic mulch in the spring. It will also improve the soil quality in your garden., If you live in a rural area and there are a few fallen trees around, you could gather some twigs and small branches. Chop them up and add them to your garden for a cost-effective option. It will cost you some hard work but is otherwise free.Twigs and branches tend to have more nutrients than bark and wood chips, so they may be better for improving soil quality.

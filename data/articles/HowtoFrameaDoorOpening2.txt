 Nail the top plate through the ceiling into the ceiling joists or blocking using 12D nails.
 Nail the sole plate to the floor, driving the nails into the floor joists or blocking.









Don't nail the sole plate to the floor between the jack stud locations because this portion of the plate will be removed before the door is installed.
Use Tapcon screws (or other appropriate fastener) to insert the sole plate., Use 12D nails to nail the king studs in place. Drive the nails at an angle to make a toe-nailed joint, or you can attach the studs with metal connectors.
 Position the jack studs against the inside of the king studs, and nail them in place.
 Take two 2x4s that are cut to a length that equals the width of the original door opening. Use them to make a header that will sit above the door. Once in position, nail these header pieces together to secure. The header should fit between the king studs and sit snugly atop the jack studs.
 Measure and cut one (or two depending on the width of your door) studs to fit between the header and the top plate. This is a cripple stud. Use a toenail to secure the cripple studs to both the header below them and to the plate above them.
 Saw through the 2x4 sole plate at the inside edges of the jack studs. Remove the cut portion of the plate.

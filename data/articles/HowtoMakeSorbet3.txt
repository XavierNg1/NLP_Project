 The best way to use an ice cream machine is to follow the instructions that came with the model of machine you purchased. If you do not have the instructions, you can likely find time on the manufacturer’s website. However, the description below should fit most ice cream makers.
 Many ice cream makers come with a bowl that should be frozen completely (usually for 24-hours) prior to making ice cream. Sometimes the bowl has liquid between the inner and outer walls of the bowl that freezes to help keep the product cold.Old-fashioned ice cream makers that do not have a frozen bowl may have a stainless steel (or other metal) bowl that sits inside a bucket of ice and rock salt. The salt helps melt the ice, which makes for a colder environment around the outside of the bowl.
 Most ice cream machines have a detachable paddle that stirs the mixture inside. Put the paddle in place per the manufacturer’s instructions.
 Remove the sorbet mixture from your refrigerator (where it has been cooling) and carefully pour it into the ice cream maker bowl.
 The ice cream maker should do most (if not all) of the work for you. Turn it on and it will spin for a set amount of time or until the mixture is frozen.Some models have a timer on them for a pre-determined length of mixing time, while others will automatically shut off once they meet a certain amount of resistance (caused by the frozen mixture).
 Depending on your machine, your sorbet may be very soft when it finishes mixing. If this is the case, you may want to place the sorbet in an air-tight container and put it in your freezer to harden.

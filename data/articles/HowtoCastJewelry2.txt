 The model should be propped up in the flask. It is ready for the jewelry casting process.









Note: In the video, the excess silver parts are other pieces of jewelry going along with the belt buckle. They are not extra sprues or necessary additions.
 Follow the instructions of whatever investment mold you choose to purchase -- it should be a simple set of measurements.









Wear a mask or respirator whenever possible as you work with this powder -- it is not safe to inhale.
Move on once you have the mix the consistency of pancake batter.
 If you do not have a vacuum sealer, you can just let it sit for 10-20 minutes. Air bubbles will create holes, which may allow the metal to seep in and create a pock-marked final piece of jewelry.
 You will completely encase your mold in plaster. Re-vacuum the mixture to get rid of any last, small bubbles before moving on.









Wrap a layer of tap around the top of the flask, so that half the tape sits over the lip and helps contain the plaster from bubbling over.
 Follow the exact instructions and drying time for your plaster mix before moving on. When done, remove the tape and scrape any excess plaster from the top of the mold.
 Note, different plasters may have different temperatures. However, you should not be at anything less than 1100. This will harden the mold and melt the wax away, leaving a hollow chamber in the center of the cast jewelry mold.









This may take up to 12 hours.
If you have an electronic kiln, try to set it to slowly raise the temperature up to 1300. This can help prevent cracking., Make sure that the hot wax can easily leak out of the mold, and that there is nothing obstructing it. If there is nothing in the way, shake the flask gently to make sure all the wax came out. There should be a puddle of wax in the reservoir of the flask or at the bottom of the kiln.









Make sure you wear safety gloves and goggles.

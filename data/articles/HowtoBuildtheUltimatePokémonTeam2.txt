 She can take even Close Combats and live, then cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave or slowly kill them with Toxic. However, it's a bad idea to let her take Focus Punch or Close Combat, so use a good physical defense Pokémon. If you choose Blissey, run Seismic Toss or a special move like Ice Beam or Flamethrower/Toxic/Soft-Boiled/Attract or Minimize.
 They can take Toxic and have 100 percent accuracy on it. Most get some attacking moves, and can usually only be walled by a good Steel Pokémon.
 Vaporeon is also good with Defense, and gains access to Acid Armor. Run Acid Armor/Toxic/Baton Pass/Calm Mind.
,, Suggestion: Mawile. That thing, with the right EV spread, can take Earthquake and Blast Burn, Combined. Although, it does make a better physical sweeper than staller, but it gets Earthquake. Use it with Sucker Punch/Play Rough /Earthquake/Iron Head. Or, to be annoying, give it Sing instead of Sucker Punch. Run a Mawilite if you're in gen 6.
 Use Cute Charm to disable multiple attacks, and then run Surf/Ice Beam/Toxic/Recover to defeat near everything. Give it Leftovers or a sitrus Berry.

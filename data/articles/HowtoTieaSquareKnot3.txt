To make your square knot a little stronger, skip the "pull tight" step in either of the methods above above and instead repeat the over-and-under half knot pattern to create an additional half knot on top of the square knot. You can "stack" as many of these half knots as you'd like to give your knot additional strength.
Note that even "stacking" square knots in this way won't make your knot safe for critical usage. Don't use square knots (even stacked ones) for securing heavy loads or dangerous objects â€” they can (and do) fail.Instead, use a more secure knot like a Carrick bend or a Double Fisherman's knot.,









Another way to make your ordinary square knot a little stronger is to make what's called a surgeon's knot. To do this, after you wrap your right-hand rope over and under the left hand rope the first time, wrap it over and under again to create a second coil.
After this, repeat the rest of the steps exactly as you normally would. You don't have to add an extra coil when you make the second half knot.










If you have long lengths of rope to use up (like, for instance, if your shoe laces are too long), you may want to try making a square knot with loops of rope (also called "bights") rather than single lengths of rope.
To tie this variation, simply start with one loop in each hand and treat each as you would treat individual ropes in the standard square knot instructions. In other words, the right-hand loop becomes the right-hand rope and the left-hand loop becomes the left-hand rope and the instructions are followed identically.

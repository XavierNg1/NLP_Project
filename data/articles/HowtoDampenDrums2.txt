 A few companies offer these small gel pads, which stick to the drum head and offer light dampening. Put it in a spot where you will not hit it when you play.

Slowly run your thumb around the top of the drum in a circle, about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the rim, while striking the center of the drum. Take note of the position of your thumb when the drum muffles best - this is usually a good place to stick the gel.
Move the gel around and listen to the different timbres you create by placing the gel in certain spots. Add another gel pad or two if you want more muffling.
If you find the gel to dampen more than you'd like, most muffling gels can easily be ripped into smaller pieces.
In a scenario where the use of muffling gel is for a temporary function such as recording, be sure to put the gel back in its case, as it will dry out and lose its stickiness.
 Drum rings are usually about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide, made of thin plastic, and rest around the diameter of the drum. Although these rings are available in music stores, you can make your own by cutting a circle from the outer edge of an old drum head with a razor blade., Experiment with different lengths of tape to find the right sound.

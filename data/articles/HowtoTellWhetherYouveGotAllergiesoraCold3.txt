 Symptoms of a cold become noticeable one or two days after you have been in contact with the virus. If your symptoms last for longer than 14 days, they may be caused by allergies, or you may have a bacterial infection., If your temperature is anywhere between 37.2°C to 37.8°C or 99°F to 100°F, then you have a low grade fever. When your body starts fighting off an infection, such as a cold virus, it releases pyrogens, which make your body’s temperature rise.Many microorganisms, including some cold viruses, cannot live through these increased temperatures.
 Infections can cause you to feel both tired and achy. This is because when your body is fighting off an infection, your muscles can become inflamed. This inflammation can be interpreted in your brain as pain, leading to you feeling tired and uncomfortable., When your body is dealing with an infection, your normal eating habits may change. This is particularly true when you have a fever. If your body temperatures get increased, the enzyme in your taste buds stops working, which in turn makes you feel less hungry., When you have a cold, your tear ducts can become blocked and inflamed because of the infection. That means that your tears can build up in your eye, leading to excessively watery eyes.Your tear gland is also known as your lacrimal gland.

 Click the Start menu on the bottom left side of the screen, and from the list of programs and options, select “All Apps.” All the apps on your computer will be listed in alphabetical order.
 Scroll down to the letter “X” and you will see the green Xbox app. Select it by clicking on it.
 Do this by entering your email address and password on the login screen. Right-click the login button to load your account.
 Click the box with 3 lines in it on the top left side of your Xbox app. You will see a list of options that you can click on.
 Your Xbox settings will load on the screen where you can adjust Xbox preferences. On Windows 10, the options for preferences are limited; you can only adjust notification preferences for your Xbox.
 Look under the top section that reads “Notifications.” The first box says “Favorites Online” with a checkbox by it. If you click this check box, your favorite friends will show up on your screen when they sign in.
 Select the checkbox right below that which says “Twitch Broadcast Started” if you want to see when your friends are broadcasting on Twitch. This is great if you do not have the time to monitor your Twitch or friends list.
 Click the third check box that reads “Messages” if you want to get an Xbox One notification when someone sends you a message.

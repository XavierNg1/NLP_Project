 Drifloon appears in front of Valley Windworks every Friday. If you defeated Team Galactic there on a Friday, you'll have to wait until next Friday to find it.


Make sure to come during the day, as Drifloon will not appear in the morning or at night. You'll need to visit Valley Windworks between 10 AM and 8 PM., Setting your clock forward will disable any time-based events for 24 hours, including Drifloon appearing. The best you can do is set the date to Thursday and then wait 24 hours for Drifloon to appear.
 Drifloon will be visible in the overworld, much like a Legendary Pokemon. Talking to it will begin a battle with Drifloon.
 Drifloon is Level 22, so it may take a while to whittle down if you haven't leveled your Pok√©mon up much. Drifloon is weak to Ghost, Rock, Electric, Ice, and Dark attacks, so use these if possible to make the fight go faster., Once Drifloon's health bar is red, you can start throwing Poke Balls to try to catch it. You can use advanced balls to make it easier, but Drifloon shouldn't be difficult to catch with a regular Poke Ball.
 If you accidentally knock Drifloon out, or you miss the time that it appeared, it will show up again next Friday during the day.

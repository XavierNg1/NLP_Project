 It is similar to an automatic, except it has only one gear. The options should be listed in this order: P, R, N, and D. Depending on the vehicle, it may have another option or two.

P is for park. This gear is designed specifically for parking a vehicle.
R is for reverse, used for backing up a vehicle.
N is for neutral. This is used when you do not need to change the speed of the car, or for coasting. Keep in mind: Coasting is illegal in many U.S. states, and should be avoided.

D is for drive, the option used for moving the vehicle forward. Operating a CVT is almost the same as automatic, except that with a CVT, you will never feel the vehicle shift - it is only one gear.
 This allows you to press the button on the lever that allows you to select the gear you want., Many newer cars have cameras that drivers use to check how they have backed up the car., Before you shift to this from reverse, come to a complete stop., Then set your parking brake up.

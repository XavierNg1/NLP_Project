 If you are fortunate enough to have some time before your big move, take the time to create a simple plan before you go and fill boxes.;
, This can be a complicated and frustrating process, and it doesn’t really combine well with packing. So do this first, before anything else. This is the perfect opportunity to take stock of your possessions. Have a garage sale, return the mower, give that extra dinner set to charity. Don't move your trash! It will be cumbersome and cost more to move. You will also find that there will be lots of things that can go straight to recycling or the garbage bin. Be strong!

During your dig, you will discover things that you forgot existed. You'll also find things you can't live without. Separate items into three piles:
“Throw Away Definitely”
“Can't Survive Without"
"Donate"



, Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc.)

, Computers make this job neat - so print out your inventory, and place in your "Moving Folder/Clipboard".
 Remember - your mind will still be coping with all the everyday things like cooking, washing, cleaning, kids and you can't remember EVERYTHING, so write it down, no matter how small the job seems. As you complete them - tick them off, write notes, numbers and follow-ups. Now - place this in your "Moving Folder/Clipboard".
 Keep this list for future reference and moves, it will be longer than you realise. The "Notification of New Address List" - For clarity divide it into 'Business' and 'Personal'.
 Watch the budget for a month if possible, and don't go spending! If you buy more stuff, you're only going to have to move it again. So - put some extra aside and be prepared for unexpected costs. If you plan well they will be minimal.

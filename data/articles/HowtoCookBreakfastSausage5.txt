 To reheat pre-cooked sausages, microwave them on full power for 10 to 15 seconds per portion.


This method can be used for both sausages cooked at home or pre-cooked packaged sausages. It also works with both links and patties.
Arrange the sausages in a single layer over a microwave-safe plate lined with paper towels. Cover them with an additional paper towel to reduce splatter.
Microwave thawed sausages for about 10 seconds per link or patty. For frozen sausages, reheat them for 15 seconds per link or patty. Note that exact cooking times may vary depending on the power output of your microwave.
 Warm the sausages through for 8 to 10 minutes using medium heat.


As with the microwave method, you can use this method for nearly any type of pre-cooked breakfast sausage: links or patties, home-cooked or packaged-cooked, thawed or frozen.
Place the links or patties in single layer in a cool nonstick pan. Cover the pan and set it on the stove over medium heat.
Reheat the sausages for 8 minutes if previously thawed or 10 minutes from frozen. You should not need to turn the sausages while they reheat. When ready, the sausages should be warmed throughout.

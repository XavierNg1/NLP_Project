 If they forbid swearing then do not swear. Learn and know these rules so you can keep out of trouble.;
, Understand the players, if they disagree with what you are doing and it happens to be against the game's rules, you could have a ban on the way.
 If you do, you risk giving the other player grounds to ban you. Instead, report them if they are being really offensive.
 The word n00b is considered offensive by some people (which actually means "newbie," so it would be better to say that instead of noob)

,, You can also get banned for using bots, automated programs that play the game for you. If you do not cheat by using bots, you will not get banned because of them. Most online games have ways to check for or fight back against bots now anyway.
 These are considered offensive in most online communities.
 This seems simple but is often overlooked.
 This is considered spamming and can get you banned. You will get banned even faster if you post links involving sexual content.

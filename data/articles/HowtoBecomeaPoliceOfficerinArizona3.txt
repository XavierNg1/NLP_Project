 Open enrollment is an alternative police academy program offered through several community colleges in Arizona, and is a great way for students to get started in a career in law enforcement. Students can attend the academy either by being sponsored by an Arizona law enforcement agency, or as an open enrollment student.


Most community college police academies meet three days a week for two full semesters.The cost of attending an Arizona open enrollment police academy is the cost of the credit hours at the college, plus materials.
 Prior to attending the academy, students must undergo a background investigation, which determines their eligibility to participate in the open enrollment program. If you are being sponsored by a police agency, they will usually pay for this investigation. If you are attending without sponsorship, you may be responsible for the cost of the background investigation., Attendees must complete the AZ Post mandated basic peace officer course that will last a minimum of 585 hours and pass the AZ POST Comprehensive Final Examination, which consists of 426 questions and generally lasts 5.5 hours., Open enrollment students are required to secure employment with an Arizona law enforcement agency within 9 months of graduating. Attendees of the academy are often hired by a police agency as soon as they graduate, but sometimes law enforcement agencies may require additional training or attendance of another police academy prior to hiring an open enrollment graduate.


Students who do not receive an offer of employment by a police agency in Arizona within 9 months of graduating are required to retake the AZ POST Comprehensive Final Examination as well as the firearms qualification, emergency and pursuit driving and the Peace Officer Physical Aptitude Test (POPAT) to complete the certification process.

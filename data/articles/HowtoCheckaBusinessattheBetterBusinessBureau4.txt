 Though the BBB is a great resource for accessing detailed information about a business, the BBB has come under some criticism for how much weight the public places on the BBB accreditation process. This is because the BBB accreditation process only requires the submission of an application and fee to the BBB, as well as the business's agreement to adhere to abstract standards such as operating with transparency. Consider BBB accreditation as being more like a club membership, as opposed to being a true certification of business excellence. Though BBB accreditation indicates that a business values its’ relationship with the public, this does not mean that the BBB has conducted a substantial, in-depth, on-site review of the company and its operations.
 Unlike the BBB, some companies such as Angie’s List rely on membership fees from consumers and not businesses. As a result, there is less of an incentive for Angie’s List to inflate ratings, or to otherwise act for the benefit of listed businesses. Though all of these companies also rely on business advertisements, using multiple websites to check out a company is a great way to get a clear picture of a business, their practices, and interactions with the public., The BBB provides general information about companies, and sometimes the more specific information gets lost in the bigger picture. Take the time to locate more specialised industry-specific sources that review and provide information about businesses. For example, if you are checking on a computer parts company, consider looking at reviews on PCWorld.com, or other sources related to computers.

If you have an allergy to sports tape, use a hypo-allergenic base tape underneath the strips of sports tape. You would FIRST lay the strips of base tape exactly like the steps listed in the procedure. You would then place strips of sports tape right over the base tape, repeating the procedure.;
, The floor suffices, but if another person is doing the taping, an elevated table is better.










This is not required, but it is less strenuous than holding your knee up.

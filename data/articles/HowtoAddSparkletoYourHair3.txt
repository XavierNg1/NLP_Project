 One way to get your mane sparkling is to dress it up with some iron-in hair charms. These hair accessories come on a sheet and are applied with a flat iron or curling iron. Peel off the hair charms and place them directly on your hair, then run a flat iron over the top of the charms to seal them into your hair. They will wash out easily with shampoo, and do not damage hair.Try placing a row of star-shaped hair charms in a headband-shaped arrangement.
Consider placing a long line of metallic stud-shaped hair charms on a lock of hair near your face.
 A great way to add sparkle to any hairstyle is with a piece of hair jewelry. Hair jewelry comes in all shapes, sizes, and styles. It is also reusable, which means you will be able to get more out of your investment in the long run.

Try a metallic gold, leaf shaped headband with a side bun for a goddess-like look.
Add miniature metallic cuffs to your braid for an elegant, unique hairstyle.
Try adding a sparkling hair clip to a low ponytail to add flair to your easy, everyday style.
Add metallic or jeweled bobby pins to an up-do.
 Hair tattoos are an inexpensive, chic way to add some sparkle to your hair. They work just like a temporary tattoo for your skin. You simply lay the tattoo flat against your strands, dab with a wet cotton ball, and then peel off the paper backside of the tattoo. They wash out easily with shampoo.Add multiple hair tattoos on either side of your part to dress it up.
Try applying hair tattoos continuously from ear to ear for a headband that won’t budge.

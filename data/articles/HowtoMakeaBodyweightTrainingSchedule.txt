 Select days on which you are available for at least 15-20 minutes.


Create a word document or spreadsheet with a table listing the available days on which you will train.
Make sure that each day has space/time for three exercises.;
, Variety is vital when training via body-weight, therefore make sure to include desired exercises you think are appropriate listed below.


The following exercises could be implemented:

Standard press-up using bodyweight,
Incline press up (hands on a chair),
Decline press up (feet on a chair),
Diamond press up (create a diamond shape with both hands whilst performing normal push-ups),
Squats,
Lunges (take turns altering between both legs whilst bending the knee),
Pull- up,
Chin-up,
Bur-pees,
Standard plank (balance whole body using arms and feet on the ground,whilst stomach and back are slightly elevated form the floor),
Side plank,
Dips,
Tricep dips (place hand on the edge of chair with feet stretched out and only use arms to lift yourself up and down)and finally
Inverted rows (pull yourself up whilst holding onto a chair).



It is more effective to do three sets of lower repetitions, for e,g. 3 sets of 6 incline press ups.
 Once you've made your plan, print it out or save it accessibly on your computer and mobile devices. That way, it's on hand so that you can follow it daily. Being consistent will really help you see results!

, Make sure to alternate between exercises in a session instead of completing one fully and then moving onto the next.
 Otherwise, lactic acid is bound to build up and cause burning sensations in your muscles during workouts, which may slow down your overall athletic progression.

 This means that your workplace injury is not expected to heal any further. It may or may not have improved to any significant degree from the original diagnosis.MMI is the point when Worker's Compensation switches from Temporary to Permanent compensation. As long as an injury is understood to be medically improving, insurance will be covering a temporary issue.
Some states do have limits to the length of time an issue can be considered temporary., You will need to have an approved physician provide details on the status of your injury and its prognosis. Once an injury is deemed to be permanent, the doctor will need to calculate how much it impedes the worker's ability to do their job.


Many insurance carriers will have specific lists of doctors approved to diagnose workplace injuries. Make sure you choose a doctor who can file the official report.
You can have another doctor who is not filing the report just to give you diagnostic information if you have a trusted physician.
 In particular, in some states there will be a rating your doctor gives you on the percentage of work you are capable of handling going forth.This rating will be important for the outcome of your disability pay.


If you think your doctor's report is inaccurate, seek a second opinion. With a permanent disability, the compensation is making up for a lost capacity over many years, and can be difficult to foresee

, In different states, the compensation will range. It will always depend on how much the permanent disability prevents you from the previous level of work.


Since a partially injured worker can often still earn some income, the percentage of wages can be considered supplemental. The WC insurance will simply cover the average wage, not future potential.
If a permanent claim is reached then the payment will be a lump sum.

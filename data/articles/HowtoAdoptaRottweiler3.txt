This includes time for walks, play, and visits to the vet., Many landlords do not allow dogs or other pets. Even if they do, they might not allow specific dog breeds, such as Rottweilers. If you rent your home, review your lease or check with your landlord before bringing home a new dog.
 Some insurance companies will not insure homes with Rottweilers and other large dog breeds. Your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance policy could be cancelled if that is the case. Review your policy or check with your insurance company to make sure having a Rottweiler isn’t a problem., Rottweilers need space to run around and play outdoors.

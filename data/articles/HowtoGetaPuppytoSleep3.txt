 While it is advised to limit play time and exercise to the evening, try to avoid playing intense games right before bedtime. About an hour or so before bedtime, begin winding down your puppy. Stop playing any games and initiate a quiet time in the house.Quiet time can consist of quietly lying on the couch while reading a book, watching TV, or listening to soft music on a low volume.
 Teething can also cause your puppy to wake up crying or whining during the night. Remedy a teething puppy by placing chew toys in their bed. This way, if pain causes your puppy to awake during the night, they will be able to comfort themselves with chew toys.


Kongs, hard rubber or nylon toys, and thick rope toys are great for soothing a teething puppy’s mouth., If you have tried different techniques, but your puppy still will not sleep, consider taking them to the veterinarian. By consulting your vet, you can rule out any possible health issues that might be preventing your puppy from getting a good night’s rest.


Additionally, some dog breeds sleep more than others; therefore, knowing the activity levels of your puppy’s breed will help you determine how to get them to sleep better.
Ask your vet, "I have tried various methods to help my puppy sleep at night, however, none of them seem to be working. Could my puppy have a health problem?"
Also ask, "I want to make sure my puppy is getting the necessary amount of physical and mental activity each day. What are the activity levels of their breed, and how can I meet them?"

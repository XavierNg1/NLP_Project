 This will allow the energy to remain concentrated in maintaining top quality foliage. Artemesias are best pruned in early spring for the best bushy results during the growing season. Wait until there is certainty of no more frosts.;
, There will be occasional shoots appearing across the bush and it is best to cut these back lightly to avoid any crowding and to avoid having to cut the bush back severely later to thin it out. About 2.5 - 5cm/1-2 inches cutting back is fine. For older plants, cut back up to half of the bush.
 Always dispose of properly so as not to spread plant diseases.

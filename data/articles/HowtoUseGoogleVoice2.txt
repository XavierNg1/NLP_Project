 To do this, click the "Call" button at the top left of the page. Then, enter "+country code" or "+1country code," depending on where you're calling from. After this, type in the international phone number.Once you've typed in the number, press "Connect." This will call your cell phone. When you answer the phone, the call will be initiated.
 To access the phone system, call your Google number if you're using regular Google Voice, and call your access number from a phone registered to your account if you're using Google Lite. Once you're in the system, press 2. To dial the international number, enter 011, the country code, and then the number.
 Remember that you do have to pay to make international calls through Google Voice, though often at very low rates. Check out the box on the bottom left of your account to see your balance -- it will be written in green. You can also use this box to add credit, check rates, and view your history.

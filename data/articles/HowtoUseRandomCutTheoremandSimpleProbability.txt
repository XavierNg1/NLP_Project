Holding down the Shift Key, do Edit Paste Picture into a new worksheet.
Save the file under an appropriate filename into a logical folder, and make notes from the steps below, below the diagram.;
, Stated another way, if x = y+z, then x^2 = (y+z)^2 = y^2 + 2yz + z^2. In the diagram then, square HF = y^2, square CK = z^2, rectangle AG = yz and rectangle GE = yz as well.
,, where the next random event will be.


There is a .3 * .7 = 21% chance the next event will be in one of the two rectangles, and so a 42% chance it will be in either rectangle (or in 2yz).
There is a .3 *.3 = 9% chance the next event will be in square CK (or in z^2).
There is a .7 * .7 = 49% chance the next event will be in square HF (or in y^2).
(.42 + .09 + .49 = 1.00 = 100% chance there will be a next event (presumably). This is an important assumption and not always the case. Or perhaps it's a presumption. It's in the sump somewhere, speaking etymologically .
 It's still very usable information today. A random cut of a card deck, a random cut in an accident, a random cut in Nature, etc., etc. -- all subject to analysis because of Euclid.

 Be very gently and do not apply too much pressure. Erase very lightly. The goal here is to just slightly bring up the pigment from the page, in order to help the tape pull it up more easily.


This helps prepare the area for the tape. You do not need to try to fully erase the colored pencil with the normal pencil eraser.
 Even if you need to erase a larger area, you are better off using several small pieces of tape.


You can use masking tape or clear tape.
 It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing with tape can cause damage to the paper. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture.


Try to choose a peripheral spot to test the tape. If it does start to tear the paper, you do not want it to ruin the central part of your image.
 Do not rub too hard, it may damage the paper when you peel it off.
 By using a fine pointed stylus, like a pen, to put pressure on the tape you will encourage the colored pencil to stick to the adhesive.Make sure you do not press too hard and rip through the tape.
This works better with masking tape than with clear tape.
 There should be some of the pigment sticking on the tape. Be careful when peeling the tape back from the paper. This is the step that has the greatest chance of ripping or tearing the paper.


Each time you repeat this step, you increase the chance the paper will tear.
 If there is still pigment left that you want to remove, repeat the entire process.


This can help to erase small, remaining amounts of pigment that are left on the page.

 This is extremely important because if you prune at the wrong time of the year, your Hydrangea bush may not flower again:


If your blooms are pink, blue or purple, you have a mophead or lacecap Hydrangea. These flowers bloom on old wood (stems that have been on the plant since the previous summer). Prune this type only in the summer, but before August—before they set their flower buds for next year.
If you Hydrangea flowers are white, they are blooming on new wood (stems that have developed during the current growing season). This type of Hydrangea produces flower buds on the stems in August, September and October—which will result in flowers the following summer. If you prune this type of new wood Hydrangea in the fall, winter or spring, the bloom buds will be removed and you won’t have a flowering shrub the following year.;
, This practice is called “deadheading.” Use sharp pruning shears to clip off the spent flower. If you deadhead before August on old wood Hydrangeas, it doesn’t matter where you cut on the stem because it won’t jeopardize next year’s blooms.
,, Never prune them in the spring and summer or you will destroy the flower buds.

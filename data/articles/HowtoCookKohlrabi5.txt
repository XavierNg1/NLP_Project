 Use a sharp knife to cut the kohlrabi bulbs into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.

For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger.
 Put the kohlrabi, stock, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) butter, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large skillet. Place the skillet on the stove over medium-high heat and cover.

The skillet should be fairly deep and 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter.
If you do not have a lid, you can cover the pan with a circle of parchment paper made to fit inside the mouth of the skillet.
 Stir the kohlrabi occasionally as it cooks, and cook only until the kohlrabi is tender.

The kohlrabi needs to be tender enough to pierce with a fork, but it can still be a little on the crisp side.
 Remove the skillet from the heat and add the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to it. Swirl the butter into the contents of the skillet until it melts.

Make sure that there are no visible swirls of butter left before you serve the kohlrabi. It should be thoroughly incorporated into the contents of the dish.
 The kohlrabi is now ready to enjoy. You should serve it while still warm.

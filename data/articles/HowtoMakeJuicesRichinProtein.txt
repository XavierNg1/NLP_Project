 From the above ingredients lists you can design a foolproof protein-rich juice drink. To design your drink select two ingredients from the Fruit List, and one ingredient from each of the other lists: Juice List, Tart Source List, Sweetener List, Wet Protein List, and Dry Protein List.










For example: If you wanted a banana berry juice drink you might choose a 1/2 banana and 1/2 cup of mixed berries from the Fruit List, a 1/2 cup orange juice from the Juice List, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) lime juice from the Tart Source List, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) honey from the Sweetener List, 1 cup yogurt from the Wet Protein List, and 1 scoop of whey protein from the Dry Protein List.;
, Once you have decided on your recipe, based on preference or availability, it is time to get your fruits ready for the blender. Wash and peel all fruits as needed. Fruits should also be cubed for better blending. Berries can be used whole.
 Add ingredients to blender. Put your fruits, your juice, your tart, your sweetener and your proteins into your blender. Make sure the lid to your blender is secure. Blend on medium speed while pulsating.









If your juice is not mixing well, stop the blender, wait until the blender come to a complete stop and stir the smoothie before resuming blending. If your smoothie is still not blending well because it is too thick, add a splash more juice. A tablespoon or two of extra juice usually does it. Continue blending until smooth.
 Your smoothie is best served immediately. Pour blended smoothie into a glass and enjoy knowing you are getting 44-54 grams of protein.

 If you truly cannot find common ground with the person, try to not be around them whenever possible. Walk away from the negativity and pessimism if you can and focus on the more positive people in the group.If you cannot walk away from, try to make the interactions as brief as possible., Never let the person you hate know that they are getting on your nerves. If they can see they are getting a reaction out of you, they are likely to keep doing whatever it is that upsets you. Instead remind yourself that you will not stoop to their level, and refocus your attention on someone else in the group. Remember that the other person is likely just trying to get you to react, so don't give them the satisfaction!

, If you are nice, fun to be with and hang out with, people, including your friend, will want to be around you.You'll be able to show everyone that spending time with you will be drama free and that you are not interested in the conflict with the other person. Best case scenario your friends could eventually lose interest in spending time with the person you hate, especially if they are always focused on the conflict.
 Make sure if you are in a group that you are not seated or standing directly next to the person you don't get along with.If they sit down next to you, you can choose to make the best of it, or you can excuse yourself to go to the bathroom and when you return choose a new spot. Space will give you a better chance of engaging others in conversation and gives you a bit of perspective.
 While you are in a group or while they are talking use the time to figure out what it is about them that bothers you.Use this to pinpoint what triggers you about them. Remember you cannot change their personality or behavior, but you can change your perceptions and the way you react to it once you figure out what it is.

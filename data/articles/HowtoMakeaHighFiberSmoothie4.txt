 Always add the liquids first. This encourages the smoothie to blend quicker. Measure out your ice cubes and coconut powder and throw them in the bottom of your blender., The fruit should go in next. If you have a weaker blender, peel your banana and break it into segments before adding it to the blender., You should add the powders after the fruit. Measure out the hemp or protein powder and the cocoa powder. Add them to the blender.If you're looking to up your protein intake, it's a good idea to use protein powder over hemp powder.
 Start at a low speed and gradually work your way up. Keep blending until all the ingredients are blended together in a smooth fashion. Time varies depending on the strength of your blender.

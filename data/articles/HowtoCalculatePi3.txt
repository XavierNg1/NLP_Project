 Pi, it turns out, also has a place in an interesting thought experiment called Buffon's Needle Problem, which seeks to determine the likelihood that randomly tossed uniform elongated objects will land either between or crossing a series of parallel lines on the floor. It turns out that if the distance between the lines is the same as the length of the tossed objects, the number of times the objects land across the lines out of a large number of throws can be used to calculate pi. Check out the above WikiHow article link for a fun breakdown of this experiment using thrown food.


Scientists and mathematicians have not figured out a way to calculate pi exactly, since they have not been able to find a material so thin that it will work to find exact calculations.

 If you live in a developing country or are just visiting, be aware of what food and drinks may harbor parasites and germs like E. histolytica. Don’t drink the tap water in areas where amebiasis is prevalent. Instead, drink bottled water that has an unbroken seal., If bottled water isn’t an option, take measures to make your tap water safer to drink. Use one of these methods:Boil your water above 50ºC/122ºF for at least a minute before drinking it, OR,
Filter it through an “absolute 1 micron or less” filter, which you can find at a camping or outdoors supply store, AND,
Dissolve chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or iodine tablets in the filtered water (use them as directed on the label)

, It’s safe to get soda and other beverages from an unopened can or bottle. Do not, however, drink beverages from fountain soda machines or get drinks (or food) from street vendors.Avoid watered down fruit juice., It can be tempting to purchase a bottled water or soda and want ice, but don’t do it. The ice is made from the same potentially-unsanitary water that comes from the tap. Drink straight from the bottle with no ice., Washing fresh fruits and vegetables in contaminated water can contaminate your food. Only eat produce that you can peel, and don’t eat any fresh fruits or vegetables that you did not peel yourself.This ensures that the food didn’t touch unclean water, and that you can remove the outer layer to get to the clean produce within.


You may also want to avoid eating salad, eggs, and ice cream. The components may have been washed or cooked in unsanitary water., Stay away from milk, cheese, and other dairy that may not have been pasteurized. If you’re not sure whether or not it is, try asking someone who lives in the area. If they’re not sure, play it safe and stay away from dairy., Flies can carry the parasites. Protect foods against fly contamination by shielding them with a cover. Store fruits and vegetables in a clean, dry area.

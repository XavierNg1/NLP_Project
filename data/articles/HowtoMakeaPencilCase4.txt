 You'll need scissors, 1/3 of a yard of felt, a leather cord, a utility knife, like an X-Acto knife, a straight-edged ruler, and washable fabric marker or tailor's chalk.
 Cut the felt down to 9" by 33". Arrange your felt on your workspace so it lies with the long side at the top.
 Using your washable fabric pen or tailor's chalk, make 24 dashes across the long side of the fabric.


Begin the marks 1" from the short side and 3" from the long side in the upper left corner of the fabric.
Dashes should be 1/2" long with 1/2" between them.
 Make another identical row of dashes 1/2" above the first. Mirror these 1/2" marks at the bottom of the fabric.


As above, begin the marks 1" from the short side and 3" from the long side (bottom) of the fabric.
Mark another identical row of dashes 1/2" below the existing row of marks.
 Use your utility knife to cut slits where you have made marks.
 Cut a hole 1" from the edge of one of the short sides and approximately 4Â½" from the top.
 Do this by folding the cord in half and passing the folded end through the hole. Tie a knot in the loop to keep the cord from coming out of the hole.
 Because you cut 24 slits, your roll can hold up to 24 pencils.
 Once rolled, use the cord to wrap and secure your pencil case.

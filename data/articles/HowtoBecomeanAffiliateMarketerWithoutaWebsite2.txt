 For example, if you team up with an affiliate that sells fitness equipment, you may want to write an e-book about different workout techniques that involve the fitness equipment.


Choose a topic you are knowledgeable about. You may earn more from your affiliates if readers gain value from the information you are providing.
 For example, if your e-book is about fitness, you can write about the importance of wearing appropriate running shoes during your workout, then embed affiliate links for a specific brand of running shoes that you recommend to your readers.


Include affiliate banners and pictures within your e-book. Banners and pictures that contain affiliate links may aesthetically enhance the presentation of information within your e-book.

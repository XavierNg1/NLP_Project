You need a BBQ with a flat or dished hotplate instead of the slotted grill types. If you don't have such a thing, you can use a large all metal frying pan, wok or skillet. The more non stick the pan, the better, but it should be one safe for using in a BBQ or hot oven above 220C / 428F.
 Turn the slices often to ensure they are crisp and browned evenly.
 The beans should be stir-fried through the potatoes and are tender on a BBQ in typically 2-3 minutes. Spread them evenly across the plate so the steam from the beans won't soften the potatoes and so the beans get contact with the hotplate for best flavour.
 Sprinkle with thyme, salt and pepper and stir again. Close the BBQ lid and let sit for a minute so that any smoke being generated by the BBQ may flavour the beans and potatoes and allow the thyme flavours to penetrate.


Thyme and pepper burns rather easily so its best to add it after the BBQ has been turned off, so the remaining heat will keep the vegetables crispy, but not burn them.
The optional extra olives or capers should be added with the thyme to allow them to warm through and the flavours mingle.



The optional extras (such as Balsamic vinegar or parmesan cheese) may be sprinkled on now.

Once the URL is copied, click the field in the Search by Image tool and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or âŒ˜ Cmd+V (Mac) to paste the URL.
Upload an image - Click the Choose file button and browse for the image on your computer. Once you select an image, it will be uploaded to Google Search, which may take a few moments.
Drag and drop an image - If you have a folder open with the image you want to search for, you can simply drag and drop it into the Search by Image tool to upload it.
 After the image is uploaded the search results will be displayed. Google will attempt to determine the original creator of the image based on search results, and will also display images that are visually similar. This can be very useful for finding additional images for a set. Beneath the similar image results, you'll see a list of pages that have the same image on them.
 If you no longer want to search by that image, you can click the "X" next to the image name in the Google Search bar.

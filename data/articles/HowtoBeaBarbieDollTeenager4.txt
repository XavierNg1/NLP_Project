 For starters, take a shower every morning, not necessarily washing your hair unless it is very oily.
 Use it in the morning and evening and after exercise. Don't be afraid to splurge on the good quality; you'll be thankful.
 Wax or thread your eyebrows every month or so, but if your eyebrows are dark, do it every two weeks. Do not pluck, unless there are stray hairs. If you do pluck, do it every 3 days. If you have an unsteady hand, live on a houseboat, or are just not sure what to do with your eyebrows, visit a salon.
 If you can't afford that, do it yourself! Great colors are blues and greens, reds and pinks, purples, and black. Even yellow or white is trendy! Keep toenails short. Although pink and French manicures are best, any color will do as long as you like it. Fake nails are fake looking and trashy.
 In the evening, use a cleanser, scrub, toner, wrinkle cream and moisturizer or acne cream. If you are 12 and under, don't use a toner. Use eye cream and anti-wrinkle/aging products at a very young age, like 12 or 13. It is good to start young and in the long run, it will prevent wrinkles.
 You can even use Clean and Clear, Biore, or Clearasil. Do olive oil face scrubs but don't go bed with too much oil in your face!

, Have Altoids mints on hand at all times! Go to your dentist appointments regularly.
 If your parents or older siblings smoke and you smell like smoke, cover it up with perfume. Use a sweet scent like vanilla, citrus, lavender, or pumpkin, but any nice scent is good. Continue using the same scent so that people may begin to associate you with it.
, It looks trashy and garish.
 Mascara, if you need it to pick up your eyes, is great, but a pale grey or tan eyeliner is optional.
 Barbie is a fun-loving gal. Hang out with friends, listen to music, go shopping, go on social networking sites and be a good student. Respect your guardians, too. They often know what's best for you. Listen to them.

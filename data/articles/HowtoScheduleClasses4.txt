 If you think you might possibly go to college, take at least one honors class in your strong subject(s). Take as many as you think you can possibly handle.
 People who are still in the school or have recently graduated will know the teachers pretty well. They will also be able to tell you how difficult classes are. Believe it or not, all honors classes are not hard. In fact some of them will be about the same as the regular class, but you'll get a weighted grade for it. An insider's perspective will help you take advantage of those opportunities. Avoid people who graduated more than 2 years ago, however, as curriculums and teachers change fairly quickly. What was hard then might be easy now and vice versa.
 Your options for electives will probably be pretty limited, so take classes that have to be taken before classes you really like. Even if you aren't so excited about taking a class on how to use Microsoft Word, take it anyway if you'll need it later to take a programming elective.
 Dropping classes is often frowned upon by colleges if they find out. Do your research at the beginning of the year so you aren't trying to put in more work than you can handle and if you do find yourself struggling consider getting a tutor rather than dropping the class. Only drop a class as a last resort if you truly cannot cope.

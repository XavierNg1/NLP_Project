 If a teacher saw you looking at an answer key in the middle of an exam, you aren’t going to be able to convince anyone that you weren’t cheating. However, if your teacher simply has a hunch that you cheated, you may be able to successfully deny the allegations. The repercussions of cheating can be intense, such as losing financial aid, getting suspended, getting expelled, and more. Unless you were caught red-handed, you may be able to convince your teacher that you’re innocent.


If you aren’t exactly sure what evidence your teacher has against you, plan on denying. If they didn’t catch you in the moment, they may only have a suspicion.
 If you believe you can get away with it, go for it. The most important thing to do is to act surprised that they’re questioning you in the first place. Imagine if you worked hard and completed an exam or a paper without cheating… wouldn’t you be shocked if you were accused of cheating? Channel that reaction.


If your teacher accuses you of plagiarizing, simply tell them that you used the source in question for research. After reading the information and going directly to your paper to write it, you may have unintentionally phrased things similarly.
If your score was uncharacteristically high on a test, just tell your teacher that you studied intently for it, as opposed to other times.
Each accusation will be different, but unless you have a great excuse, keep it simple. Repeat that you studied hard, you did your best, and you’re upset that you’re being blamed.
 Keep it simple. If you are going to deny cheating, you don’t need to come up with a winding, elaborate lie. Continuously repeat that you did not cheat, you are not a cheater, and you are saddened by the accusation. Do not tell different people different stories, and do not confess to a friend or sibling, no matter how trustworthy you think you are. Maintain one solid story, and don’t budge.

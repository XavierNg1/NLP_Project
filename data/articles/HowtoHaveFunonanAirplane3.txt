 If you’re traveling abroad to a country where people speak a different language, use the flight time to pick up some of the vocabulary. Download an app or language learning program or software before the flight.


Get a free app like Duolingo to make language learning into a fun and easy game., Download digital maps or pick up physical ones for the country or countries you’re traveling to in order to familiarize yourself with locations or plan out a travel route you want to take.


Look over maps for public transportation, like bus routes, subway lines, or train stops. It will really help to get familiar with these in advance, especially in another language, so you don’t get lost!, Read a guidebook or do some research into popular destinations in activities in the country and city you’re visiting. Make a “bucket list” of all the things you’d most like to do before you leave, or simply narrow it down to a top 5 or 10 “must-do” items.


There are a lot of things to do in another country, so try prioritizing your list so that you have a group of things you absolutely must see or do, a group of less-crucial things or “maybes,” and a group of things that you’ll do only if you have the money and time.

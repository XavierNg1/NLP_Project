 Each month, your ovaries release an egg that travels into your fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and conception occurs in the days leading up to ovulation. The egg is fertilized by sperm and attaches itself to your uterine wall. As ovulation occurs about halfway through your menstrual cycle, tracking the natural flow of your periods can help you get an idea of your fertile window.


Mark when your period begins each month. our menstrual cycle begins on the first day of menstrual bleeding. It ends the day before your next period occurs. Menstrual cycles vary, but on average are between 21 and 35 days.In general, ovulation happens around day 14 of your menstrual cycle. You can try having sex more frequently in the week leading up to the 14th day of your menstrual cycle. It's likely that, during this time, your body is preparing to ovulate. Sexual activity during this time can increase the chance of an egg getting fertilized.You can use an online ovulation calculator through many medical websites that will help you figure out your fertile days. Usually, you'll enter the start dates of your last few periods. The calculator will then give you an estimate of your most fertile cycle days for the coming months.If you notice your periods vary in length greatly, or you skip periods some months, talk to your doctor before attempting to get pregnant. Medical conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOC) can affect the menstrual cycle and you may need medical guidance to conceive.;
, Unfortunately, figuring out when you'll ovulate is an inexact science. While the 14th day is a good guess, many factors can affect your hormone levels and, in turn, ovulation. You should also look for changes in your cervix mucus, which is the fluid naturally discharged from your vagina. Just before ovulation, many women notice a change in this fluid.If you gently wipe around your vagina each time you use the bathroom, you can watch for a change in mucus. The vagina produces a variety of mucus all the time, usually clear or white in nature. In addition to tracking your menstrual cycle, start paying attention to your normal vaginal secretions each day.
When ovulation gets close, secretions will be clear and slippery. You may also notice you're producing more secretions than usual. Many women find these fluids look something like raw egg whites. After ovulation has occurred, making conception that month unlikely, discharge will lessen and become cloudier and thicker., Your basal body temperature is the temperature of your body when it's at rest. It can be measured with a special thermometer you can purchase at most drug stores. During ovulation, basal body temperature rises by about 0.2 to 0.5 degrees.


Take your basal body temperature every morning the moment you wake up â€” before getting out of bed or moving around. Keep a note on a notepad on your bedside table or on your smartphone. It can be helpful to write your temperature on a graph, as this can allow you to see a pattern each month. The graph may suddenly spike upward for a few days. These are the days you are probably ovulating.You may eventually see a pattern emerging. You may notice, for example, during the 16th and 17th day of your cycle, your basal temperature rises. The best time to conceive would be the days lead up to this temperature spike. You could increase your chance of pregnancy by aiming to have sex on the 14th and 15th day of your cycle., Certain hormones surge when you are ovulating. You can buy an over-the-counter ovulation kit at a local drugstore. These kits detect hormones in your urine, identifying the most likely time you are ovulating. Some tests may also detect a surge in hormones that occurs just before ovulation. You can purchase an ovulation kit to identify at which points in your cycle you will be most likely to conceive.How you use an ovulation kit varies by brand. In some kits, you pee on a stick, as you would with a pregnancy test. In other kits, you can take a small sample of saliva from the inside of your mouth. After a certain amount of time has passed, you should see a reading that indicates whether or not you're ovulating.
 As stated, figuring out ovulation is inexact. Sometimes, just paying attention to your body can help you identify when you're ovulating. In addition to changes in vaginal fluids, you can watch for some of the following signs that may indicate you're ovulating:Light spotting
Slight cramping
Tenderness in the breasts
Bloating of the abdomen
Increased sex drive
A heightening of certain senses, like taste, sight, and smell

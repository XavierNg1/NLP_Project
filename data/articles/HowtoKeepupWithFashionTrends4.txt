 Using accessories to spruce up a well-fitting base wardrobe is a great way to stay both on trend and on budget.
 Trendier items can be more expensive. Make sure you are budgeting accordingly. Look for bargains on t-shirts and jeans so that you can splurge on the occasional trendy dress or pair of shoes.
 Trends tend to reemerge over time. Consignment shops and thrift stores are great places to find extremely affordable clothing in older styles. This is a way to enliven your wardrobe when an older style comes back into fashion.
 While it is easy to get wrapped up in keeping up with fashion trends, set a monthly monetary limit so you do not spend more than you are able to on clothes.


Remember that fashion trends change so quickly that it is impossible to keep up completely. Buying a few items a month will keep your wardrobe lively without exhausting your wallet.

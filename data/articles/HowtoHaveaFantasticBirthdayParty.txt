 Ask your parent(s) if you can have a party to celebrate your birthday. Ask politely instead of demanding to get one organized! If it's a yes, then get planning!;
, Where will you have the party? Date? Time? Some ideas on where to have your party are your house, local Pizza Hut/McDonalds, etc or you could have a day shopping. If you are having the party after school, have it at something like 6.00pm to 9.00pm. That's 3 whole hours, plus you have time to get ready as soon as you get home. If you are having it at the weekend, that's good too. A date must be confirmed before sending out the invitations.
 Only invite people that are nice and friendly to you, and who won't make you feel miserable on the night. Friends can be temperamental, so invite your best ones. Hand-make the invitations for a look that shows you've made a real effort, or design them on the computer. Include the date, time, where it is and a phone number, just in case, plus any other information that is necessary. Hand them out at school rather then an email as you have a better source of info if you have details written down in front of you.
 Consider the ages of you and your party guests while doing it, too. How about some fun games? Strictly come worst dancing is a fun game in which the pair who do the worst or funniest dance wins. Or musical statues? Pass the parcel? You can also dance and just chat to even it out a bit.
 Make sure you supply a totally yummy tea for your guests. Sandwiches, Sausage rolls, Pizza, Chips, Hot dogs, Dips, Fairy cakes, Drinks and anything else you like is good. Either sit around your dining room table or make a buffet in the living room for people to go to and choose their foods. Make sure there are enough chairs.
 Remember to say thank you for everything (even if you don't like it much!), including the cards!

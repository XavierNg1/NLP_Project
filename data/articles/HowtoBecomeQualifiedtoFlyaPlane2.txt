 This is not just a way for the CFI to generate more income. If used wisely, you will become proficient more quickly than by just flying. For example, if you study your intended flight prior to the flight lesson, you will optimize the time you spend with your CFI by having smarter questions and clearly understanding what you are going to do. Additionally, you should receive a thorough post-flight debrief - even if everything went picture perfect. As you progress in your training these pre and post flight debriefs should get shorter.
 It's relatively simple to pass if you're in good health. No use starting sometime if you have a health condition that will preclude you from flying. www.faa.gov has the info to help you determine if you have any health exclusions.

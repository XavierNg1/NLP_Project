 Do this to see if your cat is underweight, overweight, or at a normal weight. Ideally, a domestic cat weighs 8 to 10 pounds (3.6 to 4.5 kg). However, a cat’s ideal weight depends on its breed and body type. Therefore, you may need to consult your vet to see how your cat's weight compares to the ideal weight for its breed and body type.For example, 10 to 25 pounds (4.5 to 11.3 kg) is the ideal weight for Maine Coon cats, 7 to 12 pounds (3.2 to 5.4 kg) is ideal for Persian cats, and 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) is ideal for Siamese cats.
 Do this if your scale at home cannot register your cat’s weight, or if you are still unsure after assessing its weight visually and manually. Your veterinarian will use a body condition scale to accurately assess your cat’s weight.Make sure to consult your vet before implementing any kind of diet plan.
 Do this to monitor your cat’s health. Rapid weight gain or loss may be a sign of disease or illness. Take your cat to the vet immediately if you notice any sudden changes in weight.

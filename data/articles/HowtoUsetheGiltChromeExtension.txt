 Open the Google Chrome web browser on your computer, and go to the Chrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore.;
, Enter “Gilt” on the search field on the upper left-hand section of the Web Store page, and press the “Enter” key on your keyboard to start searching.
 Scroll down the search results, and look for the “Gilt” app listed under Extensions. Click the “Free” button beside its name to start installing.


A pop-up message will appear at the top of the webpage, asking for confirmation of your action. Click the “Yes, I trust it” button on the pop-up to confirm and install the extension.
Once the installation is complete, a notification message will appear on the top right-hand corner of the Chrome window telling you that the extension has been successfully installed.
 The Gilt extension will only notify you once a sale is about to take place. Wait for a Gilt sale event to happen, and trigger the Chrome extension you installed.
 Once a sale has been broadcast to occur, the Gilt extension will display a pop-up message on the bottom right-hand corner of the computer screen (just above the clock and Notification tray), notifying you of the sale.


Click this notification, and you’ll immediately be directed to the Gilt website.
 Log into your Gilt account (if you haven’t yet), and start shopping. Take advantage of the sale, and buy all the items you’ve been waiting to go on discount!

 If you suffer from sinusitis and upper respiratory issues, try humming to yourself. A study conducted by a Swedish researcher found that humming increases ventilation in the paranasal sinus cavities. The increased flow of oxygen promotes healthy blood circulation in the paranasal sinus cavities, and thus, can decrease sinus and respiratory infections.Find a quiet place. Close your eyes, straighten your neck and spine, and relax your shoulders. Gently touch your lips together and relax your jaw. Take a deep, slow breath in. As you exhale, create an “mmm” sound without opening your lips. Hum for the length of your exhale. Continue the breathing and humming for a minute. Eventually work your way up to 15 minutes.;
, Today, research studies reveal that chanting can stabilize your heart rate, improve circulation, lower your blood pressure, produce endorphins, and aid the process of metabolism.Take a deep breath in. As you exhale, chant the sound “OM” or “Aaa-Uuu-Mmm.” If you chant “AUM,” feel the “Aaa” in your stomach, the “Uuu” in your chest, and the “Mmm” in your head. When you run out of breath, breathe in again and repeat the chant., Toning is slightly different from humming and chanting. While chanting is used as a general therapy for the whole body, you can use toning to direct healing to certain areas of your body. For example, if you have a problem with your stomach, and you know the sound relating to the stomach, you can activate the healing process by chanting the sound and directing the vibration to your stomach area. You can promote healing in certain areas of your body by humming:"Mmm" for the sinuses.
"Nnn" for the ears.
"Eemm" for the eyes.
"Lmm" for the nose.
"Pamm" for the stomach.
"Ma" for the heart.
"Kaa-Gaa-Gha" for the throat.
If you do not know the specific sound for a body part, then hum or chant any of the vowel sounds. Direct its vibration into the area of the body that needs healing.

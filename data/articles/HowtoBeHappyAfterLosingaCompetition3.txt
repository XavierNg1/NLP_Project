 Mental preparedness is a crucial component of competing, especially when you are coming back from a loss. Self-doubt and second-guessing may blur your focus and prevent you from bringing your "A game" to the competition. Committing to a plan or strategy beforehand, particularly one that implements things that you learned from your last competition, will allow you to perform in a decisive and confident manner.In a swimming competition, for example, a swimmer's strategy might involve considering whether to go as fast as possible right after the dive, break out mid-race, or alternate between high and low speed.
 Music is an excellent way to get back into the rhythm of competition after loss. It has been shown that music can improve performance by lowering a competitor's perception of effort, steering their mind away from the perception of fatigue and quelling feelings of anxiety before a competition.Choose a playlist or album that puts you in the right frame of mind and helps you feel good about competing.
 Good luck charms or rituals have been proven to improve performance by boosting competitors' belief in their ability to accomplish a task.Choosing a special keepsake or tradition of your own might be especially useful if your self-assuredness is shaken after a losing a competition. While overemphasis on superstition is not ideal, it might be a positive move to add a fun, confidence-boosting element to your routine while competing, such as:


a fun accessory to wear while competing
a song to play or sing before a competition
a favorite, pre-game meal, or snack
a handshake, hug, or other ritual with friends

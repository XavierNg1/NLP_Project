 In many recipes, heavy cream or whole milk can be replaced with low-fat or skim milk. Be careful when baking to stick to reduced fat dairy rather than fat-free dairy.
 Yogurt is delicious eaten out of the container, but plain yogurt can also be served in soups or used as a marinade for meats. Salmon served with a lemon and dill yogurt sauce, for example, makes a nutrient-packed and elegant meal. Look to food from Middle Eastern and Indian cultures to inspire you to find more ways to use yogurt in your cooking.
 If you purchase a high-quality, flavorful cheese, then you can use less cheese and still add flavor to your cooking. Grate pecorino on top off a pizza and cut down on the mozzarella, or sprinkle a little bit of Gorgonzola on a salad instead of heaps of mild cheddar.

 Click the Internet Connection Type dropdown menu, and then click PPPoE. Enter the username and password provided by your ISP. Click Save Settings.


If you don't have your ISP provided username and password, you will need to contact them for that information. Your router won't work properly without them.
 Click the Wireless tab, and then click Basic Wireless Settings. Under Configuration View, click Manual. In the Wireless Network Name (SSID) field, enter a name for the wireless network. Click Save Settings.
 In the Internet Connection section, click Connect.

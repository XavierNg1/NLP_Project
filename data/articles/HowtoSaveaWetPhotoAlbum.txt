 If possible, gently remove the photographs from mountings or sleeves. If the photograph threatens to tear, stop. Instead, dry the photographs in place keeping the leaves of the album as open as possible.;
, The first thing to do after getting them out of the album is to dry them. The preferred method is to hang them on a line - this allows gravity to work on them best. The water runs down on the page (hang them from a corner, one clip only) toward the point, and keeps the paper from warping as the water's weight allows the top part to dry first, keeping downward pressure on the drying paper.


If you can't hang them, they will dry fine on an absorbent material such as a kitchen or paper towel, although they may be more prone to buckling here and there (harmless).
Do not blot as it could damage the surface.
 Water will not harm most photographs, as exposure to water is actually part of the chemical development process for conventional photographs. If photographs have stuck together: soak the photographs for at least an hour in lukewarm water. Gently peel apart.
 If the album was wet by another liquid: You may be able to clean off the substance by soaking and gently drying the photograph as above. Some liquids, like coffee, tea, grape juice, wine, and the like, may not come off very easily, however.
 Nothing worked? The photographs were damaged? A professional photography restoration may be necessary. You can find these services through professional photographers, antique restoration professionals, and sometimes through colleges and universities.

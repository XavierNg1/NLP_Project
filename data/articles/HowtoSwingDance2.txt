 The following steps are for the lead. The follower will mirror these movements. You can also dance with the followers back against the leadâ€™s front, hands joined, and take the same steps.
 With your weight starting on your right foot, take two small steps to the left.
 Take two small steps to bring you back to the starting point.
 Place your left foot just behind you or to the side, rock your weight back onto it and then forward again, replace your foot at the center position.
 Repeat the two steps to the left, to steps to the right, rockstep rhythm. This is the basic East Coast Swing.
 Since swing is meant to be done with a great deal of space around dancers, you can take traveling steps to move around your section of the dance floor. There is little established pattern, although a star or diamond shape is a good way to start. Move in whatever way feels natural to you.
 You can add basic flourishes to this dance. One way is to push distance between partners as you take your rockstep, returning together as you return to starting position. Another way is to spin your partner, either outward or under your arm, as the first two steps are taken, returning on the second two steps.

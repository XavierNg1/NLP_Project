 You can make a simple snail trap with wooden boards that you buy new or repurpose wooden boards you have lying around for the trap. Look for wooden boards that are at least 12 by 15 inches (31 cm by 38 cm).If you have a lot of snails in your yard, you may go for larger wooden boards to catch more snails.;
, You will need 1-inch runners to raise the board off the ground slightly. This will make it easier for the snails to crawl underneath the board and get “trapped.”Make sure the board is evenly lifted off the ground with the runners. You may need to use one runner on each end or under all four sides of the board.
You can use 1-inch pieces of wood or stable objects that are at least 1-inch in height as runners, such as flat garden pots or pieces of plastic.
 You should position the wooden trap in areas in your yard where you notice there are a lot of snails. Snails often gravitate to wet or damp areas in the yard, such as by a wet garden or a water feature.You may create several traps and place them throughout your yard so you have a higher chance of catching as many snails as you can.

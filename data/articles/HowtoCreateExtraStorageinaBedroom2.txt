 If you don't have a lot of floor space for storage furniture, you can easily install floating shelves on your walls. Decide what you'd like to hang, so you can purchase shelving that makes sense for the items. For example, if you want to store shoes, you can install long strips of shelving that you can hang the shoes from.If you don't have space for a bedside table, consider installing two floating cabinet shelves on top of each other. You can install them in the corner next to your bed, so you have somewhere to put your things. For example, you could use floating bedside storage for a small lamp, a clock, your cell phone, and a pair of glasses.
 Purchase a decorative ladder that you can lean against one of your bedroom walls. Storage ladders usually have wide steps and are only half of a ladder, so they must be put up against a wall. You can store clothing, blankets, books, plants, or accessories on the ladder.


You can find sleek, minimal storage ladders or rustic wooden ladders. Try to find one that matches the look of your bedroom.
Look for decorative ladders at home improvement stores, home goods stores, or online.
 You can easily create storage space on the wall near your headboard. Purchase small shelving cabinets and install them around your headboard. This is a great way to get storage, especially if you don't have room for a nightstand.Consider installing shelving along the perimeter of your room. Install the shelving on the walls about 12 inches (30.5 cm) below the ceiling.
 Measure your windows and purchase shelving that will fit directly below them. If you have small windows, you may be able to fit a large cabinet or dresser below the window. If you have large windows, you may only be able to fit short storage cubes. Try not to block the windows, so your room can still get natural light.


Look for storage benches that you could fit under the window. This will give you somewhere to sit and a place to store things.

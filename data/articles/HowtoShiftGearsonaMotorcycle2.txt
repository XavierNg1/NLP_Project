 All that you need to do to shift gears on a motorcycle with a semi-automatic transmission is throttle the engine and use the gear shift. On a semi-automatic, the clutch is tied in to the gear shift, so using the gear shift activates both controls at once.
 Straddle the bike and make sure it is in neutral before proceeding to shift gears.
 This is a very basic process, as all you have to do is throttle the engine and press down one click on the gear shift. First gear is always found by moving the gear shift down a notch, while the remaining gears can be reached by moving the gear shift upwards.
 To do this, use the same process of shifting into first gear. Throttle the engine and push the gear shift upwards with your toe. Pushing it one click with move it to 2nd gear, giving it another gear will move it to 3rd, and so on.
 To slow down and eventually come to a stop, you can downshift into lower gears by pushing down on the gear shift. Always put your bike in neutral when you are stopped.

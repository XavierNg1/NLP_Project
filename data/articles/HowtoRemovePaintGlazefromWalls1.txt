 Sand over the glazed area of the wall to de-gloss the glaze. The sanding will remove the sheen so that paint has a surface which can "grip" when new paint is reapplied.;
, Wipe down the walls to remove any sanding dust.
, You'll need to repaint because you'll have sanded off some of the underlying layer of paint. Add a coat of paint over the top of the roughed-up glaze.


If you're making a drastic color change (from dark to light), cover the wall first with a coat of primer.

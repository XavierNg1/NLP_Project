 Plugging in an external drive has never been easier or more cost effective. In 1980, a 1 gigabyte hard drive—an unimaginable amount of storage weighing 500 pounds—cost $40,000. Today, you can easily find a 2 terabyte drive (2,048 gigabytes) that sits on your desktop for about $130 USD. In 1980, it would have cost $80 million dollars!;
, Normally, everything should be as simple as plug and go. To be safe, check the owner's manual of your external drive to make sure there is nothing unique about it that requires you to take additional steps to plug it in.


In some cases, you may need to install driver software. If this is the case, there will be an included CD or DVD—or you can generally download the latest versions from the manufacturer's website.
 Your external hard drive may need an AC power source, or it may run fine with USB power. If it requires AC, now's the time to plug it in.
 With your external unit powered down, plug in one end of the USB cable into the drive, and the other end into the USB input on your computer.
 Whether you're using Apple's OS X or Microsoft Windows, your drive should be recognized. Let it go through any power-up sequences or initializations required, and follow any on-screen prompts.
 This can be as simple as drag-and-drop. Click on a folder or directory you want to move, drag it to the external drive, and release the mouse.


At this point, you have a choice: if you are backing up files to a second drive (always a good idea), then continue on to the next folder, and continue copying files over until you have moved everything you plan to back up. If you are moving files to a second drive to free up space, then as soon as you are done copying, verify the copies are good, then delete the originals.
Many drives include some form of backup software that lets you move files automatically. Be aware that the more files you move—or back up—the longer it will take. Doing this process overnight is not a bad idea.

 Cut two 2" x 4" boards to 2 in. (or 4 cm) shorter than the distance between the posts. For example, if you want a gate that spans 36 in. (or 92 cm), cut the boards to 34 in. (or 88 cm).


You can replace the 2" x 4"s with any 1" or 2" thick boards with a width that matches the rest of the fence. The thicker the board, the better, to make the gate sturdy and durable.
 These will be your vertical boards.
 Place the four boards flat on the table to form a rectangle. Hammer them together so that the vertical boards rest inside the horizontal boards. If your gate is very tall, a center brace beam may also be necessary.


For a sturdier gate, add a diagonal brace across the square. Instead of nailing the boards together, drill holes and connect them with carriage bolts.
 Nail boards of your desired width, no more than 1” thick, to the outside of the fence gate, using 2” screws or nails driven into the top and bottom pieces. These can be butted against each other or spaced evening or unevenly, depending on your preferred look.

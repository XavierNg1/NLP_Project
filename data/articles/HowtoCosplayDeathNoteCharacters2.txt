 Pants may vary according to what you can find, but keep them as a more dressy pant like the pants from a suit. Always make sure you look preppy and fresh from the dryer. Light doesn't wear wrinkled or dirty clothing.
 Light's hair is a simple style. If you don't already have short brown hair, again, there are two options. One, cut it, or two, buy a wig. For either option you must make sure that the hair is a medium to light brown colour with possible red tints to it, and the cut must be even all around. It has the appearance of slightly messy, but is still well kept and tidy, just as everything else Light owns.
 Light's face is simple. Clear of blemishes and flaw free, but that doesn't mean you have to be that way entirely. Light is seemingly flawless in how he presents himself, but as long as you don't have any obscene amounts of makeup or facial tattoo's you should be good to go. Basically, just have a clean face.
 He's completely different from L, so remember your posture!

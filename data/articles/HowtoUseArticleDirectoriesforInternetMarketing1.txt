 Although it should be tested before adopting it on a grand scale, it will take money to finance SEO writers and/or the hours spent by your marketing team editing, posting and tracking the Return on Investment (ROI). Start by making sure your marketing department has already done research into the keywords most commonly associated with your company and website.;
, Make a list of directories that accept free, well-written articles. Ensure that each directory on your list has an author, or resource, box that allows you to write your job title, company, website and perhaps a short biography about your expertise.


Go to vretoolbar.com/articles/directories to get a list of 50 major article directories. You can also do a simple Internet search for "article directories" and spend some time surfing for sites that you think look credible, informative and attractive. However, remember that if they don't support links back to your site, they aren't worth your time.
 You can expand after you have mastered the process.

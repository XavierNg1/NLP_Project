 It looks like a "T." Click on the icon, or simply press "T" on your keyboard to bring up the text tool. Now, anywhere you click in your image will allow you to start adding type.;
, Once you click the Text tool, a bunch of options will appear at the top of Photoshop allowing you to choose the color, font, size, and alignment. You can also use the "Character," or the "Paragraph," which resemble the text editing boxes in programs like Microsoft Word. You can find these boxes by clicking on "Window" from the very top of your screen and checking "Character" and "Paragraph."Font: lets you select different font names such as Arial and Times New Roman.

Font Size: adjust the points of the font size to make the text bigger or smaller.

Font Alignment: choose whether you want the text to be centered or flushed to the right or left.

Font Color: clicking on the font color box will allow you to choose different colors for the text.
 If you simply click somewhere on the image, a cursor will appear where your first letter will appear. You can simply start typing, and Photoshop will add the words from this starting point.


If you're just adding simple text, this may be all you need to do.
If you know how to use the pen tool, you can click on a path to write text along that line.
 If yo need to text to fit with a specific area, you can click and drag out the area before you begin typing. Any text that doesn't fit will not appear unless you shrink the font size.
 If it keeps trying to start new text when you click out, then simply click on another tool to leave the text editor and move on. You can double-click on the text, or simply click on it again with the Text tool selected to edit the font and type at any point.


You can no longer edit text if you "Rasterize it." If you accidentally get this option, ignore it for now.
If the text layer is selected, press Ctrl-T or Cmd-T to resize the text by hand, instead of having to choose new font sizes.

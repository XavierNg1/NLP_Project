 Do you want to say something you didn't say back then? Or do you want to apologize for something? Whatever your reason is, don't make it sound like you're willing to get back together (unless if that's what you want).;
, You can try writing the "bad things" about it on a separate piece of paper and then burn it (try not to set anything else on fire). Show him/her that you're not bitter or childish, and at least try to write a mature letter about how you feel

, Don't think too much, just write what comes to your mind. Then you can sleep overnight and read it the next day, you may see it differently. If it doesn't sound like what you'd want it to, just write it again. Just remember not to keep on doing this for too long, the letter doesn't have to be grammatically correct or anything. The main thing is that you just finish the letter and send it to him/her.
 Saying bad things about them will change the way he or she sees the letter and you. Remain your pride and act mature.

 If you are University educated, a major (or minor) in Computer Sciences will get your foot in the door.;
, Your first assignment will probably be a clerk of some sort, you will be assisting the DBA in routine tasks. Be grateful- learn all that you can. Someday, that will be you!

, Oracle offers certification in their database products. Although this is not strictly a requirement, it ensures that you will never be out of work as a DBA (think salary haggling, and multiple offers of employment), and it complements your experience.
 Oracle has been offering database software for many years, and their procedural language built for automated routines (PL/SQL) has seen many revisions. Learn what has changed, and how to take advantage of new features when upgrading to a new version of the Database software.


I learned Oracle by getting the "Oracle database 11g the complete reference" by Kevin Loney and then practicing every example by manually typing it in a test database. You can download a free version of the Oracle database from oracle.com which you have to install. If you get stuck on a chapter, put a yellow sticky there and just go on, this way you will make a lot of progress.

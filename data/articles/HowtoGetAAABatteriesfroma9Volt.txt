 You may also want to wear gloves for the latter parts of the procedure, but this is optional.

A 9-volt battery (Make sure its an alkaline battery.)
A pair of scissors
A box cutter or utility knife;
, This isn't entirely necessary, but it greatly facilitates the next few steps. After peeling, you should notice that the battery "case" is made of plastic or steel., Using the knife, make cuts around the top rim of the battery, where the terminals are placed. If the casing is made of plastic, it is also helpful to make cuts on the sides to help open up the battery., A pair of pliers or a screwdriver may assist you in this step, but you can use your hand as well. If the top is still stubborn in not coming off, make more cuts to the rim., You will notice 6 small-sized batteries connected to the top end you just pulled off. Cut off the connecting pieces of the batteries, removing the metal pieces that are stuck on them., The 6 batteries you obtained should work decently as AAA batteries. They areÂ slightly smaller than the average AAA, but this shouldn't be a problem.

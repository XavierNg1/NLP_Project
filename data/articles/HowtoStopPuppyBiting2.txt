 Another useful training method to use for biting and other undesirable behaviors is redirection. With this training method, the goal is to redirect your puppyâ€™s attention away from your hand or body onto something else that he is allowed to bite, such as a chew toy.Keep in mind that puppies are often teething at the same time that they are learning about not biting, so it is important to make sure that your puppy has appropriate chew toys. Doing so will help to alleviate some of the discomfort in his mouth while also teaching him good behavior.
 If your puppy starts biting your hand, one way to get him to stop is to offer him a chew toy to redirect his attention away from you. Keep a chew toy handy when you are spending time with your puppy to help teach him that it is okay for him to chew on a toy, but not on your hand., Another good redirection is to play with your puppy. Try playing tug-of-war with your puppy if he starts biting you. Or if your puppy prefers to play fetch, take your puppy outside and throw his favorite ball or Frisbee for him. Whatever your dog likes to do for play can be used as a redirection from biting.

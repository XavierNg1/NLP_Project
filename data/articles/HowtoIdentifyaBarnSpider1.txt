 Female barn spiders grow to ⅞ of an inch (2.22 centimeters), while males are slightly smaller at ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters). Measure from the back of the back legs to the front of the front legs. But just estimate lengths by sight, since touching the spider will most likely startle it and scare it away., Barn spiders are generally a light, creamy brown color, with little variation in tone compared to most other spiders.The brown color of the barn spider serves to camouflage it, so you may have to look closely to detect this spider’s presence.
 One key characteristic of barn spiders is the banded or dotted appearance of their legs. The color tone alternates from medium to light brown or white, giving the legs a striped aspect. Another key to identifying them are the small white hairs covering the legs., The egg-shaped, somewhat oblong abdomen of the barn spider is disproportionately large compared to the legs, more so than with most spiders. This can give it a swollen, almost misshapen appearance. There are also darker brown spots toward the back end of the abdomen, in a pattern somewhat resembling military camouflage., If you think you may have found a candidate, take a digital photograph of it that you can enlarge. This will allow you to get a better look at the details of its anatomy. You can also use a magnifying glass for the same purpose, along with a flashlight if the web is in a dark area.

 Remove immediately from the burner or microwave once chocolate has melted and stirs smoothly. Do not over heat or you will scorch the chocolate and will not be able to use it.;
, (120 g) of butter to the melted chocolate and stir. Let it sit until the chocolate has cooled down and the mixture is not hot.
 Blend in 1 cup (240 mL) room temperature sour cream for a smooth frosting, since cold sour cream may cool your warm chocolate and cause it to stick together. Fold slightly with a rubber spatula or whisk.
 (10 mL) vanilla and 1/ 2 tsp. (2.5 mL) salt and stir. Add 5 1/2 cups (550 g) powdered sugar gradually, and keep mixing until the mixture becomes a creamy, spreadable consistency. Stir in a little more sour cream if the frosting is too stiff, or add more powdered sugar, a little at a time, if it is too thin.
 If it is too stiff after refrigeration, allow it to set out at room temperature for a few minutes so that it will be easier to spread.
 Spread onto cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pastries, muffins and even sweet breads.


Keep unused frosting refrigerated in an air-tight container and use within 2 days or it may loose some of its fluffy consistency.
Double the recipe if you want a thick coating of frosting on larger sheet cakes or double layer cakes.

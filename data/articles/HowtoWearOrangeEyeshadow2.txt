 Use your fingers or a damp eyeshadow brush. A damp brush works well for applying for bold pigment.However, if you want a bold and imprecise look, smudge the shadow on with your fingers.Dot an iridescent shadow, such as a pearly pink, in the inner corners of your upper lids for extra definition.
There are various shapes you can apply your shadow in, such as fanned, rounded and more. Whatever shape you choose, make sure to blend the outside of the shadow with your fingers or a brush.
 Black, green, pink and purple eyeliner all go well with orange eyeshadow. Black mascara frames a bold orange eye well.Alternately, you can skip all eyeliner and mascara, if you want the bold orange hue to stand out on its own., To get the under eye look right, make it subtle. Use your fingers to smudge a light amount of shadow below the water line of your lower lids, close to your lash line.Use less shadow than you did for your upper lids, so itâ€™s not a bright and defined. Blend the shadow so that it fades at the inner and outer parts of your bottom lids. Apply mascara to your lower lashes.Orange shadow on the bottom lids is optional for this look.

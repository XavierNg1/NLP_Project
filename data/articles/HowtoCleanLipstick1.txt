 To clean and sanitize your lipstick, you’ll need a bottle of isopropyl alcohol, which you can find at any drugstore. Pour enough into a plastic cup so you’ll be able to easily submerge the lipstick into it.Isopropyl alcohol comes in different percentages. For cleaning your lipstick, 70% is usually the best option. It’s strong enough to kill the bacteria and germs that might be present on the lipstick, but won’t evaporate as quickly as higher concentrations.;
, Take the tube of lipstick that you want to clean, and turn it all the way up the entire bullet is exposed. Submerge the lipstick in the cup of alcohol, and hold it there for 15 to 30 seconds.Be careful when you’re holding the lipstick in the alcohol so you don’t bang it against the side of the cup and damage the bullet.
 After you’ve let the lipstick soak in the alcohol, remove it from the cup. Use a tissue to wipe off the top layer of lipstick from the bullet, and leave the lipstick uncovered so it can finish air drying the rest of the way.To avoid dripping alcohol all over your table or counter, tap the lipstick container gently against the side of the cup when you pull it out to knock off any alcohol droplets before they fall.

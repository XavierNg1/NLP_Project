 You just cannot market to a market that you do not know. You have to get to know your market as if it were a person. What motivates that â€œperson? to buy your product? How old is the average person buying from you? What gender are they? Where do they live? What kinds of jobs do they have and what is their income? The more you know about your market, the more you are able to target your message effectively.;
,, You can have a great marketing message, but your market will not be interested if it does not reach them at the right time. Think about certain times of the year that your product or service can be advertised aggressively. Holidays such as Christmas, Fourth of July, and Easter could be exploited to increase revenue for your business.

With this in mind, you have to test your offers. You have to find the right offer that will beat all your other offers, and then turn around and test it again. You need to test, and then test again. In addition, after it is all done and over with, you need to start all over again, with your testing. In this way, you will be testing and refining your results for the better on a continual basis.
 Your message will resonate with their hearts. It will address their needs and your service or product will differentiate you from your competitors. Be sure that you stress benefits over features. All too often, advertisers are hung up on the features, and leave prospects wondering what the benefits are. Do not assume that your prospect will already know the benefits. You have to spell them out for the market.

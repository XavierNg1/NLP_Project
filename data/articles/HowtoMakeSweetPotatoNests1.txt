 Set your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (about 205 degrees Celsius). Place your sweet and russet potatoes on a baking tray and bake them for about 20 minutes. When your potatoes are done, they should be cooked through but not entirely tender or soft to the touch., Wait until your potatoes are cool to the touch. Then, use a vegetable peeler to peel off the skins. Use a grater, such as a cheese grater, to grate the potatoes into a mixing bowl., Add the olive oil and salt to your bowl with the potatoes. Mix everything together into a even, consistent mixture., Divide the mixture evenly between 12 compartments in a muffin pan. The mixture will shrink considerably during the baking process, so expect the compartments to be very full. Then, press down the center of each cup so you have a slight indent. This is where you'll put the eggs.Depending on the size of your baking tray, you may be left with extra potato mixture. In this case, make one more nest.
 Turn the oven up to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Place your muffin tray in the oven. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes. When done, your potatoes should be golden brown., Crack each egg one by one. Pour the eggs into the indents you created in your potato mixture earlier., Place your potato mixture back in the oven. Bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.

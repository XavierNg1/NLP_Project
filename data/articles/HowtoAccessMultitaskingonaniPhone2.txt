 When using an application on iOS7 and above, notifications will appear as clickable banners at the top of your screen regardless of what application you are working in.


To determine whether or not push notifications are enabled on your device, go to "Settings," "Notification Center," and then select the apps you would like to have banner notifications. This will lead you to a window where you can personalize the banners and alerts., By clicking directly on the banner, you will be transferred to that app. For instance, if you are looking through your photos and receive a text message, you can quickly access your messaging by clicking on the banner notification.
 To return to your initial application, double-click the home button. The screen you are on will minimize and you will be presented with a menu of all of your open apps.
 To search for the app that you would like to relaunch, you can swipe to the left or the right on your screen in order to browse your currently running applications. Tap the app to bring that app back to the foreground. The app will start where you left off.

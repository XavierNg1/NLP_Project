 See the method above for this. Remove the lid completely (it is not needed for this project).
 Use nail polish from other bottles to paint pretty designs onto the bottle. For example, flowers, stripes, patterns, etc. Allow to dry.

 The tiny vase can be used to hold a small bunch of dried flowers or leaves, or it could hold incense sticks, or anything long and skinny that you find decorative.

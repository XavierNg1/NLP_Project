 Buy desks, computers, and make rooms.


For example, you could make a meeting room with chairs and a table, eating room with a feast table, and spying room with tons of computers.;
, Choose someone who thinks this is a good idea too. You don't want someone who destroys it all by pretending to like it, then messing it all up for you or calling you names.


If possible, get lots of buddies––the more the merrier and the larger the spy org will be.
 Have field agents, analysts. gadget makers, mission providers (aka the boss/head honcho/big mamma), etc. You can make it up from your favorite spy movies or cartoons. Or you can just make it up. It's all make believe so be as imaginative as you like.
 For example, AWAA stands for Arctic Wolf Animal Agency.
, Use it when animals you don't know are around you.

If you have a friendly jammer, try to tell them to at least try their best not to give themselves away. They might be better off making and explaining the gadgets, analyzing data or playing Moneypenny style characters.
 Have a buddy hide somewhere. Track down your buddy. Put your cursor over the blue circle to know where your secretive buddy is. Tell them when you've found them.


Then, follow your buddy. Click the blue circle to follow the buddy and hide yourself. Play this as often as wished.
The blue arrow pointing upwards above the chat box has a list of what has been said if you click on it.
 The boss should have the main role in deciding this but you can all make suggestions.
 A good one to try is doing adventures, a hard one, like The Hive.

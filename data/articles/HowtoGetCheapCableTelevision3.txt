 An Internet search for “cheap cable” will bring up many websites that allow you to compare all of the different packages offered by cable providers in your area. Type in your zip code and research the different options available to you. Perhaps draw up a chart to compare the pricing and which channels and features you get for the money; doing this will help you to quickly visualize which provider is offering you the best deal for your money.


Be wary of deals that may offer a low monthly rate for a limited period of time, only to increase the price after that period ends.

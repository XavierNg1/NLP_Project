Measure out 6.8 fl. oz. (200 milliliters) of methanol. You can find methanol in gas tank antifreeze, available at hardware stores or auto part stores. Pour it in a blender.






Use a scale that will accurately measure out grams to weigh out 3.5 grams of lye. You can use Red Devil Lye Drain Cleaner (sodium hydroxide), but take the proper precautions because lye is poisonous. Drain cleaners that are chlorine-based (calcium hypochlorite) will not work.






With the lid off, turn your blender on its slowest setting, and begin slowly adding the lye to the methanol inside. This will create sodium methoxide, but take precaution that the mixture doesn't splatter all over.






It should take about two minutes for the lye to dissolve, so once it has, add 1.1 quart (1 liter) of vegetable oil.

, Approximately 30 to 60 minutes after you pour it into your container, you will see layers appearing in your mixture. The bottom layer is glycerin, and the lighter layer above it is bio-diesel.
 Once the mixture has completely settled, you can pour off the biodiesel for use and discard the glycerin. You can alternately use the glycerin for making soap.

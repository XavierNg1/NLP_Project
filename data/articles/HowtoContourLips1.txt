 Dehydration leads to lips that are dry, chapped, and cracked, so make sure to consume the proper amount of fluids! Consume at least 64 fluid ounces (2,000Â ml)of pure water daily, drinking more if you have an active lifestyle or do any exercising.;
, This creates a fresh palette to work on! Use a makeup wipe to remove any product and then wash your lips with a mild, unscented soap such as Dial or Dove.
 This removes all dead skin from your lips, leaving them soft and easy to work on. Do NOT use a sugar scrub, because sugar grains are too abrasive for the fragile skin of the lips. Be sure to rinse all products from your lips!

, Lip balm stays on your lips for long periods of time and you will not have a fresh palette to contour. In addition, don't use any lip balms with medication or beeswax in them, for those can harm your lips and even become addictive (they don't heal your lips, only relieve them, so it's a continuous cycle). If you plan to contour directly after, use a moisturizer that is made specifically for facial use, any one that you pick up from the beauty store should do.

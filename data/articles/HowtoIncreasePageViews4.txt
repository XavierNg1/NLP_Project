 Users hate it when companies clog their newsfeeds with posts and ads. Be discerning. Share content that you feel strongly about. Populate pages and videos with links so users interested in more information about you can embark on their own search across your website.


Before sharing, think about your brand, and whether the content you want to share furthers the image you want to create.
 Share buttons take the form of a control panel that lets users share a page you created on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and other popular social media sites with a single click.


Free apps such as AddToAny give you share control panels you can embed in your webpage.
Place share buttons at the top and bottom of each page.
 Not every piece of content you share has to be something you created. Share fun and interesting content that's tangentially related to your brand. For instance, if your webpage sells fashionable clothing, look for top-10 lists that count down the trendiest styles worn by celebrities.
 Many users spend more time on Facebook on Thursdays and Fridays, when their workweek is coming to a close and they have more time to kill before heading home for the weekend.

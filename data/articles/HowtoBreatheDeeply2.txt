 As you take in air through your nose, count from one to four, making sure not to rush. This counting exercise will help you regulate your breaths and concentrate on breathing deeply. Remember to let your belly move outward and breathe from your diaphragm.This breathing exercise acts as a kind of sedative. Whenever you're feeling particularly stressed out or in need a quick way to calm down, find a quiet place to practice 4-7-8 breathing.
You can also use this breathing exercise to help you fall asleep.
 Relax and hold it, not breathing in or out, as you wait for seven seconds. You can count in your head or use a watch.
 Slowly let the air out through your mouth as you count to eight. Timing your exhale will help you make sure that it's about twice as long as your inhale, which is optimal for deep breathing. As you exhale, pull your stomach in to help expel as much air as you can.
 Breathe in again, hold it, and exhale completely. Remember to count every time so that the 4-7-8 ratio always stays the same. After four breaths, you should feel a sense of calm. Repeat the exercise for several more breaths if needed.

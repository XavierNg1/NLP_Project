 Consider the balloon size when selecting your balloon. The bottom half of the balloon will end up being the vase’s shape so if you require something larger (or smaller) be cognizant with regard to those dimensions.;
, Dip your sponge brush into the glue and cover the area of the balloon that will become the vase. Take the glue a little higher than your intended height as you may want to trim and shape the vase top as you go.
 Working quickly (so the glue doesn’t dry before you are finished), sprinkle confetti over the glue. Make sure you cover the vase area completely so make several passes with confetti until you can no longer see balloon underneath.
 Ample dry time could be up to 24 hours and in a dry, cool area. The confetti will feel somewhat stiff once it has fully dried.
 Don’t go for the big pop but instead, pierce the top and slowly allow the air to escape from the balloon.
 Be gentle when removing the balloon and simply peel the pieces away.
 Go for something unexpected or cut the edge so it appears even--it’s your creation!

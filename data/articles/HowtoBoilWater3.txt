 If you can't find a dish labeled "microwave safe," choose glass or ceramic cookware that does not have any metallic paint. To test whether it is microwave safe, place it in the microwave, empty, next to a cup of water. Microwave for one minute. If the dish is hot after the minute is up, it is not microwave safe.








For increased safety, use a container that has a scratch or chip (in scientific terms, a nucleation site) on the interior surface. This will help the water bubble, reducing the risk of an (already unlikely) "superheated" explosion., This also helps the water bubble. Try a wooden spoon, chopstick, or popsicle stick. If you don't mind flavoring the water, even a spoonful of salt or sugar should be enough.








Avoid using a plastic object, which may be too smooth to allow bubbles to form on it.
 In most microwaves, the edge of the rotating carousel will heat up faster than the center.
 For maximum safety, look up recommended water heating times in your microwave's manual. If you don't have the manual, try heating in 1-minute intervals. After each interval, cautiously stir the water, then remove it from the microwave to test its temperature. The water is ready when it's steaming and too hot to touch.









If the water is still cool after the first couple minutes, increase the length of each session to 1.5 or 2 minutes. The total amount of time depends on your microwave's power and the amount of water you're boiling.
Don't expect a "rolling boil" in a microwave. The water will still reach boiling temperatures, but it will be less obvious.

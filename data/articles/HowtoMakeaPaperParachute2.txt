 Unfold a sheet of tissue paper and lay it on a flat work surface. Use a ruler and pencil to measure and mark a square with side lengths of 14 inches. Cut out the square with a pair of scissors., Retrieve a roll of scotch tape and rip four 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Set the pieces on the edge of your work space. Place 1 piece of tape on the top left corner—place ½ inch on the top of the tissue paper, fold the tape over, and adhere it to the bottom of the tissue paper. Insert the reinforced corner into a hole punch and create a hole. Repeat this process on the remaining corners.


The tape will reinforce the corner and prevent the tissue paper from ripping. , Unwind the string and cut off a strand that is approximately 16 inches (40.6 cm) long. Unwind more string. Lay the cut strand next to the unwound string to use as a ruler. Cut the second strand the same length as the first. Cut 2 more lengths of string., Thread 1 string into the top left corner of the tissue paper sail. Tie the string in a loose loop. Tie 1 string in each of the 3 remaining corners., Gather the 4 strings together 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom. Tie the strands together in a knot. Hook 3 to 7 paperclips in a chain to the bottom of the strings. Hook the first paperclip over the knot., After completely the construction of your parachute, it is ready to launch.

 This could be done by using the internet or by using the Yellow Pages in a phone directory. Most vets have websites, so if you do a search for "vets in (your town)", you should get a list of possibilities.;
, Some vets and pet hospitals do not accept rabbits because the veterinarians do not specialize in small animals. Check on their website or call them up to verify whether they'll see bunnies.
 This will allow you to compare the options. Considering the factors that matter most to you, investigate each option by reading their website, sending them an email with your questions, or calling them. Some factors to consider include:


Location: Is it easy to get to from your home, and is parking available if needed? You don't want to have to travel a long way with your rabbit, or carry it a distance.
Facilities: Which building has a nicer facility? Does each vet offer the services you need?
Cost: Find out the cost of a basic office visit, and other common services you might need.
Hours: It's important that your vet is open at convenient times for you. If you'll only be able to take your rabbit in on the weekends or during the evenings, make sure they're open at those times.
 While getting along with your vet might not be your number one concern, you likely still want to make sure that your vet is polite, friendly, conscientious, and knowledgeable. Talk to them and see who makes the best impression. Get an idea of their "bedside manner" with your pet. Make sure that they have worked with rabbits before and that they know what they are doing.
 If you decide you don't like that vet afterwards, you can always go and try a different one next time. Nothing is set in stone, and it's pretty easy to jump from vet to vet.

 Grab all of your box braids and pull them into a loose ponytail at the top of your head.


Keep the ponytail loose and hold it together with a large hair elastic.
Center the ponytail over the top of your head.
 Divide the braids in your ponytail into three separate sections. One should fall over the front of your face while the other two fall over either side of your head.


Note that the section of braids at the front of your face should be about half the size of the side sections. Both side sections should be roughly the same thickness, however.
 Take both side sections and fold them toward the back of your head. The ends of these two sections should meet at the back.


The bow shape should start to form as you fold.
Each section will look like a half-loop positioned on either side of the top of your head.
Once you bring the ends together, hold both ends in place with one hand.
 Using your free hand, flip the front section of braids up and back. It should cross over the top of your head and fall to the back.


As you flip this front section back, it should cross over the folded side sections and their ends.
This flipped front section forms the center of your bow.
 Tuck the ends of your center section beneath the secured side loops.


Work carefully to avoid unraveling the bow.
Once the ends of this center section are beneath the loops of the bow, carefully push them toward the center of the bow.
 If any braids fell out of the side loops as you worked, use your fingers to carefully tuck them in and out of sight.


You can also take this time to accessorize your braided bow. Consider using beads or decorative bobby pins. Insert the pins directly through the center of the bow to help hold the braids together.
After you finish this step, you've completed the style.

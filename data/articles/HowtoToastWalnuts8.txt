 Toasted walnuts taste best when served warm, so you should not let them cool to room temperature. They will be hot after you finish toasting them, though, and handling them immediately can lead to burns. Wait until the nuts have cooled just enough to comfortably hold in your hand., The shell should have begun peeling up slightly at the "x" mark as the walnuts toasted. Use your fingers to grip the corners and forcefully peel the softened shell off. The shell may still pose some problem, but it can usually be worked off with only your fingers., If the shell is still too hard to peel away, gently crack it using a nutcracker as though the nut were still raw. Apply pressure carefully, though, since toasted walnuts tend to be a little softer than raw walnuts and will break apart more easily., Rub the towel over the nuts using small yet rapid strokes to remove the bitter skins., You can also store the toasted nuts in the refrigerator or freezer if necessary, but most people prefer the taste of warm toasted walnuts over cold walnuts.

Both beef short ribs and back ribs are available in various grades. Most standard grocery stores will carry select grade meat. This meat is perfectly acceptable for consumption, and is the least expensive. Choice and prime cuts are often available only at specialty grocers and butchers, but they have additional marbling through the meat, which adds flavor and tenderness. Kobe, or waygu, may only be available if you special order it through your butcher.



Organic beef comes from steer that were raised and slaughtered according to that area's organic certification standards. It is typically the most expensive compared to grass fed or conventional beef. Grass fed beef is raised on grass and may or may not have any hormones or other additives. Conventional beef is mass produced and available at the lowest price.

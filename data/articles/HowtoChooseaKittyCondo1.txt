 The cat condo you choose should be made of quality materials. Wood is the best material. The wood should be covered by carpet that is not looped, which can get caught in their nails. Fake fur and fleece may also be a good choice.Avoid treated wood because it can contain chemicals harmful to your cat.;
, Scratching posts are intended to keep the cat from scratching your furniture. This should be covered in sisal rope. The rope should be thick to provide an adequate surface to scratch. The rope provides a better scratching post than one covered in carpet.Make sure not to get a scratching post with oiled rope. Oiled rope can be toxic.
 The materials used to put the kitty condo together is important. Putting the frame together using screws is better than nails. Screws can be tightened after the cats have jumped on it and loosened it.Make sure the carpet is not glued on the condo. Glue can be very toxic to cats. Instead, the carpet should be stapled.
 Some kitty condos come with additional features that may be helpful for your cat. You can get ones with hanging cat toys, hammocks, and stairs. Decide if the price is worth the extra features.Hanging cat toys may be beneficial if you think it will help stimulate and engage your cat.
 Make sure that the base of your condo is wide and sturdy. If you buy a condo, especially a tall one with platforms and other accessories, the base must be sturdy. Look for a wide sturdy base that wonâ€™t cause the whole condo to topple over if multiple cats jump on it.

 One of the best ways to get B12 into your diet is to eat seafood. Shellfish, such as lobster, crabs, and especially clams, have high amounts of B12.Fish, such as trout, salmon, tuna, and haddock, also offer a lot of B12.


One three ounce serving has almost 400% of your daily B12. Three ounces of clams give you more than your daily value.;
, Both beef and organ meat like beef liver have a lot of B12.Pork also contains B12.


One medium slice of beef liver has 2800% of your recommended daily amount of B12.
As a healthier alternative to beef, you can try buffalo or bison.Some meat substitutes are fortified with B12, as is tofu. Consider this option if you are vegan or vegetarian, and check the label for the amount of B12.Poultry products provide B12, as do eggs. Two cooked eggs have a full day’s amount of Vitamin B12.
 Include dairy products, such as yogurt, milk, and cheese, in your diet to give it a B12 boost.Some non-animal milks are fortified with B12, too.Try a snack of one cup of low-fat fruit yogurt for half a day’s amount.

 Unlike business headers, many personal letters are handwritten on stationery that says the person’s initials or full name at the top.
 Envelopes may get thrown away and including a sender’s address is the best way to encourage a reply. Move on to the date if you are on friendly terms with the recipient.The sender’s address should include two lines, the street and the city, state and zip code. A name is not necessary.
 Format it using the month, day and year. For example, “September 15, 2014.”


Personal letters should be sent immediately after the are written to expedite time-sensitive information.
 If you are writing a formal complaint or letter that will go on record with an organization, you should use the etiquette rules governing a business letter.
 Always include a colon after the salutation.


You can use “Dear Mr. James,” “Dear Larry James” or “Dear Larry.”
Continue the letter, including body paragraphs, a closing, a signature and enclosures.

 Everybody gets bad shoulders. You get them from punching hard for hours. You get them from working on escaping various wrestling holds (Americana, Chimora, Armbar, etc). Here are some things that help:

, Do not roll your shoulders forward and back. All these exercises seem to do is accentuate any injury you either have, or are working on having.
 This is a great thing to do while in a fight, but terrible for every other time.


Take some time several times each day to pinch your shoulder blades together. Hold them there with your arms out to your sides (palms up) at 90 degrees, bent at the elbow like you're imitating an angel (your hands should be about level with your shoulders), and slowly raise your arms over your head while keeping your shoulder blades together and touch your index fingers together.
You may need to back up to a wall to ensure you have your shoulders rolled as far back as you can and your back is not rolled so that your stomach is poking out. Slowly go up and down 6 to 10 times. Do this before each workout for sure, and a few times each day whether you need it or not.
 These can be bought in bulk powder and some people find they help with crummy joints.

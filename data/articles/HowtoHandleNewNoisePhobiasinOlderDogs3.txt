However, your dog picks up on your moods, so getting upset, angry, or frustrated will just increase the anxiety in your dog.You may not understand why your dog is upset over the noises, but they look to you for comfort and reassurance. Love your older dog, and don’t scold them for their anxiety.
 Your dog feels comfort when you are around, so if there are noises that upset your older pet, don’t leave them alone. Instead, stay near them and spend time with them. You don’t have to go out of your way to comfort them. Just be close to help them feel safe.For example, if you get upset because they are upset, the dog may pick up on it. Excessively comforting them may make them feel more anxious.
Relax with your dog on the couch, play with them, or pet them gently. Let them know you are there.
 While you want to make sure you keep your dog close so they feel safe, you should just act like everything is normal.

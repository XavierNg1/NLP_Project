 Water is the base that is used in every potion and poison, and it determines the level of the item you are creating. Look for water in streams and around ponds. When the icon to gather the water pops up, hit the A button to gather it.


The types of water in order of rarity are natural, clear, pristine, cleansed, filtered, purified, and cloud mist. The farther in the game you get, the better waters you can find.
 You can find them scattered across all of the different areas on the map. There are 18 varieties, and they can be gathered by approaching them and hitting the A button.
 You should look for an icon on your map that resembles a chemical cloud. When you go looking for an Alchemy Table in town, look for beakers and vials scattered on it, that is how you know you have found the right table.
 You will be loaded into the Alchemy screen where you can start making potions or poisons.
 You should pick a high-quality water if you want to make the best potion or poison. You cannot directly pick if you want to make a potion or poison; instead, it is dictated by the plant ingredients that you use. An example would be if you use two plants that boost health, with this, you will make a healing potion. Two potions that have the trait “Damage health” will result in a poison.
 Look below the water and you will see all the ingredients that you gathered while you were out. Highlight and select two of them with the A button.
 You have a chance of discovering more ingredients if you get the proper combinations of ingredients together.
 You will gain experience for discovering ingredients and creating the potion.

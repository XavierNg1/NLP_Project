 Go through your recipe books and the internet and look for the best baking recipes you can find.
 Type or copy and paste all the recipes in. Add a Table of Contents at the beginning and a title page. Remember to make it colourful and easy to read. Save the file and print it. Do not put in any recipes the recipient of the basket will/may be allergic to.
 However, if it is too thick to staple get a hole punch and punch a hole 1/4 of the way up and another 3/4 of the way up (the page). Get some sting/ribbon/colourful wool and tie a bow through the first hole. Repeat for the second hole. You can do this with as many holes as you want. Remember to tie the bow tightly and double knot the bow tightly.
 If you don't have a printer you can ask a neighour/relation/friend to print it for you or go to a printing store (although you will have to pay for the last option).

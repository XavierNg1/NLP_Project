 Are you trying to lose weight to feel healthier? To make the softball team? Impress guys? To get into the dress of your dreams or a bikini for summer? Understanding your motives for wanting to lose weight will give you a better chance at achieving your goals.;
, Things that tempt you like sugary cereals will no longer tempt you if they're in the trash. If you live with roommates or relatives and simply discarding unhealthy food isn't an option, ask them to hide it or put it in a less tempting location.
 Whether it's an exercise plan or your meal plan for the week to avoid eating unhealthy foods, writing things out is a great way to commit yourself to achieving your weight loss goals.

 To receive a diagnosis of nightmare disorder, your nightmares cannot be explained by another medical or mental health condition.However, an underlying condition may be responsible for your nightmares and treating it may eliminate the nightmares. Talk to your medical doctor about any medical conditions you may have that may underlie the nightmares. Your doctor may run some tests and rule out causes for your nightmares. If a medical cause is found, treat the underlying medical cause.Your doctor can also prescribe new medications, or adjust your current medications if he or she suspects that these medications may be causing your nightmares.Repeated nightmares may be an indication of a breathing disorder such as sleep apnea. Sleep apnea occurs when the body stops breathing while sleeping, then gasps for air. A telltale sign of sleep apnea is loud snoring, followed by a pause, then a snort or gasp. This pattern repeats throughout the night. You may wake up feeling unrefreshed or grumpy in the morning, feel drowsy throughout the day, or have untreatable headaches.Although it is not related to nightmare disorder, PTSD is a common cause of nightmares. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects some people after a stressful or traumatic event. 71 to 96% of people who experience trauma and resulting PTSD experience nightmares. The nightmares may recount major scenes of the trauma.Go to a therapist and get assessed for symptoms of PTSD and the resulting nightmares.

 IRT is a practice performed while the individual is awake. While engaged with the nightmare, the person changes the ending of the nightmare so that it no longer is upsetting. Once the ending has been changed, the person replays the nightmare and the resulting ending over and over in the mind. This type of treatment can reduce the frequency of the nightmares.For example, if you constantly dream about driving off a cliff, imagine yourself driving the same road, anticipating the cliff, and the car or bus driving past the location. Then, see the destination up ahead. You may imagine a nice forest or beach where you can have a picnic.

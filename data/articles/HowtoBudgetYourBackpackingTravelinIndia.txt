 Indian services and goods cost about a 1/10 of what similar would cost in the USA. If this ratio is greatly exceeded on any product or service it usually means the target market are tourists or the rich.;
,, Indian money bills are used till fall apart. Keep away from torn, mended or highly eroded ones, as locals do, these can usually be deemed only at an 'Bank of India' government branch.
 Local small businesses find it hard to give change for even Rs.500 bills

, All marked prices are bottom line, in rural India. There are no extra tax, vat, gratuity, tip, fee, charge etc.
 Bargaining is the nature of consumer business in India. Barber, tailor, Internet browsing center, mobile/computer shop or any service (Vs. packaged goods) is open for price negotiation.
 All packaged goods bear an M.R.P (Maximum retail price) which is the sale price at all city and village shops. There's no bargaining as shop's profit margin is only about 5% . M.R.P is surpassed at highway bus stops, train stations and airports.
 Traditionally money should be paid and received with right hand only.
 As per latest recommendations by the Government of India, you will be charged for plastic bags and numerous places have been marked as "NO PLASTIC ZONE" and many other shops won't even use plastic bags.

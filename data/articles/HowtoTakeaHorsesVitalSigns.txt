 If needed, have an assistant hold the horse.
 For a mare, the average is 100ºF (37.8ºC) and for a stallion, the average is 99.7ºF (37.6ºC).The normal pulse rate is 36 to 42 beats per minute. The resting heart rate is 28 to 40 beats per minute.The normal respiration rate is between 8-12 breaths per minute. At rest, it is between 8 to 14 breaths per minute.The average capillary refill time is two seconds.
 Lubricate the tip with petroleum jelly or Vaseline.;
, Insert the thermometer into the horse's rectum, angled slightly towards the ground.
 Take a reading after this time is done.


Always clean the thermometer before storing it.



If the pulse is weak, strong or absent, this can be a sign of heart disease or a specific defect.The horse must be promptly seen by the veterinarian.
 The pulse can be found near front of left jawbone; under the jawbone, there is a major artery that sticks out slightly.
 Press against the artery firmly.
 Multiply the number of beats you counted by four.


Alternatively you can place your hand or a stethoscope behind the horse's left elbow to take his pulse. Be sure to count each lub-dub as one beat.
 Be sure to count one inhale and one exhale as one breath (not as two).


If you are having difficulty seeing the ribcage move, try watching the horse's nostrils or place your hand in front of the nostrils to feel the horse exhale.
 An even better method is to place a stethoscope to the horse's windpipe to listen to its breathing. This will also give you strange sounds if the horse's windpipe is blocked by mucous or if the horse has allergies or heaves.
 Firmly press your thumb against the gum for two seconds to create a white mark.
 The mark should return to normal salmon pink color within two seconds of releasing the pressure.


If the CRT takes longer than 2 seconds, the horse may have shock.

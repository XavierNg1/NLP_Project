 One of the biggest factors that can make your cat's condition worse is excess weight. An overweight cat will have an even harder time breathing, so excess weight should be avoided.If your cat is overweight, discuss ways to lower its weight with its veterinarian. Putting your cat on a weight loss regimen under the guidance of a veterinarian will ensure that it loses weight safely.
 Cats that have problems breathing can have even more trouble when they are too hot. If you live in a warm climate, be sure that your cat has a cool place to spend its day.

Hot and humid weather can often make the symptoms of brachycephalic airway syndrome worse., A cat that has this condition has a harder time getting oxygen into its system. If you over exercise it, this lack of oxygen can become more pronounced and its respiratory system will become over stressed.Once your cat's condition is treated with surgery and it has recovered from that surgery, you can resume normal levels of activity with your cat.

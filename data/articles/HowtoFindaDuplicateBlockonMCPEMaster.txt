 You don't need to eliminate passive mobs.;
, Place them side by side.



Does one block have lines that run smoothly to the next, or is there a seemingly dead end? If you chose the first one, your blocks might be modified duplicates.



However, all of the wool blocks are modified duplicates of white wool. They are not similar in color. Any of these signs is not good on their own, but when you put them together it counts.



Maybe one block has a feature that looks like an E in the right hand corner. If it does, that sign almost screams duplicate.
 If not, keep trying different block combinations. You will find one eventually!

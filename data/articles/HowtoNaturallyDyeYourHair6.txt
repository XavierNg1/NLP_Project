 You'll want to test out any natural hair dye method before using it. Your hair may react poorly to a certain method or produce a color you dislike. Dye a small portion of your hair first, using a lock from the back of your head. See if you like the results before attempting to dye your own hair.
 Natural hair dye will not dramatically change the color of your hair. It seeks primarily to enhance your hair's existing shades. For example, if your hair is a dirty blond using chamomile can produce a lighter, more yellow blond. However, adding henna to naturally blond hair will not turn your hair brown. If you want to completely change your hair color, it's better to go to a salon.
 Some salon products may cause your hair to react poorly to certain natural hair dye methods. As always, test the method on a small piece of hair before attempting to dye all your hair. You may also want to call your stylist and ask her what products he or she used and whether they interact poorly with natural hair dyes.

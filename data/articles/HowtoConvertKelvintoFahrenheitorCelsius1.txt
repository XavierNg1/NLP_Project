 The formula is: ºF = 1.8 x (K - 273) + 32.;
, The Kelvin temperature in this example is 373 K. Remember that you should not use degrees when measuring the temperature in Kelvin., Just subtract 273 from 373. 373 - 273 = 100.
 Now, multiply the answer, 100, by 1.8. 100 * 1.8 = 180.
 Just add 32 to 180 to get your final answer. 180 + 32 = 212. Therefore, 373 K = 212ºF.

 Then, draw a horizontal oval that starts about two-thirds of the way down the circle. Make sure the two shapes overlap, as they do in the provided image. This sketch will be the base of your squirrel's head and cheeks.
 Make sure they should be slightly off to the sides of it. These rectangles will serve as the ears., Remember, when it comes to drawing chibis you should make sure that the body is about half the size of the head. Chibis are all about being non -proportional., Two should be inside the trapezoid (pointing towards the middle) while the other two should be below pointing to the two bottom corners of the trapezoid., Above it, draw a large circle with a small swirl within it., In the middle of the trapezoid, draw a small, vertical oval. Within the two rectangles on the head, draw smaller rectangles. Draw two large circles for the eyes, then inside these circles, including circles for their highlights. Add the squirrel's mouth by drawing a round, cornered triangle for the nose and an upside down "Y" shape connected to the nose, with rectangular teeth sticking out of it., Add shading if you wish, and make sure that all extraneous guidelines have been erased.

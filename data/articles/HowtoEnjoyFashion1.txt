 Separate the clothes you like from the clothes you do not like.;
, Look for similarities and ask yourself why you like each piece. You may like the way it flatters your shape, or maybe you like it because of the material or pattern. Mark these reasons down on a list so you know what to look for later on.
 Ask yourself if there are any pieces that have unfulfilled potential, like a tailor-fit blazer in a bland color or dress trousers that need to be hemmed up. Return these pieces to your closet or dresser.
 Theoretically, you should be left with clothes that do not flatter you and clothes that follow tired trends. Make a second list of all the attributes you do not like so you know what not to look for when you go shopping.
 You can give it away to a relative or close friend, or you can take it to a secondhand shop or charity.
 If your garments have stains or rips, toss them out.
 Keep pieces that you like and, depending on the quality, either donate or dispose of pieces you hate.

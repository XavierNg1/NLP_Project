 For a simpler method of presentation, lay uncut flowers with long stems across the top of the cake, or on the platter around the based. Cut wax paper or roll a thin layer of fondant to cover the part of the cake that touches the flower. One or two whole flowers will make for a modestly beautiful look.Be sure to trim away any thorns, leaves or visible imperfections from the flower stems before situating them on the cake.
Whole flowers can be used to spruce up naked or smaller cakes in a breeze.
 Rather than inserting flowers into the top of the cake, stick them between the layers on the outer edges of larger cakes. This will create the effect that the flowers are blooming out of the cake. Use foam dividers if youâ€™re worried about damaging the layers or contaminating the cake.Place fresh flowers in a ring around the base, middle layers and top of the cake to create a festive border.
 Gently remove the petals from your flowers of choice. Be careful not to mash or tear them. Use a loose hand to sprinkle them around the base of the cake, or sparingly on top. Flower petals can give your cake an infusion of color and bohemian grace without the need to mess with soaking, cutting and arranging whole blossoms.Loose flowers petals can be picked off before serving, or eaten, provided that they belong to an edible species.
 Some types of flowers are safe to be actually eaten. Mix in a small amount of these flowers with fruit, candies and other confections for a dessert with bright, floral notes. Clover, marjoram and hibiscus are all common flower varieties that can make a great cake topper.It may be better to avoid decorating with especially fragrant types of edible flowers such as roses and jasmine, as the chemicals that produce their trademark scents can easily overpower the flavors of a cake.Use a light hand when finishing cakes with flowers that are meant to be eaten. Their petals can sometimes be dry, waxy and hard to chew and swallow in great quantities.

 VLC Player will automatically load subtitle files that are located in the same location as the video file that is playing, as long as the subtitle file lines up with the video. You can find subtitle files for virtually any movie or show in a variety of location online. Simply search for the title plus "subtitle file" or "srt". SRT is one of the most common subtitle file formats. Subtitles may also be in SSA format.
 It can be in a folder with lots of different videos. Rename the subtitle files so that it has the same name as the video.
 You can either start VLC and then load the movie, or you can set the movie file to open automatically in VLC. Either way, make sure that VLC loads the movie.
 Once the movie file has started playing, Click the Subtitle menu and click "Add Subtitle File". Browse for the subtitle file and open it. The subtitles should then be displayed at the bottom of the video.


The subtitle file will not be added to the video. You will need to keep the subtitle file in order to view them.

 To avoid the tax sale, you must pay back taxes before the deadline for the sale. You will receive a notice when the county government schedules the sale, and you will receive a deadline for paying in full the unpaid taxes and any interest or penalties. Try to come up with the money in the following ways:


Dip into your savings. Although you might be saving money for a rainy day, you don’t want to lose your house. You should think about taking money from your savings.
Sell bonds, stock, etc. Sell any financial instruments to raise money.
Ask friends or family for a loan. If you don’t owe much money, you might be able to get a friend or family member to give you a loan. Be sure to draft and sign a payment agreement.
Request a loan from a bank. A bank or a property tax lender might be willing to give you a loan.Check their interest rates.
Get a loan from a government agency. In some cities and states, you can get a loan from an agency if you qualify. For example, in Baltimore, you can get a loan if you owe no more than $1,500 and have no bankruptcies or liens on the property. You get two years to repay the loan., Your taxing authority might agree to a payment plan. You should call and ask.With a payment plan, you can stretch out repayment of the back taxes over a year or more.
 Take out your notice of tax sale and check the deadline for paying. Be sure to pay before the deadline, otherwise the process of getting the house back becomes more complicated—and expensive.


Remember to get a receipt. Once you pay, make sure that the tax assessor gives you a receipt to show that you have paid off your taxes in full.

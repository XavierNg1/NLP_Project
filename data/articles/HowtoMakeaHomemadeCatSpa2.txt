 Start when she is happy — perhaps after eating. Even though cats do a lot of washing themselves, brushing often takes some time to get used to. Start by letting her inspect the grooming brush and try to brush her for about five minutes.
 Keep your cat happy and entertained as you brush him. Start a regular brushing routine so that your cat knows what is coming and begins to look forward to it. At the beginning you might even want to give your cat a treat for doing a good job while you were brushing.
 Short-haired cats and long-haired cats have different needs when it comes to their care. Always brush in the direction the hair is growing. Be sure to clean out the brush after each use — and especially if you have multiple cats that use the same brush.Short-haired cats need a fine-toothed metal comb for the initial brushing, followed by a soft rubber brush to get out the loose hair.
Long-haired cats initially need a wide-toothed comb to get out the tangles and any dirt that might have gotten stuck in their hair. Work very carefully to get the knots out. Then use a wire brush to get out the loose hair. Some people suggest using a toothbrush around the face as the final step.
 Long-haired cats can easily get tangles in their hair which are often difficult to remove. Make sure your cat is in a very good mood before beginning to work on the knots. Using a wide-toothed comb, work at the edge of the tangle, closest to the end of the hair. Keep picking gently at the tangle with the comb — do not tear at it. It will eventually come out, even if it might take a few sessions to get it out entirely.

 It's the easiest, fastest and most reliable. Some say it's cheating but really it's just that it's not traditional so older blacksmiths frown upon it.


It will not create as fine of an edge as filing BUT it will ensure you do not mess up on what may be a 500-1000 dollar blade. Accusharp is the most commonly used sharpener for swords being that not all sharpeners fit a sword. It's also relatively cheap.
Try polishing the edge with sandpaper after you're done for that extra gleam.

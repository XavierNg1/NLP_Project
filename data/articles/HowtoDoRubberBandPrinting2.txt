 Something around 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) square would be ideal, but you can make it any size you want. Plan ahead, however; you need to be able to wrap the paper around the cardboard.


Use a craft blade to cut the cardboard. If you're a kid, get an adult to help you.
 You can use basic printer paper for this, but watercolor paper would be better. The paper needs to be big enough to cover the cardboard.It's okay if it is a little smaller than the cardboard, however.
 You want the rubber bands to be pinning the paper against the cardboard. Play around with different thicknesses of rubber bands. Place some straight up-and-down, and a few others sideways. You can even place some at angles to make crisscrosses.
 Pour some liquid watercolor paint into a cup or a clean, plastic container. Dilute it with some water.How much water you use is up to you; the more water you add, the lighter the color will be. You can also mix your own by filling a cup with water, then adding a few drops of food coloring into it.


Prepare a few different colors to make your print look more interesting.
You can also use straight tempera or acrylic paint. You don't need to mix those with water.
 Dip the sponge into the paint, then squeeze the excess out. Carefully dab the paint onto the paper. Do not drag it across the paper, or you may get paint under the rubber bands and ruin the resist effect.Make sure that you cover the entire paper, from edge-to-edge.


You can use all one color, or you can use different colors for a tie-dye effect.
If you are using more than one color, be sure to rinse the sponge in water, or switch to a new sponge.
 You can use the same colors and patterns, or you can use a different one.
 Once the paint has dried, pull or cut the rubber bands off. Slip the paper off of the cardboard, and unfold it to reveal your design.You can also cut your paper along the fold to get two designs.

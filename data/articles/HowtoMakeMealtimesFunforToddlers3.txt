 Mealtimes should be a time where each family member can enjoy themselves, even the littlest ones. Stay relaxed and your toddler will be relaxed too.
 Start your toddler out with very small servings so they do not feel overwhelmed and try to keep from berating them into eating just “one more bite”. Fun mealtimes should encourage a lifetime of healthy attitudes about food.
 Do not rush your child. Give him enough time to eat a meal and do not put added pressure on him.
 Eating together is a nice family activity. Be the example for your child. Turn off the TV and enjoy some fun conversation along with your meal.
 Routine is important. The meal should always be at the same time, so eating becomes a habit and the child is always hungry enough to eat when the food is served.
 Invite a friend to join for dinner. The meal may seem more interesting to the child when they have company. Choose a child who loves to eat so that your child has a good example to follow.
 Worrying about neatness during meals may be an additional stress for your child. Expect some mess and accept it, at least until your child is a little older.

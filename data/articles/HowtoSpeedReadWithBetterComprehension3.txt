 When the eyes stop on a word, it’s called fixation, and it lasts approximately 1/4 second per word.Of course, the smaller the words, the less fixation time.If you are currently looking at one word at a time, and can expand your field of fixation, it would improve the speed with which you read.
 The ability to see both margins of text at one time accelerates reading speed. When only the right margin is viewable at the end of a line, the eyes need to return to the left margin on the next line. The parafovea portion of the eye cannot adjust to the next line perfectly. Instead, the peripheral vision misjudges the beginning of the next line, generally landing a word or two to the right. The subsequent adjustment left to the beginning of the line, a fraction of a second process called a saccade, is a disturbance in crucial to speed-reading efficiency., It seems like a simple concept, but the more you read the better you will be at speed reading.The reason for this is your fluency will increase and your vocabulary will expand, decreasing the amount of time spent on difficult words.Your recognition vocabulary – the words you understand immediately without thinking them through or sounding them out – is stored in your brain, and is sub-vocalized quicker than unorthodox words.Some electromagnetic studies have shown that sub-vocalization – the process through which physical mechanisms of speaking occur while reading – takes place no matter how fast someone reads.Try to improve your recognition vocabulary by subscribing to a “word of the day” program or by improving yourself through self-driven vocabulary study.

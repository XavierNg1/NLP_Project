 Having regular visits to a dentist can correct any teeth problems and is highly recommended at least twice a year. If you experience discomfort or pain associated with the overbite, your dentist can provide the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.


It is estimated that overbite affects up to 46% of children and nearly 30% of children would benefit from treatment. Thus, early diagnosis is essential for the treatment of overbite and to prevent any complications., A typical dental exam or checkup will be done by a dental hygienist followed by a consultation with the dentist.During the checkup, the overall condition of your teeth will be noted and the dentist will take a look at your teeth to assess if you have an overbite.
 Your dentist can usually diagnose overbite by just looking at your bite; however, they may also take dental x-rays to visualize your jaw and teeth. This is especially important in children if their permanent teeth have not yet erupted.Dental x-rays help your dentist to diagnose how your child's permanent teeth are positioned and/or see any damage or dental diseases.If the dentist sees any problems in your x-rays, including cavities or decays, treatment options will be discussed.
 If your dentist will confirm that you have an overbite, they will refer you to an orthodontist. An orthodontist is an expert at correcting and realigning the teeth.


Orthodontists have two to three years more education compared with dentists and are trained to treat overbite and other conditions due to misaligned teeth.During your consultation, treatment options to correct the bite will be discussed.
Treating an overbite is essential for your health as it can decrease your chances of tooth decay or gingivitis, and help lessen the strain malocclusion has on the teeth, jaws, and muscles.

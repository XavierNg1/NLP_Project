, Fill one-half to two-thirds full, then top up with water. Leave it to soak for 8 hours if you're agitating it regularly, or for 24 hours if leaving it and only agitating a few times. Or:
Place the compost into a hessian sack. Suspend this sack over a drum of water. Agitate the liquid two to three times on day one then every day or two for a week. It is ready for use after a week of soaking in this manner, or you can hasten the process by stirring it more frequently.
Consider more frequent stirring prior to use. Some gardeners believe that this provides more suspension of the nutrients.In either case, never leave the compost tea brewing for longer than a month., To use the compost tea, decant it into a watering can or a spray bottle/unit. The colour of the compost should be light amber; if it is darker than that, dilute it with water.It can be used safely on all of the garden and is especially useful for plants that have been newly planted or transplanted, sick plants that need a tonic, potted plants during their growth season, lawns, and the vegetable patch.Don't use compost tea in very cold or hot weather conditions. In summer, apply the compost tea in the early morning or afternoon. This is because the plant's stomata are open at these times.It should only be used during the growing season for the plants in question.
Plants such as broadleaf and tree crops have stomata on the underside of their leaves, so you'll need to ensure the entire leaves are covered., If wished, the compost can be resoaked to create more compost tea. You will need to add a little more new, matured compost each time though. When you no longer wish to use the compost that has been soaked, it can serve as mulch or as a soil additive.

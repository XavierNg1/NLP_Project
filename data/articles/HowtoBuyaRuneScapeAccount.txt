, First: Magician, Warrior or Ranger? Pay a lot of attention to the level of the player you are buying, and which items the player comes with.
 It's a good idea to enter in contact with the person selling the account - there will usually be the option to contact the owner of the account either via E-Mail or IM (instant messaging). Then you should get the land-based telephone number of the person, to ensure the person is where said. Talk with the person to get an idea of the responsibility and realness of the seller. It's also a plus that you have the persons number to enter in contact, case anything goes wrong.
 Since you have already chosen to buy an account from a certain seller, then you should be okay with the price, but for your good you can always suggest a little lower price - if the seller says no, just pay the amount you initially knew about. Also, make sure everything listed is included in the price. (Items)

, Pay through a reliable and secure program (PayPal is good), and set a limit of time in which you should receive password and account information for you to log in. Remember to have talked and agreed on everything with the accounts seller before you do this.
 When everything is in place - the payment has been made, and your information has been given to you, you should immediately change the account name and password. If not, you could get either hacked or tricked.

 An unlimited amount of people can play.;

The raptor finishes counting and starts to hunt. If he sees someone, he has to tackle him.

When you tackle someone, they become a Raptor, and help you hunt down everyone else. But, if they prey tackles him, he is back on their team. The original Raptor however will always be a Raptor.
When you tackle someone, they have been "Killed", and they have to stay in that same spot, until one of their teammates comes and touches their hand, or "Brings them back to Life". After that, they can continue playing the game.
 Once the Raptor has everyone on his team, or everyone has been killed, the game is over.
 If you want to play again, then the last person who was captured or killed is the new Raptor, and the game starts all over.

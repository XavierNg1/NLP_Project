 You will need space, supplies, a method of communicating so that everyone can hear, good lighting, comfortable room, etc.;
, Make a lesson plan of sorts... what will you say? What order will you present it in? How will you make your presentation interesting and easy to remember?

, This will allow you to get a handle on how many people to plan for and how much you will need in the way of supplies and elbow room. This also gives you contact information for each participant so you will be able to follow up later if you want.
 If you have a large number of potential participants and space is at a premium, you could do several smaller classes instead of one larger one. On the other hand, if you have a large room, you may need some sort of public address system so that everyone can hear.
 Nothing is so small that it does not matter. Things like pins, needles, measuring tape etc. can make or break the class.
 Too few tables for too many people leads to frustration for both you and your students.
 The more thinking you do in advance, the less apologizing you will do during and after the class.
 If the group is over 5 people, you'll need assistants who can help each participant individually with their projects.

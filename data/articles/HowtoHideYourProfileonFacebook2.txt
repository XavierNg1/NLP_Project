 You can deactivate your account through the mobile app. Your profile will be hidden and your account deactivated until you log in again.
 You'll find this in the upper-right corner (Android), or in the lower-right corner (iOS).
 This will open the Settings menu for your account.
 This will display your account security settings.
 This will start the deactivation process.
 You'll be prompted to enter your password before you can proceed.
 Scroll through the form to find the "Deactivate" button at the bottom of the screen. You can choose to let Facebook know why you're deactivating your account, but this is optional.
 You'll be able to restore your account at any time by logging in with your email and password.

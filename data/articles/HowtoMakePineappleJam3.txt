 If you plan on canning and keeping the pineapple jam for a long time, you will have to make an environment that will allow the jam to keep. Sterilize Bottles and Jars for Canning to ensure that the jam won’t spoil after a couple months.Make sure to use the canning jars that have the rings and the screw-on top. These jars provide an airtight seal and are optimal for canning.
If you plan to eat the jam within the next few weeks, you don’t have to bother with the canning process: you can simply pour the jam into a jar and keep it refrigerated.
 After you have finished making the jam and sterilizing the jars, pour the jam immediately into the sterilized jars. You can use a funnel or measuring cup to transfer the jam from the pot to the jar if you are worried about spilling.Don’t fill up the jars completely. Leave about a ¼ inch (0.6 cm) of space at the top.
 Because jam is sticky, it can make jars extremely hard to open if it gets stuck on the rim. Before you close the jars, use a clean towel to wipe the rims and remove any excess jam., Place the jars in a large pot of water on the stove. Make sure that the jars are completely covered in water, with at least 2 inches of water above the tops of each jar. Boil them for five minutes, then remove the jars using a pair of tongs.You should see a small indent at the top of the jars after you take them out of the bath. This means that they are sealed and won’t spoil for about 18 months!
Again, you can skip this step if you plan on eating the jam within the next month or so.
 Let the jars cool on the counter until they reach room temperature. Then store them either on the shelf or in your refrigerator. If you went through the sterilization and canning process, the jam is usually best eaten after two weeks, as it can be a bit runny if eaten in the days following canning.,

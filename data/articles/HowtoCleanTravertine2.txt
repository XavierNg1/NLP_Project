 Acidic liquids, hot pans, and wet glasses can damage your travertine countertops. The best way to combat damage is to prevent it. Use hot pads, placemats, and coasters on your kitchen countertops. In your bathroom, place all of your beauty and health products on a vanity tray instead of directly on the counter., Travertine is a porous stone that absorbs liquids. When accidents happen, blot up the spill right away. Wiping up the spill will only cause the item to spread, increasing the area susceptible to a permanent stain.


Once a year, seal your countertops. This layer of protection will prevent stains from setting., Sanitize and wipe down your travertine countertops on a regular basis with hot water, gentle cleaners, and a microfiber rag.


Spray the surface with a gentle cleaner that is safe on natural stone.
Wipe up the cleaner with a fresh microfiber rag.
Polish the surface with a new microfiber cloth.

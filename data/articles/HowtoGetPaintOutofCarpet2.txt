 These paints aren’t as tenacious or oily as other types. You should be able to absorb the majority of the spill with a towel. Make sure to use a towel you’re prepared to throw away, as it might stain. Be careful not to scrub the stain, as this could drive it deeper into the carpet fibers., Mix a tablespoon (15ml) of dishwashing detergent with a cup (237ml) of lukewarm water. Add this solution to a white rag; colored rags might stain the carpet. Blot the spill, starting from the outside of the stain and working towards the center.Clean gently, to avoid driving the paint deeper into the carpet.
 After blotting the spill, vacuum up the dislodged paint and dishwasher detergent solution. This will prevent the liquid from creating mold and mildew in your carpet. Use a wet vacuum, as these are specifically designed to clean up liquids.
 You might not get all of the paint out on the first try, so try this method until you clean up the stain.

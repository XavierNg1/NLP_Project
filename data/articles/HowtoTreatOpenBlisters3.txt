 Blisters commonly form on feet, often due to poorly-fitting shoes. Shoes that are either too big or too small for your feet can apply pressure and friction to areas of your skin and cause blisters.Buy shoes in the middle of the day, when your feet have swollen a little bit but not as much as at the end of the day.
Ask a salesperson to help you determine your proper shoe size.
 Blisters often form when your skin stays in contact with moisture. Avoid foot blisters by keeping your feet dry. Wear moisture-wicking socks when you're going to sweat. Change your socks and shoes when they get wet.You can also dust the inside of your socks with talcum powder to absorb moisture.
 If you know an area of your skin is likely to rub on something - your shoe, a piece of sporting equipment, etc. - apply a layer of moleskin over the area. This can help prevent the friction that causes blisters. If you have a mild blister, it can also keep the area protected enough to prevent the blister from popping or tearing., If you already have a blister, stop doing whatever caused it. Wear a different pair of shoes, for instance. Avoid doing the activity that irritated your skin - continuing to do so could make your blister worse or cause it to pop. You can resume the activity when your blister heals., Hands are another common area for blisters. Protect your hands with gloves if you're playing a sport, gardening, using tools, or doing something repetitive with your hands. Your gloves should fit snugly but not be constricting.

Rowers often get hand blisters, and should use gloves or a soft wrap to protect their skin.

 The most important tool in creating a positive classroom atmosphere is for the teacher to be a positive role model. Being positive doesn’t mean being happy all of the time. Rather, being positive means approaching every issue with a positive, constructive attitude.There are little ways to be positive, such as smiling in the morning when your students arrive.
You should also be positive when difficult issues arise. For example, if a scary news story comes up in class, talk about things the students can do to help. Or discuss how it’s okay to be sad and no one should be looked down upon for expressing their emotions in a healthy way.;
, Your students will mimic the behavior that you display. If you react with anger when a student misbehaves, your students will think this is the right way to respond to frustration and they will do the same. On the other hand, if you display self-control in the face of frustration, your students will do the same.Important positive social skills include empathy, tolerance, patience, and effective communication.
As an example of good communication and patience, if a student is disrupting the class, don’t ignore the student and then suddenly lash out with anger. Instead, calmly ask the student to respect the class’s time. If the student continues to be disruptive, tell them that you need to send them to the office and you’ll be down later so the two of you can discuss the problem.
You can also praise students when they display good social skills and point out their behavior as a model for the rest of the class.
 Integrate role models from the community into your classroom. The more role models from different walks of life your students see, the more they will feel that a good attitude can apply to any situation.For example, bring in a policewoman or fireman from the community and have them discuss how they approach the difficult aspects of their jobs with a positive attitude.

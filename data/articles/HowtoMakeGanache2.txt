 Making basic ganache is a piece of cake. Getting the ganache so that it's perfectly suited for its partner in crime in another story. Here are some proportions that you can use as a guideline when making ganache.








For glazes, particularly hard glazes — 3 parts chocolate to 1 part heavy cream, along with a tablespoon or more of corn syrup
For truffles — 2 parts chocolate to 1 part heavy cream
For cake filling — equal parts chocolate and heavy cream
For soft icing — 1 part chocolate to 2 parts heavy cream

, Take your basic chocolate ganache and set it in the refrigerator so that it's just a tad cool before whipping. Pour the ganache into a metal or ceramic bowl and then beat with an electric whipper, just as you would make whipped cream out of heavy cream.
 Let the ganache cool completely and thicken up some. When you can spoon your ganache into a piping back and it holds its form, its ready for action.

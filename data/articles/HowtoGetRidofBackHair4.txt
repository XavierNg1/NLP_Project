 Everything you need to do to shave with a back shaver is the same as if you were working with a normal razor and an assistant. In other words:


Exfoliate with water and a gentle abrasive or brush to reduce the risk of ingrown hairs.
Clean and dry your back if you are using an electric razor.
Wet your back and apply shaving cream/gel if you are using a standard razor.
 While a back shaver will allow you to reach your whole back, you'll still probably miss spots if you can't see what you're doing. Find a bathroom that has a large mirror. Grab a smaller mirror and face away from it.
 With one hand, hold the shaver. With the other hand, angle a smaller mirror in front of you. Adjust it so that you can see your back in mirror behind you with the reflection from the small mirror in your hand.
 Fully extend the arm of the back shaver. Lift your arm up over your head with your elbow bent and position the shaver in the center of your back. Use gentle, controlled motions to shave the hair on your back in rows from your mid-back up to your shoulders.
 Bend the shaver at an angle (if your shaver has this option). Angle your arm to reach your lower back hair from the side. You'll probably need to adjust the mirror so you can see what you're doing.
 Since it's hard to look at your entire back at once with the two-mirror setup, take a few minutes to look at each spot individually. If you see any leftover hair, shave it as normal.


After you're done, take a quick shower to wash off stray hair. Pat dry with a towel and, if desired, apply a gentle unscented lotion to keep the skin soft and smooth.

 Your primary care physician can evaluate the extent of your injury. They can provide treatment and relief for minor strains, and if it is more serious, they can refer you to an orthopedic doctor. If needed, you may even receive a prescription for anti-inflammatory medication., These doctors specialize in the skeletal muscular system and will be able to make a sound judgement about how to best treat a ligament injury. They’ll question you about the cause of your injury, symptoms, and then advise you about the most appropriate treatment.A specialist (like a rheumatologist or orthopedic doctor) might recommend surgery or some other course of action.
 Depending on the severity of your injury, you’ll want to consult a personal trainer about steps you can take to promote ligament healing. Ultimately, a personal trainer will likely recommend that you limit stress to the damaged limb while working out muscles that surround the damaged ligament.Ask your doctor if they can recommend a personal trainer.
 There are several diagnostics that will provide your doctor with information about the severity of your ligament damage. Without running these diagnostics, your doctor might not be certain as to its extent and whether damage impacts other ligaments, tendons, or bones.


Your doctor will likely start with an X-ray. Although an X-ray won’t detect ligament damage, it will let the doctor know if there is a broken or fractured bone involved.
After an X-ray, your doctor will likely prescribe an MRI. An MRI will create a picture of your skeletal-muscular system – including ligament damage.

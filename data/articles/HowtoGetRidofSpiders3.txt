 Make sure it's not easy for spiders to wander into your home. Keep the windows and doors closed and take the following measures to keep unwanted creatures out:

Use caulk to seal up cracks and holes inside and outside your home.






Make sure your windows are screened, and check the screens occasionally to be sure they don't have holes.
Screen other points of entry such as vents, the chimney, and gutters.
 Some species of spiders build their webs in tall grasses and other plants, so if you have a spider problem, you might want to remove landscaping that's close to your house. Cut the grass often, and compost yard clippings in the back of your yard.
 Many types of spiders like to live in wood piles, so having one stacked against your home is almost guaranteed to draw spiders inside. Store your wood in a shed located away from your home.

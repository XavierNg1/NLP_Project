 Although your child may have their first crush, and while they might have told all of their friends about it, they may be unsure exactly how to tell their crush how they feel. You can help them by letting them know its okay if they don’t want to tell their crush. You can also help by giving them a few suggestions for how to talk to their crush.

You might tell your kindergartener with a crush on her older sibling’s friend, “It’s okay for you to have a crush on Sam and keep it a secret. Sometimes that’s how crushes are.”
Or, you might say, “When you tell your crush you like them, remember that you’re being brave by telling them.”

, Because this is a first crush, your child might not know exactly what to expect or do. Take the time to think about what types of interactions and relationships you’re okay with you child having. Then talk with your child about what crushes and relationships should look like for someone their age.You might start by explaining that their feelings are normal. You could say something like, “It’s okay for you to have these feelings and to want to be around your crush.”
You might also say, “At your age, I’m okay with you sitting next to your crush, holding their hand, and talking on the phone.”

, Although developing a crush is a normal occurrence for children, there should be guidelines and limits set on appropriate interactions between kids. Explain to your child what types of displays of affection are only for older kids, as well as what kinds are only okay for adults.For instance, you could explain to your preschooler, “Its okay for you to hold hands and sit by each other, but you aren’t allowed to kiss.”
Or, with a preteen, you might say, “You aren’t old enough yet to cuddle or kiss.”

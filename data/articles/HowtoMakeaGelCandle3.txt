 There are several density grades to choose from:


Low density gel is made with 1 lb mineral oil and .9 oz resin. It allows for a light fragrance and only holds small, light objects.
Medium density gel is made with 1 lb mineral oil and 1.1 oz resin. It allows for a decent amount of fragrance and will hold all but heavy objects.
High density gel is made with 1 lb mineral oil and 1.25 oz resin. It allows plenty of fragrance and holds even heavy objects.
Stand alone density gel is made with 1 lb mineral oil and 1.4 oz resin. It does not require a container, but does need a stand. It holds the most fragrance of all and has no trouble with the heaviest of embeds.
 Mix your combination of mineral oil and resin and let sit for an hour. After this time is up, heat gradually to 220 F (104 C). It should take about 2 hours for the gel wax to form and then liquify. Let cool, pour into a container, let harden and store for later use.

 Clamp the can to a table or other solid platform and drill holes slightly larger in diameter than the steel wire you will use where you made your marks.
 On the free end, bend about one half inch at a 90 degree angle so the wire doesn't pull back out. On the end attached to the spool, cut it about 3 inches (7.6Â cm) and bend the same direction at a 90 degree angle as the other side. The bent steel wire ends must be pretty close to parallel with the damper inside to allow better control when operating the fireplace.
 This will be the damper plate. Drop it in the bottom of the can with the steel wire. Using the rectangular cutout from Firebox Assembly Step 2 as a support, maneuver the damper plate until it is held up against the steel wire from beneath. The long dimension on the damper plate should be parallel to the steel wire (small adjustments can be made in the next step). The bent steel wire ends must be pretty close to parallel with the damper inside to allow better control when operating the fireplace.
 Using a toothpick as a spreader, generously apply it so that it covers the steel wire and sticks to the can bottom piece. Now is the time to make sure the can bottom piece is aligned parallel to the steel wire. Leave the epoxy to cure overnight or for at least six hours.
 Test the damper by moving the longer side of the steel wire with your finger. If it snags, wiggle the it a bit to get it moving. If it swings freely, proceed to the next step. If it catches a lot, check inside to see where it catches; you may need to bend that area to get a smoother fit.
 Make a small mark at the junction to allow you to easily align it again.
 Place the damper segment back on the firebox segment and align it using your mark. Use a toothpick to spread the silicone sealant to fill any gaps.

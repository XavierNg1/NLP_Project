 Do not say anything to egg them on (including threats, racist words, or sarcastic comments). This could escalate the fight, and your goal is to end the fight altogether. If their friends are there, they could end up using your words against you. Or, if the fight persists, the opponent could end up winning and then those words would come back to haunt you., If their friends or allies join the fight and you are outnumbered, try to run and defend yourself while sprinting off. Keep careful watch on the body language of everyone there, so that you can be ready to react with fast reflexes. Dodge any objects that they may try to throw at you. Call for help if needed., Certain people are just plain cruel, and avoiding them altogether could be the best plan. Steer clear of areas where a bully usually hangs out, and instead find a new route to get where you need to go. You are not cowardly for wanting to avoid confrontation and maintain peace in your life., Do not get carried away in the fight, and never try to cause permanent physical harm to another person. Do not aim for their face, for instance. Do not use objects to fight; simply use your hands to defend yourself. Once you have protected yourself from harm, retreat from the fight.You can certainly use objects as a shield, such as holding up a book to block blows. However, you will lose the respect of your peers if you use such objects against your opponent and the odds become uneven and unfair.

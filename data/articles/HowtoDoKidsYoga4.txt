 Kids might not feel motivated by a serious and highly controlled yoga session. They will be more likely to enjoy it if the session is fun. Otherwise, they might get bored and lose interest. There are lots of different ways to make yoga fun for kids.Tell kids the names of different yoga postures. These are often animals or elements of nature. Children may enjoy doing poses based on the interesting names.
Try to invent different stories to go along with the actions. For example: Tell a story about a dog, using the “Downward Dog” posture as a focal point. Make believe you are the sun waking up in the morning for the “Sun Salutation” posture.
Talk about how silly and fun some of the yoga movements are. By using funny noises or words, you can make the motions more fun.
 If you push your kids too hard, they may not see yoga as fun. Try to be patient and keep yoga sessions short. Make sure that your lesson is suited to your kids’ individual needs. For example, if you know that your child has a short attention span, then try doing one or two yoga poses at a time throughout the course of the day.


Encourage kids in their posture and don’t scold them for not doing a pose the right way. Just keep encouraging your kids and modeling good posture for them.
Try to keep position holds on the shorter end. This will keep kids from getting bored., Everyone needs support, especially kids. When you praise your kids’ efforts, you will motivate them to keep doing yoga. Kids like to hear that their teachers approve, so make sure to let them know they're doing a good job.Try saying something like, “You are so flexible!” Or, “Your downward dog pose is fantastic!”

 Fever is often one symptom of a sinus blockage, which causes headache.
 Green discharge often indicates infection.
 Radiographs are the only way to diagnose a true sinus headache, which is a blockage of sinus passages.
 Avoid these drugs until you have a sinus headache diagnosis. Other headache types may become aggravated by these medications.

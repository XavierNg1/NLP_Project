 This means asking employees to think on their feet. Meetings should possess an element of prompt responses; encourage employees to share ideas off the top of their heads in a fast rotation when discussing possibilities for a project. Promote the thought that every idea is welcome.These ideas should be documented, and then analyzed to see if they could actually be practical and effective. The focus should be on which idea most effectively solves the problem, rather than which idea is good or bad.;
, While coming up with ideas is great, coming up with ways to implement those ideas is better. Encourage employees to not only come up with ideas, but also to link those ideas to action agendas.You could have the action ideas be a group effort; when someone comes up with a good idea, you can designate a team to come up with how that idea could be put into effect.
 Using humor and fun in your creativity sessions can make exercises more engaging. Encourage people to be a little silly, but to also stay on track.Laughter can promote the production of dopamine and endorphins, both of which can help to keep your meeting low on tension but high in morale.
 Employees are more likely to participate if they are to be rewarded. To awaken the real creativity, the most workable ideas should be rewarded through incentives that could be as simple as a weekend getaway, or a bonus for the rendered contribution.


When employees receive appreciation for creativity and successful contributions, they will most likely be more quick to contribute in the future.
 Open up the floor for ideas from employees in all different departments. Sometimes having a different background can lead to ideas that others might not have thought of.


Encourage employees to chat with one another and seek help from other employees who are in different departments. Promote department mingling by setting up casual dinners or whole office outings.

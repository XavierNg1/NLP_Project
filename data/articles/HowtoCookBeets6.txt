 Steaming beets is a great way to cook them while allowing them to retain their flavor.,, Arrange the beets in a single layer so that they are evenly cooked. Cover the steamer once you've placed the beets in it.
 If you peel and quarter your beets in advance, then you can cook them in half the time.
 Then, quickly place them in cold water and remove the skins with a paper towel or a damp cloth.
 Enjoy these beets as they are or slice them, quarter them, or add some olive oil and salt and pepper to them to give them a richer flavor.

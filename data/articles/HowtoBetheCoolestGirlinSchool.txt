 In 10 years it won't matter what stores you shopped at, what makeup you wore, and so on. Be kind to the people around you, have a sense of humor and radiate confidence and beauty. Appearance matters but it is not everything. If you are charming, kind and energetic people will want to be with you no matter what. "A rich man never knows who his true friends are." Same applies in this case. If clothing defines you, you are plastic.;
, This can be your starting point.
 Make sure you have a rather fashionable bag or coat, or both if you like. But you don't need to spend loads of money or people may just think your too rich and snobby, don't overdo it. If you think your bag is old, customize it by adding a few key rings. Vera Bradley bags or Miss Me jeans are good for that cool girl style!

, Straight hair is in but you don't have to get up at 5am every morning, as most people don't have time. Just try out a cute hairstyle that all the girls will want to copy!

, Only talk about things that are relevant in a conversation. Basically, if your friends are talking about shopping, don't come out with a random story of how you got soaked on you way to school, or you fell down the stairs. Practice a cool walk until you know it by heart. And, if people are calling you a loser, speak up a bit more and have CONFIDENCE talking to people!

,, Try new perfumes to pick which one fits your style!

, If you THINK sexy. Others will to. Be confident.
 It is important to let others have their say. This will make people want to talk to you, and you will have more friends. You must be good at keeping secrets!

 If so, people will want to be with you, and that makes you more popular!

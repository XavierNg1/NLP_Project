 Open the pair of scissors as wide as they can go, and position the blades around the sides of the mason jar.


The jar should be as far as it can go between the two blades. Hold the jar with one hand, and the scissors with the other hand.
 Squeeze the scissors closed, and slide the mason jar out from between the blades as the scissors close.This is the same way you would close the scissors if you were cutting paper or fabric. Use light pressure to close the scissors, let the glass do the sharpening work for you.









Repeat this process until the blades have a smooth, clean edge.
Be sure to use a mason jar that you donâ€™t mind damaging, because the blades of the scissors might leave scratch marks on the jar.
 Using a damp paper towel, wipe down the blades of the scissors to clear off any microscopic glass pieces that may have gathered on the blades while you were cutting the mason jar.

 IRC channel names start with a #, and Freenode's policy dictates that "off topic" channels should start with ##; e.g. ##mychannel.;
,


Use the /join ##mychannel command.
If the channel was empty, it will be created and you will automatically become a "channel operator" (sometimes "chanop" or "op"). Ops are allowed to manage the channel â€“ for example, to ban abusers.
If the network doesn't give you op rights, it means the channel is already registered by somebody else.
 This makes sure nobody else can take over the channel.


/msg ChanServ register ##mychannel

/msg ChanServ op ##mychannel

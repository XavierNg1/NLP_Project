 You'll need to click and drag your mouse cursor over the text, releasing the button only when you've highlighted your preferred section.


To select all text in a document, hold down the Ctrl key and tap A.
 This is the button with a vertical arrow pointing both up and down; you can find it in the "Paragraph" section of the Home tab., Your highlighted text should now be double-spaced!

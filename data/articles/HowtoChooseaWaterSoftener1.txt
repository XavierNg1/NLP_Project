 If you are looking for a full-home solution, take the size of your family and property into account. For instance, if you have a family of three people or less, and have only one or two bathrooms in your home, a small to midsize water softener will be adequate. If you're a family of four or more people, and you have more than three bathrooms, you will need a mid to large sized softener., Contact your local municipal representative for information about water softening measures. Some municipalities do not allow the use of water softening systems because of their use of salt and resins. Before deciding on a water softener, find out what your restrictions are and consider alternatives if needed., Think about whether or not you intend to sell your home in the foreseeable future before choosing a water softener. If you have hard water, a whole-home water softening system can go a long way to making your house more attractive in the real estate market. Take into account the hassle and cost of replacing or repairing household parts and appliances damaged by hard water (e.g. pipes, water heater).

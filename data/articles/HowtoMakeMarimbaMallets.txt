 Ensure they are cut to the exact same size.;
,, Take it out, put a few drops of wood glue in the hole, and push the dowel back in. You can put a little more glue around the base of the ball knob to secure it.
 (For extra rebound and a bigger mallet. Not extremely necessary)

, Leave about 3 inches of extra yarn for stitching the bottom.
 (By OVER, Imagine the mallet core as a globe with the north pole at the top and the south pole where the mallet shaft is inserted. Outline a "Prime Meridian" of the "globe" with the yarn. NOT the equator.)

, (Looking at the mallet from the top there should be an X)

, This X should be a 45 degree turn compared the first X. Now from above it should like 4 lines intersecting at the middle. Kind of like a pizza pie with 8 slices.
 Start wrapping OVER the mallet slightly off-center. When coming over hook the yarn tightly around the nipple, NOT directly on top of it.
 (Remember not directly over the intersection of the first 4 wraps that made the "pizza looking pattern" or "overlapping X's pattern") You can wrap anywhere from 100-275 wraps. The hardness of the mallet depends on the type of yarn, the core, and the amount of wraps. Try it occasionally to see if its the sound you want. Be careful though because it might unravel.
 Leave about 3 inches of slack and cut the yarn. Thread the end of the yarn into the needle.
 (To do this think of a donut. Imagine wrapping a donut with yarn. Through the middle, pull from the bottom, and do it again.) Using this technique might fill the hole if using a thick enough yarn.
 Right when there is no more slack cut the yarn and any remaining slack should be tucked in the hole at the top and can be glued tight.
 If the mallet ever loosens from the bottom, restitch it quickly. If the clove hitch shows and the slack gets too long, the mallet might unravel.
 Wrap the yarn the same amount of times to get the closest sound possible.

 Open the map and scroll down to the entry store and create a waypoint. Make your way over there., Enter the building without having your weapon out. Go to the counter and draw a (semi-auto) pistol (not the AP pistol for example)., Intimidate the cashier by shooting around him. If a single bullet hits him, he will run away from the register into the back room and come back out with a pistol - he will kill you if you don't kill him first! Anyways, as soon as the cashier emptied the register, take out a shotgun and kill the cashier., Get out of the store, get the nearest car and travel to a Safehouse - being wanted on level 2 is no fun.

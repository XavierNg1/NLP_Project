 Hold a treat on the wheel to get your treat-driven cat to climb onto it. If necessary, gently place the cat onto the wheel. Give your cat a small treat as soon as it’s on the wheel, then repeat the sequence for 15 to 20 minutes.Once it's on the wheel, gradually hold a treat further away from your cat to teach it to move forward. Start hold a treat at a quarter of the wheel’s height, then work your way up to a third of its height. Slowly increase the height at which you hold the treat until you can get past half of the wheel’s height.Break up treats into tiny pieces so you can reward your cat without overfeeding it.
Consider wearing a glove to avoid getting scratched when your cat goes after the treat.
 If your cat ignores treats but responds to toys, a wand toy will give you the most control when you train it. Start by shaking the wand on the ground around the wheel to get your cat’s attention. Then move the toy onto the wheel to get your cat to climb onto it.Move the toy on and off of the wheel for 15 to 20 minutes to get your cat comfortable enough to get onto it.
Once it's comfortable with getting on the wheel, shake the toy forward so the cat has to spin the wheel to pounce on the toy., If you have difficulty holding your cat’s attention with the feather wand, try using a laser pointer. You can either use it in place of or in combination with the wand to keep your cat engaged.Experiment with different toys to identify the ones that most effectively lure your cat.
Like wand toys, a laser pointer will allow you to direct your cat where you want it to go.
 Catnip stimulates some cats and makes others mellow. If it makes your cat hyperactive, sprinkle some dried catnip on the wheel to encourage your cat to run on it. You can also hold a catnip-laced toy just out of your cat’s reach so it runs on the wheel and tries to get the toy.

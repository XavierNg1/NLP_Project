 Social networking sites are the best, try Buzznet, Facebook, Myspace, and Bebo. Nothing childish. Glogster is also a good new one. Add everyone! You need to have at least 300 friends before even being close to Internet stardom.;
, Whatever look you choose it needs to be original! If you have heavy makeup try purple stripes in your hair. Or maybe even blonde hair with blue mascara. Make it different and make it you!

, NEVER use something overdone like "____ Hardcore" or "____ Suicide" Try something creative! Ask people to give you words that describe you and start with the letter of your first name. You can even change your first name to your liking! Even try asking Internet celebs through buzznet like dropping Hannabeth or Sam Skeleton a note.
 Don't be too emo you hate the world, but don't be all happy happy. You need to have the perfect mix.

 Move the oven rack to the bottom of the oven. Have a window open or turn a fan on to ensure adequate ventilation.;
, Choose a bowl that is a little smaller than the record, and set it right-side-up onto a baking sheet. To further protect your baking sheet, line it with aluminum foil or parchment paper.


Make sure that you are happy with the size of the bowl. The record bowl will end up roughly the same size.
 Make sure that the record is centered and that the label is facing upward. If your record has a label on each side, make sure that the side you like the best is facing up.If the record is dirty, clean it first.
 Again, make sure that the can is centered. The can will weigh the record down as it heats up, and help it conform to the shape of the bowl.If you don't have a can, fill a cloth bag with dried beans or rice, and use that instead.
 Place the baking sheet into the oven and let it bake. After about 3 to 5 minutes, the vinyl will start to soften and warp. Do not bake it longer than 10 minutes.Adjust the shape while the record is in the oven. Use a metal spatula to poke and prod it., Use a pair of oven mits to take the entire baking sheet out of the oven. Set it down onto a heat-safe surface, and let the record cool down. This should only take about 10 to 15 minutes.
 The record will now have a bowl-like shaped with ruffled sides. You can use it to store non-food items, like as jewelry, ornaments, or even remote controls.

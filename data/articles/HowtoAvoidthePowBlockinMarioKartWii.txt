Count the number of POW Block strikes to three. Wheelie up by flicking your Wii Remote upward (Wii Nunchuk w/Wii Remote) or your Wii Wheel or by pressing Up arrow button (GameCube or Wii Classic controller). A blue force field protects you, so you will spin only once, but you will not slow down. However, you will lose your items, so be sure to use them before the POW block disappears.
Hop many times if you are using a kart. You won't lose items that you carry. This only works if you set your drift mode to manual.
Use the Mega Mushroom, Star, or Bullet Bill.
Go on a ramp/jump and into the air if you see the POW block. With this method you retain all your items.
Go into the cannon in DK Summit/Snowboard Cross, Maple Treeway or DK Mountain, go on the ramp over the river on DK Jungle Parkway, or go into the Launch Star in Rainbow Road.;

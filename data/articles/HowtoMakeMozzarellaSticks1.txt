, For each of these ingredients, use bowls with wide openings to make dipping easier.


Whisk the egg in a small bowl.
Mix the breadcrumbs, panko crumbs, Parmesan cheese and dried parsley together in another bowl.
Tip the flour into yet another bowl.
 In the following steps, you'll be dipping the sticks into each of the coatings. Before dipping, line a cookie or baking sheet with parchment paper for placing the sticks on.
 Ensure that each stick is evenly coated in flour.
, Again, ensure each stick is well coated. Lay each stick on the cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
 Leave until frozen solid. If you skip this step, the sticks will fall apart when baked.
, Check that the sticks aren't touching, then place into the oven to bake. Bake for 5 minutes, then check for crispness. Turn them over with a pair of tongs to crisp for another 4-5 minutes on the other side.
 Don't leave them unwatched or in the oven too long, as they'll melt into blobs. They're now ready to serve.


Serve with suitable dipping sauce, such as sweet chili sauce, pizza sauce or tomato ketchup.
For a party, arrange in a circle around a plate, placing the dip in the middle. Serve as soon as baked, for best taste.

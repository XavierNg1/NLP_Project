 Stir it up into an even consistency.


If vanilla ice cream isn't your thing, add fruit or chocolate sauce to your creamy concoction.
You may do this in a bowl, but why dirty a dish when you don't have to?
Make sure the sugar is dissolved!;
, Squeeze out any extra air, too. Too much air in the bag may force it open upon shaking.


If you're concerned about leaking, double-bag your ice cream mixture. Leaks are less likely to occur but it may take a bit longer for the ice cream to adequately freeze.
 It should be about half full.


Coarse, Kosher, and rock salt works best, but table salt will do. However, know that you may see shabbier results with smaller granules.
Place the sealed pint-sized bag into the salt and ice mixture. The salt and ice will freeze the creamy mixture, not become a part of it.
Squeeze out any extra air in the larger bag and seal it tightly, too.
 If gloves aren't handy, use a towel. Your hands will appreciate the barrier between them and the extreme cold.


Shake for 5-10 minutes. After this period, check the consistency of your ice cream to see if it's ready.
 After adequate shaking, take out the ice cream mixture before unsealing. You don't want any ice or salt in your ice cream!


Grab a spoon a dig in! Your ice cream is ready.
Or cut the tip of the bag and squeeze out the ice cream into a dish.

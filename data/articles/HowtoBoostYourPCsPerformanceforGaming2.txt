 The more programs you have on your computer, the slower it will run. By deleting unnecessary programs, you can easily improve the efficiency of your device., Navigate to the "Uninstall Programs section. In windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, these settings are all in different places. You may have to search for the option if you don't see it immediately.
 This will allow you to filter through your programs and find the ones you have not used in a while.
 When you find a program that you no longer want, click Uninstall. (Be careful, if you don't know what something is, look it up first, often times some applications are necessary to run games.)

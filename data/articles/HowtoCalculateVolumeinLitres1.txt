 If the dimensions are given in meters, inches, feet, or some other unit of measurement, convert each dimension to centimeters (cm) before calculating the volume. This will make it easier to convert to liters. Consider the following conversions:

1 meter = 100 centimeters.So, if the length of a cube is 2.5 meters, that converts to 2,500 centimeters, since 2.5×100=2,500{\displaystyle 2.5\times 100=2,500}.

1 inch = 2.54 centimeters.So, if the length of a cube is 5 inches, that converts to 12.7 centimeters, since 5×2.54=12.7{\displaystyle 5\times 2.54=12.7}.

1 foot = 30.48 centimeters.So, if the length of a cube is 3 feet, that converts to 91.44 centimeters, since 3×30.48=91.44{\displaystyle 3\times 30.48=91.44}.

, How you find the volume will depend on the shape of the three-dimensional object you are measuring, since the volume of each type of shape is calculated differently. To find the volume of a cube, you can use the formula Volume=Length×Width×Height{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\text{Length}}\times {\text{Width}}\times {\text{Height}}}.The volume of a three-dimensional shape will be in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm3{\displaystyle cm^{3}}).

For example, if a fish tank is 40.64 cm long, 25.4 cm wide, and 20.32 tall you would calculate the volume by multiplying these dimensions together:Volume=Length×Width×Height{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\text{Length}}\times {\text{Width}}\times {\text{Height}}}Volume=40.64×25.4×20.32{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=40.64\times 25.4\times 20.32}Volume=20,975cm3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=20,975cm^{3}}


, To do this, use the conversion rate 1liter=1,000cm3{\displaystyle 1\;{\text{liter}}=1,000cm^{3}}. Dividing the volume (in cubic centimeters) of the shape by 1,000 will give you the volume in liters (L).For example, if the volume of the fish tank, in cubic centimeters, is 20,975, to find the volume in liters, calculate 20,975÷1,000=20.975{\displaystyle 20,975\div 1,000=20.975}. So, a fish tank that is 40.64 cm long, 25.4 cm wide, and 20.32 tall has a volume of 20.975 L.

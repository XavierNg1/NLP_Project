 Draw a horizontal line for the horizon with a hard pencil. The horizon lines determines how far the viewer can see based on the terrain and the distance of the viewer from the ground.
 This is what will determine the effect of the perspective. As a reference, the most basic vanishing point would be located in the center of the paper horizontally and over the horizon line. If you set the vanishing point to the right, the drawing will look as if the point of view is moved to the left of the objects. The vanishing point for some objects can also be above or below the horizon lines depending on the inclination of the planes in respect to the ground.



Take care to draw all the horizontal and vertical lines perfectly horizontal and vertical.
The lines that start near the point of view and get farther should be drawn extending towards the selected vanishing point. This will give the perspective effect.

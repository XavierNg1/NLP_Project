 Since mixing two primary colors and then the third will give you brown, mixing will also give you a similar result, but this process will not be as neat since you will not have as much control over the secondary color. Mix them in different proportions just for fun and see what proportion creates the brown color that you want.









The more yellow you use, the lighter the shade of brown will be; the more red and blue you use, the darker it will be.
 Mixing all the shades of brown you have created will make other shades of brown. You can use just the browns you created from one separate method (mixing orange and blue, for example). Mix and match the different browns from different methods and see how the colors turn out.

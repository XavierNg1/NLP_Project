 In addition to preventing your leader from casting on overhead branches or otherwise snapping, casting sidearm will permit the bubble to lead the fly during the cast (much like weighted lines lead the leader in fly casting) and let the fly land naturally.
 Submerged flies should be let fall to a depth of 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 m) before you begin your retrieve.


You can test the rate of fall by dropping the fly and bubble in the water and note how long it takes to fall to a particular depth. When you cast the fly, you can count down to this same depth before starting your retrieve.
 Flies fished on or near the surface should be presented as though they're drifting with the current toward shore, with occasional twitches to mimic struggling. Submerged flies should be fished with a stop-and-go action or with slow pulls to simulate a swimming minnow or crustacean. Your bubble should cause a slight wake in calm water to provide sufficient resistance to the line to help you distinguish between when a fish hits the fly and when the fly hits something else.
 As with the more familiar, colored, clip-on bobbers, if the bubble suddenly dips or bobs sharply, a fish has taken the fly.
 This will help drive the hook home. If you fail to set the hook, return to the same slow retrieve you were using. The fish may think it only injured the fly and want to move in for the kill.

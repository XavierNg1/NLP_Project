 If you use your broom to sweep up something particularly dirty or gross, clean it right away. Otherwise you should clean your broom heads about four times a year., This is especially important if you often use your brooms to clean up wet messes. It's okay to store your brooms in a closet, as long as it's one that's used often. Opening and closing the door will allow air in.
 You should store your brooms by hanging them. Many home improvement stores carry easy-to-install broom racks that attach to walls or the inside of doors. Storing your brooms by hanging them prevents dirt or water from getting on the broom head while it's not in use.

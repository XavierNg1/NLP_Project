 Video interlacing is a process by which a video file is split into separate fields, and is commonly used to reduce flickering. Different interlacing techniques work better on different forms of video media. Changing the interlacing type can improve the quality of a video file.


Locate the interlacing options of the application being used and experiment with each to determine which technique will achieve the best results to improve the quality of a video file. The interlacing options are typically located in the effects and filters menu.

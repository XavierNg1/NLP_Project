 Look for a small switch or lever under or behind your rearview mirror. By switching this lever, you can change your rearview mirror to its night setting. With this setting on, the headlights from the cars driving behind you will appear much dimmer, and they are less likely to produce glare while driving at night.If your car doesnâ€™t have self-dimming mirrors, then you may want to replace your mirrors with self-dimming ones, or look into getting a car that has these already.
 You will need to go to your car dealership or auto mechanic to have this checked. Having your headlights properly aligned will help you see better while driving at night. It will help other cars see you better at night as well.Have your headlight alignment checked once a year.
 To properly align your side mirrors, rest your head against the driver seat's window. Adjust the mirror outwards until you can see your car's rear corner. Then, lean to the other side until your head is in the center of the car. Adjust your other mirror until you can see the rear corner on the other side of your car.Having your side mirrors properly aligned helps reduce glare while driving at night, as well as blind spots.
 Having the lights on inside your car can exacerbate glare, making it even more difficult to see. If you have to, only use these lights for a couple of seconds while driving at night.

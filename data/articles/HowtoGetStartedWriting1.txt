 Choose a writing spot that is in a quiet, secluded area in your home. This could be a desk in your bedroom, a table in your living room, or a secluded spot in your school library. Go for a spot that has little to no foot traffic and is barely used by others.You may set up an area to write if you do not already have access to a table or a desk. Set up a desk in your bedroom that is for writing only or put a table in the basement of your home and use it as your writing spot.;
, To ensure your writing area is comfortable, make it ergonomic. Get a desk chair that supports your lower back. Adjust your desk chair so your feet can lie flat comfortably on the floor and your lower back is straight. If you are typing on a computer, make sure the monitor is 20 to 40 inches (50-100 centimeters) from your face. The monitor should be eye level and you should be able to see the screen without having to squint or strain your eyes.You should also make sure your keyboard is at the right height so your wrists are not strained when you type. Keep your mouse near your keyboard so you can reach it easily.
 One of the biggest hinderance to writing is getting distracted by things and people around you. Turn off your cellphone or switch it to silent so you are not distracted by phone calls or text messages. Keep your door closed and wear noise cancelling headphones, especially if it is noisy around you.You may also shut off your internet connection so you are not distracted by social media or online news.
If you live with other people, let them know you are writing and that you are not be disturbed.

 Mental illness is highly stigmatized, and this is particularly true of schizophrenia. This often results in decreased social activity and feelings of loneliness. Maintain regular contact with the person to reduce the isolating effects of social stigma.To make this a priority, set a weekly date to spend time with the person. Ensure regular social contact by designating a day each week to share a meal or engage in activity, like yoga.;
, The person may be experiencing hallucinations and/or delusions, but the fear and loneliness that result are very real. Focus on the emotion the person is expressing rather than the validity of his story.Respond to a traumatic account by asking if he is ok now and asking how you can help make him feel more comfortable.
 Support groups are great for gaining insight and establishing supportive relationships. Joining a support group will demonstrate your desire to be better informed and supportive.

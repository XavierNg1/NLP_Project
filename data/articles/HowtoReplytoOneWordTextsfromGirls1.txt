 Have the last few things you've written her been boring or commonplace? If you are not saying anything interesting, she won't want to reply back to you. Try to liven up your texts with a topic she is interested in or something that you know she would like to talk about. This way, she might be more willing to respond and hold a longer discussion with you over text.;
, A good way to get her to respond is by letting her know you are thinking about her. Text her things like: "I really liked that outfit you wore yesterday." or "You kicked butt when we all went bowling last week." These things make her pay attention to the conversation, feel special, and know you like her., Bring up something that reminds you of her. Text her something like: "There is this flower outside that is the same colour as your eyes. It makes me think about you when I see it." It lets her know that you think about her outside of the current conversation. It will also likely bring her back into the conversation with you.


Make sure you don't say anything inappropriate at this stage. Match what you say with how close of a relationship you have. If you just met her, you will not say the same things to her as you would if you've known her for a long time., If you are trying to get a longer response from her, ask her a question that has more than a one word answer. You can even turn it into something flirty. Ask her something like: "What is your idea of a perfect date, and why?" This puts the idea of romance in her head and requires a longer response. It also has the added benefit of helping you get to know her a little better.

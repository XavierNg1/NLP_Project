 Before you start this, preheat your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius). Then rinse 3 cups (540 g) of cherry tomatoes under running water. Gently scrub them with your fingertips to remove lingering dirt or chemicals. Then slice each one in half., Transfer the tomatoes to a small mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of dried oregano, ½ teaspoon of salt, and a pinch of black pepper. Stir to coat your tomatoes evenly.If you’re making bacon to include in your sandwiches, make that first and add 1 tablespoon of the fat left over from cooking to the tomatoes and oil for extra flavor.
 Line a sheet pan with parchment paper, or spray a roasting pan with cooking oil. Spread the tomatoes across it evenly. Place them in the oven and roast for one hour. Remove them from the oven, flip them over, and roast for roughly one more hour. Start checking them about 30 minutes before the last hour’s up to make sure they don’t burn., Once they’re roasted, transfer your tomatoes back to your mixing bowl. Stir in 1 cup (227 g) of Boursin cheese until all ingredients are evenly mixed. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.

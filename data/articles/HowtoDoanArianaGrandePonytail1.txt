 Put some hair gel or texture spray in your hair, and tease the front section of your hair.


Teasing is the method of creating texture where you use a comb to comb small sections of your hair backwards. Start in the center of a section of hair and draw your comb back in quick strokes toward your head. This knots your hair slightly, and creates volume.;
, You don’t need hair extensions for a high pony, especially if you have thick hair. However, Ariana Grande’s hair always features a really big style that is sleek and flowing, which is achieved with extensions.


Create an anchor (a small section of hair) where the center of the ponytail will be at the top of your head. Clip your extensions in a circle around that anchor. , Gather your hair and pull it to the back of your head, securing it in an elastic.


For the Ariana Grande style, you will want to put your hair more towards the top of your head.
When you gather your hair, pull it up to avoid creating bumps.
 Pull out a small section of hair from the ponytail and wrap it around the elastic. Secure it with a bobby pin.


You may want to use some hairspray to keep spiky extra hairs in check-- sometimes your hair may not be long enough to create a smooth disguise for the hair tie.

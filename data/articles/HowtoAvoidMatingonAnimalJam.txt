 Sometimes there are Jammers who want to talk about bad things with you in their den, don't risk it and always say no. If both of you are "friends" and suddenly they want to meet with you offline that is very bad.


Don't ever meet with anyone offline, no matter who they are.
Report and block any Jammer that tries to mate with you or asks you to meet offline.
If a Jammer wants to meet offline, make sure you tell your parents after you've blocked and reported them. It's a very bad thing for them to do.;
, Usually, the people who are inappropriate and say things like "Come to my den if you like me" are girls who are attracted to boys. If your animal is dressed in dark colours, blues, reds or oranges, they will assume you are a boy, regardless of your real gender. If your animal looks good, they will likely say something like "You are cute" or "Wanna be my day? (as in date)". Either way, if you make your animal less visually appealing, you probably won't be approached by these creeps.
 They might be trying to look like they're naked. (<-- good way of ruining a kids game, Jammers.) Report and block them if they say inappropriate stuff.


Some animals just like these colors though, so don't go reporting them for nothing. Just if they are acting inappropriate.
 Get up and move away if you think that is what they intend to do. If they start showing you that want to mate tell them firmly no, then block, report them and leave.
 If you do these three things you are awesome and not a drama seeker. Many people will stay where there is a person mating and say things like "Yuck! Stop now! I am going to barf!" but they don't leave. If you stay and keep talking the animal will think you want to mate and keep asking you too. Always leave as soon as possible.

 Be polite. Say please and thank you. Having good manners goes a long way in helping people not find you annoying. Think about talking to a polite person versus a rude one: Who would annoy you more?Laugh at people’s jokes. Laugh even if they’re not really funny (unless it’s an offensive joke). It’s polite and makes the joke teller feel good.
Don’t burp, pass gas, or spit around other people. Keep your bad habits, such as cracking your knuckles or chewing with your mouth open, under control. If people start to notice these bad habits happening consistently, it becomes grating and instantly annoying!

, If someone says for you to stop teasing them, bothering them, or getting in their face, stop immediately. No means no.Say “I’m sorry,” and step away from the person. If you stop when they ask, most likely there will be no hard feelings. Don’t say, “Can’t you take a joke?” or “Calm down.”

, Constantly needing to be the center of attention gets on everyone’s nerves. If you are incessantly texting your friends, butting your way into conversations, or making everyone look at you while you do something, people are going to begin to withdraw from you.


Ask yourself why you need all this attention. Oftentimes, people who engage in attention-seeking behaviors have low self-esteem for are feeling insecure about something.Stay out of drama. Don’t create it, and don’t participate in it. While it often feels good to be in the middle of it and gives you a great attention rush, people begin to see that you are a drama tornado and will do their best to not get sucked in. Drama will give you attention, but not authentic friendships., Don’t have an entitled attitude and expect to be treated better than everyone else. Don’t expect people to bend to your whims.Keep your word. If you say you are going to be there at five o’clock, don’t roll in a little after six. Keep your promises to others, and if you can’t, let them know as soon as possible.

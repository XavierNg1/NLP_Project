 Managing your own stress will make it easier to deal with someone who is constantly complaining about their love life. Take time to exercise, eat well, and get at least eight hours of sleep each night. Being nourished and well rested will make it easier to positively manage someone’s complaints about their love life.
 Maintaining a positive attitude is important for your mental health. This can be especially crucial if you are on the receiving end of someone’s nonstop complaints about their love life. Since listening to chronic complaints can negatively influence how you see your own life, make an effort to think positively about yourself and your life.


When you are with the complainer, try thinking to yourself, “I am grateful for my love life, which seems great in comparison to Aunt Zelda’s.”

, If you are constantly listening to someone talk about their problems, it is important that you take time to do things that are important to you. This is especially important if the person complaining plays a regular role in your everyday life.


For example, you can take a long walk on a local nature trail a couple of times each week.
Try taking time to read a novel or watch your favorite television show.
 Dedicate time to relationships that are mutually supportive, where both people are invested in supporting one another. Each person should both take time to support the other, whether that means being an active listener or helping the other person through a tough time.

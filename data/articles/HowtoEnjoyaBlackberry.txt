 Believe it or not, there are plenty of different ways to obtain blackberries. Some people prefer to go to their local grocery store, while others prefer picking them straight off the vines.


Some people can tell a taste between organic and non-organic blackberries, but organic fruits do offer added health benefits. Non-organic blackberries use pesticides to keep the bugs away, and preservatives to prevent mold from growing.;
, In the grocery store, blackberries most often come in clear plastic containers pre-picked, with holes on the container for air to pass through. It’s best to check all around the container at all sides of the visible blackberries to avoid choosing a container with moldy berries on the bottom.


When picking from the vine, look for fully ripe, black berries with no mold. Blackberries do not ripen after they're picked.Blackberries are seasonal fruits that peak in the summertime in the United States.When not in season, you have to look carefully for signs of unripe blackberries.
 Although other fruits like bananas and avocados may be safe to pick before they’re fully ripe, blackberries will just remain unripe and unappetizing. Some signs of moldy or unripe blackberries include:


Temperature. (Berries mold more quickly when left at room temperature.)
Fuzzy growths on the berries.
Dis-colorization.
Bruising or dents in the fruit.
Soft spots and wrinkles.
Leaky juices.
 If you don’t use all the blackberries at once, then the berries can spoil very quickly. Leaving berries out at room temperature can cause them to mold overnight.


Leave only 1-2 days’ worth of berries in the refrigerator. They’ll spoil after that.
If you want to keep more for longer periods of time, you can freeze blackberries for several months without air. (Be sure to wash them first!)
Wash the berries right before you are about to consume them.Once they're washed, berries are more likely to go bad.
 It’s also wise to rinse the blackberry before freezing them, too. If you rinse before storing them in the refrigerator, you risk allowing the berry to mold quicker.


Don’t press too hard while rinsing, as blackberries can be easy to squeeze.

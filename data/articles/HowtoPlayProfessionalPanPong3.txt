, If the Ball is blocked by the opposing player no point is awarded.


A hit is defined as any shot causing the ball to come in contact with any part of the defending player (this includes the head and face). However, the one exclusion is all of the forearm beginning at the elbow, all the way to the fingertips. A legal hit also includes a ball that is deflected upwards but on its way down comes in contact with the player's body (head, lap, etc.).
If the Ball misses the opponent, or is blocked by the opponent's Pan and hits the floor; the round is restarted with another face-off.
The first player to 15 points and has at least a 2 point lead is declared the winner.
In the event that the first player to reach 15 points does not have at least a 2 point lead, the winner is determined by the same tie-breaking method in Tennis of "Deuce". During this tie-breaker, the same rules of game-play are still in effect. Both players begin at Deuce. If a player scores a point, they move to the status of "Advantage". If they score once more they will be declared the winner. However, if the other player scores, both scores return to Deuce. This method is followed until a player is effectively determined as having scored twice on the opponent with no opposing points being scored.

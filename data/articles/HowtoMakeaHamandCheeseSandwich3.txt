 Season the egg with a pinch of salt and pepper, to taste. You will be dipping the bread in this, like making French toast, so make sure that the dish is big enough.
 You are only coating one side, not both. For the mustard, you can use plain yellow mustard, or the more flavorful Dijon mustard.


Don't use the butter on the bread. You will be using it for grilling later on.
 Place one of the bread slices down on the counter, with the mustard side facing up. Layer the ham and cheese slices on top, then cover it with the remaining slice, mayonnaise-side-down. Gently press down on the sandwich to flatten it. This will make it easier to grill.


If you don't have any shredded cheese, you can use 2 slices of cheese instead. Swiss will taste great!If you don't have Gruyere, you can use other types of cheese as well, such as Gouda, Monterey jack, or Swiss.
Unlike other grilled sandwiches, you are keeping the mayonnaise/mustard on the inside of the sandwich instead of the outside.
 As the butter melts, tilt the skillet around so that it coats the surface evenly. You can also spread it around using a spatula.
 Place the sandwich into the egg dish, wait a few seconds, then flip it over and dip the other side into the egg. Make sure that the egg soaks into the bread.
 Cook the sandwich for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip it over using a spatula. Cook it for another 2 to 3 minutes. The sandwich is ready when the cheese melts and the bread turns golden brown., If you'd like, you can sprinkle some powdered sugar on top.

 Concentrate on shaded areas around docks, overhanging trees, and vegetation. Avoid very dense vegetation, which will make spotting fish more difficult. Look for active shiners zipping along just below the surface of the water.Find a strategic area to set your trap., Lure the shiners out of dense vegetation and deeper waters. Tear bread into fairly large chunks that are big enough for several shiners to feed on at once, which will help reveal how many are in the immediate area., Use bread or crackers to lure shiners inside. Place the trap in shallow water. If the current's strong, anchor it with a few rocks inside or secure it by tying a line., Wait for shiners to collect inside. Then, if possible, keep your trap partially submerged in the water when you open it to remove your shiners; this way your fish will remain relatively stress-free. Transfer them to storage as quickly as possible so they remain as healthy as possible.

 To start creating a pin up style, brush your hair out like you normally would. Then, brush your hair into a side part. You can part your hair on whichever side of your head is most flattering for you., Once your hair is secured in a side part, take some hair clips or hair ties. On the side of your hair with more hair, section off about two thirds of your hair near the front of your head. Secure this hair with hair ties and a hair clip and leave it aside for now., Start at the side of your head with less hair. Use a brush to brush your hair sideways and then wrap it around the back of your head. You want your hair on the shorter side to be flattened against your head and curling around the side of your head., Once you've flattened and curved your hair, take some hairspray. Mist a generous amount of hairspray to hold your hair in place.If hairspray does not adequately keep your hair in place, use something stronger like mousse or gel.
 Push your clipped hair off the side slightly. On the other side of your head, where your hair is not flattened, work a flat iron through your hair strand by strand. Move the flat iron in back and forth motions as you pull it through each strand. This should create slight waves and curls on one side of your head., Once you've curled your hair, remove the clip or tie from the sectioned hair. Use a comb to brush out the hair until it's straight and tangle free., Take your flat iron. Loop your sectioned hair around the flat iron, so it's rolled into the flat iron like it would be with a hair curler. Slowly pull the flat iron out, which should leave you with one large curl falling slightly over your forehead. You should now have a vintage 50's pin up style.

 Craps is a game of chance, but you can use statistics to figure out how to place your bets. You win in craps on the first roll if you roll a 7 or an 11. The combinations that will result in a 7 are 1-6, 2-5, and 3-4. Because there are two dice, you need to multiply the number of combinations by 2 (3 x 2), giving you a total of 6 out of 36 chances, or 17%, that you will roll a 7 on the first roll. An 11 is only made by rolling a 6-5, so the total number of chances you'll get an 11 is 2 out of 36, or 5.5%. To find out the overall probability of winning on your first roll, add 1/6 and 1/18, which makes your overall probability of rolling a winning number on the first roll 8/36, or 22%. Look out for rolls of 2, 3, and 12. These are considered the natural losing numbers in craps and no matter what you bet, you lose if these numbers are rolled. Don't worry too much, though, because the likelihood of each of these numbers being rolled is 1/36, or 2.7%., The pass line is where you bet for the roll of 7 or 11 on the first roll. You can start by bidding the pass line, which will win you money 22% of the time on your first roll if you roll a 7 or 11. This can be a nice way to gently build yourself up to betting higher., If you don't want to bet the pass line, you can bet on the point numbers. Point numbers are the numbers that aren't natural winners and losers, which are the 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. When your first roll doesn't automatically win or lose, you end up with a point number, which you have to roll one additional time to win. 6s and 8s are the most probable point numbers, and these numbers will be more likely to win you money than any of the other point numbers. There is a 10/36, 27%, chance that your point number will be either a 6 or an 8. Your chances decrease once a point number is rolled, with the odds of 5/36, or 13.8%, that you will get the matching point number.


Even if these odds seem low, they are the highest for any point numbers. The chances of you winning with a 5 or 9 is 4/36, or 11%, and with a 4 or 10 is 3/36, or 8.3%. These are much lower than the 13.8% chance that you'll win off the 6 or the 8., Even if you're on a losing streak, following the odds will likely pay out in the long-run, regardless of short-term losses. Odds will always even themselves out, but that process may be much longer than you anticipate. If you have plenty of money to burn, playing against the odds can be a fun risk to take.

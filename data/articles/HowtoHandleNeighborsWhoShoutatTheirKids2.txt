 If your neighbor’s shouting is loud or annoying, you might talk with them about it. Find a time to talk with your neighbor and ask them if they would consider keeping it down. They might not be aware of how loud they are and appreciate you letting them know.You might say something like “Hey Dianne. You were pretty loud the other day. Do you think you could keep it down?” or “Hey Jim. I heard you getting on Todd’s case the other day. It kind of upset my kids. Could you maybe be a little quieter?”
Do not send your neighbor a text or write them a note and leave it on their door or in their mailbox. If you are going to talk to them, you need to do it face to face.
 If your neighbor has a tendency to lose their temper on their kids, but the yelling is not abusive, you might consider simply ignoring it. Getting involved, especially if there is not any abuse occurring, might damage your relationship with your neighbor. Play it by ear and, if you do not think the yelling is severe, ignoring it may be the best response., If the yelling is upsetting your kids, you might want to have a discussion with them about what is going on. Let them know that sometimes parents get a little frustrated with their children and lose their tempers. However, you should also explain to them that yelling at your kids is not the best way to deal with your frustration.


You might say something like “I’m sorry that is upsetting you. That yelling is bothering me too.”
If the yelling is that bad, consider leaving the house for a while to go do something fun with your children. Or do something to distract them from the disturbance — put on some music and play a game or dance around.

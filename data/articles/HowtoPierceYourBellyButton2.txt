 Look for general tidiness and watch the artists to make sure that they wear sterile gloves and use sterile solutions on the skin. Ask them if they own an autoclave. Don't be afraid to walk out of the piercing studio if you don't feel that they are very hygienic with their piercing techniques.
 You will likely be asked to sign a paper for legal purposes. If you are younger than 16, you'll probably need a parent to provide consent before the shop will perform the piercing.
 A knowledgeable piercing artist will help guide you with what type of jewelry is best for healing.



On request, expose your belly button and the piercing artist will size up your navel with a felt tip marker.
A surgical-type clamp will be attached to the upper region of your navel to stabilize the tissue in preparation for the puncture.



Out of the autoclave comes a very long, very sharp hollow needle of sorts, which will be used to pierce the skin for your new piercing.
Your jewelry is placed on the end of the spear and guided through your new piercing.
Remember to breathe throughout the procedure for maximum calm and comfort.

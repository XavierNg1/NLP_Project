 A steady uphill walk or jog is a well-regarded way to help build muscle strength, especially for those who are just starting to strength train or those recovering from injury. Start with a gradual incline to help build your leg and core muscles. Warm up for five minutes by walking at a brisk pace with no incline.
Set your incline to something gradual to start, generally no more than about eight percent.
Walk consistently at that incline for 25 to 35 minutes.
 As you build your lower body muscles, you can start to increase your incline. Go up gradually as you feel your workouts become easier. Try to avoid increases larger than two percent at a time to avoid fatiguing your muscles.The steeper the walk, the more challenging for your muscles. You should feel your muscles getting tired, but not to the point where you cannot continue to walk or fail to properly support your body weight once your workout is finished.
 You may opt to wear a weight belt or ankle weights, or carry small hand weights as you walk to add resistance and build greater strength. Weight belts and ankle weights are good for engaging the core and increasing overall resistance, while hand weights can help you strengthen and tone your arms.Always be careful when using weights during an aerobic exercise. Make sure ankle weights and belts have a quick release option, and do not use hand weights that you cannot easily pick up and move.
Also, keep in mind that wearing ankle weights is like putting a load at the end of a long lever, which is your arm or leg. This can strain your joints and cause serious joint injuries or muscle, tendon, or ligament strains and tears. Do not wear ankle weights or carry dumbbells for longer than one minute. Take them off after one minute and take a break before putting them back on.

, Fill a glass or container with water for dipping the paintbrush into.
 Dip the paintbrush into the water to wet it. Push it against the edge of the glass or container to remove excess water drips but ensure that it's wet enough to produce the design, as the more water on your paintbrush, the more the color will run, which is the effect you're after.
, Start at the top and let the paint drip all the way down to the bottom. Use other colors if wished, or keep with the same color.
 During this time, you can start on another mug, chill out, clean the kitchen, whatever. If your mug has not dried by this time, wait until it has.
 Turn the oven on while waiting for the paint to dry.
 Putting your mug into the oven will ensure that the beautiful watercolor design remains intact in the future, as the heat from the oven will bake the paint on, meaning that it won't come off when you wash it.
 Use oven mitts to pick it up, as it'll be very hot to handle. Let it cool down on a heatproof surface.
 You officially have your own watercolor mug! Make yourself a cup of coffee or tea and give it a test run.

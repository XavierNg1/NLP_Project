 Maybe you'd like random shapes created from rugged, odd shaped broken plates. Or perhaps you'd prefer cleanly broken halves that all match in size and shape. Make this decision before cutting/breaking the plates or salvaging broken pieces.;
, You can choose between an eclectic mixture of any broken plate design you can lay your hands on. Or, you can be more precise and select plates only with the same pattern, to give a more uniform and formal appearance to the border. Again, decide before selecting plates and broken pieces.
 If you’ve broken one or two plates of your set in the past and can no longer use that set, you could break the remaining plates to use as your border. Or, if you don’t possess the pattern or color you desire, go to a garage sale or thrift store for plates in order to score the best deal possible.


This is a great opportunity to get rid of chipped or cracked plates that you no longer want to use.
 Which size best suits your needs? Teacup saucers, side plates or dinner plates? For extra large borders, think serving or carving plates. Match plate size to the area of border needing to be covered.

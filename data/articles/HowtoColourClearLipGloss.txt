 If you have under half a container of it left (unless the container is big) it is not worth colouring it when it won't last for long anyway.;
, This method creates a more muted shade than the source of the colour, so you may wish to go a shade brighter than you normally would.
 This may be your favourite lipstick or one that you rarely use, whatever you want. As long as it is lipstick rather than gloss or gel, it will work.
 Remember the more you use, the stronger the colour of the lip gloss.
 If you desire, you may want to crush or break up the lipstick first so it melts evenly.
, This can be done by rolling the applicator bud in the melted lipstick or using it to scrape it into the mouth of the container.
 This should only take 10 - 20 seconds as the lipstick is fluid and will mix easily with the lip gloss to form a compound just as most other fluids would.



Is the lip gloss one colour throughout? Is the colour bold enough that it is visible when on, but not so strong that you look like a clown? If not, add more melted lipstick and try again.
Alternatively, is the colour too strong? If so, melt about 1/4 teaspoon of petroleum jelly and add it, essentially diluting the mix.
 It may look good in the container, but not so great on. Make sure to try the product on before you put it away.

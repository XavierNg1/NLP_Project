, Make sure the side with writing on it is facing the inside, so you can't see it.
 Now you have a long, thin piece of paper.
 Make sure the two edges of the triangles are parallel; not like a trapezoid, (two parallel sides and two non-parallel sides) but like a parallelogram (two pairs of two parallel sides).
 Make your fold so that the edge of the triangle that's closest to the center of the rectangle moves up so that it's parallel to the long side of the rectangle. If you do this with both triangles, you will create something that looks like an "S" turned 90 degrees counterclockwise.









If you fold the triangles inward, you will get a rectangle, and this is wrong.
 You should have two triangles making a square shape in the center, with an equally-sized triangle sitting on each side.

 Also wipe around your nails. Doing so immediately after applying the tanning product will keep it from tanning those areas as much.


Tanning spray is a problem if it pools around your palms and nails. You don't want your nails or palms to be colored by the spray, as they are naturally lighter than the rest of your body. Mostly, you want to avoid spraying in that area, but you do need to spray your hands, which can lead to your nails or palms getting sprayed.
 If the damage is already down, use a whitening toothpaste on your nails and palms.Choose a clean toothbrush used specifically for this purpose. Put some toothpaste on the brush. Scrub into your palms and around your nails. Rub in gentle circles, but don't rub too hard.
Wash off the toothpaste. You should have removed some of the spray tan.
 You can use the acetone in nail polish remover to remove the stains from your nails. Simply apply as you normally would: rub the remover on with a cotton ball in circular motions. Rinse your hands afterwards.

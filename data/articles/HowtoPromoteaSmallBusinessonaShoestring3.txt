 Introduce yourself to local reporters, and let them know about your area of expertise. Offer to comment any time they are working on a story about your industry or field.
 Use your relationships with the media to suggest stories that might include a quote from you or reflect well on your business.
 Even if they are on an unrelated topic, when you get them published your byline can include the name of your business and perhaps include a link to your website.

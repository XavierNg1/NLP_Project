 Before you begin laying the blocks, visualize all the corners of your frame. Section off the corners with wooden stakes. Use a cord or string to tie off exactly where the cornersâ€™ edges will be. Attach a chord or string to the wooden stake used to mark the corners.The string should create a circumference around your work space.
 Lay out your blocks along the dried footing and see how many you'll need for the first layer. Don't seal these down. Use a 5x8 to separate the blocks to account for the mortar.


Use corner blocks on the corners if available.
After testing, remove the blocks and prepare for the real event.
 Take the bag of dried concrete and measure out one dosage. Look on the bag's specifications for the brand you choose. Prepare a container to mix the dried mortar with water. Use a five gallon bucket that you don't mind damaging.


Never mix more mortar than you can use.

 In AoE1 and AoE2, the minimap is a small trapezoidal map of the game world in the bottom-right corner of the screen, while in AoE3, it is a small round map in the bottom left corner.;
, Move your mouse to the location you want on the minimap and then just left-click to go there. This will instantly move the camera to that part of the game world.
 To jump to a different part of the game world using the minimap, left-click the corresponding part of the minimap.


Note that parts of the game world that have not been explored will appear black and blank on the minimap just as they will on the actual game world.
 Similarly, you can left-click the area where your town is to go back if youâ€™ve finished exploring. Alternatively, you can press the hotkey H (for AoE1 & 2) or T (for AoE3), and you will be taken there right away.

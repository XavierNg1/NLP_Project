 Make sure that you provide smooth transitions between each part of your speech and that each part is well developed on its own. Be patient, writing is a process, and it may take you a good amount of time and multiple revisions before you have a solid introduction, body and conclusion.
 Make sure that you highlight your main ideas at each part, the introduction, body and conclusion of the speech. For example, in your introduction you can say, “This story is about …”. Additionally, make certain that you come back to your main idea in a way that sticks out in your conclusion.


After your speech you want people to be able to easily remember what you talked about so they can discuss what you said.
 Choose someone who you trust and respect, like a teacher or colleague, who is knowledgeable about writing or speech making. Often you will be unable to see problems in your speech, but a knowledgeable person who gives you honest feedback will help you sort out those problems.


Send the same person your revisions each time you make a major edit.
 Depending on how practiced you are at talking in front of big groups of people, you may need to plan on practicing more times. Get your family or friends together to listen to your speech, and go through the speech several times in front of them.


Make sure to practice your pacing, and slow down if you have a tendency to read quickly through your speech. Use a timer when you practice giving your speech in front a mirror or your family/friends.
Practice enough times so that you have the things you want to say internalized. This means that when you go into autopilot mode in front of an audience you will be more likely to remember because of your muscle memory. If you get stuck, look at someone you trust in the audience and breath deeply for a couple of seconds to calm yourself down while you try to collect your thoughts.

 Buy, reuse, or make a container to hold your new lip balm. Make sure whatever you use is fully cleaned and dried before pouring your heated lip balm into it.


Reuse an old lip balm tub or stick, or buy new ones from beauty supply stores. You can also make your own containers using bottle caps or repurposed mint tins, jewelry, etc.
Make sure the container you use is free of moisture that could contaminate the balm. Use rubbing alcohol to help clean and dry the surfaces., Transfer your lip balm to a container while it is still warm and liquified from the microwave. Use a funnel or another pouring mechanism to help get the balm into a small container.


For easiest pouring into most containers, use a Pyrex measuring cup with a pour spout. This is ideal, as it is microwave safe so you can use it throughout the process to add, microwave, mix, and pour your ingredients.
For very small containers like a lip balm tube, you can also use a glass dropper (note that beeswax is very hard to clean out of this once hardened), a disposable plastic pipette, or a very small funnel to help transfer the liquid.
If your ingredients have cooled slightly and separated or hardened into anything other than fully liquid, simply reheat in the microwave for a short time before pouring.
 Leave the lip balm in its new container undisturbed with the lid off. You can allow it to harden in room temperature, or speed up the process by placing it in the fridge or freezer.


If in room temperature, allow the balm to sit for several hours or overnight. If in the fridge, about an hour will do, or less in the freezer. When in doubt, leave it undisturbed for longer to ensure a smooth, solid balm.
After cooling and hardening, you can place the cap or lid onto your container. Use the balm like you normally would, applying to lips with a finger or directly from the container.

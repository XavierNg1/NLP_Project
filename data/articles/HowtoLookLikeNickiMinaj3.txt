 Wear body hugging dresses or plunging necklines if you have the occasion and the confidence. Most people don’t have music videos or award shows to pull off such daring looks but you can still add a touch of sexiness to your wardrobe. Choose outfits that show off your midriff or pull up your skirt slightly to show off a bit of skin.For example, you can wear a roll neck long sleeve crop top, matching skirt, and patent leather strappy sandals to complete a more wearable day-to-day look., Nicki knows how to stay bold with patterns liked pairing mixed print pants with a blazer, great for a more casual look or adding some flair to the workplace.For example, match a monochrome frayed shell top, crepe grid print trousers, a black blazer, and black cut out gladiator heels to complete a patterned look great for going straight from the office to cocktails., Nicki has a flair for the dramatic. She pairs teal Jimmy Choo pumps with a vibrant pink Chanel bag, or a military bag from Marc Jacobs with python knee boots from Bally Ocre. Not everyone can afford her designer tastes but experiment with bold shoe and accessory combinations.Shop at more affordable retailers like Forever 21, H & M, or online.

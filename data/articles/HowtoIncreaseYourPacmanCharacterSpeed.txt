, (The result was only on level 4 you can eat up to 4 fruits and no more.) Until you have reached level 7.


At Level 7, you will have to not eat any of the fruits the whole time until level 8.
, You have came to level 9, for some people this was easy, and others very hard, so now you have to risk all that time you have spent. Do all of this in the exact order, and try not to be eaten by the ghosts.


First off, eat all the Big Dots first.
Second, eat 1 fruit in the middle
Eat all the left side of the screen (the top and bottom)
Get 1 fruit again from the middle
Eat the top right side only
Eat every fruit that pops up now, and nothing else. You have to keep getting the fruit until you have come to 3 lives(if you had 3 lives before you have to lose 1 and then earn it back)
Where the ghost spawns (The Ghost Jail) you have to go around it any way 3 times and it can be if you want to take a break and not be eaten, by going down and do the rounds you have left.
Finally, repeat ONLY step 6, and you have to wait until you have 4 lives(not 3).
After doing all the steps above, eat all the small dots that are left(on the bottom right side of course) and if you want you could eat another fruit BUT just don't get up to 3 lives again.



Right when you have typed it in, you will start moving super fast.

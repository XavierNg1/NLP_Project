 They wait for small crustaceans to be pulled off the bridge pilings by the current. The pompano will linger in one place as long as there is food coming their way, making them easy to catch by anglers who prefer to fish from a boat.
 Attach an egg sinker, about 12 inches of leader, and a size 6 hook.
 Break off the big claw before baiting your hook.


Place some rags in a bucket and just cover the crabs with seawater. Fiddler crabs will live several days in a shady place.
 Drop your line near the down current pilings.


Pompano will be on one side of the bridge when the tide comes in and the other side when the tide goes out, so you will have to move your boat if the tide changes.
 Chumming is the practice of dumping cut bait or fish parts into the water to attract fish. When fishing near a bridge, scrape barnacles and mussels from the pilings with a long-handled garden scraper and allow the current to carry them toward the pompano.
 The bait will disturb the sand on the bottom, which attracts the fish. You may have to change the weight of your sinker to accomplish this. Let your line play out as the current drags your line toward the down current pilings.

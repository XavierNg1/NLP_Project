 Having your dogs wear a tick repellent collar can help keep ticks away from their heads and necks. These types of collars sit on your dogs' skin and release chemicals or active compounds into the fatty tissue just below your dogs' skin.


These chemicals won’t hurt your dogs, but they will kill and repel ticks.
Place the collar carefully on your dogs so that they won’t be able to turn their heads and chew or bite it.Make sure that you use a product that is licensed to kill ticks, such as Seresto, or your dog will not have adequate protection.;
, Every day, you should comb through your dogs' fur and check for ticks, particularly if your dogs spend a lot of time outside. You might occasionally find one or two, and getting them off your dogs every day will help prevent a serious infestation.


Place your dogs on a white sheet so that you can better see if any ticks fall off when you’re combing their fur.
Using either your fingers or a comb, comb the fur along your dog’s back and belly, making sure you get all the way down to your dog’s skin. As you comb, look for ticks, which will sometimes look like gray beans or black poppy seeds or smaller.If your dog has long hair, then you might consider clipping their hair to make finding ticks easier.
 You should shampoo your dogs every two weeks with an anti-tick shampoo. These shampoos contain ingredients that kill any ticks that might already be on your dogs and repel any ticks that try to bite your dogs later.Bathing your dogs is a good way to prevent ticks, but it should be used in conjunction with flea medications. Relying only on baths probably won’t prevent your dogs from getting ticks.

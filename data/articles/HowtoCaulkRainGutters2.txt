 Moreover, silicone caulk also works better in gaps that expand and contract, which gutters often do in response to changes in temperature. If you have white gutters, use a white caulk. If your gutters are painted in another color, choose a clear caulk.


If possible, go with a caulk that is specifically formulated for gutters. Gutter caulks are designed to work in the conditions gutters face, and as such, they last much longer than non-gutter caulks.
 Rub the edge of the seam with sandpaper or a wire brush using steady, even pressure. Caulk, especially silicone caulk, adheres better to a surface that is slightly rough and uneven than it does to a perfectly smooth surface. The gutters do not need to be jagged, but it helps if the metal is a little coarse.
 Cutting the tip at an angle makes it easier to fit the tube into the seam.
 The tube should be fitted securely at both ends of the gun.
 Start at the front of the seam and gradually pull the trigger of the caulking gun. As you squeeze, a small dot of caulk should emerge from the nozzle. Drag the nozzle down the length of the seam, applying even pressure on the trigger to maintain the same size dot along the entire seam.
 By working it into the joint, you ensure a stronger seal.
 Draw a second line of caulk above the first using the same method and amount of pressure as you used to create the first. Do not push this line under the joint.
 Use your finger to smooth the beaded line into a smooth strip of caulk. The width should be even throughout the entire line.
 After it has dried, check your work to verify that the caulk is secured.

 You should also have items for the night. Here are some items that are important finding your way homeÂ :


Compass
Map
Bed
Torches

, The Signs should be about land areas. Like a Mountain Arch is near by and then you placed a Sign saying "Creeper Arch". Then you know that you have been here. Or, remember certain areas with weird land. Like an area floating off land.

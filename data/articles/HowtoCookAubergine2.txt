 Youâ€™ll also need to line a baking pan with foil or lightly grease it. Alternatively, if you have one, you can use a Silpat (though a little greasing still wouldn't hurt).
 Consider a few of these variations:


Cut it into 3/4-inch cubes. Toss the cubes with garlic, olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Once all the cubes are covered, place into the pan.
Bake your aubergine whole. Pierce the skin a few times when baking so it does not explode from expanding moisture. You can then scoop out the flesh for mashing or pureeing.
Slice the aubergine length-wise and brush with olive oil and seasoning (diced onion, pepper, grated cheese, breadcrumbs and spices all work wonderfully).
 If you're working with cubes, you may wish to stir them up about halfway through, or 10 minutes in. And if your oven cooks unevenly, turn the pan around as well. You want each piece to have that hint of crunch while still being tender.


If you're roasting a whole aubergine, pierce it with a fork. If there is initial pressure and then it slides right in, your aubergine is fully cooked.

 Explosive moves are those that incorporate jumping from a static position. You can turn almost any exercise into an explosive exercise and this will intensify your workout.


For example, you can try jumping from a squat position straight up into the air instead of slowly rising to a standing position. Or, you could also try jumping from one lunge position to the next.
If you have a platform you can jump onto, then this can help to add even more intensity because you will have to shift your body weight enough to get up on the platform. Start small though if you have never done this before, such as by jumping up onto a small platform or step. Make sure that the platform is stable as well.
When you do explosive moves, try to land as softly as possible and keep control of your muscles. Do not allow your knees to collapse or your feet to slam on the ground.The joints of your feet, ankles, knees and hips should stay in the same plane to avoid injury. Keep your knees aligned vertically above your feet.
 Standing on one leg instead of two for an exercise is an easy way to up the intensity. For example, you can try a one leg squat, a one leg calf raise, or a one leg bridge.If an exercise does not feel very challenging, then try switching from two legs to one leg.
If this feels too hard, then switch back to two legs.
 While you might be tempted to pair this routine with a short run or to do the routine on a rest day, you are actually better off doing the routine on the same day as your long run. This will allow you to truly rest on your rest day and your muscles will already be nice and warm.Try doing your body weight exercise routine right after a long run.
If you canâ€™t get out for a run due to weather or other reasons, then a bodyweight routine may also serve as a good substitute for a run.

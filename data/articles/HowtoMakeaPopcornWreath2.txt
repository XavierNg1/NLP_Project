 Use either very strong cotton or embroidery thread or monofilament thread. Measure the circle size for the wreath, then measure the thread to this length about three to five times, then cut to that length. A long piece is necessary to create a strong thread.


If using monofilament, just use the first circle's length, as it'll be strong enough on its own, without doubling up.
The color of the thread is completely up to you; it doesn't matter that much, unless you'd like to color coordinate it.
 This will double, triple or quadruple its strength. (Skip this step if using monofilament.)

, Thread a needle with the folded thread length and tie a knot at the end of the length. Push the needle through the middle of a piece of popcorn. Push it all the way along to the knotted end. Continue this method until you have added all of the popcorn you can fit onto the string, leaving a length for tying.
 Tie it in place with a firm knot. The wreath is now complete and ready to hang indoors or out.


A hanger can be attached to this wreath, as for Method 1's popcorn wreath.

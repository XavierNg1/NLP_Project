 It’s important that your cat is relaxed and content in the space where it sleeps. Think about where your cat spends the most time snoozing or lounging. For example, if your cat loves napping in the window sill, consider a window perch., Try placing your cat’s bed in a sunny location. Cats like to be warm, so a room with lots of natural light can help them maintain body heat while snoozing. For example, try putting a cozy cat bed near a window or other source of natural light., Cats need to have safe, quiet spaces where they can retreat from household mayhem. Consider locating your cat’s sleeping space in a room that is not frequented as often by family members, such as a guest bedroom or den.

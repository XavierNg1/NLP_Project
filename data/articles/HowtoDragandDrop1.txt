 Decide the files that you want to move to a new location. Choose where that new location will be.;
, If you are using a Mac computer, open two Finder windows to access the files and the new location where you want to put them. If you are using a Windows computer, open the windows through the Start menu.


If your files are located on the desktop, you should only open a window for the location where you want to move the files.
If you are using a Mac, after you open the first window, go to the File menu at the top and select the option to open a new Finder window.
If you are using Windows, you can simply minimize the first window and access the Start menu again to find the second window.
 If your files are on the desktop, arrange your window next to the files on the desktop.
 Move your cursor so it is to the top left of all the files you want to move. Left click the mouse and drag the cursor over the files until you reach the bottom right corner.


Your files should be highlighted in blue to show they are selected and ready to drag.
 The files should stay highlighted.
, They will transfer and make a zipping noise as they are moved and saved.


If your files stop being highlighted at any time, you will need to repeat the drag and drop.
If you repeat this process but drag the files to a different drive, such as a removable hard drive, CD or zip drive, the files will not move, they will be copied.

 This converts the rate to feet per hour, since there are 5,280 feet in a statute mile. Dividing by 6,076, the number of feet in a nautical mile, tells you how many knots something is travelling.

For example, a boat might be travelling 20 mph.

Converting to feet per hour: 20Ã—5,280=105,600{\displaystyle 20\times 5,280=105,600}.

Converting to knots: 105,6006,076=17.38{\displaystyle {\frac {105,600}{6,076}}=17.38}.

So, a boat travelling 20 mph is travelling at about 17 knots.
 This is the conversion rate, since there are about 0.869 knots per mile. The product will tell you the rate in knots.For example, the wind might be blowing at 25 miles per hour.

Simply multiply, or use the formula 0.869x=y{\displaystyle 0.869x=y}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the rate in miles per hour, and y{\displaystyle y} equals the rate in knots.


25(0.869)=21.725{\displaystyle 25(0.869)=21.725}

So, wind blowing at 25 mph is blowing at about 22 knots.
 A red boat is travelling at 15 knots. A blue boat is travelling at 17 miles per hour. Which boat is travelling faster?

To convert how fast the blue boat is travelling in mph to knots, multiply by the number of miles per hour by 0.869:0.869(17)=14.77knots{\displaystyle 0.869(17)=14.77\;{\text{knots}}}

The red boat is travelling at 15 knots; the blue boat is travelling a little less than 15 knots. So the red boat is travelling faster.

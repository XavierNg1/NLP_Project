 The purpose of any meditative technique is to take your mind off potentially distracting thoughts that may pop up as you attempt to center yourself. Exhale and then slowly inhale until your lungs feel full. Count the seconds and then try to take the same amount of time to exhale. The length of time will depend on your lung capacity but you should generally try to breathe slowly. Continue breathing on this number of seconds to prevent other thoughts from entering your mind.Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth.For a slower, more relaxing meditation, try the 4-7-8 exercise. Exhale, then close your mouth and inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for 7 seven seconds, and exhale over the course of 8 seconds., Focus on the curve of your breath. The curve is part where you change from inhaling to exhaling and vice versa. Try not to curve your breath too quickly.It may help to add a 2 second waiting period between when your lungs are full and when they are empty to slow down your curve.
 Focus your mind on how parts of your body react to your breathing. Feel your diaphragm, throat muscles, and shoulders shift as you inhale and exhale to occupy your mind. This should not be a painful strain but you should feel your muscles stretching in these areas. If may help to place your hand on your diaphragm so you can feel the muscle reaction.You can also focus on the relaxed parts of your body. Leave your hands and arms in a comfortable pose that doesn’t require you work any of their muscles and keep your mind focused there.
 Think of a word or phrase like “breathe” to repeat to yourself when you catch your mind wandering. Accept that this is natural and don’t give up if you’re struggling to stay focused. Remember that you should be concentrating on your breathing pattern.

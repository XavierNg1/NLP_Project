 In the wild, rabbits move around on grass and soft earth, which allow them to sink their claws and toes into the ground and have adequate foot support. Unfortunately, it’s hard to replicate that type of flooring for pet rabbits.If your rabbit has been sitting on a wire mesh cage flooring, without another soft area to rest its feet, you will need to make the cage flooring more comfortable.


If buying a smooth-bottomed cage isn’t practical, cover about 1/3 of the wire mesh flooring with soft flooring.For example, place a towel on the wire mesh and pile a thick layer of soft bedding, such as straw, on top of the towel.You could also place cardboard on top of the wire mesh. Cardboard is very absorbent, though, so you will need to change it frequently.If your rabbit’s cage already has smooth flooring, consider covering it with a soft cotton mat that has a rubber bottom. The soft cotton mat will give your rabbit traction, which will keep it from slipping and sliding on the smooth surface., Urine is very irritating to the skin and can cause sore hocks. If your rabbit likes to sit in its litter box, its feet will be constantly exposed to urine, leading to sore hocks.As you treat your rabbit, remove soiled bedding from your rabbit’s cage at least once a day.


When you remove the soiled bedding, make sure you also remove your rabbit’s feces. Both urine and feces and contribute to bacteria buildup in the cage that can worsen a sore hock infection., In addition to removing soiled bedding regularly, you should also keep your rabbit’s whole cage clean. Each day, remove any uneaten food, then clean your rabbit's food and water bowls with hot and soapy water. Every two weeks, clean the cage more thoroughly: clean the cage and toys with a diluted vinegar solution (4 parts water to 1 part vinegar).

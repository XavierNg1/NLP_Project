 You can use a web browser on any device or computer, or the Find My iPhone app on another iOS device.
 Make sure you log in with the same Apple ID associated with your iPod.
 This will display all of your Apple devices that are connected with your Apple ID.
 The map will center on it, and details will appear in a card.

 Any candle with a decent surface area will work well with glitter. This might be tall, taper candles; thick, wide candles, or even high votive candles. Choose the color of the candle the color of the glitter to complement or match one another.
 This might be just a solid section at the base, middle or top of the candle. Or, you could be fancy and add designs, such as wavy stripes, spots or letters.


If making a design, use paper templates to stick around the candle and guide where to add the glue and glitter.

 While there are specific golf rules that are followed on every course, there are often course specific rules as well.For example, course specific rules indicate where the boundaries are on the course.
 Each player in the game should hit their first round. In this first round, it does not matter who hits the ball first. However, once all of the players have teed off, the player who is closest to the hole should hit first., One point will be awarded to each swing that it takes for you to get the ball into the hole. An additional point will be added if the ball goes out of bounds. These boundaries vary from course to course. The player with the lowest score at the end of the game wins., Remember that there are other people on the course. Donâ€™t rush the people in front of you. Also, pay close attention to how long the course is taking you. If you are taking a long time, allow the people behind you to move in front of you.

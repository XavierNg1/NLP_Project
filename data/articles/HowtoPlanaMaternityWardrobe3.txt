 For everyday wear, you may want to treat yourself to a new pair of highly supportive tennis shoes. Structured, supportive shoes will go a long way in reducing potential back pain. You should also look for shoes with no-slip soles for extra balance.
 A pregnancy can cause your body temperature to rise above its usual level; in addition, your quickly stretching skin can generate itches and the extra body weight can increase your sweating. For these reasons, stick to natural fibers like cotton for everyday use, and dress in layers to achieve warmth in cool weather. Synthetic fibers can irritate itchy skin and trap in sweat.

 Use homemade bread, if possible, such as white bread, braided challah bread, or French bread. Slice the bread into six slices, about 1.5 in (3.8 cm) thick. Use a paring knife to cut a horizontal pocket into each slice of bread, taking care not to cut completely through the slice., Use homemade jam, if possible. Mix the jam and softened cream cheese together. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag or a sealable plastic bag.Use any jam or marmalade you like, such as blueberry, orange, or mixed berry.
 Snip off a bottom corner of your sealable bag, if applicable. Squeeze the piping bag to fill the pocket of one slice of bread. Press down around the edges of the bread to secure the sandwich.Use about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of filling for each sandwich.
Repeat this process for each sandwich.
 In a bowl, whisk together a batter of eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla, if desired. Coat the bread on both sides., Place the butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Cook one side of the pocket until it is golden brown, then flip the bread with a spatula and cook the other side equally., You can top the pockets with sprinkled powder sugar, warmed-up jam, or syrup. Try adding a side, like breakfast meat or fresh fruit.

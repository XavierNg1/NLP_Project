 Do the last stitch as you normally would while working in the round. Stop just short of chaining extra to start a new row.
 Cut the yarn about 4-6" from where it comes off the piece you are working on. This extra thread is called the tail.
 Now pull on the loop that you have started until all of the thread comes through and you have a loose tail., Get a yarn needle and thread the tail through the needle.
 Now, you'll have the two sides of your row on the circle, separated by a V shaped gap. Your needle and thread should be on one side: you're going to bring them over to the other. Put the needle just under the first stitch, just past the beginning chain, and pull the tail under both loops.
 Pull the tail to bring the two sides of the V together and close the gap.
 Go back to the last stitch that you made, on the first side. Put the thread through the back loop of that first stitch, from the facing side, and then pull it through. It should now look like a normal chain in the outside row, completely invisible.
 Weave the tail down towards the center a bit and then back up. Weaving in two directions will be necessary to keep the tail from coming loose.

 With feet hip-width apart, lift your right foot and place it on the top of the chair or bench. Place your body weight on your right foot and step up onto the chair or bench.


When both your feet are on the chair, step down with your left foot. Do 10 high step-ups with your right foot, and then switch feet and do 10 high step-ups with your left foot.
 Put your arms out in front of you and flex your core muscles. Lift your left leg slightly off the ground and put all your weight on your right leg.


Squat and lower yourself to as close to sitting as possible. The chair or bench is there to help you, in case you fall, but you should try not to sit on it. Allow your left leg to stay straight while you squat. When you are almost sitting, rise up using both legs.
Do 6 repetitions with each leg. Work up to 10 repetitions with each leg.

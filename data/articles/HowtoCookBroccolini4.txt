 Fill the stockpot with about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of water and bring it to a boil over high heat.

Make sure that you have a steamer basket that fits into the stockpot you use. The steamer basket should not come into direct contact with the water, even after the water reaches a boil.
If you do not have a steamer basket, you could use a metal colander, instead.
 After adding the broccolini, cover the stockpot and steamer basket and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until the broccolini becomes tender.The stockpot needs to be covered for the duration of the cooking process. The steam produced by the boiling water is responsible for cooking the broccolini in this method, and as such, you need to let as much of it build up as possible.
 Transfer the broccolini to a serving platter and add olive oil. You can also sprinkle with lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, if desired. Toss with tongs to coat well and enjoy.

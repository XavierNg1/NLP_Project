, Decide how many calendar days you want to include in your advent calendar. Lay out the appropriate number of matchboxes.Remove the drawer from each matchbox so that you're only decorating the shell. Use a combination of ribbons, washi tape, and decorative paper to decorate each shell.Decorate the front of the drawers to match the shells. You don't have to use identical patterns for the drawers and shells, but make sure they complement each other., Use paints or markers to add numbers to the front of the drawers. Or, if you prefer, cut out some numbers from the scraps of your decorative paper and glue them to the drawers.Feel free to mix and match techniques when making the numbers. Your advent calendar should be a reflection of your creativity.
 Once you've decorated every matchbox, fill them with tiny gifts such as candy, money, or small toys.

Make sure all the drawers are facing the same direction.Place the calendar on a table or counter top, or thread some ribbon through the top box and hang it on the wall.

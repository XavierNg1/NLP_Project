 At first, it's generally easiest to grip the needle between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand. Hold the thread comfortably between the thumb and forefinger of your dominant hand. Raise the needle and the thread up to your eye level, about two inches apart. Make sure that there's plenty of light to see everything clearly!


Consider pinching the thread between your fingers so that only the tiniest tip is visible. If you're having trouble, this technique might help you steady the thread., Line the tip of the thread up with the eye-hole, and make sure that you have a clear view of the hole. Keep your hands steady. Push the thread slowly and surely through the eye-hole until you see it poke through the other side.


Try holding the needle sideways, so that you can't see the eye, but you can see the thread as soon as it peeks through the eye.This may take a couple of attempts. Keep trying! If you're having trouble, try moistening and smoothing the tip of the thread again.
If you keep trying, but you can't get it, consider using a needle with a bigger eye-hole.
 Use your fingertips to carefully tug more of the thread through the eye. Go for at least 10cm (four inches) so that there's little chance of the thread-tip slipping back through.Let this end hang through the needle eye, and shift your attention to the other end of the thread.

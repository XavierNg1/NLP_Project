 This is not the most effective way to reach out to someone, but if youâ€™re really serious about trying to find someone, and if you believe that person may be local to you, you could just run an ad in a local newspaper. Describe the type of car, the reason you are trying to find the person, and a safe way for him or her to contact you.
 If you are looking for the owner of a car that is likely to be a collectible item, or an antique, then you may wish to try this option. There are numerous magazines dedicated to car enthusiasts, and they would likely have a broader circulation than a local newspaper. Try placing a classified ad with a description of the car and driver you are hoping to locate, and include a safe way for him or her to contact you.


Be careful not to post too much private information about yourself. If you set up a meeting with the person you contact, keep it in an open, public location where you will be safe.
 The Internet reaches all over the world. Consider using sites like Facebook, CraigsList, or similar resources to make your search truly wide-reaching. Again, be careful not to put out too much personal information about yourself, and only arrange meetings in safe locations.


If available, you might consider posting a photo of the car in question. For example, suppose a car is illegally parked in your neighborhood, and you're trying to reach out to the owner. Posting a photo of the car on a neighborhood Facebook group might just catch someone's eye.

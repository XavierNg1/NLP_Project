 Draw a straight line tilted slightly to the right. Add a rectangular shape following the line's slope.


If you want a very basic flag for a flier or poster, you can keep it this two-dimensional shape; however, for a more realistic flag you should make waves as seen below.
Add a rectangular shape following the straight line's angle.;
, Imagine actual waves as you're sketching, which arc and bend in a way similar to that of a flag fluttering in the breeze.
 Erase the straight sections remaining between the waves you drew in step 2.
 Make sure you incorporate the fabric that's covered by the flag's position, keeping the pattern consistent with it.
 Fill in every other checker, so it looks like the flag shown.


Your checkers can be a different color than black, or even multicolored--it's up to you how you want your flag to look!

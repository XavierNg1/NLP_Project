 Certain types of apples are more prone to browning than others, so if you're planning on cutting up your apples, go for kind less inclined to brown. Studies conducted on the browning of apples revealed that: "Arangeh tend to brown the least. Granny Smith and Golden Smoty apples also showed minimal browning. Golden Delicious apples were in the middle, and Red Delicious apples browned the most."








, The best way to store cut apples (after using one of the preservation methods listed above) is to place the apple slices in a ziploc bag, seal the bag three-quarters of the way, and draw the air from the bag with your mouth before sealing. Place the bag in the refrigerator until you are ready to eat or serve the slices. They will stay remarkably fresh and crisp.
 If the knife you're using is old, it may be corroded by organic acids and leave deposits of iron salts on the cut fruit. These iron salts can significantly speed up the oxidation process, causing your apple to brown much faster. This is why using a clean, high-quality knife is important in helping to slow down the oxidation process.
 If it's already to late for your fruit this time round, you can attempt to disguise the browning somewhat by sprinkling a little cinnamon on the cut sides of your apple. The flavor of the cinnamon will complement the taste of the apple nicely, while its reddish-brown color may help to disguise the browning. Cinnamon is also a mild antioxidant itself, so a light sprinkling will help to prevent any further browning.
 These methods are not reserved for apples alone, they can be used with any type of fruit that is prone to browning, including bananas, pears, peaches and avocados.

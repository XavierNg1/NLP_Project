 This alone is not always a good indication of whether or not raw chicken is still good because the "Sell By" date only dictates at which point chicken can no longer be sold to consumers. Instead of relying on the "Sell By" date, it is best to use it as a means of confirming whether or not chicken you suspect has gone bad is actually past its prime.









If you purchase fresh, refrigerated chicken from a store and freeze it, it can last up to nine months past this date, as long as it was fresh when purchased., Cooked chicken goes bad faster if it is exposed to air, and improperly stored chicken is more likely to be bad.









Chicken should be stored in shallow, airtight containers or heavy-duty freezer bags.
It could also be wrapped tightly in aluminum foil or plastic wrap.
Example: In order to remain safe to eat, whole chicken should be cut into smaller portions and any stuffing should be removed prior to refrigeration or freezing.
 After these time periods elapse, there is a higher chance that the chicken will have gone bad.









In the refrigerator, raw chicken should be used in one or two days, while cooked chicken stays good for about three to four days.
In the freezer, cooked chicken can remain good and safe to eat for up to four months while raw chicken can be good for up to a year.

Mark only the back or sides of a card.
Make an indentation with your fingernail.
Slightly bend a corner.
Make a small gouge on an edge.
 Play the card, fold, or otherwise send the card out of your hand. Don't worry about letting an important card go, you won't lose track of it.


Don't look at the card as you send it away.
Don't immediately start to track its location in the game.
 Pay attention to where the card is by looking for your mark. Now you can see where the card is whenever it is in play.


Watch for other players who might have the card in their hand.
Plan you plays according to who has the card and how they might use it.
Only glance at your marked card, do not stare, to avoid getting caught.

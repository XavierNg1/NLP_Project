 The U.S. Government offers a tax deduction for the additional cost of purchasing gluten-free products for individuals with diagnosed Celiac disease.
 If your income level qualifies you for local or federal government assistance, apply for a program that allows food purchases at farmersâ€™ markets or provides options for fresh produce, lean protein, and basic whole food items.
 Many health insurers offer free consultations with dietitians or nutritionists who can offer suggestions for budget-friendly gluten-free recipes or local stores.

 Katy is always pairing different textures and fabrics together. Emulate her style by incorporating sparkly leggings and a leather dress with patent shoes.The varied textures allows your outfit to become multi-dimensional.


Add texture by wearing nylons with your shorts or skirt instead of leggings. Nylons are an inexpensive way to add variety to your outfits.
 If you’re a heel person, stick to platforms. Katy loves platform shoes and they not only make a bold statement but are often more comfortable than regular footwear..If you feel heels are too old for you or just aren’t your style, watch for flats in bright colors or wacky accents such as pictures or feathers. Don’t limit yourself to ballet flats. Watch for sandals, slip ons, or slippers., Katy Perry is often seen in a pin-up, retro style.Visit your local second hand stores and look for lace, A-line waists and puffy skirts. If it looks glam or over the top, it works.


Are you less girly? Don’t worry. Retro doesn’t have to mean lace and fluff. Think about high waisted pants or jeans if you’re style favors low maintenance. Another option is khaki green, military-style pants paired with a bold lip., Katy is often seen in either retro or geeky frames. Depending on your daily outfit, try adding some glasses to finish off your look. If you’re going retro, look for white or bold colored glasses in a cat eye shape.When wearing a nerdy look, pick some square and plastic frames in a black or brown color.

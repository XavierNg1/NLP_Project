 Custom molded earplug kits are available that allow you to create your own set of custom molded earplugs at home. These custom molded earplugs can be much more effective and comfortable than other types of earplugs.

You can purchase custom molded earplug kits online and in some stores.;
, The custom molded earplug kit should come with two different types of materials. These materials should be two different colors and packaged separately within the kit. Take each of the materials and break each piece into two equal sized pieces., Next, you will need to mix the different color materials to create the earplug material. Take one piece of each color of the foam materials. Squeeze and knead the foam materials together for a few minutes so that they combine to create one uniform color., After the materials are well-combined, press one piece of the earplug material into each of your ears. Press the material into your ear enough to block the sound, similar to how you would wear other types of earplugs.

The plugs should feel comfortable and not too tight or loose.
 Allow the plugs to stay in your ears for 10 minutes. During this time, the earplug materials will dry and keep their shape. When you remove them from your ears, you will have your own pair of custom molded earplugs.

 Some models have a circular jack pad behind either of the front two tires attached to the chassis. Otherwise, find a solid member of the chassis to apply the jack. On an M3, there is a cross member running from left to right behind the front wheels that is a good place to apply the stand DO NOT jack up your car by applying the jack to a part of the suspension.
 Apply the stand to a solid part of the chassis, then slowly release the jack allowing the car to rest on the stand. Repeat for the other side.
 It will most likely be a 17 mm nut. Place the oil pan beneath the plug. Use a socket wrench to remove the plug and washer. It can help to apply inward pressure on the plug when removing it to avoid spilling hot oil.
 Some people remove the jack stands and lower the car to ensure all of the oil drains as the car is leveled.
 Clean the oil plug and place the new washer that came with the filter on it. Getting back under the car, replace the plug. Do not over tighten. It should be torqued to about 18 feet (5.5 m)-lb. Remove the oil pan and lower the car, removing the jack stands.
 On these cars the filter is under the hood, making it easy to change. Usually it requires a 13-mm socket wrench, but double check to make sure this is the right size. As with any nut, you want to avoid stripping it.
 Replace with your new filter. Apply new, clean oil to the new o-ring before replacing that as well. Torque to around 16 feet (4.9 m)-lb.
 Check with your dealer to see how much oil your car requires depending on the size of the engine. Replace the cap, remove any tools, and start the car. After a few minutes check underneath to ensure that there are no leaks and turn the car off. Check the oil level on the dipstick. It should be between the two notches. If it is too low, add a small amount, run the car again, and shut it off to check the oil level until it is right.
 Do not dump the oil.

 If you have trouble remembering to feed your cat at the same time each day, try setting a reminder on your phone. Although you may not always be able to feed your cat at the exact same time every day, setting daily reminders can help you remain consistent when you can.
 If your entire family takes responsibility for feeding your cat, it may be helpful to create a schedule that details who is responsible for feeding the cat, what time they should feed it, and how much they should feed it. This will help ensure your cat isn’t being double-fed or that its meals aren’t accidentally getting skipped.


Hang the schedule somewhere everyone in the family will see it—maybe on the refrigerator door or next to your cat’s food bowls.
It might also be helpful to have each member of the family put an “X” or slash on the schedule after they feed the cat to ensure the schedule is being followed properly.
 If you are not home consistently or at the same times throughout the day, you can use a timed cat feeder to make sure your cat is getting its meals on a schedule. These feeders will work with either dry, canned, or raw foods. Using a timed feeder can be a big help in keeping your cat on a consistent feeding schedule when you are away for extended or inconsistent periods of time.

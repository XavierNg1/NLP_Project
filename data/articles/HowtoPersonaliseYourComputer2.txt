 Windows gives you a few options if you want to change your desktop image, but if you want a truly personalized wallpaper, then you’ll need to find or make one. First, you’ll need to know what size image you’ll be downloading.


Open up your Display utility. In Windows XP, 7, and 8, open the Control Panel and then open Display. In Windows Vista, open the Control Panel, open Personalization, then click Display Settings at the Bottom.
 For the best looking desktop image, you’ll want one that matches the size of your desktop. This will keep it from stretching or repeating. Look for the slider in the Display window that lists how many pixels the desktop is made of. For example, it might say “1920 by 1080 pixels”. This means that your monitor is displaying an image 1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels in height.
 Use popular image search engines to find a new picture for your desktop. Open the Search Tools, click Size, and then select Exact. Enter in the size of your desktop to only search for images that size. Once you find an image you like, save it to your computer.
 Open up the Personalization tool in the Control Panel. This could be listed in the Appearance and Personalization category, depending on how your Control Panel is set up. From here, open the Desktop Background option. Click Browse… to search your computer for the image you downloaded.


If you didn’t download an image the same size as your desktop, you have the options to stretch it, tile it, or leave it with black borders.

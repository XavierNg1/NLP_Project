 Apply a soothing serum or hair oil to make sure your hair stays straightened. This will condition your hair, cut down on frizz, and keep humidity from unstraightening your hair.








If you use a smoothing serum before blow drying or flat ironing your hair, you can use the same one at bedtime. Just as the serum will protect your hair from the heat of the iron or dryer, it should help protect your hair from the heat and moisture produced on your head while you sleep.
 You want to maintain the straightness of your hair by wrapping it flat around your head and pinning it down. Depending on how much hair you have, section it into manageable sections. Take each section, comb or brush it out, wrap it flat around your head, and then pin it down.


You will need to be strategic about which sections to flatten out first, as you want to build around your head, pinning layers flat on top of other layers.
 To keep your hair flattened and to lessen frizz, you will want to purchase a hair wrap and wrap it tightly around your hair. This may be uncomfortable at first but will help you maintain beautifully straightened hair.


If you don't have a hair wrap, you can use an old pair of nylons instead.Slid the waistband around your head gently,

, If your hair is damp at all, for instance from sweating a bit at night, use a hair dryer to dry it before your take the pins out. Take your wrap off and your pins out gently. Gradually unwind your hair, making sure to remove any kinks made by the overnight pinning.









Apply styling products as you normally would, for instance adding hair oil to give your hair a bit of shine.

 If you are a freelancer, you may not be required to be accountable to anyone. However, thoughtful examination of your work every quarter can help you hone your skills.
 If you are lacking essential skills or knowledge about an issue, take it upon yourself to read a relevant book, enroll in a class or watch a webinar.
 If you know someone in the field that you respect highly, ask the person to go to coffee or lunch, or even a Skype session, to learn how they have managed their professional life.
 Micromanaging others is not an effective way to manage yourself. Delegating when you need to may determine how successful you are.
 It is easier to keep jobs than to find new ones. Managing yourself may involve devoting a portion of your time to speaking with clients or following up with previously completed jobs.

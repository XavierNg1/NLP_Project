 Explain to whomever answers that you've been receiving calls from the number. Politely ask who they are. If they tell you, no need to continue! If they don't, try one of the methods below.


Try having a friend call or using their phone. If you have called repeatedly and gotten no answer, it's possible that the other party is choosing not to pick up your calls. Calling from a friend's phone or a payphone can help rule out this possibility.;
, If you're wrong about the number being a cell phone, it will likely be public information. Search the white pages in the U.S., or use a search engine to find your own area's public database.
 The phone number's owner or associated institutions may have posted the number on a personal or corporate website.


Include the area code of the phone number you're looking for. Try several formats, such as XXX-XXX-XXXX and (XXX)XXXXXXX.
If your first search is unsuccessful, try a few different search engines.
 Enter the phone number in the social network site's search bar. Many Facebook users in particular have privacy settings that still turn up their "private" number in public searches.If you suspect it is someone you have dealings with online, search the site where you exchange chat or information with them, such as on the site's forums.
 Also called "invisible web" search engines, these are designed to find results that more mainstream options pass by.Deep web engines are typically specialized, so you'll need to find one that's useful for your search. Try searching (on a regular search engine) for an index or guide to deep web search engines.

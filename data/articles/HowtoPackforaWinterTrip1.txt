 Instead of packing bulky sweaters and other heavy items, pack with the idea of dressing in layers. To start, pack your base layers. These are actually thin wardrobe items you will put on first when dressing for winter.Go for light short or long-sleeved shirts. Think about what you'll be wearing over your shirts to help you decide what to pack.
If you, say, plan on wearing a button down shirt over a t-shirt, pick a color that goes well with the button-down.
Wools and polyesters are good materials for base layers.;
, Presentation layers are the outermost layers of an outfit besides a coat or jacket. These are the clothes people will see you wearing indoors, so pick items you like.Pick items that are fashionable but can easily conceal base layers. Example includes tunics, light sweaters, and cardigans.
 Once you have your layers in place, add a jacket. Remember, if you're layering, this will keep you warm. Therefore, you do not need to take up suitcase space unnecessarily with a big, bulky jacket.For a warmer destination, you may be able to get by with a light zip-up denim or fleece jacket.
For a colder destination, go for a bigger, bulkier jacket. However, you do not need to pack something like a parka if you're dressing in layers.
 You also want to keep your feet and legs warm. Pack items with this in mind. Jeans and corduroy pants are great presentation layers, as they can easily be worn over things like leggings, tights, and long underwear.You should also pack multiple pairs of warm socks. It's important to keep your feet warm when traveling over the winter.

 Although creating a RAR file requires a copy of WinRar, some third-party programs can unpack and execute RAR files.


Locate a freeware application capable of handling RAR files by performing an Internet search for "open RAR file."

, Set a file association for .rar files during the installation process. When prompted by the installation wizard, place a check in the box labeled ".rar." Once the installation process has completed, the application will unpack, reassemble and play the file automatically.

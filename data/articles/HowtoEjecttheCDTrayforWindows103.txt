 If there are any files or programs open that require the use of your disk drive, Windows will prevent you from ejecting the disk.
 The start button is commonly located on the taskbar at the bottom of the screen with the start button on the left hand side. Your list of drives will appear on the left hand column. If you want a more detailed overview of the drives, click on "This PC," from the left column, then on the right hand side of the window, scroll down and expand the "Devices and Drives" Category.


You can also bring up the File Explorer without the start menu by holding âŠž Win and pressing E., Your disk drive may vary as to which drive letter corresponds to the disk drive you want to open. You can identify the drive you are looking for by a name and icon that changes based on the contents of the disk, either indicating a music CD or software on the disk that is represented by a unique icon. You can eject the disk in two different ways.


Right click the drive icon to bring down a menu of actions to perform on the disk drive. Select "Eject" from the menu to eject the disk drive.
If you are viewing the disk drive from the "Devices and Drives" category on the right hand side of the window, click on the drive to highlight it. On the menu bar at the top of the window shows a menu option that says "Manage" under "Drive Tools". Click on "Manage" then select the "Eject" option from the menu.

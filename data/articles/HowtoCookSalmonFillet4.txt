 You can use both gas and charcoal grills to prepare salmon fillets.


If using a gas grill, preheat the grill to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius).
If using a charcoal grill, spread a layer of charcoal onto the bottom of the grill and light. Allow the coals to burn and smolder for 30 minutes.
 Place each fillet in the center of a piece of aluminum foil. Bring the sides up and fold them together, sealing the packet. Press any raised aluminum foil flat.


If using nonstick aluminum foil, place the salmon fillets on the nonstick side.



Checking the fillets for doneness may be difficult since the foil will be hot to the touch. You may need to wait until after you pull the fish from the grill. If the fillets do not flake easily with a fork or if the center is not opaque, seal the foil again and return to the grill.
 Allow the salmon to sit off the grill and in their foil packets at room temperature for 5 minutes, then serve.

 You can do this by left-clicking it or pressing the game-specific hotkey on your keyboard (i.e., T for Age of Empires 3 and all its expansions, and H for Age of Empires 2 and all its expansions).
 This means that you will have set a gather point for any villagers created by the Town Center inside the building itself.
 With the Town Center selected, a panel will appear in the bottom-left corner of the screen (for Age of Empires 3) or on the bottom-right corner (for Age of Empires 2) with different buttons for the different functions that your Town Center can perform.


The “Train Villager” button is the very first one on the panel—the one with a picture of a workman. Click the button once to train one Villager or many times to train many.
All villagers that are created will automatically garrison inside the Town Center, thus increasing its firing power against invaders.
This strategy is best used when trying to defend the colony in a scenario where you don’t have the resources or buildings to create military. Otherwise, villagers staying garrisoned and idle in the Town Center while they should be working is detrimental to the colony.

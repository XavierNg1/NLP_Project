 The Vrindavan-style is another way of wrapping, tying, and folding the pancha kachcham. It’s often the method used by members of the Hare Krishna.


Hold the fabric horizontally behind you.
Wrap the fabric around your hips and waist, and bring it to the front of your body.
Adjust the fabric so you have equal amounts of fabric on the right and left sides., Pull the fabric taut around your body. Hold the fabric so that you’ve got just enough to wrap around your body. At your navel, tie a knot in the fabric.


Let the rest of the fabric hang loose in front of you., Grab the fabric from the left side. Holding the top left corner of the fabric, reach down and grab the bottom left corner. Let go of the top corner.


Make four-inch (10-cm) accordion pleats in the fabric.
Fold the material back toward the top left corner, so that you fold the entire vertical panel of the fabric back on itself.
 Hold on to the folded fabric so the folds don’t come undone. Pull the material through your legs, making sure to go under the fabric behind your legs.


Tuck the top four inches (10 cm) of the folded fabric into the waistband of the fabric at the center of your back., Grab the fabric on the right side of the knot. Hold the top right corner of the material. Make about six vertical accordion pleats in the fabric, so that you're folding the material back on itself toward your body.


Center the folded material at your waist and tuck the top four inches into the waistband of the fabric., Grab the first two layers of material from the pleated fabric at your front. Hold the layers at the height of your upper thigh. Fold the material up toward your waist and tuck a few inches into the waistband.


When you tuck in the extra fold, tuck it in slightly off-centre, to the left of the original fold.

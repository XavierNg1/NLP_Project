 You'll need a large spade or shovel and three containers (buckets) to help dig up the potatoes.
 Look for the base of the plant and dig 7 inches away from it to ensure you don't stab into the potatoes. There will be about 4 potatoes with each plant.
 If the skin rubs off easily they are called new potatoes. You can place these potatoes back in the ground to toughen up or use them quicker than the hardy potatoes.
 You'll usually get three kinds of potatoes which need to be kept separate; green potatoes, stabbed potatoes and potatoes that are perfectly fine. If you're lucky you'll get all potatoes in good condition but it's not uncommon to get some green potatoes or to accidentally stab one.


Green potatoes need to be chucked out and aren't edible. If they are eaten they will make you sick. Potatoes turn green when they are exposed to the light for too long.
Stabbed potatoes are still good to eat but need to be eaten first. They cannot be stored away otherwise they will rot.

 On your Sprint mobile phone, open your phone’s keypad (either on-screen or physically), and dial *4 on the call screen.
 A voice recording will prompt you what to press next.
 You will then be informed of how many minutes you have left.


Since you won’t get any text messages, it would be best to write down the information given to you by the voice recording so you’ll have a copy.

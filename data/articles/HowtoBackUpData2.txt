 There are programs available for free and programs that cost money, but all offer many of the same basic features. One of the advantages to using a paid program over manually backing up your data is the scheduling and automation options. This allows you to take a hands-off approach to your data backups.Some programs will compress your backed up data to save space while others will mirror it so that it remains accessible at the cost of more space. Some programs offer both options.
 All programs will ask you what files and folders you want to have backed up. Make sure that you have selected all of your important folders, and that you aren’t forgetting stray locations.
 You will still need an external or network drive in order to use these programs. Make sure that it is plugged in before beginning your initial backup.
 The span of time between backups depends a lot on how often you access and edit your files. If you are constantly making changes that need to be saved, you’re better off backing up frequently, as often as every hour. This can be especially important for artists, writers, and financial documents.


Backing up often can put a strain on your computer’s performance. Many people are fine with their backups occurring at off hours when the computer is not in use.






Make sure that your backup location is connected during the scheduled backup.

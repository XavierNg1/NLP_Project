 If you're on birth control pill or are interested in getting a birth control pill subscription, it's possible to use them to delay your period so that it won't come during an inconvenient time. According to the Mayo Clinic, it's safe to delay your period using this method as long as your doctor has determined that it's safe for you to take birth control pills.Talk with your doctor about whether birth control pills are a good option for you, given your health profile.
Birth control pills have side effects for some women, including increased risk of blood clots and other health problems. Do research before deciding to go on the Pill.;
, A set of regular birth control pills is designed to be similar to the menstrual cycle. There are normally 21 hormone pills (composed of the hormones that control your cycle) and 7 placebo pills that don't contain hormones. In a normal pill cycle, when you take the placebo pills, you bleed. If you skip the placebos and go straight to the next pack of hormone pills, that bleeding won't occur.The bleeding that occurs when you take the placebo pills is not the same as the bleeding that happens when you menstruate. It's just a reaction to stopping your hormone intake.Some women experience spotting when they skip the placebos. However, this should go away once your body gets used to the steady hormone supply.
 After the big event has occurred, you should go back to taking your pills as normal. If you don't wish to do so, and you'd rather stop your period altogether, consider getting a prescription for continuous birth control pills.

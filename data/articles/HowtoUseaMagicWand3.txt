Beauty spells. These often encompass height or weight adjustment or improving self-image.
Money spells that focus on wealth, prosperity, power, or good fortune.
Protection spells to shield someone from negative energy, to protect a home or specific place, and to ward off dark magic, for example.
 This is important prior to using a wand. There are several considerations to take into account before casting a spell.


Consider what you plan on calling for--exactly what you want--and think about how this will bring yourself harmony.Determine whether or not your use of the wand will cause harm, and specifically how it will affect others.
 Strokes are simply the movements that you make with your wand. They are a way of bringing your inner intentions to the external world. Different people use a different number of strokes when casting a spell.


It might be helpful to think of each stroke as forming a letter. Some say this is how the word spell came into being—by spelling out your intention with strokes., Incantations are sung spells. The word comes from the Latin stem “canto,” which means to sing. Incantations put out powerful vibrations into the universe, and entrust your will to whatever higher deity you ascribe to., Like anything else, practice is necessary to make a spell work. Sometimes a spell might not come to fruition for a period of years.In other instances, you'll see more imminent results that show your energy manifesting itself in the universe.

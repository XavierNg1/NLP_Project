, It can be disorienting for a hamster to be lifted up out of its cage. To help reduce its anxiety, lower you hand into the cage, and allow it to investigate your hand. It may sniff or lick your hand, or it may even walk right into it. Let it explore your hand for a few minutes. If your hamster isn’t interested at first, keep trying every day.You can help this process by offering the hamster treats in your hand. Place the treat in the palm of your hand, and allow the hamster to come pick it up.Do this for a few days before you try taking it out of the cage.
Do not place your hand on or in your hamster’s bed. It may become territorial and bite., When your hamster has adjusted to its new home, you should wait until it is awake and moving around.

Do not reach for your hamster without first letting it see or investigate your hand for a few seconds.If you grab your hamster without doing this, you risk startling it. You may even be bitten.

 If you haven't done so already: Import your video clip into Windows Movie Maker, then Drag the file onto the timeline along the bottom of the window. If you want to speed up the entire video, just leave it as is. If you want to speed up a specific portion of the video, you'll need to split the video into several clips.
 From the main storyboarding screen, click Tools, then Video Effects.
 Scroll through the various video effect options until you find "Speed Up, Double." Left-click and drag this effect to the timeline version of the video clip that you want to speed up â€“ then "drop" the effect onto the clip. This should double the speed of your video clip.Windows Movie Maker does not have a more precise speed-increase effect than the doubling tool. If you want to do something more advanced, you'll need to find another video editor.
 If you make a mistake, you can simply press Ctrl+Z or click "Undo" to restore the clip to its original speed. You may also apply the "Slow down by half" effect. Navigate to the Video Effects tab again, then drag "Slow down by half" onto the video.


Try right-clicking on the timelined clip, then selecting "Effects." You should be able to see the effects that are currently applied to this clip, and remove any effects that don't fit your purpose.

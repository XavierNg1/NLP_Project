 Its thickness should be at least 0.10 mm (0.0039 of an inch).
 While calcium oxide is usually used on sailboats for de-humidification, this chemical can go hard on your laptop. Instead, get some silica gel desiccant. Better yet, get a drying agent with a safe organic indicator which changes its color from orange when active to green when saturated. This makes it much easier to know when your laptop has had all the humidity removed from its inner workings.
 Turn the laptop off. Place in into the plastic bag together with enough desiccant. Leave it like this when not the laptop is not in use. This includes when docked at port because your laptop is still over water.


The desiccant usually comes in small paper bags. It is really important the the desiccant does not come into direct contact with the laptop, so if it is not already covered in a bag, add one before placing it in with the laptop.
 While the laptop is on, humidity is not a problem as moisture accumulates only on surfaces that are at lower temperature than the ambient air is. It is only when it is not being used that moisture becomes a problem.
 Calculate the amount you'll need to bring with you for the duration of your sailing trip.

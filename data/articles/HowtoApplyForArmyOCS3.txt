 As an applicant to OCS, you will be asked to select which branch of the army you would like to serve as an officer in. Most active combat branches are eligible for selection, but “special service” branches require candidates to directly contact the head of that branch.


Your branch choice will be considered, but you will ultimately be placed in a branch that the army selects, based on its need for officers.
 OCS basic training is different for candidates inside and outside of the military. For those coming from the private sector to OCS, they will be enrolled in a nine week course designed to give them the basic military training they need. Candidates who are already active service members will have completed this step and will not need to complete basic training again., OCS for individuals coming from outside the military is a standard, twelve week course held in Fort Benning, GA. For active service members stationed overseas, the OCS program will not bring you home until you have completed your service. , OCS training is broken down into 2 phases. Phase 1 consists of leadership training, designed to bolster and test your physical and mental toughness in theoretical leadership situations. Phase 2 consists of an evaluation of leadership skills in actual field environment tests. This phase is designed to assess how you react to stress in actual battle environments., During OCS, you will be staying in 2 to 3 person rooms with other candidates and will share facilities, like showers, toilets, and public areas, with other candidates.


Candidates applying for OCS in the infantry branch may be able to get the army to pay to relocate their families to Fort Benning. However, most branches of the army will not cover family relocation costs.
While not in practice at this time, OCS may require all OCS candidates, coming from both inside and outside the military, to complete a Basic Officer Leadership Course in the future.

Avoid phrases like, “I don’t know about this” or “Maybe we shouldn’t”. Your meaning can be misinterpreted.
You might say, "When I say no, I mean it. Don't keep asking me or trying to change my mind. If or when I am willing, I'll let you know.
With a spouse or partner you could try, "When you ask me to have sex so often, I feel pressured and uncomfortable. Please stop."
If they keep pushing, keep saying ‘no’. This is called the "broken record" technique. The person can't continue pressing without looking like an enormous jerk.;
, Sometimes your words can say one thing, but your body language says something different. Communicate that you want them to stop pressuring you to have sex by using your tone of voice, posture, and other non-verbal cues.Telling them and making sure your actions match your words will make your message clear.


Stand up (or sit up) straight and tall. Hold your head up and relax your shoulders. This posture will increase your confidence.
If you need to, take a step or two back to put some physical space between you and the person.
Look the person in the eyes. Without smiling, speak using a clear, calm, firm voice.
 In some cases, even when you firmly say ‘no’ with your words and actions, the person doesn’t stop pressuring you. In these cases, deal with the pressure by leaving the situation as quickly as you can.Leaving, even if only for a minute or two, can lower the intensity of the moment and give the other person a chance to think about what they’re doing.


Excuse yourself to the bathroom or to get a bottle of water. If you go back to the situation, keep some physical distance between you and the person.
Lying isn’t usually recommended. However, if it is the only way for you to get away from someone that won’t stop pressuring you for sex, then lie.
You might glance at your phone and then say, “I have to go. My mom just texted me to come home.”

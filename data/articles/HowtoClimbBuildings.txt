, Scan the building for drain pipes or solid ledges that can hold your weight. When climbing, you will need to find safe handholds and footholds that you can grip. If the building has too few, you may need to search for another one to climb.
 Search for a spot where there are the most climbing holds above you. Plan a route that takes you to your destination, as well as a method for entering the desired place whether it be through the roof or an open window. Once you have figured out a plan, begin at a starting point, such as a sturdy drain pipe.

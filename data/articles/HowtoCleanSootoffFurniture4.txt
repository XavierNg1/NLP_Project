 Position the nozzle directly above the soot, but do not allow it to touch the surface of the upholstery. Do not use any attachment, either, especially not the brush attachment. Soot stains develop more easily in fabric than in finished wood, so the brush attachment is more likely to rub the soot further in and may pose more harm than good.
 Removable elements usually include cushion covers, throw blankets, and pillowcases on decorative throw pillows. If these are all washable elements, tossing them into a warm wash cycle may be enough to remove any soot damage. Liquid detergents often prove the most effective at cleaning away soot, followed by a combination of powder detergent and bleach.


Note that you may need to wash these coverings several times before the soot comes out completely.
 If soot has gotten onto parts of the upholstered furniture itself—for instance, the side of the soda—you may be able to blot out the soot with a rag drenched in a solution of hot water and liquid degreasing detergent. Do not use plain water, since the oily soot stain will only smear with plain water. Do not scrub, either, since scrubbing may cause the stain to worsen.
 If you have delicate fabrics that cannot be washed in your machine or that cannot stand against household detergents, you may need to turn them over to professionals. Take removable coverings to the laundromat and hire professional cleaners to come to your house and take care of non-removable upholstery.

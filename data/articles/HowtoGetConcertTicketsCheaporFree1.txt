 Check the website for a band you know is coming to your city or town and search to see if they have a street team. Join a street team to promote the concert by putting up posters, telling your friends, and sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. You’ll be “paid” with free tickets to the show, and sometimes the chance to win VIP passes or merchandise.;
, Search the internet for a seat filler company in your city. Join for a reasonable monthly fee to get free tickets to a wide variety of concerts, local theater, comedy, sports, expos, etc. as a way of helping venues fill their unsold seats.Seat filler memberships give you access to a large variety of events, not just concerts, and you won’t know too far ahead of time what’s available. It might not be the service for you if you’re looking only for specific events, venues, or seating., Check a band or music festival’s website several months in advance of the event date to see if they are asking for volunteers. Apply to volunteer if you have a flexible schedule, and you’ll get to attend the concert for free.


If you have experience with music equipment, sound, or lighting, you may also be able to get a gig helping out the band or venue with setup or cleanup. Check the band’s website or give the venue a call.

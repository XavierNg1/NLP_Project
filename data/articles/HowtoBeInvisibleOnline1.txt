 Every browser has an Incognito feature that disables your browser or other websites from getting your browsing information, such as the sites you frequently visit, your username, and even passwords.


Open your browser’s menu and inside you’ll find its Incognito feature. Developers make this feat easy to access by making it readily available to users that are not tech-savvy.;
, If you’re using chat programs like Skype or Facebook Messenger, you can adjust the settings of these programs to set your chat availability as “Invisible.” This means that while you’re still online, people who have you in their contact lists will see you as not available or offline.


You can still receive their messages, but you don’t have to respond right away.
Like Incognito, this feature is also very easy to use and access. It’s commonly located on your account profile, chat window, or beside the message text field of the chat application you’re using.
 If you can’t use an Invisible feature, sign out completely. If the chat application you’re using—by any chance—doesn’t give you the option to go invisible, just sign out from it completely. Hit the “Log out” button to go offline. You’ll still be receiving messages and can read them later anyway.

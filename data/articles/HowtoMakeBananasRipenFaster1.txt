 Bananas produce ethylene gas, a hormone that triggers ripening.Keep them in a paper bag to trap more of this gas near the fruit.


Avoid paper bags with a clay or waxy coating, which may absorb the ethylene.A plastic bag blocks oxygen from reaching the fruit, which can sometimes lower the production of ethylene.;
, All your bananas need to ripen is a bag, some warmth, and their own ethylene. However, you can add other fruit if you have it. Some other fruits also release ethylene, ripening nearby fruits. The best options are apples, pears, apricots and similar pit fruits, avocados, kiwi, and quince.Other bananas will help as well, but the effect is low unless they're already ripe.


Use the ripest fruit you can find, or cut the fruit to encourage more ethylene production.
Even other fruits, leafy vegetables, and tubers sometimes produce ethylene if they are severely wounded.If you have no other options, cut them many times and add them to the bag.
 Heat significantly speeds up ripening in bananas. The ideal ripening temperature for flavor and texture is about 65–68ºF (18–20ºC).This is about room temperature in a heated home. Keeping it in a warmer location, such as on top of the fridge or over the stove, may speed up ripening. The result might be less evenly ripe, but this shouldn't matter much for home use.
 Low humidity may slow ripening or affect flavor.If the weather is dry, run a humidifier in your kitchen, or leave out shallow pans of water.


However, you should keep your bananas away from damp areas, which may encourage mold. Nearby water is fine, but a very moist and enclosed area is not the right environment.
 The bananas will usually ripen within 48 hours, but it can take several days if the bananas are still green. Check once or twice a day, since the fruit stored with the banana will quickly become overripe.

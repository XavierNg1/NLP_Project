 You can use any type of white body lotion you'd like. You can also use Aloe Vera gel or even sunscreen.
 You can find them online or in well-stocked beauty supply stores. If you do not have any mica powders, you can try using some loose bronze or gold eye shadow, or ground cinnamon/nutmeg/coca powder. Some people find that the ground cinnamon/nutmeg/cocoa powder combination, however, leaves their skin streaky., You can use any scent you'd like, but consider using something that smells sweet (like brown sugar or vanilla) or tropical (such as coconut or pomegranate). Do not add the oil if your lotion is already scented; you might end up with a combination that does not smell good.
 You can use a spoon, mini spatula, or a mini whisk. Try to stir using a rolling motion, so that you bring the ingredients from the bottom of the bowl to the top.
 You can also use one of those empty, travel-size shampoo bottles. Use a spatula to scoop the lotion from the bowl and into the new container.
 Spread the lotion over your arms and legs whenever you want that healthy, sun-kissed look.

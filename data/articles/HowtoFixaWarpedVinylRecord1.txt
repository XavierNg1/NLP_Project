 These objects need to be wide enough to cover the entirety of the record. They need to be heavy enough to put pressure on the record without warping it further. Two large books are best for this purpose.;
, Put the first object on a flat surface, such as a table. Put the record atop the object, followed by your second heavy object. Make sure the objects cover as much of the record as possible; if any part sticks out, they may be warped.


Before you place the record between the two objects, ensure it is clean. The last thing you want is a grain of sand grinding a scratch into your record., This is perhaps the longest method you’ll use. You’re relying on constant, gradual pressure to un-warp your record, and this will take some time. Prepare to wait for days, maybe even weeks for the record to un-warp.

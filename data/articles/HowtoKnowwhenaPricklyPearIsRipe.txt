 At the early stage (March-June), a prickly pear will look green. At this stage, it is not even close to being ripe. Closer to July, there will be a slight color change, as the base starts to turn orange to red. This denotes that the ripening process is on its way.
 At this point, the pear will appear red to orange or reddish-purple in color. This denotes that the prickly pear is ripe., The glochids are the long spines on the fruit, with smaller ones at the base. When these start to fall off or loosen, the fruit is ripe., When the fruits reach a size of around 2 to 3 inches, they are considered mature (along with the correct coloring changes)., The prickly pear should be firm but not rock hard when gently pressed; it should be slightly yielding.

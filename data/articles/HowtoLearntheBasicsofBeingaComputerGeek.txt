Example: say there's a bunch of movies on your brother's laptop, you could go there, copy them on a flash drive then bring them back, but why should you? Computers are powerful now right, I shouldn't have to leave my room.
 Think about it: you probably have Wi-Fi. You can configure your network to allow sharing between different computers, so why not? It beats the flash drive option.
 This is where Google is your best friend, once you know what you're looking for Google fills in all the gaps. You can find guides, books and demonstrations of almost anything.
 You've just learned a new skill, how to share movies on a network. Why stop there? Find out other things you can do over your network. Share photos, stream music, remote control his laptop and the list goes on.
 As you attempt these things your knowledge will grow, you will become more comfortable with computers and in time be able to do things that leave others speechless. It's a truly awesome feeling., That is the thing which you will need to learn new things. Fiddling with Google is the best.

 Use a microfiber duster, soft cloth, or feather duster to remove any dust or dirt that has accumulated on the surface.


Try a duster with small nubs, feathers, or texture that will help get into the small cracks of the wicker weave.
 Use a vacuum with a brush attachment on the hose to gently remove dust from on and inside the weave of your wicker.


Make sure the vacuum is at a low suction setting to avoid damage, and brush it gently across the surface of the wicker.
For larger dirt, dust, or other objects stuck in the wicker, try using a pair of tweezers or needle-nose pliers to remove it., Remove dust and dirt from between the weave of your wicker by sweeping a cleaning brush gently across the surface.


Try a paintbrush or even a toothbrush for smaller, hard-to-reach areas.Make sure to use any brush lightly, so as not to disrupt or dislodge any of the wicker.
Avoid steel wool or any brush with stiff bristles, as these can damage natural wicker or remove lacquer, paint, or weatherproofing from treated wicker.

 Our bodies get accustomed to diet and exercise routines very quickly. Keeping your body guessing by switching up your fitness plan will help you overcome plateaus and prevent weight gain.


Alternate between eating 6 small meals one day and 3 bigger meals the next.
Switch off between cardio and strength training exercises throughout the week.
 Weight loss can often trigger the desire to binge, or overeat. The best way to avoid binging is to eat the things you crave in moderation. If you constantly deprive yourself, you will be much more likely to have binging episodes.
 If you have lost weight, then your stomach has probably shrunk, meaning you need less food to feel full. Listen to your body, and only eat as much as you need to feel full. If you go back to your old eating patterns after reaching your goal weight, you will definitely gain some, if not all, of the weight back.
 If you are constantly suffering, you will eventually give up on your diet and exercise plan--it's only natural. Find a lifestyle that you feel comfortable with.


Choose an exercise that you enjoy. If you are having fun, you will be much more likely to stick with it in the long term.

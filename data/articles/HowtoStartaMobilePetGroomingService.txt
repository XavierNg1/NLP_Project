Most larger cities have at least 1 local pet-grooming school. Grooming school teaches you how to bathe a pet and how to trim the coats of different breeds. For example, you'll learn how to clip a poodle and strip an Airedale terrier.
Part of your education will include hands-on practice grooming dogs and cats.;

Your biggest expense will be a van or small motor home large enough to accommodate a grooming table and tub.
A mobile grooming service is a grooming shop on wheels. Therefore, you need to retrofit the van with a grooming table, a tub, a water supply tank and pump, a generator and secure storage for your grooming supplies.
You may have received basic grooming tools for pet care as part of your education. Take stock and purchase any additional clippers, scissors, brushes, combs and towels that you may need.
Stock up on shampoos, conditioners, eye drops, styptic powder and other consumable products.



You may need to register the business and receive a permit for a mobile pet-grooming business.
 If so, apply for the appropriate license.



You should insure the van and its contents.
You may also wish to purchase liability insurance in case you have a mishap while grooming a dog or cat.



Let your friends and family know that you offer pet care.
Visit veterinarians in your area and tell them about your mobile grooming van.
Ask independent pet supply stores if you can leave some flyers for their customers. You could even offer to set up the van in their parking lot and offer grooming specials to their customers.

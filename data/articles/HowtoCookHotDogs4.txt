 This method of cooking hot dogs results in juicy, blackened hot dogs. They taste about as close as you can get to grilled hot dogs without the inconvenience of lighting up the grill.
 Use a sharp knife and cut on a stable surface, since hot dogs can be slippery. Do not slice through the hot dogs themselves; just make a cut that will serve as a vent in the surface of the hot dogs.
 The hot dogs will drip as they release juices, so you may want to line the pan with aluminum foil for easy clean up.
 Place the roasting pan in the oven and let the hot dogs cook until the skin begins to brown and the dogs begin to curl gently.


Brown the hot dog by turning on the broiler if you prefer your hot dogs crispy.
Add cheese and place the hot dogs back in the oven for an additional minute, if desired.
 Carefully take the hot dogs out of the oven and place them on buns. Oven-roasted hot dogs pair wonderfully with chili and cheese. Scoop chili on top and sprinkle on some cheese, then serve the hot dogs with forks.

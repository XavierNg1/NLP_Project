 Sometimes, One Direction have book signings at WHSmith or Waterstone. If you have the money to buy a book and get it signed, you can go wait in line and maybe get a photo.
 If you can't make it to a concert, try to get into the crowd when they perform on morning talk shows or on MTV performances and hang out outside.
 The fan club will keep you updated on concert opportunities in your area, and might even clue you into some meeting possibilities and VIP ticket packages that aren't made available for regular fans.

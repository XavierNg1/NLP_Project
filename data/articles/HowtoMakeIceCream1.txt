 Pour 3 cups (710 ml) of whole milk into a medium pot and place it on the stove. Heat the milk on medium-high for about 5 minutes or until it comes to a simmer. Take it off the heat as soon as bubbles form on the surface, and allow it to cool.You can substitute heavy cream or a combination of whole milk and heavy cream if you prefer.
Be careful not to let the milk to boil over.
This recipe will make a basic vanilla ice cream base. If you want to create a specific ice cream flavor, you can add herbs such as lavender, coffee beans, or even chocolate into the milk to steep or melt into it.;
, Add 8 egg yolks, 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, and a pinch of salt to a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until a thick paste forms., Once the milk has cooled to room temperature, which should take about 10 minutes, slowly pour it to the egg mixture in a steady stream. Stir the milk in gently until it is fully incorporated., When the egg mixture and milk are fully combined, return it to the pot. Place it back on the stove over medium-low heat. Stir the mixture in an “S” shape so you can scrape the bottom of the pot, and allow it to cook until it reaches 170°F (77°C).Check the mixture’s temperature with a candy or deep fry thermometer.
You can also tell that the base has cooked enough when it is thick enough to cling to the back of your spoon.
 Place a wire mesh strainer over a bowl that’s set in a larger bowl filled with ice water. Pour the ice cream base through the strainer and into the smaller bowl to remove any lumps. Next, mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla and stir well.You can substitute a fresh vanilla bean for the extract if you prefer. Cut the bean in half and scrape the seeds out to mix them into the base.
 Once the ice cream base is fully mixed, cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator, and chill it for 3 hours or overnight.

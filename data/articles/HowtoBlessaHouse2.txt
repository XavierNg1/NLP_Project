 It is important to clean and de-clutter your home before you perform a house blessing. This will put you in a more positive frame of mind and invite fresh energy into the home.
 It's a nice idea to invite friends and family to share in the house blessing ritual with you. Ask them to stand in a circle and join hands.
 Pink symbolizes love and kindness, and will invite these energies into your home.
 Pass the pink candle to each person in the circle. Whoever is holding the candle should share their blessings for the home and homeowners. Example blessings include "may this home be a sacred dwelling for you and your family" or "may those who enter this home feel peace and love".
 After the blessing, you may want to carry the pink candle into each room of the house and state your intention for it, whether it's the bedroom, the baby's room or the kitchen.
 When the ceremony is complete, place the pink candle in a central location in the house and allow it to burn for at least an hour.
 This allows the life-giving energy of the sun to stream into your home, bringing energy, life and light.

Common warts mostly tend to be found on the hands and plantar warts are found on the soles of the feet., The HPV virus can be easily passed from one person to another. You can also re-infect yourself by touching your wart and then touching another part of your body. Warts can also be spread by sharing towels, razors, or any other personal items that come into contact with the wart.


Some people seem more likely to get warts than others.

They can come in many different shapes and sizes. Warts tend to be painless, though some plantar warts that can make walking difficult. Warts on the fingers can also be uncomfortable because they are used and irritated more frequently.

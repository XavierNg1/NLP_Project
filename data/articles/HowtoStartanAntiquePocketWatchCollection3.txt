 Ideally, you want to store each pocket watch in its own individual bag in a secured place where it’s not going to fall or have anything damage it. Storing other items in the bags can scratch the pocket watch and hurt its value. Some plastics contain chemicals which corrode metal and other material over time, so avoid using plastic bags.Don't store your antiques in damp or humid places because the moisture could damage the internal parts of the watch.
If the watch has a face, make sure to close it when you store it. Place the watch face up.
 In many cases the cost of repairing a watch is more than the cost of the watch itself. Examine the outside of the watch to see if there are any rough abrasions or scratches. Damage on the outside indicates potential damage with internal components. Take out the watch movement and and look for any missing springs or screws which would indicate that it hasn’t been repaired in a long time. Try winding and setting the watch. The dials should turn smoothly and not jerk while you are turning them. If you hear grinding, there is probably an issue with the internal components. If the watch is fully wound but not running, then something is broken on the watch and it needs to be repaired.Avoid rust at all costs because it indicates that the inside parts may be rusted as well.
 Avoid abrasive or acidic cleaners that may destroy the quality of your watch. Using metal polishers and cleaners that are made specifically for the type of metal that your watch is made of. Remember to use a lint free cloth, and don't get your pocket watch wet.


If you use a glass cleaner for the face of your watch, make sure it is alcohol and ammonia free.
If you never clean your pocket watch, dust may settle in the internal components and build up over time.

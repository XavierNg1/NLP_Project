Printing photos: Inkjet printing can blend colors more smoothly to print photos with enhanced tones and hues.
Using different types of paper for printing: Paper jams are usually less common in inkjet printers. You can print on regular office paper as well as textured paper or even print on iron-on transfer sheets using an inkjet printer.
Mobile printing: Inkjet printers are easier to move around because they are smaller in size and lighter in weight.
Low-cost printing: Inkjet printers generally cost less to purchase and maintain.
 Laser printers offer the following advantages in comparison to inkjet printers.


Better black text printing: Laser printers give better results when printing in only 1 color.
Speed: Laser printers usually have a higher page per minute (PPM) speed.
Bulk printing: Most laser printers allow you to feed many pages through a paper feeding tray so you can print documents with many pages. Most feeding trays can hold 150 or 250 sheets of paper.;

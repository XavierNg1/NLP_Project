 Turn the pill bottles upside down. Obtain a small wooden ball with a diameter equivalent to that of the pill bottle’s top. Paint the ball a flesh tone, then glue it on the top of the pill bottle using a glue gun. The ball will represent the caroler’s head.After the flesh-toned paint has dried, use a fine-tipped black brush to give the caroler eyes, a nose, and a mouth.
 Fold a pipe cleaner in half and twist it tightly around itself. Glue the pipe cleaner to the area just beneath the rim of the pill bottle using your glue gun. Bend the pipe cleaner around the pill bottle and clip it using wire cutters to a proportional length. Usually, you won’t need the pipe cleaners to be longer than 2.5 times the diameter of the pill bottle., Cut a tube of cloth from some old cloth scraps. Cut enough cloth to cover the pill bottle caroler on all sides. Cut a hole the center of the upper portion of the cloth you’ve selected for the caroler’s cloak. The hole should have a diameter just slightly smaller than that of wooden ball you situated atop the pill bottle. Wrap the cloth around the caroler and glue or sew it securely in the back.Take care to gently cover the pipe cleaner arms and arrange the hole you cut in such a way that leaves visible a portion of the ball’s surface.
 Cut a small piece off an old songbook (a caroling songbook, preferably) and fold it in half so that it resembles a miniature songbook. Glue this songbook scrap to the miniature caroler’s outstretched arms.

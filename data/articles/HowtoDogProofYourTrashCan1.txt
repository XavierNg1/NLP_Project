 Instead of a plastic trash can, use a heavier metal can with a lid for your garbage. Small plastic cans are easy to tip over, even if they're hard to reach and relatively clean. This can make that garbage pretty tempting for your dog.


Metal cans don't have to look industrial. Lots of sleek, modern looking metal trash cans are available at most home goods stores. These are difficult to tip over and look great in your kitchen.;
, The lid of the can is the most important part. If your can already has a lid and your dog can still get into it, you might consider weighting it with something on top to keep things in place.


Use a heavy book, a break rotor, or a couple of plates on the top of the can. That thing won't move.
 Lots of trash cans are available with closeable lids, operated by foot pedals, or little latches that you can open quite easily. They can get pretty fancy. If your dog's tenacious about nosing open the trash, even if you've got a lid on it, these can be a great dog-proofing mechanism.
 The high-end of garbage technology is the motion-activated can, which will only open with the wave of a hand or a touch in the proper spot. If you want to make sure your trash can outsmarts your dog, this is the way to go.


The downside is that these can be pretty expensive, and are still always susceptible to tipping. They're usually a bit heavier, but if you have a really big dog, it's probably still able to knock it over.
 Some dogs are big fans of tissues and other hygiene products that end up in your bathroom trash, and these trash-diggings can sometimes go unnoticed for longer. Make sure these trash cans have lids as well, or are placed high enough so your dog can't get to them.

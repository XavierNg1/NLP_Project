 If you suspect that your child has swallowed any kind of battery, immediately take them to the emergency room or contact emergency services. Batteries can do damage to a child’s body in a short amount of time.Don’t wait for any symptoms to develop before taking your child to the emergency room. Take them immediately before any damage can start.
 If you believe your child has swallowed a battery, you may think that you should make your child vomit so they can get it out of their system. You should not do this or give the child anything to make them vomit. Moving the battery can lead to increased risk of harm.You should also not give your child anything to make them go to the bathroom. Batteries can pass through stools, but you should not try to force this to happen.
 You should not give your child anything to drink or eat to try and force the battery through the body. When a battery is in the esophagus, it has the potential to do severe damage.Giving the child something to drink or eat can move the battery or cause a negative reaction that can burn or severely injure your child’s insides. It could also interfere with a doctor's methods of getting the battery out.
 If your child has swallowed a battery and it is stuck in their throat, you may think that you should give your child the Heimlich maneuver to try to remove it. You should not do this because it can move the battery, which can cause severe damage, cause it to get stuck somewhere else, or make it an even more serious choking hazard.Batteries also present a choking hazard, which needs to be dealt with by medical professionals.
If your child is having difficulty breathing or is actively choking, you should call 911 and consider trying the Heimlich maneuver (or an age-appropriate method, for babies). You should follow the appropriate choking guidelines for the child's age and level of consciousness.

 Bowser will transform into a snake. Change the view to the Overview by pressing the X button. This makes following his moves more easier.
 Before he can do this, quickly run up to him and punch the golden block. After a couple of hits, move away. Be ready for his spread shoot, as he will shoot two fireballs sideways and one forwards.

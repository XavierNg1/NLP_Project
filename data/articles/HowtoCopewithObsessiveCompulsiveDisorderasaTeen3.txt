 Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you recognize how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors work together to improve your functioning. CBT also teaches problem-solving skills, stress management, and realistic thinking and relaxation. Some therapy might also include a strategy called "exposure and response prevention," which helps you find new ways to look at obsessions and compulsions and how to respond to them differently.Find a therapist through your insurance, local mental health clinic, or from a recommendation from a physician, friend, or family member.
 Support groups are a good place to share your experiences, learn from others, and know that you aren't the only one experiencing OCD. It can be comforting to meet other teens who have similar difficulties as you do and know that you are not alone.Find a local support group in your community by contacting an area mental health clinic. You can also join an online community support group.
 If you struggle with OCD while at school, you may be able to get help or assistance. You may get accommodations to help you perform better or to have more time on tests. Talk to a teacher and your parent or guardian about wanting some help at school. They will work on your behalf to meet your needs while at school.Within the USA, these meetings are called 504 or IEP (individualized education plan) meetings.
 Most people with OCD benefit from medications and itâ€™s an integral part of treatment. You may wish to work with a psychiatrist to track your obsessions and compulsions throughout your medication treatment. A psychiatrist can help you monitor your progress, make changes to your medication, or change medications as necessary.


Only use your medication as directed by your prescriber.
While some side-effects may occur, speak with your prescriber if you experience unpleasant side-effects as you can change the dose or use a different medication.

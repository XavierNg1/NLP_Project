 Use your foot to push down on the lever near the rear wheels. While the lever is in its lowest position, it should prevent the wheels from moving.;
, On some stroller models, the front wheels may also have a locking mechanism to prevent them from swiveling. First, push the stroller a few paces forward to put the wheels in the forward position. Then, look for a small lever between the front wheels. If present, it may need to be pushed up or down, depending on the model, to lock the wheels in position., Tug gently on the canopy, if opened, to pull it back into folded position.
 Push the seat backward to recline it as far as it will go. On some models, you may need to undo latches on the side of the seat before this is possible.
 Check the right and left sides of the stroller for a small handle, somewhere near the seat base or wheels. Some models simply fold when this handle is tugged in a particular direction, while others require a button in the center of the handle to be pushed and held down as you fold.
 You should now be able to fold the stroller together simply by pushing the back and seat together. Grip the lower handle if there is one. If necessary, tug the lower frame near the wheels to start the folding, then withdraw your hand from that area to avoid pinching your fingers in the folding frame. Finish pushing from the top handle and the seat base.

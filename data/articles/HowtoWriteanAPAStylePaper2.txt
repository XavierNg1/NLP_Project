 Prepare it by centering the title roughly one-third of the way down. The title should not exceed 12 words. Hit "Return" or "Enter" and then type your name. Underneath your name, include your university or institution of learning.


Everything should be double-spaced and centered. Your title should contain no filler words or abbreviations.
If you have any "Author's Notes," place them at the bottom of this page. This could include information on any grants received or where correspondence should be issued to., This "head" is a condensed version -- not to exceed 50 characters -- of your paper's title. The uppercase words "RUNNING HEAD: " should appear as the first page header and be left justified.


You'll need a header on every page. After the title page, do not include "RUNNING HEAD." Just the title of your work is required. Flush right should be the page number, again on every page.

 Obtain the minor name change form that is used in your county of residence from your county circuit court. Complete the application as completely as you can, leaving the date and clerk signature fields blank. You must have the form verified via affidavit signed by both parents.Should both parents not submit the petition together, or should the identity or location of a parent be unknown, the petition needs to be specific with all facts, which includes efforts to identify or contact the non-petitioning parent.
If there is no father on the birth certificate, you must complete legitimation proceedings prior to filing the Petition for Change of Name Minor form.
Service of process is required for any non-petitioning parent.
 You will need copies of the minor's original birth certificate, as well as those of both parents, social security cards and official photo identification of both parents, a photograph of the minor and his or her social security card. These documents will be submitted to the court along with the petition.Have original/certified copies available along with photocopies to be sure you have the required copies to submit to the circuit court.
 Both parents and the minor must appear in court. If one parent is a non-petitioner, they must be served with notice of the name change via service of process. In such a case, the court may grant the name change of the minor without requiring both parents to attend the hearing. Provided there is sufficient evidence that the name change is what is best for the minor, the petition should be granted.

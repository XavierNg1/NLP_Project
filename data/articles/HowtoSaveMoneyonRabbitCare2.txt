 Buying a commercially made rabbit hutch or cage can be expensive. Instead, find plans online and build your own. Depending on the specific plans, you will only need basic carpentry tools and supplies that can be bought at your local home improvement store.When you don't pay for a commercially made hutch, and you build one instead, you are basically eliminating paying for labor. Instead, you are doing the labor of building the hutch or cage yourself.
 Not all supplies for a rabbit need to be bought from a pet or farm supplier. Instead, find products that can be used for a variety of purposes at stores that are not just for pets. For example, cleaning supplies, such as white vinegar, can be bought at any store and they are often cheapest at a big box or discount store. Vegetables, which should be included daily in your rabbit's diet, can be bought from a wide variety of stores.For products that are commonplace, such as white vinegar, be willing to buy generic brands. Be careful, however, about buying generic if the products will actually be of poor quality.
 More so than with food, supplies for a rabbit can often be bought in bulk. You can buy supplies through a wholesaler in bulk, paying way less than you would at a pet supply store. This can be done easily if you buy through a wholesaler already, for instance if you buy farm supplies already you can buy your timothy hay through that same wholesaler.Try going in on supplies with other bunny owners. If you can't justify buying in bulk for just one rabbit, search for others that own rabbits and are also looking to save money.
Buying through a wholesale supplier cuts out the middle man, making products cheaper because they are not marked up by an additional business.

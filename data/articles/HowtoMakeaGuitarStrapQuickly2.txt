 Find any belt that's comfortable and sturdy., The method depends on the belt. If it has a lot of holes, is sturdy and can fit the end pin, put it directly on; by the way, remember it must fit you. If it is made out of strong, comfortable material but has no holes that fit the end pin, put a rope on one of the belt holes, on one end, and put some on the buckle, on the other end. Tie a good knot and strap it on. Make sure it is secure., Be careful, belts break, like a heart. If used wrongly it will eventually break to pieces.

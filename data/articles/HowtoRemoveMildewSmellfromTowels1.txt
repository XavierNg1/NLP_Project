 Place your smelly towels in the washing machine and start the wash cycle using the hottest water setting available. Add in about one cup of white vinegar and one cup of baking soda.For now, leave out detergent or fabric softener.
You can also try washing your towels with just vinegar or just baking soda if you do not have one of these ingredients.;
, Stop the machine after everything is well mixed. Then, allow the towels to soak in the baking soda and vinegar solution for about one hour. After the hour is up, turn the machine back on and allow the cycle to complete.
 Next, you will need to run the wash cycle again, but this time add a cup of vinegar and your usual laundry detergent. Use the same amount that you would usually use for a load and allow the cycle to run through as usual, except with an extra spin cycle.


You can either select “extra spin cycle” if your machine has this feature or restart the spin cycle after the first one finishes.
 As soon as the second spin cycle finishes, put the towels into the dryer. Turn your dryer on the highest setting and run it until the towels are completely dry. Then, run the towels through the dryer for a second time.

 Divide that number by four. The final number is the number of sheets of paper you will use (not including your cover). For example, if you want a pocketbook with 20 pages, you´ll need 5 sheets (20:4).;
, You could use regular paper, but it is recommended that you use at least a thicker paper, like cardstock, or a cloth or other fabric of some kind.
 If it isn't, cut it so that they are the same size.
 Put one of the cardstock halves aside. You can use it for another notebook.
 Fold them in half. Just fold, don´t cut. Experiment to find a pocketbook with a shape you like.
 This is the hardest part. You have a pretty thick stack of paper, and if you used cloth for your cover it's even thicker, but you're going to need to either staple, hole-punch, or cut it.


Hole-punching: To hole-punch, either punch a hole near the top (but not too close) of the book, on the spine, and another about an inch down the spine. Repeat this on the other side of the spine. Then, thread ribbon or yarn through this and tie a bow. This is a more decorative method.
Cutting: If you don't have a hole-punch, you can either open up your pocketbook and bore a hole through the spine with scissors in the same way you would do with a hole punch, then thread the ribbon or yarn through. (see hole-punch for more instructions.) If this is too time-consuming for you, try to fold it again and simply cut a hole.
Stapling: Take a long-armed stapler, and staple the inside where the fold has creased the papers. Two staples; one at the top and the other at the bottom should be sufficient. If you decide to add more, start at the middle to avoid wrinkly paper.
 You can use rick-rack, lace, spare cloth, pictures, leaves, and other good collage-making items.
 Your pocketbook is ready. Once you get the hang of it, you will have a lot of fun making it just the way you want it.

 The 1 represents the "root" (fundamental) note. The 3 represents "the 3rd," or the note 2 places up. The 5 represents "the 5th," which is 4 places up from the root and 2 places up from the 3rd. Each note skipped is called an interval (creating a pleasing separation between the ones that are sounded out).
 It's easier to learn basics of harmony by hearing the notes played on a piano. Then one can start to sing along with the piano notes. Then they can move on to singing the harmony with another singer.


A good step is to distinguish 2 or 3 singers each singing the melody an octave higher or lower than the other which is just singing in unison but is not harmonizing.
For example: the male lead singing the melody an octave low "versus" a female soprano are in unison (not harmony). Singing unison is "layering," and may enhance sound as in a choir (but a duet, trio or quartet is not normally unison, except for some special effect).



But, if a soloist sings a harmony note instead of the melody, that is a form of singing off key.
, Bad harmony is being inconsistent, and so traveling from ones note to the note of someone else (off key).


If there are more than 3 people you can have 2 or more singing each of the notes as in a choral group. Once you have a sense of the basics of harmonizing the "1, 3, 5 and 1, 3, 5, 7" you may experiment with other kinds of notes in other chords which have sharps or flats.

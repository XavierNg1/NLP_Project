 As long as you catch the yellow blossoms before they mature into white seeds, you should be able to stop the weed from spreading. Set the lawn mower deck to prevent it from cutting the grass lower than 2 to 2.5 inches (5.08 to 6.34 centimeters), since longer grass will block out the sunlight needed for dandelions to grow.


Note, however, that merely mowing down the top of the flower will not permanently kill the original flower.;
, Removing the dandelion by its root will remove it from your lawn. There are several "dandelion diggers" you can purchase at garden and hardware stores to accomplish this task. Some look fork-like in nature, while others look like a hybrid between a screwdriver and a fishtail. In both cases, however, you merely dig around the base of the flower and use leverage to pivot the flower out of the ground, root and all.
 Dandelions require plenty of sunlight to live. You can cover them with cardboard or black plastic bags to block the sunlight out, and within a few days, the flowers should die.

, Add nutrient-rich compost and mulch to the soil to improve its quality. Dandelions thrive on acidic soils and tend to grow weaker in rich soils, making them easier to pull up and less likely to ever take root.
 Both creatures love the taste of dandelions and will munch on the nasty weeds as they pop up from out of the ground. Dandelions are also healthy and nutritious for these animals.

, These hand-held torches literally burn weeds away.

, If you consistently pour boiling water over each dandelion a few times each day, the plants should start to wilt and wither into oblivion within three days.
 Plain white vinegar works, but you can also boil it down to concentrate the amount of acetic acid, creating an even more potent weed killer. Put the vinegar in a spray bottle, and douse the offending weed from head to base.


For even more effective results, pull the dandelion out at the root and spray the hole to kill any roots that got left behind.
 CGM is a pre-emergent herbicide, so it prevents seedlings from ever taking root. Spread the CGM over your lawn four to six weeks before the weeds usually germinate. Since it only lasts for five to six weeks, you should reapply the herbicide multiple times throughout the growing season.

, Pile 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of salt at the base of the dandelion, where it emerges from the lawn. Avoid getting the salt on other plants, though, since salt has been known to kill plenty of other greenery, too

, Buy some muriatic acid at the hardware store. (It's cheap, around $6 for a gallon and will last an eternity). Put on latex gloves. Use a turkey baster to apply the concentrated acid to the dandelions. Avoid breathing the fumes. Smile as the dandelions turn brown within minutes and stay dead for good.

, A post-emergence herbicide designed to take care of broad leaf weeds is ideal. Systemic weed-killer, like those made with glyphosate, should be applied directly to the weed you want to get rid of. Do not apply these products to your entire lawn. Glyphosate products kill all vegetation and should only be applied directly to the leaves of the dandelion. After the greens die, the chemical will seep into the plant and kill the roots.

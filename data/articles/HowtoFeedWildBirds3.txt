 Since you'll want to watch birds as they feed, setting up the bird feeder next to a window in a room you're frequently in is recommended. Keeping the feeder within three feet of a nearby window will also prevent birds from accidentally colliding into the window.
 Pick a location that provides protection from the wind. Though some feeders do not need this, pole-mounted feeders will sway if exposed to high winds.


Also keep the feeder near trees and bushes. These provide a place for the bird to hide if predators come too close, something birds are constantly mindful of.
Ensure that predators such as your beloved cat or dog cannot get to the feeder. Place your feeder in a location that your pets cannot get to.
When feeding nectar eating birds such as hummingbirds, mount the feeder in the shade and the sugar solution will stay fresher for longer. Whilst you can put the feeder in the full sun, be aware you need to change the nectar more often to avoid it becoming contaminated with bacteria. , There are different ways to mount bird feeders and this largely depends of the type of feeder you are using. The feeder can be hung from a shepherdâ€™s hook, mounted to a post, hung from a tree, set on a stable, or flat surface. Certain feeders even attach to windows, giving you a close-up look at the birds.


Remember to follow the mounting instructions accompanying the design you've purchased. If you made your own bird feeder, be sure to mount your feeder securely.

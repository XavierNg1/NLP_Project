 The round bouquet is the oldest and most traditional of all bouquet shapes. It is incredibly versatile, working well with almost all wedding dress styles, brides, settings, and levels of formality. It can be composed of multiple colors, or a single hue; with uniform flowers, or ones of varying sizes and species. The globular arrangement is easy to make -- and cheaper to purchase, and allows for the round shape to be made larger or smaller depending on the bride's needs and preferences.
 The loose bouquet (also referred to as organic or hand-tied) is exactly what the name says. A collection of loosely tied flowers and ribbon, this bouquet lends an air of relaxation and tranquility. They are ideal for outdoor venues or beach weddings. See How to Make a Hand Tied Wedding Bouquet., Usually symmetrical, these flower arrangements are preferred for their natural look. The flowers just seem to "flow" across the hands. (The bouquet is thick in the middle and tapers down as it nears the floor.) Depending on the flowers used and the length of the "arms" the crescent can be made to look traditional or more modern., The pageant bouquet is characterized by long stems. They are usually arranged in such a way that the stems lay against the bride's arm, with the cluster of flower heads near her elbow. This style is great for formal occasions and, if tied loosely, can be ideal for informal occasions as well., This bouquet resembles a waterfall. The flowers "spill" out of the front of the bouquet, and are best for formal settings. It does require a lot of flowers though, as the base is bulky and the flowers trail downwards., The oval bouquet is best when only comprised of two different colors. It is similar to the round style, but is much better at complementing larger wedding dresses (like ballgowns) than many other arrangements., One color only! This bouquet's impact comes from the shape of the bouquet, not necessarily the flowers or their colors.

A healer is a job that can heal the hit points (HP) of a party member and remove status ailments, such as poison. The healer will primarily be healing the tank, since the tank will be receiving the most damage. The healer is almost always required in a party because of its job requirements and needs in the game, so therefore, you'll need a secure member for it.
A tank is a party member whom has a high defense and other attributes that lower the amount of damage they receive during battle. Effective tanks also generate "hate" to make the monster focus its attack on them. the warrior job gets the ability to "provoke" the monster to hit them at level 5, making them decent tanks.
 Damage dealers are jobs that excel in dishing out the damage. support jobs are jobs that help the other jobs or (support them) in achieving their goals with a variety of spells and/or abilities.
 Too many support jobs in the party, and survivability may increase in the short term but the fights will likely last longer than expected. Too many damage dealers will make for a longer rest in between fights to regain lost magic points/hit points.


Also the damage dealers may not be able to effectively hit the target or tank effectively without the help of a support job.

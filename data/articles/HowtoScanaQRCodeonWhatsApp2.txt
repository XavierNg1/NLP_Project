 You'll see a black-and-white box in the middle of the page; this is the QR code.


If you're using the WhatsApp desktop version instead, you'll see this code the first time you open the program.
 It's a green app with a white phone icon inside of a white speech bubble outline.


If you haven't yet set up WhatsApp, do so before continuing.
 It's in the top-right corner of the screen. Tapping this will prompt a drop-down menu with options.


If WhatsApp opens to a conversation, first tap the "Back" button in the top-left corner of the screen.
 It's at the top of the drop-down menu. Doing so will open a QR code reader that uses your Android's main camera as the scanner.
 Your phone's screen should be facing you, while the camera should be facing the QR code on your computer.


If you've previously scanned a QR code with WhatsApp, you will need to first tap Scan QR Code near the bottom of the screen to invoke the camera.
 If your camera doesn't acknowledge the QR code right away, try moving your phone closer to the screen.


Once the code scans, the WhatsApp web page will display your WhatsApp messages.

 These are located all across Skyrim, with at least one in every village (usually located in the taverns).


You can also have them installed in your homes once you start buying real estate. Having them in your home is extremely useful, although using the ones in inns and alchemist shops means that you can buy some ingredients. Then again, you can store ingredients in your home, so the choice of where you want to make your poisons is yours.;
, Read the potions and poisons for each ingredient to see what you already know about a particular item.


For example, selecting Blisterwort will show you any potions and poisons you have successfully crafted (Frenzy and Restore Health), and for those that you have not discovered it will read UNKNOWN.
 Select “Ingredients” then choose at least two of any ingredients you have on hand.


You may want to use more than two because it increases your chances of a successful experiment.
The more times you succeed, the more information you learn about each ingredient, which begins to take out a lot of the guesswork from your experiments.

 No matter what it is, just get out into the crowd and show them you are not antisocial.;
, You can even tell them how you feel. Most people who put people down are insecure about themselves anyway.
 Your life is yours!

, No one else is like you! You are unique so make the most of it. Don't let people tell you who you have to be and what you have to look like. Being happy with who you are is one of the most attractive qualities one can have.
 If you have a dream, any dream, don't let it only be a dream. You will be happier if you fulfill your dream. Remember, the only way to have a shot at a good life is to try; if you don't try, there's no chance.
 If you don't like yourself now remember that you may not be the same person later. You need time to change to the person you want to be.
 Live life the way you want to, not how you're told and you will be happy. Life isn't measured by how long you live but the moments in your life. The more moments, the longer you lived.

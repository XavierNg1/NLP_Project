 Before you read, read all titles, chapter and section headings, subheadings, and any charts, graphs, diagrams, questions, and summaries you can find.If you are reading a text without these things, you might consider reading the first and last sentence of every paragraph or chapter to get an idea of the material the text is covering.
 Write down any questions you hope your reading will answer. You will comprehend more if you go into the text knowing what you want to learn. If you are not sure what you want to learn, go through and turn every chapter heading, section title, etc. into a question. Try to guess what the text will teach you: ask yourself the question you think the text might answer.If you like, add further questions while you read.
 Review your questions, then read the text. You may skim or scan, or you may just read at your current fastest pace.Depending on the length of the text, you may choose to read it all, or you may choose to read it in sections.
For maximum comprehension, pause at the end of every section and think about what you have read. Answer the question if you can.
For maximum speed, answer the questions once you have read the entire text.
 Now that you've read, you should be able to answer the questions you asked yourself. Answer all the questions you have read. You do not have to write them down (unless that is your assignment), just recite them aloud.If you are pausing after each section, make sure you can recite the answer to that section before you move on to the next. If you cannot, go back and skim it again.
If you feel you made an error in the framing of one of your questions, reframe it so that you can answer it.
 The final "R" in SQR3 is "review," which will help you retain the information you have comprehended. Go back over the questions you have answered and see if you can still answer them from memory.If you cannot, skim the section again until you can.

 Only fill the reservoir up to a third. If you’re concerned that white vinegar is too abrasive, you can also make a solution that’s equal parts water and vinegar.
 Use the iron’s high heat setting. Let the iron steam until the vinegar has completely evaporated. This should take between 5 and 10 minutes.









Alternatively, you can lay a piece of cloth on an ironing board and iron it until the reservoir empties. You’ll then be able to see all the filth removed from the iron.
Make sure you use cloth you’re fine with throwing out. It will likely get stained and marked from this process.
 Make sure you fill the reservoir completely, and turn on the iron. Let it steam until the reservoir is empty. This will simultaneously remove any remaining gunk in the steam vents and clear the iron of any leftover vinegar.








After steaming, make sure to wipe the soleplate with a rag to clean off any remaining residue.
 Dip a cotton swab into a solution that’s equal parts vinegar and water. Rub the cotton swab over and in each steam vent in turn. This will remove more resilient buildups.









Cleaning iron steam vents ensures even, consistent iron performance.
Avoid the temptation to use paper clips or other hard, metal items that could scratch your iron's steam vents.

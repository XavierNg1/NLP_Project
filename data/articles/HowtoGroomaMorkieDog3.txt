 In preparation for an actual visit, try to get your Morkie ready for what it will experience at the groomer’s. Once a day, handle its front and back paws and gently tap its nails with a metal spoon or clippers. Place it on a tall spot (e.g. a kitchen counter) and have it stand there for several moments to get used to being on an elevated surface., To choose the right groomer for your dog, ask friends for recommendations or look online for reviews of local grooming businesses in your area. Call and inquire about whether the groomer has the proper state-required certification (e.g. in some states, groomers must be licensed and certified in flea/tick applications). Ask other questions, such as:”Do you have much experience grooming Morkies?”
”How many years of experience do you have?”
”Did you complete training at a grooming school?”

, Bring your Morkie to see a groomer once a month, or at least every two months, to stay properly groomed. Groomers will give your Morkie a proper bath, trim its hair and nails, clean its ears, and brush its teeth if requested. Puppies should be brought to their first grooming session when they are 10-12 weeks old, or when they have received their second round of vaccines. , Ease your dog into visiting the groomer’s by opting for a limited treatment the first time. Have the groomer do a face trim, feet trim and sanitary cut instead of an entire body haircut. This will get your dog used to the sights, sounds, and overall atmosphere of the grooming salon without having the experience be too lengthy or intense.

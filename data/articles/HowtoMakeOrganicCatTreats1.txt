 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.;
, If you want to give your cats a treat with a stronger tuna flavor, you can use some or all of the water that you drained from your can of tuna. Otherwise, filtered tap water should suffice.
 Use your hands to blend the cornmeal and flour with the tuna until a moldable dough forms. Knead this dough into a ball.
 Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch (0.64 centimeter).
 Each strip should be roughly 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide.
 Each piece should be as close to a perfect square as possible, with a width and height of 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) each.
 The pieces should not be touching, but they do not need a lot of space to expand.
 Allow them to cool to room temperature before giving them to your cat, and store any extra treats in an airtight bag or container.

 We'll use 15/4 for our example. This is an improper fraction because the numerator, 15, is greater than the denominator, 4.


If you're not comfortable with fractions or division yet, start with the example below instead.;
, Write the fraction as a long division problem.Always write the numerator divided by the denominator. In our example, this is 15 รท 4.
 Review long division first if you're not sure what to do. This example will be easier to follow if you write out the long division problem as you read it:


Compare 4 to the first digit, 1. 4 doesn't go into 1, so we need to include the next digit.
Compare 4 to the first two digits, 15. How many times does 4 go into 15? If you're not sure, guess and see if you're right using multiplication.
The answer is 3, so write 3 on the answer line, above the 5.
 Unless the numbers divide perfectly, there will be a remainder left over. Here's how to find the remainder in a long division problem:Multiply the answer by the divisor (the number on the left). In our example, that's 3 x 4.
Write the result underneath the dividend (the number underneath the division bracket). In our example, 3 x 4 = 12, so write 12 underneath the 15.
Subtract the result from the dividend: 15 - 12 = 3. This is the remainder

, A mixed number is a whole number, plus a proper fraction. After solving your division problem, you have everything you need to write this mixed number:


The whole number is your answer to the division problem. In this case, that's 3.
The numerator of the fraction is your remainder. In this case, that's also 3.
The denominator of the fraction is the same as the denominator in the original fraction. In this case, that's 4.
Write this as one mixed number: 33/4.

 For this method of fake blood, you'll need:


1/2 cup light corn syrup
1-2 drops liquid red food coloring
1 tablespoon cornstarch (helps to thicken and add opacity to the fake blood)
1-2 tablespoons chocolate syrup
1 teaspoon cocoa powder (or drinking chocolate).
 Stir to combine.
 Decorate yourself (skin, unwanted old clothes, face, etc.). Or, since this is edible, you can add it to food that needs a tinge of fake blood for Halloween.

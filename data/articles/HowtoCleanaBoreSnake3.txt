 Wait until your snake is totally dry to the touch before running it through your gun’s barrel. Keep in mind that water can rust or otherwise damage your gun. Protect your gun by giving the snake the chance to totally air-dry before bringing the two into contact.Drying times will depend on the materials and size of your snake.
 If you’re in a rush, it may be tempting to wipe the bore brush with the same cloth that you used for the rest of the snake. However, be aware that this will most likely result in fibers being left behind on the brush’s bristles. These in turn will end up in your gun’s barrel when you use the snake next, so definitely use a toothbrush in order to keep your barrel clean., If you’re machine-washing and choosing to roll your snake up and tie it into a bundle, never use dark-colored shoelaces or cords to do so. Expect these to possibly stain your snake during its wash. These stains will make it harder to judge what’s dirt, what's oil, and what’s just a stain.

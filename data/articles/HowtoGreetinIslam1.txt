 Greet a Muslim as they would greet one another.


Use the phrase "As-Salam-u-Alaikum" ("Peace be unto you").This is pronounced “as-saa-laam-muu-ah-lay-kum.”
You might also choose to use the longer greeting of "As-Salam-u-Alaikum wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh" ("Peace be unto you and so may the mercy of Allah and his blessings”).
The pronunciation is “us-saa-laam-muu-alie-kum waa-rah-ma-tull-laa-hee wa-bara-kaa-tu-hu.”;
, Traditionally, the Salam greeting is reserved for those of the Muslim faith, so if you are not Muslim, you might not receive this greeting.Some current Islamic scholars believe that, in the interest of global peace and understanding, it is permitted to initiate the Salam greeting with non-Muslims.If you do receive the Salam greeting, respond with "wa-Alaikumussalam wa-Rahmatullah."
The pronunciation is "waa-alie-kum-us-salam waa-rah-ma-tull-la"
The meaning is "May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you."The longer response is "waa-alai-kum-us-salam-wa-rahma-tall-ahi-wa-ba-ra-ka-tu".
 If greeted with the Salam greeting, a Muslim will respond to a non-Muslim with the return greeting ("wa-Alaikumussalam wa-Rahmatullah").


It is obligatory for a Muslim to return the Salam greeting, regardless of the religion of the other person. To refuse this is against their religion.According to the Qu'ran (Muslim holy text), the Salam greeting has been mandatory since the creation of Adam and is commanded by Allah.

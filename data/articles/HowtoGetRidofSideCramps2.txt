 Follow the one hour rule and wait at least one hour before doing strenuous exercise. This will give your body time to digest., If you do feel you need to eat or are worried about having less energy during your workout, eat complex carbohydrates like a handful of dried berries or nuts like almonds half an hour before a run or workout.Complex carbohydrates are good snacks before a run or workout because they are digested in your small intestine and have a faster gastric emptying rate, which means they leave your stomach faster. You then wonâ€™t be running or working out on a full stomach., Some studies show that side cramps could also occur as a result of dehydration. Rather than drink a lot of water right before a run or workout, focus on drinking at least 8 glasses of water throughout the day. This will ensure you stay hydrated, even through strenuous exercise.

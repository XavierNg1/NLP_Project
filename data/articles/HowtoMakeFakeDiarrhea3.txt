 If you're going to leave your fake diarrhea in the toilet for someone to find, set up the prank ahead of time. Make sure the person you're pranking overhears you talking about how bad your stomach hurts.


It may help to hunch over like you're in pain, or wince from time to time.
 Food poisoning usually doesn't kick in immediately. If you start faking symptoms right after a meal, people might get suspicious. Wait about half an hour before you mention anything's wrong.
 Stomach pain isn't the only symptom of food poisoning. Say you feel nauseous, too. Act like you don't know whether you need to poop or throw up.
 If you've eaten the same thing as the people around you, ask them if they're feeling any of your "symptoms." If you didn't eat with them, list the things you ate earlier in the day that might cause food poisoning. Maybe you ate leftovers that sat around for too long in the fridge. Maybe the restaurant you ate at earlier looked and smelled unclean.
 Nobody will believe you feel sick if you're chomping happily away at snacks. If someone offers you food, say "Thanks, but I don't feel good right now. I don't think I should add anything more to the mix in my stomach right now!"


Instead, make a big show out of drinking a lot of water to stay hydrated.

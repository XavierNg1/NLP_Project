Example: In one situation there are as of May, 2011 about 45,000 "home-care providers for disabled adults" in Michigan, individual private contractors required to be unionized by law who receive payments from Michigan's Medicaid (mandated by Federal law) for these home-care providers.,,


Example: In a similar, but different situation, with free legal assistance, homecare workers have reached a settlement with Michigan government ensuring that the state will not continue to force "home-based child-care providers" into unions. Michigan had granted UAW and AFSCME union exclusive/monopoly bargaining power after an election in which only 15 percent of eligible child-care providers voted. That began in 2006 when Michigan unionized an estimated more than 40,000 home-based child-care providers into compulsory membership by passing state laws. Although the State of Michigan itself is not the employer for the child-care providers, the state pays a taxpayer subsidy for eligible children part of which goes directly or indirectly to the 40,000 workers in small businesses often run by independent contractors working in their own homes. But, now the new settlement ensures that the state will not force home childcare workers to financially support a union as a condition of taking care of children whose parents receive state assistance., These could set precedents to end similar unionism plans around the country and block unionism hidden in legislation, in your state.


Example: There is an ongoing class-action lawsuit that aims to order AFSCME and UAW union bosses to give back the estimated over four million dollars taken from Michigan child-care providers while this forced unionism was in operation.,


Example: A legal court action has attorneys challenging the Michigan union idea as a violation of the U.S. Constitution, a victory would serve as a precedent in other states and against similar provisions in similar cases around the nation.,, Perhaps join your efforts with others if you wish to pull together.

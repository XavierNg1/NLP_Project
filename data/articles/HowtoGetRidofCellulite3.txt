 Dry brushing improves your circulation and helps your skin get rid of toxins, reducing the appearance of cellulite. Buy a body brush made with natural fibers and make dry brushing a part of your morning routine.


Make sure your skin and the brush are both dry before beginning.
Starting at your feet, brush upward toward your heart. Concentrate on areas with a lot of cellulite, like your thighs and buttocks. Brush your arms from your hands to your shoulders. Brush your stomach in a clockwise circular motion and your arms in an upward motion. All brushing movements should be made towards your heart to encourage the return of blood and lymphatic flow.
Take a shower after brushing to wash away the dead skin cells and toxins that have risen to the surface.
 Taking measures to make your skin look tight and healthy doesn't actually get rid of cellulite, but it can go a long way toward temporarily reducing its appearance. Try the following techniques:


Bathe in lukewarm or cool water, rather than hot. Cool water tightens your skin and makes it look more toned.
Moisturize your skin with a product that contains caffeine. Buy a cream or lotion that contains at least 5 percent caffeine, which is said to improve skin tone and decrease the appearance of cellulite.
Use another topical product designed to reduce the appearance of cellulite. There are many creams and lotions on the market designed specifically for this purpose.
 You can reduce the appearance of cellulite by making the color of your skin look more even. Choose a spray tan product just a shade or two darker than your skin. Make sure to apply it evenly over your legs, not just in the areas where you have cellulite.

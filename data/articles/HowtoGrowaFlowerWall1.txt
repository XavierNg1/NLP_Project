 Choose a place in your yard or garden where the latticework or trellis can be leaned against a wall and either has garden soil beneath it or space for containers.;
, Tie (using twine, wire, strong yarn, etc.) and/or nail/staple in place, as appropriate for the surface it is leaning against.


If end posts are needed, these can be made from actual fence posts (wood or metal) or you can make use of something similar such as lengths of palette wood or a clothesline pole.
The latticework or trellis must be taut enough to be able to handle the growing flowers without bending or leaning.
 These can either be pinned back against the lattice or will use the lattice to climb against.


Some examples of suitable flowers include astelias, delphiniums and verbascums.
 Alternatively, place in containers and arrange along the length of the latticework.
 This helps to retain moisture.
 Trim and replace flowers as needed.

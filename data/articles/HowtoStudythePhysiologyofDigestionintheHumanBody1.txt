 The digestive system starts at the mouth. You take in food and drink from your mouth and pass it down to the the rest of your digestive track. The mouth also starts mechanical and chemical digestion of the food., The esophagus is the long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. When you swallow food, it travels down the esophagus until it reaches the stomach. In the stomach, the food is combined with hydrochloric acid and enzymes that break the molecules down., The endocrine system consists of glands that produce hormones. One of these glands, the pancreas, also aids in digestion. The pancreas produces enzymes that help the body break down proteins and regulate blood sugar.
 The majority of nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine. This organ is broken into three sections: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Each section has a unique purpose.In the duodenum, food is mixed with pancreatic juices to be broken down even further for absorption.
Most absorption of nutrients takes place in the jejunum.
The ileum connects the small intestine to the large intestine. It also absorbs the last bit of nutrients available in the food.
 After the nutrients have been extracted from the food mass and absorbed by your body, the remaining waste is saturated with water. This water can be reabsorbed and reused by the body. The absorption of water happens in the large intestine (also known as the colon). Aside from keeping your body hydrated, this process also helps form a solid stool that your body can easily eliminate as waste., A buildup of waste in your body can be toxic. In order to prevent a buildup, your body has to shed the waste left behind after digestion. Waste is moved along the length of the long intestine until it reaches the anus. The anus allows waste to exit the body.The anus is very short. It is usually only about an inch long.

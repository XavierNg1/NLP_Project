 Simply peel them and chop them up to add them to a pie, cake or other baked good able to hold fruit. The sweetness of the pears means you can add less sugar to the recipe too.









Here are some recipes to try: Chocolate pear cake, vegan pear cake and pear pie.
 Overripe pears are best stewed, as they may fall apart and not keep the lovely pear shape required for poaching. However, they will still taste great and with the addition of some berry fruits or apples, this makes for a delicious dessert. Finish by topping with yogurt or cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon or nutmeg.

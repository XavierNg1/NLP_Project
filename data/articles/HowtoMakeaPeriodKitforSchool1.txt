 It should have a zipper or some other way to seal it. This kit, which fits inside your school binder, is ideal if you're looking to have supplies on hand during every class. You can find a pencil bag at most office supply or big box stores.;
, Decide if you want pads or tampons, and how many youâ€™ll need throughout the day. Figure out how much will fit without bulging. You want enough to get you through a whole day. You can always restock when you are getting low, since you should be taking your binder home, or you could restock periodically from your locker.
 Look for individual wipe packets. Add those baby wipes or feminine wipes to the bag.Also, get an additional body mist, or something that will hide the smell.
 When you need it, you can grab the whole thing and bring it with you to the bathroom so you don't need to walk around holding a pad or tampon.

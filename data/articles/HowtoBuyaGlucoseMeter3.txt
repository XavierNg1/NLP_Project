 Different glucose meters use specific test strips, so before spending money on your meter decide how you’re going to purchase your test strips. This may be from a pharmacy, or you may buy them in bulk over the internet. Find out what test strips are available to you, so that you definitely get a compatible glucose meter without a monthly hassle of finding more strips., Almost every pharmacy like RiteAid, Walgreens or CVS will have glucose meters for sale. They are commonly-used products that should be readily available. You can ask the pharmacist or a sales associate to help you locate them in the store.


Stores like Target and Walmart that have health items should also carry them in stock.
 Shopping online is efficient and easy, as long as you obtain the right product. Buy from recognizable online stores like Amazon, and only buy new products – never used. You can also decide which type of glucose meter you want and purchase one from the company’s website directly.


Avoid buying from outside your own country, as specifications might be different than what you and your doctor are familiar with.

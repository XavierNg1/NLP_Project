 Keeping your hair moist and conditioned is important to help it grow faster. Dry, limp, unhealthy hair will not grow as fast. Additionally, it will break and fall out. Use a deep conditioner on your hair at least two to three times each week.Once each month, do a protein deep conditioning treatment. You can find these at beauty stores.;
, The growth of curly hair can be slowed down if you use products with lots of chemicals. Products that contain sulfates, polymers, and parabens can slow down your growth because they leave residue and buildup on your scalp that can block the follicle.These chemicals can also strip your hair’s natural oils, which can lead to dry, damaged hair that won’t grow.
 When choosing hair products like shampoo, conditioner, and masks, you should make sure your products have ingredients that will nourish your hair. Choose products that have biotin, also called vitamin B7, and proteins. You may also want to use products that contain healthy oils, like coconut, jojoba, and argon oils.
 Essential oils can help remove buildup on your scalp and help stimulate the hair follicle. By improving the health of your scalp, the hair will grow better. Make sure you never place undiluted essential oils on your scalp. Always mix them with a carrier oil, like coconut, grapeseed, jojoba, or sweet almond.Mix 30 mL of jojoba oil and grapeseed oil with 7 drops of rosemary and lavender oil, and five drops of thyme and cedarwood oil. Massage the mixture onto your scalp with your fingers for a few minutes.
You may also use peppermint, sage, lemon, or chamomile oil.
Perform a patch test on your scalp before you put the essential oils on your entire head. This ensures you won’t have an allergic reaction.

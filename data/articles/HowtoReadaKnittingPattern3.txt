 Avoid a knitting pattern that provides only charts without written instructions if you are just beginning to read patterns, as it takes some practice to read charts.


You may choose a knitting pattern chart over written instructions if you are more of a visual person and prefer reading instructions from symbols rather than words.
 Read the key provided for a knitting pattern chart, which will tell you what each symbol in a square means. In general, the following symbols mean:


Blank square: Knit a stitch (right side) / purl a stitch (wrong side)
Horizontal line: Purl a stitch (right side) / knit a stitch (wrong side)
Diagonal line: Knit two stitches together (a decrease)
Circle: Yarn over, Read the chart from bottom to top. A right side (RS) row will be read from right to left, while a wrong side (WS) row will be read from left to right.If the bottom row of a chart has two blank squares, followed by two horizontal lines: Start row 1 (RS) by reading the row right to left, which would mean purl two stitches (p2) then knit two stitches (k2). If the row is wrong side (WS), it will be read left to write, meaning knit two stitches (k2) then purl two stitches (p2).
The pattern will specify how to read each row based on the key and whether the row is right side or wrong side.

 Cats will naturally feel more comfortable in an enclosed space, without any loud sounds or distractions. Sit in a small room with your cat (perhaps a bedroom or a laundry room). The cat will likely hide at first, but if you sit quietly, it will eventually build up the confidence to approach you.You may also find the cat watching you intently. This is normal; fearful cats will make sure that their surroundings are calm and safe before they emerge.;
, Your cat may be anxious and afraid of its surroundings. To help it feel more confident and secure, make sure the cat has places to which it can retreat and observe the world around it. You can assist by giving your cat places to hide.These don’t need to be anything fancy, and require little work on your part. For example:


Set a cardboard box on its side so the cat can crawl in.
Pull a sofa or dresser out from the wall by about 6 inches so your cat can crawl behind it.
Purchase and set up a “cat tree” that the cat can perch on top of.
 You’ll need to be patient while socializing a fearful cat, since this is the only way it will overcome its shyness and build confidence. If you live in a house or an apartment, let your cat wander at its leisure. Be careful not to make unexpected loud noises or do anything to frighten the cat, as these occurrences will only reinforce its fear.At first, the cat may primarily hide and only emerge when you’re asleep. Over time, though, your cat will build up its confidence and will interact with you more frequently.

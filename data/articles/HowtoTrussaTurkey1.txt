 Place the turkey on its back with its legs facing you. Draw some kitchen twine from the top, or neck end of the turkey, under the back until it meets the wings. Pull the twine up over the outside of the wings, crossing it over the bend in each wing., Pull the ends of the twine toward each other and against the wings so they hug the body of the turkey. Pull the ends of the twine down along the breast of the bird and cross the strings under the rib cage on the inside of the leg joint.Pull the ends of the string tightly until you feel the wings are secure.
 Move both ends of the twine around the feet of the turkey so they are under the legs, but over the tail. Cross the twine under the legs, then move the ends around the back of the turkey at the tail. You may have to lift the bird a little to get underneath it. Cross the ends of the twine again. Pull the ends until they are secure., Cross the ankles of the turkey one over the other. Draw your twine up to the legs. While holding the ankles in place, cross the twine over the ankles. Wrap it around the bottom of the ankles crossing the ends again. Bring the twine back to the top of the ankles and cross them again to create a knot.Tie a knot in the twine and trim the ends if necessary.
This is the most common and traditional way to truss a turkey and will result in a compact shape suitable for the main course centerpiece for your dinner.

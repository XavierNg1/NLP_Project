 The Crocodile is only available to members.;
, Remember, choose the name as Happy TheCroc, or something like that.


Color 1: dark green, kinda like when you first buy the gator.
Color 2: lighter green.
Eyes: Circle eyes, like when you first buy a bunny. Why not wide open eyes? Because they look weird on a crocodile.
 Do normal eyes.
 Have fun with your new gator!

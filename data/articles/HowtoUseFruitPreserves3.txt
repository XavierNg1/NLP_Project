 Fruit preserves are added to whipped cream with crushed vanilla wafer cookies for a classic English treat. For a single serving, use about ⅓ cup (78.9 ml) whipped cream and ½ cup (118 ml) fruit preserves. Crush four or five cookies into the mix. Larger batches can be made by multiplying the recipe.Only use preserves and cream that are thoroughly chilled. If necessary, chill the treat for a half hour or so after you mix it up.
 The next time you mix up a cocktail that includes fruit, use preserves instead. Strawberry and peach are great for whiskey cocktails. Mixed berry and raspberry are great for vodka. It’s best to add the alcohol and fruit preserves to a shaker and shake it to mix them thoroughly.Pour the drink over ice. Sometimes it’s best to strain it, as well.
 Scoop a heaping spoonful of preserves into a pint sized canning jar (or a shaker). Add ¼ cup (60 ml) warm water, put the lid on, and shake. Then remove the lid, add ice, and top the jar off with club soda or sparkling water. You have a refreshing fruit flavored sparkling water. This works well with any preserves you have on hand.

 Once you have combined the kombucha and the sweet tea, cover the jar with a few layers of cheesecloth, coffee filters, or paper towels. Then take a rubber band to tightly band the coverings over the jar at the rim., Put the jar in a cupboard or corner away from direct sunlight in an average room-temperature room of around 70 °F (21 °C) (around 21.11 C).Direct sunlight can hinder the development of the kombucha scoby.
 Keep the kombucha sealed for 1-4 weeks, checking on it a couple times a week.By the end of the first week you should see bubbles forming at the top of the liquid, then you will see a thin film forming on top.
When the scoby is finished developing, it should be about ¼ inch (6.35 mm).
 When the kombucha scoby is opaque and about ¼ inch (6.35 mm) thick, it is ready to use. Remove it and use it to brew your own kombucha tea!Dispose of most of the liquid that you used to make the scoby, as it will taste very acidic and strong. Keep about 1 cup (236. 58 ml) if you are planning to make kombucha.
If your scoby starts to develop mold or smells rancid, it likely means that bad bacteria are forming on the scoby and that you should throw it out and start again.

 Most mobile devices do not natively have the special characters or symbols, such as music notes, on their keyboards. You can use an app for this purpose. There are several available, and most work the same way. Try apps that have emoji or symbol on their names, like Emoji Smiley.
 Whatever status message you will on Facebook, you can type that in the emoji keyboard app.
 All these emoji or symbol keyboard apps have a huge library of different emoticons, icons, and whatnots. Look for the music notes you want and just tap them. They will appear with your message.
 When you’re done with your message, including the music notes, copy the whole thing to your clipboard. Copying will vary on the device, but usually you long-press on the message, and select “Copy all” from the options that appear.
 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device and tap on it.
 For iOS devices, tap on your name on the header toolbar. You will be brought to your Timeline or wall. Tap the “Write Post” button at the top of your wall, and a small window for “Update Status” will appear.


For Android, on the News Feed page, you will find three buttons at the bottom of the screen when you swipe up. Tap the “Status” button to access the Update Status window.
 Paste your status message from your clipboard to the window. To do this, long-press the text field area and select “Paste.” The message will appear as how you wrote it on the emoji keyboard app, with the music notes.
 Your post will be made available and it will appear with the music notes you’ve put.

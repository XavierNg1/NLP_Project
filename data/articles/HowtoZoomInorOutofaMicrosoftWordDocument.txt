There is a button in the Standard toolbar of Microsoft Word, that will allow you to Zoom-into our out-of your document.


Select the View menu bar at the top of the screen, and select Zoom. Select your Zoom level.






A larger number than your initial zoom level signifies a zoom-in of a preferred amount. A smaller number than your initial zoom level signifies a zoom-out of a preferred amount.
You can also choose to provide a Customized zoom level, by clicking the "Percent" drop-down box and typing your own predefined zoom levelÂ %.


Look for the zoom drop-down from the Standard toolbar. Click the drop-down option, and select your zoom level.






You can also click this same box and type your own customized zoom-level number.
No need to type the percent sign in either of these styles.

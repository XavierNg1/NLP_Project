 You should vaccinate your cat when it’s young or as soon as you acquire it. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent herpetic keratitis.When you get your cat vaccinated, ask the vet if it’ll need a booster and when you should get it a booster shot.
 Indoor cats are less likely to suffer eye injuries from confrontations with other animals, which will reduce the risk of injury-related keratitis. Keeping your cat indoors will also reduce its exposure to infectious diseases.Further, keratitis can result from intense sunlight, and keeping your cat inside will reduce its direct exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light., Look into your cat’s eyes and ensure they’re free of plaque or lesions, that the area around the iris (or colored part) is white, and that the pupils are even in size. Gently roll back the eyelids to make sure they’re pink and not red or white. Use a damp cotton ball to wipe away any build up from the corner of the eye, and use a fresh cotton ball for the other eye.Persian, Siamese, Himalayan, and Russian blues are especially susceptible to developing keratitis, so take special care to inspect and clean the eyes of these breeds.

 Not all amps have an effects loop, but if yours does, you can experiment with placing some of your effects inside your amp's effects loop to give your guitar a richer, more nuanced tone.The effects loop is before the power amp section but after the preamp of your amplifier. You'll see "Effects Send" and "Effects Return" jacks. On some amps these may also be labeled "Preamp Out" and "Power Amp In."

, Most guitarists who use the effects loop to set up their guitar pedals put the time-based effects in the loop to avoid the washed out sound that can be produced if these effects are fed into the overdrive and distortion of the amp.This set-up can give you a clearer sound if your amp is generating sound that is overdriven or distorted. The sound from your amplifier's preamp section feeds into these effects.
 Placing modulation pedals in the effects loop will give you a different sound than if you run them through your signal chain directly from your guitar. Experiment with these and see if it suits your style.Moving the volume pedal inside the effects loop allows you to control the entire sound coming out of the amplifier.

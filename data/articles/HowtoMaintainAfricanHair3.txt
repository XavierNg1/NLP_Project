 Make sure that your diet contains plenty of fatty acids, B vitamins, folic acid and protein to promote the health and strength of your hair. Foods containing these nutrients include salmon and other fatty fish, nuts and eggs., One large cause of hair breakage is the friction that results from your hair rubbing against your pillowcase at night. Counter this damage by opting for silk or satin pillowcases, which create less friction and don’t absorb the moisture from your hair in the way that cotton pillowcases tend to do.If you don’t want to buy silk pillowcases, you can also wrap your hair in a silk or satin scarf at night.
 If you have shoulder length hair, the constant rubbing of your hair against cotton shirts or shirts made of other absorbent material can sap the moisture from your hair and cause breakage. If you have shoulder length natural hair, try wearing silk or satin shirts when you wear your hair down.

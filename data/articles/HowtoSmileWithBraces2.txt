 Psychologists have found that all sincere smiles involve the muscles around the eyes. Sometimes called the "Duchenne smile," this expression of sincere happiness causes so-called "crow's feet" creases around the eyes, as the eyes narrow and the smile broadens. It's a mechanism most people aren't consciously aware of, but with practice you can learn to smile with your eyes, giving you a more natural, sincere smile.Stand or sit in front of a mirror.
Smile until you notice your eyes narrow slightly. Try to hold this pose and study the way your facial muscles stretch in this position.
Practice smiling with your eyes until you're able to achieve this expression on command.
 One way to practice smiling with your eyes is to look at photographs of other people exhibiting Duchenne smiles, then try to perform the same expression. You can easily find pictures online by searching for "Duchenne smile", and researchers have found that viewing a photograph of a Duchenne smile makes it easier to replicate that smile on command.


Practice in front of a mirror or camera.
Continue looking at Duchenne smiles and then practicing your own until you're able to smile with your eyes on command.
 Research suggests that some people are capable of achieving a Duchenne smile while imagining (or "roleplaying") certain events that were causes of happiness. Imagining or remembering a fun occasion with friends, greeting a friend, and receiving a good grade were all scenarios that caused some people to express a Duchenne smile.
 Some research connects laughter with a Duchenne smile. If you're having trouble replicating the Duchenne smile on command, you may want to try forcing a brief instance of laughter to form a Duchenne smile. Think about something that amuses you or brings you joy, and practice laughing/smiling in front of a mirror.

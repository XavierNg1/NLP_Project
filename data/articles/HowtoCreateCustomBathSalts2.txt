 You'll need the following items:


A large dipping cup
Any essential oils you'd like (you can use more than one!)
1/4 cup baking soda
1/2 cup sea salt
1/2 cup non-scented Epsom salts
Food coloring (optional)
Bowl and spoon

, Mix it up thoroughly -- don't be afraid to use your fingers!


Baking soda is good for skin irritation and softening the water.
 If you're using more than one essential oil, drop them in one drop of each at a time. You don't want to put in 8 drops of mint only to find that adding any more chamomile would make your salt too runny.


Any oil is good! Sandalwood, peppermint, jasmine, lavender, vanilla -- even a few drops of a "cooking" oil like almond, walnut, olive, or grapeseed can add a silky touch to your salt.
Add food coloring at this stage if you'd like your salt to pick up some hues. Start with just a few drops and see where it goes. Mix it in well!

, Tada! Now are you going to use them for yourself or give them away as gifts? Whichever it is, know that about 1/3 cup is necessary for every bath.

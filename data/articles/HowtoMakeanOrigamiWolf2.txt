 They should now appear inside the larger triangles.
 Make this fold on both sides of the paper. This will make the paper more narrow., Tuck the top of the paper down inside the “body” of the wolf.
 This will make the head of the wolf.
 Crimping means pushing the front of the two flaps back at an angle.This will add dimension to the wolf’s neck.
 Bend the top part of the neck towards the body of the wolf. This will create wolf ears.

 A mountain fold is when the crease sits at the top of the paper like the peak of a mountain.Doing a mountain fold will narrow the tail.


To give the wolf more detail, mountain-fold the back of the wolf's body. As well, you can crimp the front and hind legs.
 To do this, reverse-fold the tip of the tail.


Form hooves on the wolf by outside reverse folding the tip of the legs. Then, outside reverse fold the small triangle or tip on the legs.
 Create more detailed ears by squash folding the ears and then valley folding them to create two perky ear flaps.


A valley fold is when the crease is at the bottom of the paper and the paper folds upward to create a valley shape.Crimp the wolf’s head and mountain-fold the wolf’s neck.

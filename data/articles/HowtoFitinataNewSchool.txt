 You won't fit in at school if you don't know the school well yet. Ask where places are or ask for a school map.;
, Be nice to adults, teenagers and kids alike, because they might just be your next teacher or friend.
 Talk to them and find out more about them. See how strict or lenient they are, and test their limits. Just don't go too far, or you may end up getting in trouble (adding to your reputation, but you still get in trouble).
 Talk to different people, but don't ignore a certain group. Be yourself and don't lie. This is your school now... take a chance on being who you weren't at your old school.
 Teachers always pay attention to new students.
 When people talk to you, don't be nervous, but don't be too loud. Be confident and make eye contact. However, sometimes you may need to make yourself loud so that you will get noticed, and but try not to constantly attract attention to yourself. Don't worry too much about what people think of you; you'll over-analyze the situation and they might judge you for that. Be genuine, be yourself, and be nice to everyone, no matter how mean they may appear at first. It's usually always the 'girl/guy that you hated at your new school' that ends up being your friend after a little sincerity. But then again, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself if it's very clear that you should.
 Know where your locker is and have a map in case of emergencies, but whenever possible, ask the person sitting near you where something is. It's a good way to talk to people and meet a lot of people on your first day, - you're the new kid now, - tell people that you are whenever you need some help.
 Once one person hates you, their entire group will hate you too. Remember these people grew up together, so it's their obligation to defend their lifelong friends. Be nice, and optimistic, even if there happens to be an annoyance. They might even let you be the annoyance to another new kid someday, it usually takes a year and a half, but they'll come around. Always remember to make a good first impression but it's also important to be yourself.
 Usually, they will ask you if you're sitting with anyone, but if not, steer the topic towards school lunch (as in is the food good etc) If no one specifically mentions eating together, but you're walking to the cafeteria together, then it's implied that you'll eat lunch together.
 They could always know people you'd rather be friends with or introduce you to more people. Try to meet new people. However, if they are hated by everyone, then it is advised not to become best friends with them unless you really want to, don't get too into people, hang out with everyone, and make sure you know a group or person well enough before deeming them your friend, - it's usually always the most tricky, manipulative people that talk to you at first, and it's usually those who just talk to you later on, at the back of the classroom who are there for you later on.
 If someone passes a note or whispers something to you, ignore them so you can pay attention to the teacher.[[Image:Fit in at a New School Step 11.jpg|center, Make sure you are committed to that sport or club.
 Even better, ask them to do something over the weekend.
 While you don't want to be a complete kiss-up, kids like the people who will cooperate with them. If they ask you a favor, do it. Don't be too gullible, - people will sometimes even push your buttons to test what your 'limits' are, - like testing the waters. Just make sure you confidently (maybe even with a big smile on your face)... reply 'reasonably'. Like if they call you a "jerk" , - ask them why they called you a jerk. If they accuse you of something you didn't do, reply by saying you've never done whatever it is they are accusing you of, and then ask them who had said that.
 Never forget that while you might be trying to fit in, you should never try to be anybody but yourself. The first couple of weeks are always confusing.

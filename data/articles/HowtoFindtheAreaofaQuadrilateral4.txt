 A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least two sides that run parallel to each other. Its corners can have any angles. Each of the four sides on a trapezoid can be a different length.


There are two different ways you can find the area of a trapezoid, depending on which pieces of information you have. Below, you'll see how to use both.
 The height of a trapezoid is the perpendicular line connecting the two parallel sides. This will not usually be the same length as one of the sides, because the sides are usually pointed diagonally. You will need this for both area equations. Here's how to find the height of a trapezoid:Find the shorter of the two base lines (the parallel sides). Place your pencil at the corner between that baseline and one of the non-parallel sides. Draw a straight line that meets the two base lines at right angles. Measure this line to find the height.
You can also sometimes use trigonometry to determine the height if the height line, the base, and the other side make a right triangle. See our trig article for more information.
 If you know the height of the trapezoid as well as the length of both bases, use the following equation:



Area = (Base 1 + Base 2)/2 × height or A = (a+b)/2 × h


Example: If you have a trapezoid with one base of 7 yards, another base of 11 yards, and the height line connecting them is 2 yards long, you can find its area like this: (7 + 11)/2 × 2 = (18)/2 × 2 = 9 × 2 = 18 square yards.
If the height is 10 and the bases have the lengths of 7 and 9, then you can find the area simply by doing the following: (7 + 9)/2 * 10 = (16/2) * 10 = 8 * 10 = 80

, The midsegment is an imaginary line that runs parallel to the bottom and top lines of the trapezoid and is exactly the same distance from each. Since the midsegment is always equal to (Base 1 + Base 2)/2, if you know it, you can use a shortcut for the trapezoid formula:



Area = midsegment × height or A = m × h

Essentially, this is the same as using the original formula except that you're using "m" instead of (a + b)/2.
'Example:' The midsegment of the trapezoid in the example above is 9 yards long. This means we can find the area of the trapezoid simply by multiplying 9 × 2 = 18 square yards, just like before.

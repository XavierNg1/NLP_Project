 Everyone got help from someone else at some point. Think of your educational path, for instance. If you attended university, you were inspired by your professors and fellow students. If you educated yourself at the library, your learning was enabled by the local government that funds the library and by the many authors of the books you read. Remember how interconnected we all are in order to stay humble despite your success.
 Whether you imagine overcoming your struggles through education, business ownership, or public office (or a combination of these), seek out the advice and feedback of experts.


For instance, if you have a great idea for a tech business, find a mentor in the field and bounce it off of him or her. Use their feedback to guide your thinking.
 Be generous with your new wealth by giving to worthy charities.Live your life in an ethical way so as to gain respect for more than just earning wealth. Educate others on how they can best follow your path to success. Unlike individuals who were born rich or did little to earn their success, the self-made man or woman should always be thankful for the improved quality of life they have.

 Ideally, you want to engage in moderate-intensity exercise 30 to 60 minutes a day at least four days a week. You don't have to do this exercise all at once, but you should be consistent and exercise at the same time every day.If you don't have an hour that you can carve out of your day for exercise on a regular basis, try splitting the time into three 20-minute intervals. For example, you might take a brisk walk in the morning, at mid-day, and then in the evening.
 Getting down to your goal weight isn't enough if your muscles remain weak and easily fatigued. Even doing basic bodyweight exercises, such as push-ups and crunches, can help build muscle strength.There are plenty of strength training videos you can find online for free and follow at home. However, if you're new to strength training, you may want to work with a professional trainer first to make sure you're getting your form right.
 Exercising regularly is not just about dedicated fitness work at a gym. Many daily physical activities including gardening, cleaning around the house, walking the dog, and other daily chores can also be done at moderate intensity to keep your body active.For example, you might walk up and down the stairs instead of taking the elevator, or park far away from your destination so you have a further distance to walk.
 If you have trouble staying motivated to exercise on a regular basis, going for a walk or jog with a friend can help you stay on track. You also might consider joining a gym or fitness club, or taking a new class to learn a new physical activity.

 Use your car and park it behind the wrecked car, at least 100 feet (30.5 m) away, and turn on your hazard lights. Deploy traffic cones and other traffic control devices if you have them. In generally other vehicles are far more dangerous for you than the risk of an explosion.;
, Liquids are not explosive, vapor from a flammable substance is. So a leaking gas tank raises the risk of an explosion.
 Tell your location, what has happened, how many persons are in danger and wait for further questions.
 Think first, then act.
 Get the spurt directly in the flames. Use your little capacity as efficiently and as quickly as possible.
 Rush to the driver's window and check how many passengers there are. If they are conscious tell them to unbuckle themselves and try to get out.
 If the doors are smashed in, try to take them out through the windows. If the windows are not completely smashed out, take your shirt off and wrap your fist in it. Punch through the glass and rip large shards off, so the person can get out. Don't take a lot of time doing this, cuts are not as life threatening as an explosion.
 If the buckling mechanism is damaged the belt will need to be cut.
 The explosion will certainly kill them, if they are not removed.
 When the victim is out of the car, carry / drag them hastily away from the dangerous car, at least a good 100 feet (30.5 m), try putting them behind your car.

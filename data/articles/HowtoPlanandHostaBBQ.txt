 Remember not to invite too many people because you'll have to cater for them all.;
, Usually one is held on the garden/patio/porch. Make sure there are places for people to sit such as benches and rugs. Decorate the area with lanterns for a magical evening BBQ or just a nice rustic venue.
 Think of your guests. Are they children? Vegetarians? Make sure there is something for everyone. Burgers, sausages, ribs and kebabs are popular. Make sure there are some side dishes like potato salad, salad, couscous, watermelon, etc. Have drinks such as lemonade, beer, smoothies or even just water!

, Go and plan fun games you used to play as a kid! Maybe a game of rounders! Remind your guests to wear suitable footwear.
 Make sure that someone or even yourself is at the BBQ at all times when food is cooking on it!


On the day of the BBQ, prepare all your side dishes in advance, either the morning before the BBQ or the night before. Display the food outside on a table like a buffet so your guests can choose what they would like.

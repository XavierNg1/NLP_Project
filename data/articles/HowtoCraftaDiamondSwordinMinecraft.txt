 Look around your area for a hole in the ground. Explore that cave to see if it is large. Feel free to dig down in a stair case to look for more caves.;
, Head to a cave at Y-level 5-12.Look around for diamonds or strip mine. Mine up any diamonds you may see.
 Retrace your steps and go back up to the surface. Go to a biome where there are trees.
 Head to a tree and collect at least one block of wood. The type of wood does not matter. Transfer the block of wood to wood planks, then sticks.
 Using your two diamonds and one stick, craft a diamond sword in a crafting table. The diamonds go in the upper and middle left spots and the stick goes in the bottom left.

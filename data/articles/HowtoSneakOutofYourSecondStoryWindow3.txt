 You're in luck if there's a tree near your bedroom window, because it serves as a built-in escape route. Simply open your window, and climb onto the nearest tree branch. Then, proceed to climb down your tree.


If you plan on sneaking out often, it might be a good idea to add some easily climbable steps to your tree. This can be done by simply nailing pieces of wood onto the trunk of your tree. Use these pieces of wood as steps to climb up and down the trunk of your tree., If your house has features like a terrace, a lower level roof, or a porch, take advantage of them while sneaking out. Using these house features will allow you to sneak out without having to use a rope or risk getting caught while setting up a ladder.
 The second story of your house has multiple windows. Choose the best window to climb out of by figuring out which one has the easiest escape route. One window may have a tree right next to it, or one window might be above an elevated porch or terrace. Choose whichever window is easiest to climb out of.

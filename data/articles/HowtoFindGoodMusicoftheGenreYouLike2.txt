 There’s a wealth of information about music that will help you not only learn more about what you like and listen to, but will provide you with many new suggestions to listen to.


Try a site like AllMusic, which is essentially an online encyclopedia of music and even has options to stream music so you can listen as you browse.

To navigate this site, search for an artist you like and check out the “Related” tab near the top of the artist page. This page lists 1) artists which influenced your artist, 2) artists which are similar to your artist, and 3) artists which were influenced by your artists.
 These are web-based technologies that collect music from all sources and consolidate it in one place.They can come in the form of apps or websites and are extremely useful for finding new music that is similar to what you like.


For example, the website If You Digallows you to simply type in an artist you like and it will suggest related artists. Other options abound, including Gnodwhich describes itself as a “search engine for music you don’t know about” and Spotify, a commercial music service, that has a range of options, including radios and lists of similar artists, to help you find music you will enjoy.If you are outside of the United States, the collection of music you can access may be limited due to copyright restrictions. Luckily, there are still other music aggregators that are not geo-restricted and you can access these from anywhere around the world. Check out Earbits Radio, Musicovery, or Shuffler.fm., Turning to the critics, such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork, can help you find new music. Music journalists are taste-makers for a good reason. They tend to have an in-depth knowledge of music, including specific bands’ influences and peers.

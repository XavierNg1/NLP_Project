 This app is white with a multicolored triangle on it.
 It's in the top-left corner of the screen.
 This option is in the pop-out menu on the left side of the screen.
 It resembles a green, yellow, blue, and red circle. You should see it in the "Updates" section; tapping it will prompt Chrome to begin updating.


If you don't see Chrome in the "Updates" section of the My apps & games menu, Chrome is up to date.

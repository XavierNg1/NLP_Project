 Ask a friend or family member who speaks the new language to come over and have a few conversations with your child. It is even better if they can share some of their cultural experiences as well, as that will help your child to make a connection between learning and real life.Make sure to warn this native speaker that your child is still in an early learning phase and may make numerous mistakes. Ask the speaker to be as supportive as possible, while providing constructive criticism.
 If learning the new language is just confined to the classroom, your child may grow bored and lose interest. Instead, take them to a museum with bilingual exhibits. Go see a sports match that is announced in the language that your child is learning. Go browse a farmer’s market in which the vendors speak the other language., Find a way to start learning the same language yourself. You can buy a learning program, such as Rosetta Stone, or perhaps even get a private tutor. Keep up with your lessons and talk about your setbacks with your child. You can also create a study routine that parallels that of your child, to encourage them to keep with it., It is possible that your student’s grades and test scores might lower a bit while they are enrolled in the program. They may also be particularly frustrated for the first few weeks as they make learning adjustments. It is important that you are supportive during these times and that you emphasize the long-term goals for your child, such as a better chance to travel internationally in the future.For example, you might say, “This is just a rough period as you are getting used to the schedule. Let’s give it one more week and reassess.”

 The most widely cited version runs: All Boys Should Come Home Please. If you remember this, you can remember: Aragon Boleyn Seymour Cleves Howard Parr.
 This version runs: A Big Secret Concealing Her Past. It is easy to remember because of all the drama connected with the lives – and deaths – of Henry’s wives. Think about Anne Boleyn scheming to rise the ranks in the palace and get close to the king. Or imagine Catherine Howard, cousin to the dead Anne, carrying on her affair behind the king’s back.
 This is a rarer mnemonic but a good one: Arrogant Anne Seemed More Clever at How to Catch the Ring. Arrogant sounds like Aragon; Anne is Anne Boleyn; Seemed More sounds like Seymour; Clever is like Cleves; How to sounds like Howard; and Catch is like Katherine Parr. It has the benefit, too, of being historically accurate. Anne Boleyn was certainly arrogant and interested in catching the wedding ring.

 Your GPA (or grade point average) is used to determine your performance level across all of your classes. Your high school GPA is often used to determine which colleges you can get into and your college GPA will determine your graduate school entrance.


Your GPA is calculated by assigning a certain number of points, based on the grade you earned for a class versus how many credits that class was worth, and dividing the resulting total point count by the total number of credit hours. The points assigned for a 1 credit class are listed below (for classes above one credit, multiply the number of points by the number of credits).

A = 4
A- = 3.7
B+ = 3.3
B = 3
B- = 2.7
C+ = 2.3
C = 2
C- = 1.7
D+ = 1.3
D = 1
D- = .7
F = 0

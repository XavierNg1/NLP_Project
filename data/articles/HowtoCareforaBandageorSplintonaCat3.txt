 When your cat's bandage or splint is put on, ask your veterinarian if you can schedule appointments to have the dressing changed. Your veterinarian will advise you about how often this should occur, as bandages on infected wounds may have to be changed up to twice a day (or every 2 days for uninfected wounds) while splints may stay on for up to a week before being changed. Ideally, dressing changes should be done by a veterinarian to prevent infection, further injury, or an inadequately covered wound., If you are not able to bring your cat to the vet to have its splint changed, do it yourself using gauze pads, cotton roll, stretch gauze, elastic bandage, and wooden sticks. Gently remove the original splint entirely and apply a new gauze pad if there is a wound present. Wrap cotton roll and stretch gauze around the wound, place flat wooden sticks on either side of your cat's injured limb, and wrap the entire limb with an elastic bandage.To prevent your cat from wriggling away or ruining its new splint, have a friend or family member hold it while you change the splint.
As you change the splint, inspect the injury for any signs of irritation or infection.
 Gently remove your cat's bandage the way you would remove a splint, then re-wrap the limb with cotton roll and stretch gauze (3-4 layers of each). Wrap the wound tautly enough to stabilise the limb and attach it with adhesive tape.After bandaging your cat's limb, check it's paws to make sure they are not cold from lack of circulation.If they are, unwrap your cat's limb immediately and start again.

 The under cuff is usually fashioned with womenâ€™s jeans that are tighter fitting, and contain lycra woven into the fabric.This is because the lycra gives the jeans some flexibility, which helps to maintain the creasing in the cuff.
 Fold the bottom of both legs of your jeans 1-3 inches thick. The width of the fold is really all about the desired length of your jeans.


Make a larger fold if you want your jeans shorter, and make a smaller fold if you want your jeans longer.
 Iron the bottom edge of the fold to give your jeans a firm creasing.Make sure to iron both the front and back sides of the cuff.
 Instead of folding the cuff again, on the outside of the jeans, turn the cuff inward, folding into the inside of the jeans. The ironed crease should serve as the bottom marker of the cuff. Pull on the edges of the cuff to make sure the fold is even and flat.


This cuff works best for seamlessly altering the length of jeans, in order to pair them with a pair of heels. However, in general, this cuff can be worn with any kind of shoe.

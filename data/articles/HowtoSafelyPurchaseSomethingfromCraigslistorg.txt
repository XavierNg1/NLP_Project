 Use a non-traceable email such as Mailinator, GishPuppy, or others to keep your information private.;
, If the price you negotiate is too good to be true, it very likely is. And it may be a way to get you to come to a crook with cash in order to rob you; most people will not take as many precautions for smaller amounts of money.
 Giving your name and phone number are fine, but avoid giving your address or work place.
 A fast food place, Starbucks, and the phone store that the phone is branded such as Sprint, or AT&T are all acceptable places. Never, even if someone gives an excuse, go to someone's home or work address, especially alone.


If someone gives you excuses as to why you need to go to their apartment or home, do not agree under any circumstance. They may tell you their children are home, they are too young to drive, that their car is broken down, or a number of other creative excuses, still, do not accept the excuse, you have no way of knowing if it's true. Very good thieves and manipulators know exactly what to say so that you let your guard down and agree to something unsafe.
 Preferably during the day, and have a friend or family member come with you. Make sure if you are buying jewelry or an expensive item that you try to always bring a companion. Thieves count on you being alone.
 If there is an emergency you want a quick way to get in touch with help.
 You do not want the person you're meeting to follow you or be with you when you go to the bank or ATM, it could be dangerous. There is a possibility they could also be working with another person who follows you while the first person waits at the location where you've initially met.
 It sounds like this is a lot of work, but it is worth it to stay safe.

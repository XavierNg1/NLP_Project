 Any animal fat can be used, but beef fat is most commonly used. Remove all skin, muscle, ligaments, tendons and meat to leave only animal fat, commonly referred to as tallow.;
, Cut the tallow into small pieces and melt the tallow over a low flame on the stove in a pot. Stir as needed.
 Pour the lye into the water slowly. The addition of lye to the water will generate heat, so handle the containers carefully. Stir the solution gently.
 When the tallow has been rendered, remove the tallow from heat and stir.
 The tallow and the lye solution should both be about 95 degrees F (35 degrees C) for proper mixing.
 Pour the lye solution slowly into the tallow and stir vigorously.
 Pour salt into the completed mixture and continue stirring. Add salt until the thick syrup formed floats to the surface with a pool of fluid formed beneath it. Stop stirring.
 When the mixture has cooled to a consistency that can be scooped out of the pot with a large straining spoon, do so. What remains in the pot will be a liquid with some impurities and salt mixed in. The liquid is glycerin.


Decide how to use the syrup. The syrup is actually hard soap. The syrup can be remelted and poured into molds to make bars of soap. Alternatively, the syrup may be discarded in any manner as it is not hazardous.
 After the glycerin has cooled, pour the glycerin through a fine strainer to filter out most of the impurities. This will not remove all of the dissolved salt. The glycerin must be distilled to remove the diluted salt. The result is a finished quantity of glycerin.

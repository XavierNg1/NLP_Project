 It should drop down into a U-shape as it falls under your fingers. You don't need to measure the yarn precisely; just give yourself enough extra yarn to work with.This U-shape is called a "bight" in knot tying.;
, All it requires is a half turn or so, and the yarn should naturally cross over itself.
 Make sure your other hand is holding onto the strands of yarn below your loop, keeping the shape intact.
 The standing yarn is the line that leads back to your ball of yarn. The shorter side, leading to the end, is called the tail. Pulling the standing line through will form another bight (U-shaped bend in the yarn).









You only need to pull a few inches of yarn through.
 You don't want to cinch the whole thing down yet. You can, however, pull on the tail to bring the knot closer together and "clean it up."









It should look a bit like a noose, with a knot on the bottom of a yarn loop.
 A slip knot almost always goes around something, as the beauty of the know is how easily it tightens and loosens around an object. Pull both the tail and standing line simultaneously to tighten your slip knot.

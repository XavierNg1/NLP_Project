 As noted in the introduction, the type of paper chosen will determine the suitability of the wreath for the occasion.;
, A standard wreath can be made using about eight to ten medium size pinwheels, more if the pinwheels are smaller. To make a pinwheel, see: How to make a pinwheel.
 Find a suitable base, such as a Styrofoam/cane/cardboard wreath base. Glue each pinwheel to the wreath base, taking care to keep the pinwheel shape intact and to try to keep the pattern neat.
 If the wreath base lacks a hanger, add some twine or ribbon to create one. The pinwheel wreath is ready to hang on a door or anywhere else appropriate.

 You should be able to observe your toddler at all times, as a young child should never be left unattended. If your child likes to play in a certain room, set up a table and chair in a place where you have a good view of the entire room., Allow for 30 minutes to an hour of TV time for your toddler while you get some work done. Educational television can help your child learn, as well as providing a short time of rest for him or her between meals. However, never leave your child unattended. Take your work with you into the TV room so you can keep an eye on them., Encourage your toddler to complete crafts or color with crayons while you work. Keep craft materials on hand so that there is always something for them to work on., Children love to imitate adults. Setting up a tiny table with paper, crayons, toy phone, and stickers will stimulate their imagination by allowing them to pretend to be working at the office with you.
 Be sure to keep your home work environment safe so that you can protect your toddler from potential dangers. Store letter openers, thumbtacks, and other sharp objects in closed containers that your toddler cannot reach. A locked desk drawer also works for safe storage.Secure heavy furniture so it does not tip over. Attach it to the wall with brackets or anchors.
Protect cords and outlets. Make sure your toddler cannot reach electrical cords, and that they are not lying on the floor for the toddler to trip on. Put covers onto outlets.
Keep computer ink, correction fluid, markers, and other potentially toxic liquids locked away so that your toddler cannot reach them.

 Depending on what hemisphere you’re located in, the crescent moon will help you identify either south or north. The Northern Hemisphere is the portion of the earth that’s north of the equator, while the Southern Hemisphere is comprised of the area below the equator.All of North America and Europe are in the Northern Hemisphere. The northernmost portion of South America, two-thirds of Africa, and most of Asia are also in the Northern Hemisphere.
Australia, Antarctica, the southern third of Africa, approximately 90 percent of South America, and some southern islands off the coast of Asia are in the Southern Hemisphere.
 This method for finding your direction on only works if the moon is in either the waxing crescent or waning crescent phases, which occur approximately seven days in each calendar month. The crescent phases typically occur at the beginning and end of the month.If you’re not sure whether there will be a crescent moon on a given evening, there are a number of online calendars that provide the lunar phases for each month. Just do a search for “moon phases calendar” or “lunar phases calendar.”

, With your gaze fixed firmly on the moon, image a line from the two points of the crescent that tracks all the way down to the bottom of the skyline. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, the point where the line meets the horizon is roughly south. In the Southern Hemisphere, the point where the line meets the horizon is roughly north.If you are having trouble following the imaginary line down to the horizon, it may help to hold a stick through the tips of the crescent moon as a guide.

 Older students will place a high value on their free time. If a student or students are not quieting down, you can try making them stay after class or during a break. This penalty, or threat of it, should be enough to get most students to settle down and stay quiet when it's time to work., You can try implementing a call and response practice with your kids to help them quiet down. Get in some practice by being noisy, doing the call and response and then making sure that they quiet down after. Strive for complete silence while practicing. The next time your kids get too loud, issue your call and wait for their response, followed by silence.For example you might say "What are we?" and have your students whisper "Quiet".
Older kids respond better to longer responses. You might try using lines from songs or famous passages in books that your class is reading.
 Playing some quiet music during class time can be an effective way of keeping things quiet. Keep the music itself quiet and have it playing as kids walk into the room. Playing soft music can help set the tone that it's time to work quietly and focus. Some people recommend playing classical music during class.
It's best to avoid playing music too loudly or music that is too distracting.

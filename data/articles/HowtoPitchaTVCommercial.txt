The first step is to have an idea that can be turned into a commercial. Most commercials last about 30 seconds and they need to be able to get the viewer's attention and interest within that short time.;

You will need to have your idea written out in an easy way to follow the outline. More importantly, you should prepare a storyboard. This will be the main part of your commercial, shown with graphics and text. It should be laid out in boxes and each one will show a different scene. Each scene should be a drawing of what will happen in that particular scene in your commercial and a description of the scene. The scenes will be in the order they will be shown on the TV.
Your storyboard can be on a poster board and drawn or printed out. Or you can choose to do it using presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Using software, you can put together graphics, text and even music to present your commercial idea.



When you go to the company to present your idea, you want to be prepared and professional. It is best to practice ahead of time. Say your pitch out loud to see how it sounds. Record it if you can so you can see what it looks like from the receiver's point of view. Practice it until you are confident in your delivery and you sound as though you can sell the product.



You can look for the company's contact information on their website. Many companies will list their address and phone number on their websites. Call the company and ask who you may send a query to. It may be an outside agency or the company may have its own advertising department. Ask for a contact name where you should direct your letter.
Your query letter should state who you are. If you have any previous experience in advertising, you should include that. Introduce your TV commercial idea and close with a request to speak with someone regarding the idea so that you may present it.

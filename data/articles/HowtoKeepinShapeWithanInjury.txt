 He or she will probably have suggestions for a fitness program, as well as specific things you can and cannot do. Always listen to your doctor.;
, If your doctor recommends physical therapy, it's a great way to safely maintain fitness. Most physical therapists use a combination of stretching and strengthening in their programs.
 Even if you never bothered to strengthen these areas before, full-body fitness will improve your performance in almost any sport. Some easy exercises that don't require a gym membership are: push-ups, crunches, calf-raises, bridges, bicep curls, and squats.
 Even if you've injured your lower body, it may still be possible to bike or swim. Ask your doctor. If this isn't possible, many repetitions of an exercise can get your heart pumping. For example, try holding a 5lb weight in each hand and move your arms back and forth as if you were jogging.
 Many athletes don't realize that flexibility is an important component of fitness. Flexibility reduces the risk of injury and allows your body to perform better. Start stretching now so you can return to your sport without stiffness, soreness, or worse, re-injury.
 It can be hard to stick to an exercise regimen when you're injured. Especially if you're watching your teammates having a blast, it can be tempting to give up entirely. Keep trying! Find a friend to work out with or write down an exercising schedule. Above all, remember that you WILL recover someday.
 If you tend to push yourself too hard, an injury can be your body's way of forcing you to take a break. With some injuries, it is best to forget about fitness for a while and give your body a chance to rest and rebuild.
 Without your usual training regimen, your metabolism will slow down and you won't need as much food. Make sure the food you do eat is healthy. Even if you're depressed about your injury and want to stuff your face with doughnuts, remember that those extra pounds will only make returning to your sport that much harder.

 Whenever you go anywhere in the game, search all chests, baskets, sacks, and other containers and loot everything. Take it all. Be thorough in your searching and leave no path unexplored when you go through an area. This thoroughness is the main key to making lots of money in any RPG.


There literally are thousands of treasure boxes, vases, and jars all throughout the game map. Items are randomly placed inside, which means there’s a chance of getting rare items. Break open every treasure box you see inside buildings, caves, and dungeons and take any item you see inside.
 Doing quests will also get you loot which you will often sell. Many times the monetary reward for a quest will be minimal, but you will also get a nice item. You can of course keep the item, but it may make more sense to sell it. If you don't really need it, consider the item as loot and sell it off.
 Exploring not only the cities but also the surrounding environments will give you a huge chunk of cash. This is accomplished by "looting" the environment, taking every available resource and alchemical ingredient and selling it later. You will also, of course, find many quests this way and other opportunities to make money.
 Another major key to making a lot of money is to not be dismissive of small transactions. You will find lots of items in the game that are worth very little, but over time you can make a great deal of money by selling them all off.


It doesn’t matter whether it was dropped by a monster or thrown away by another player, when you see stuff lying around, pick it up and add it to your inventory. These items may be small in value but when sold collectively to a vendor, it can bring a pretty hefty price tag.

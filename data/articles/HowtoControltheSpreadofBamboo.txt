 Bamboo is a large grass. And like its smaller cousins, there are some varieties that spread easily and others that form neat clumps. If you already have a spreading variety of bamboo, or if you prefer the style and appearance of the spreading kind, go on to step 2!;
, Most bamboo shoots are edible raw, and all of them are edible cooked. This is actually very effective, but requires diligent harvesting every year. The rhizomes left in place after shoot harvest will put up more shoots the following year.
 While bamboo will grow next to a stream, it will not cross one. Bamboo will not grow into an area that is either bone dry or completely water saturated for more than three months out of the year.
 Mow the lawn as usual during the shooting season, and the soft shoots will be killed before they get started.
 One of the easiest of these is to make conditions very good where the bamboo is, and very bad where you don't want it to be. For example, give your bamboo water, organic material like compost, and a few inches of mulch where you want it to be. Withhold water and nutrients in the areas where you don't want it. This is only reliable in combination with the following step.
 Bamboo spreads by sending rhizomes out from the plant near the surface. These rhizomes will shoot out into your trench where you can easily spot them. Check for these rhizomes once or twice a year, and cut off any that you find. Although another rhizome may replace it the following year, a rhizome that is cut off will not continue growing in that direction.
 Occasionally a rhizome will sneak out under your trench for example, requiring you to dig it up to prevent spread. If you really want a long term low maintenance solution, you may want to install a bamboo rhizome barrier. Though this is the most difficult option, it is the most effective way to control aggressive bamboo. See the related WikiHow article, "How to Install a Bamboo Rhizome Barrier".

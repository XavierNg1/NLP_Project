 Wear mostly blue and aqua. Your hair should be dark brown and always in a ponytail. You don't always have to wear this color. Have nice, blue eyes. Remember it's the attitude that counts.;
, Try not to stress out. Go with the flow and overreact once in a while. Always be confident and never show fear.
 Don't cry when you break your nail. You should be able to run really fast and have great balance and agility. Play a lot of sports such as basketball, soccer, football, etc.
 Fall for a boy that has a fiery temper and that is hard to please. Try not to go overboard with this idea.
 You want your animal love you back too. It doesn't have to be a polar bear named Naga. It could be a dog, your animal is there for you 24/7.
 This should not interest you at all. Usually, never put it on unless you have to do.
 Never give up on your dreams. Even if you fail get up and start all over again.
 Instead of thinking to do something, just do it. Do it again even if you fail.
 But that doesn't mean you can tell them anything. You tend to keep all your emotions to yourself.

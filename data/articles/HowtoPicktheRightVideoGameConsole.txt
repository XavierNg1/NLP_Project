 No console is perfect and not everything will suit your needs. You will probably have to sacrifice at least one thing that you like in order to get a lot of things you love, so bear this in mind.;
, This is far more important than any other decision you will have to make, because if you buy a brilliant console and none of the games are to your liking, why bother? Although most consoles support a huge mix of games, they are usually better at some things than others.
 Bear in mind that saving up for a while and getting a better console than you would have may be a good idea.
 You don't even need to do that much, just check around the internet or talk to people you know. If all your friends have one console and play online regularly, then you may be more inclined to invest in that one. Just do general research and find out background information. Read reviews, weigh up what the advantages and disadvantages of each console you're interested are.
 The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 both offer full 1080p HD graphics and true 5.1 Dolby Surround. Contrastingly, the Nintendo Wii only supports standard definition and stereo audio. This may impact your decision as to which to buy.
 For the latest consoles, online gameplay should be an important consideration. The Xbox 360 offers the best online experience, but there is a subscription fee. The PlayStation 3 offers a good online experience, and it is free. The Nintendo Wii also offers online gameplay on some games.
 For example, the Xbox 360 has Kinect and the PlayStation 3 has Move. The Wii also has a few added bonuses. This should be part of your consideration in buying the product.
 All three of the latest consoles can play games that were intended for an older console, either via emulation or via a port. This is true of some older consoles, too.

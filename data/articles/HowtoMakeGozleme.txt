 Combine all ingredients in a mixer or large bowl and knead until it makes a smooth, elastic dough (approx 5-10 minutes). You may not need all the water as flour absorbs at different rates, so add it gradually. Allow the dough to sit for an hour.


 If you made the yeast free version, its recommended to allow the dough to rest overnight.;
,, You will need to roll out as thinly as possible, so its recommended to dust the table with flour to ensure it does not stick. Keep giving the dough 90 degree rotation turns to ensure the consistency is even. If space permits, roll out all the dough rectangles before filling.


You may also make them into a large circle, the method is flexible.
 Be sure to only spread the filling over half of the dough as you will be folding it over to make a parcel.
 Brush each gozleme envelope lightly with oil.
 Cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. Brush the uncooked side with oil and carefully flip over and cook the other side until golden.

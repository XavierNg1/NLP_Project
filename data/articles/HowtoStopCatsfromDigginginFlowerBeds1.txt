 Lemon is a citrus fruit, and many cats hate the scent of citrus, and will be instantly repelled by the scent. Lemon zest is better if the flower plants are growing, but lemon juice is perfect if you have fully grown flower plants to dodge.;
, Again, many cats absolutely hate the scent (and taste!) of citrus fruits. Alternatively, you can split orange segments and place the buds around the flower beds.
 Though it may smell slightly clinical, it is a great way to repel cats. Its strong odor stops many a cat from entering the area sprayed with it.
 Use a spray bottle filled with just water. Leave it hanging or sitting very close to the affected flower bed. If you come across the cat in the flower bed, grab the bottle and spray the cat. A few short, sharp sprays will scare off puss. Repeat as needed. With luck, the cat may come to associate that flower bed with unpleasantness and will leave it alone.
 This isn't the most ideal solution, as you're likely to get pricked when clearing up the garden bed or picking flowers. However, it may work if the area is open enough and you can easily collect up the prickly matter at the season's end. Try blackberry stems, rose stems and other thorny stems.


Be aware that some cats are really not fussed at walking over the thorny branches. However, they may be far less inclined to start digging into them. At worse, they may urinate but not dig.

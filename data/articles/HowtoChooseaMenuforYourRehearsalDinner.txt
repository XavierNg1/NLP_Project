 Even with a limited budget, you can jazz up your basic menu selection with a fancy appetizer and dessert. Just make sure that the foods match. For example, begin dinner with prosciutto with melon. Your entr√©e could be lasagna with salad and hunks of cheesy bread. Then dessert could be scoops of sorbet served in martini glasses garnished with fruit or a sprig of mint.;
, Which ever you choose will determine the type of menu you should have.


Opt for easy to serve dishes if you are planning to serve your rehearsal dinner food buffet style. Foods such as spaghetti can be messy. Additionally, select foods that will stay fresh looking as it sits out. Cheeses usually sweat and harden when they are left out.
 This would guarantee that your guests select items within the theme of your celebration and also your budget, if that is a concern.
 If you are having a formal reception, the rehearsal dinner should be semi-formal, such as a plated dinner in a fine restaurant. A casual reception would call for a casual rehearsal dinner, such as a relaxed buffet at your home. Accordingly, if your reception is based on a cultural theme and menu choice, such as Italian or Indian, then the rehearsal dinner menu should match accordingly, but don't select the same menu choices as the reception.
 Try to include foods that all parties will enjoy. This means choosing a selection that includes both and meat and vegetable options, and if possible, make an effort to take into consideration any dietary restrictions your guests may have.



If you are at a restaurant and have a small budget, you may hand out a drink ticket and then have a cash bar for anyone who wishes to purchase more than one beverage. Another option is to provide a red and white bottle of wine at the table.
Offer guests an open bar if your budget allows.

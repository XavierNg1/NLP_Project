 When the climbing rose grows canes or stems long enough to reach your trellis, tie them to the climbing structure. Use strong twine or plastic tape. Hold each cane up against the climbing structure so that it runs across the trellis, or other structure, horizontally, at a 45-degree angle or as close to an angle as possible.


Begin training the plant by selecting only the largest, healthiest, sturdy canes and fastening them to the trellis in as straight a manner as possible. Use a material such as netting or rose trellis bands to allow the ties to expand when the canes grow.
 Run a piece of twine or plastic tape through the structure from the backside and loop it around the cane. Push the other end of the twine or plastic tape back through the structure and tie it from the backside.
 Leave it loose enough for the cane to continue to grow without restriction. Bend the tips of the canes so that they are pointing down and tie them into place in the same way. As the canes grow longer, repeat the process further up and loosen the lower ties if they have become too snug.


Tie the lateral shoots or stems that grow from the main canes in the same way when they get long enough. Tying the canes and stems in this way will result in a lovely display of flowers.
 Pruning your rose can be done by removing the ties on the oldest, gray, woody-looking canes and cutting them off at the base. These old canes produce few, if any, roses and should be removed to make way for the new canes.


As the new canes grow, attach them to the support structure as you did with the old canes.

 Coloring books are a great low-energy activity for little kids. Just give them a book and some crayons, markers, or colored pencils.


You don't have to buy coloring books from a store. Search online for free coloring book pages that you can print out. If you don't have a home computer or printer, find out if your local library has any available for use.
There isn't an age limit for coloring books, but most children lose interest by the end of elementary school.
You can engage with a child who is coloring by asking questions. For children from ages three through five, try asking the names of the colors being used.You can also ask about the picture being colored: "What/Who is that?"
Be sure to provide only water soluble, non-toxic coloring utensils.
Avoid markers and pens when using commercial coloring books. Many coloring books are printed on a type of paper that markers can bleed through, ruining the picture on the next page.;
, People of all ages love to draw. Give the kids some printer paper or a sketch book and some drawing utensils.


Toddlers can enjoy "drawing" with scribbles. Encourage them to develop their creativity and motor skills.
While a child is drawing, ask about the picture being made. Don't directly ask what the drawing is "supposed" to be, since this may discourage a child. Instead, ask the child to tell you about what he or she is drawing.Older kids may not like being asked so many questions. Save them for when the child shows you a finished drawing.
 There are thousands of different activities children of all ages can enjoy. Check out websites and blogs run by parents and teachers for ideas. These can be time-honored traditions or completely unique projects. Some examples are:


Paper crafts like snowflakes

Making pet rocks
Fingerpaints

Store-bought crafts like models and jewelry kits

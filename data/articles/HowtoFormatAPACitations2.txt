 Just like with an in-text citation, start your reference list citation with the author. However, when you make a citation in the reference list, you’ll also need the author’s initials, too. Put the author’s last name first, followed by a comma and the initial(s) with periods. For example:


One author: “Smith, G.”
If you have more than one author, your citation would look like: “Smith, G., Davis, D., and Baxter, R.”

, Next, you’ll put the date in parenthesis, followed by a period. Here’s an example:


“Smith, G. Davis, D., and Baxter, R. (1995).”

, Now, you’re going to add in the title of the book. Unlike titles in other types of citations, in APA, you only capitalize the first word of the title, along with the first word of the subtitle. To introduce the subtitle, you use a colon. All the words in the title are italicized. In our example, it would look like this:


“Smith, G. Davis, D., and Baxter, R. (1995). The world in our words: Why things happen.” In this case, the main title is “The World in Our Worlds,” while the subtitle is “Why Things Happen.” Follow the title with a period.
 The city of publication is usually on the title page or the back of the title page. If there are multiple cities, pick the one closest to where you are. Use the postal abbreviation for the state, and don’t use periods between the letters. Do use a comma between the city and state. If your book was published in New York City, the citation would be:


“Smith, G. Davis, D., and Baxter, R. (1995). The world in our words: Why things happen. New York City, NY.”

, Place a colon between the state that the book was published in, and the name of the publishing company. Let’s say our book was published by Treehouse Publishers. Our example would therefore look like:


“Smith, G. Davis, D., and Baxter, R. (1995). The world in our words: Why things happen. New York City, NY: Treehouse Publishers.”

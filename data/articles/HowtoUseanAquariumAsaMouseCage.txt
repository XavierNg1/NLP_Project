 For three female mice or one male mouse you should have at least a 20 gallon (75.7 L) long tank. Bigger is always better. Petco has a $ a gallon sale which sells tanks cheaply.;
, It should be chew proof. Also get a way to clip it on securely. Pet stores such as Petco or Petsmart will sell you everything you need.
 When your mice are babies, a 5 inch (12.7 cm) wheel may do, but as they grow a 6.5+ wheel will be needed. Flying saucers are recommended because they don't bend the mouse's tail. Don't use a barred wheel- for some mice, mesh may be okay, but solid is always best. For multiple mice, more than one wheel is a good idea.
 Have it be tall and climbable- this will be one of their options for climbing onto the mesh lid upside down, which mice love to do. Even if they don't, it will be excellent exercise.
 Get toys that hang from the top- your mice will love scaling them. You can even buy mouse climbing walls. The important thing is to provide plenty of opportunity to climb.
 All of these are pretty easy to find- you can walk into Walmart and come out five minutes later with a suction cup/ aquarium holder water bottle.
 At least once a week do a full cleaning.
 No pine or cedar.
 If they come in a cardboard box (if you have a long ride home, bring a safe carrier) you can put that in the cage for them to climb. Watch out, though- it will get disgusting and need to be removed fairly quickly. Remember to let them settle in, otherwise you'll terrify them.
 Always put your hand down away from them and then approach from the side. It's best to let them come to you.

, Use frequently to cancel out opponents' attacks and to edge guard like a pro.
Side smash, A: Use this combo after unbalancing an opponent. Very useful for KOs and lengthening your smash hit time.
Boomerang (side-B): Try using the boomerang to unbalance an opponent. Great in the air and for edges.
Spin attack (up-B): Last but not least, Link's spin attack is wonderful for edge guarding, area effect attacks, ending combos, and most everything else. Be careful of lag time. Try this combo on an edge: Z, throw, up-B. If timed right, it can be an instant kill.
 Do this by using bombs, neutral airs, boomerangs, down As, and the spin attack. Try Link's dash grab.
 Make up for this with these moves:


The roll (side-R/L): Link's roll makes him hard to attack and can lead to some great combo opportunities. Roll frequently.
The dodge (down-R/L): Essential to Link's technique, the dodge can cut your attack time in half. Master the dodge.
Tech (press R/L when you hit a wall or floor): like L--canceling (another useful technique), teaching will cut your recovery time from a powerful move when you hit the ground in half.
 This will increase your probability of a kill with Link's fantastic edgeguarding skills. Grab your opponent and throw him/her off the edge, setting yourself up for an easy air combo game (use neutral air).
 Use boomerangs, bombs, and the neutral air to work your opponent to the edge. Finish off with a side smash, A combo.

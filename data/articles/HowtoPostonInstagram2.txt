You can only upload one image at a time.
 You can download the app for free from the iTunes App Store, Google Play Store, or Windows Phone Store.
 Make sure that you are logged in with the account that you want to upload pictures to.


You can create an Instagram account for free, or log in with your Facebook account.

You can tap the "Gallery" menu at the top of the screen to select another location on your device to look for images.
 When you first select the image, you will be able to crop it to your liking. If you don’t want to crop the image, don’t select anything and tap the Next button at the top of the screen.


Instagram uploads images as a square, so make sure that you've centered the image so that you can see everything you want to show.
Once you’ve cropped or moved on, you will be able to add effects to the image. Tap Next to move on.
 Once you are done applying effects, you can add information about the photo before you share it. You can add a caption, tag other Instagram users, and share it to services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.
 When you are ready, tap the Share button. You can share the photo directly to other users by selecting Direct. Otherwise, it will be shared with your Followers.
 Repeat the above steps for each additional photo that you want to upload.

 The easiest way to scratch your back is to simply try and do so yourself. You can do this by reaching one or two hands behind your back and trying to find the spot that itches. If the scratch is on your shoulders, lower back, or upper back, you may be able to scratch it on your own., Be gentle when scratching. Vigorous scratching can break the skin, irritating it further. This can cause further itchiness down the road.


Scratch your itch lightly, using gentle motions with your finger. It may be a good idea to trim your nails prior to scratching.If you begin to feel pain, stop scratching. Scratching can feel very satisfying, but you want to resist the urge to over-scratch the itch, as this can break the skin.
 While scratching can be satisfying, you should avoid scratching your itch too frequently. Scratching at an itch too much will not alleviate the itch. If an infection or rash is causing the itch, this will actually make it worse.You can trim your nails very short or wear oven mitts to deter yourself from scratching an itch too deeply.Watch for signs of infection, like redness, swelling, scaling, or warmness around the infected area.
 An itch in the middle of your back may be difficult to reach alone. You can ask a friend, family member, or significant other to assist you. Ask that this person scratch your back for you and help direct them to where the itch is. Request that this person not scratch the itch too hard. You do not want to make the itchiness worse.

 The average deviation is a more detailed measure of the precision of a group of measurements or experiment values. The first step in finding the average deviation is to calculate the mean of the measured values. The mean is the sum of the values, divided by the number of measurements taken.

For this example, use the same sample data as before. Assume that five measurements have been taken, 11, 13, 12, 14, and 12. The mean of these values is (11+13+12+14+12)/5=12.4.
 For this calculation of precision, you need to determine how close each value is to the mean. To do this, subtract the mean from each number. For this measurement, it does not matter whether the value is above or below the mean. Subtract the numbers and just use the positive value of the result. This is also called the absolute value.Algebraically, the absolute value is shown by placing two vertical bars around the calculation, as follows:


Absolute deviation=|x−μ|{\displaystyle {\text{Absolute deviation}}=|x-\mu |}

For this calculation, x{\displaystyle x} represents each of the experimental values, and μ{\displaystyle \mu } is the calculated mean.



For the values of this sample data set, the absolute deviations are:


|12−12.4|=0.4{\displaystyle |12-12.4|=0.4}


|11−12.4|=1.4{\displaystyle |11-12.4|=1.4}


|14−12.4|=1.6{\displaystyle |14-12.4|=1.6}


|13−12.4|=0.6{\displaystyle |13-12.4|=0.6}


|12−12.4|=0.4{\displaystyle |12-12.4|=0.4}




, Use the absolute deviations and find their mean. As you did with the original data set, you will add them together and divide by the number of values. This is represented algebraically as:Average deviation=Σ|x−μ|n{\displaystyle {\text{Average deviation}}={\frac {\Sigma |x-\mu |}{n}}}

For this sample data, the calculation is:


Average deviation=0.4+1.4+1.6+0.6+0.45{\displaystyle {\text{Average deviation}}={\frac {0.4+1.4+1.6+0.6+0.4}{5}}}


Average deviation=4.45{\displaystyle {\text{Average deviation}}={\frac {4.4}{5}}}


Average deviation=0.88{\displaystyle {\text{Average deviation}}=0.88}




, This result may be reported as the mean, plus or minus the average deviation. For this sample data set, this result would look like 12.4±0.88. Note that reporting precision as the average deviation makes the measurement appear much more precise than with the range.

 Move your mouse to the Apple logo in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Click to open a drop-down menu, then select "About This Mac" from the options.
 There are different tabs at the top of the "About This Mac" window--stay in the tab labeled "Overview." Locate the button that says "System Report," and click to open.
 Scroll down on the left panel until you find the "Network" heading and click to expand. Click on "Wi-Fi."

, If you have a WiFi card, it will appear here. It will say "Card Type" and then tell you the name of your card, such as "AirPort Extreme" (yours may be called something different).


If you don't have a card, you might also see the error Wi-Fi: No hardware installed on the top right corner of the screen, along with the date and day.

 You should use a healthy, intact plant that is actively growing because a dead or dormant plant will not provide water vapor that you can collect. Plants that are water-loving, such as willows or cottonwoods, are the best option, but you can use any variety with leaves.The larger the leaves on your plant are the better. That’s because a large leaf surface will usually produce more water vapor than plants with small leaves.;
, Make sure to cover as much of the live plant as the bag can accommodate. For the best results, use a clear bag that allows light to pass through it. The added heat will help extract moisture from the plant.Check your bag to make sure that there aren’t any holes or tears that might allow air inside. If you find one, cover the tear with a piece of strong tape, such as vinyl duct tape.
 Ensure that the seal is as airtight as possible. It helps to tie several layers of the bag off with string, making sure that there aren’t any gaps around the base of the plant., You want at least a portion of it to be lower than the seal around the base of the plant. That’s because the water will gather in the lowest portion of the bag, so you want to give it room to collect.You want to be sure that the plant and bag can bear the weight of any water that’s collected, so check that they’re not starting to list to the side before the water vapor begins to gather.
 It usually takes four to five hours for water to start to collect in the bag. To help the process along, set the plant near a window or under a lamp, so it can receive light to help heat up the inside of the bag., You’ll be able to tell when there’s water in the bag for you to collect, but you have to undo the seal carefully to ensure that you don’t spill any. Pour the water into a glass, bowl, or other container for you to use.You may not get as much water as you want even after several hours. If that's the case, reseal the bag over the plant and repeat the process.

 Tell him that it looks really interesting. After you've told him this, ask about the author or artist/band of the song/book. This should get the conversation going if he really likes the particular author/singer/band. If he doesn't know much about them, say something like, "Hey, (insert band/singer/author here) sounds a lot like (a different band/singer/author here).";
, If he is really friendly and outgoing, he'll probably say hello. If he doesn't, you say hi. This way you can pretend that you aren't trying to talk to him because you like him, but just because you're just bored and have nothing to do but to talk to him or you can pretend that you're just being friendly.
 If you have trouble with math and he's a math whiz, ask him to help you with the math. If you're carrying something heavy, then ask him to help you carry it. This sets you up for a conversation in a non-awkward way. Don't forget to thank him after.
 Say, "Oops, sorry!" Don't just walk into him, blush, and walk away. After you've apologized for bumping into him say, "Hi, my name's _____. What's yours?" If you know his name already but he's new or you're new, say, "Hi, I'm _____. You're _______ right?" If that won't really work, make a comment about something funny that happened in class, some bizarre rumour that obviously isn't real, the amount of homework that the teachers give you, the weather, how awesome they did on their school project or at their football game, etc.
 Here are some examples:


If your crush did awesome at a sport event (football, let's say), say to him, "Wow, you did awesome at the football game on Friday. Can you give me some tips on how to play football as well as you did?"






If your crush did a great school presentation or speech, say to him, "Hey, I loved your speech/presentation on (name school presentation here). I need some help in the public speaking area, and you seem like the best person to ask for advice about this stuff, so could you give me some tips?"






If you know for some reason that your crush got a good grade on his math test, say, "Hi. I heard that you did great on your math test. Great job! I have a couple of tests coming up, maybe you could give me some tips about how I could do as well?"






If you heard that they aced a job interview, say, "Hiya, I heard that you did great on your job interview. I have one coming up, so how did you do so awesome on it?"







, Note that this isn't likely set up a real conversation (unless you do this before class has started), but it might let him know that you're interested and this is good because he will most likely want to talk to you more if he thinks this!

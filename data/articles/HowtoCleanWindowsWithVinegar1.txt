 If you’ve never cleaned your windows with vinegar before, you might want to mix up a slightly stronger vinegar solution for your first attempt. Mix two cups (480 mL) water, ¼ cup (60 mL) white vinegar (you can also use apple cider vinegar), and ½ teaspoon (2.5 mL) of dishwashing detergent.You can also mix up and use this formula if you haven’t washed your windows in a while.;
, If you clean your windows with vinegar pretty regularly, you can use a more basic solution for your cleaning needs. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) water with 1 cup (240 mL) vinegar.








This is a good solution to mix up ahead of time and have on hand just in case you decide to do some cleaning.
 If you have really grimy windows, you’ll want to wash them with an extra strength solution. Simply warm 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar and apply it directly to glass (a spray bottle is best for this particular solution).If your windows are extra dirty, you can leave this solution on your windows to soak for a minute or two before you rinse it off.

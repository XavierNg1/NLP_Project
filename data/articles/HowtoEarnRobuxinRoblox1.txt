 Each day, Builders' Club members will earn a certain amount of Robux just for being in the club, although the amount of robux per day varies per level of Builder's Club. This option, however, costs money.


If this is your first time purchasing BC, you will receive an extra 100 robux just for buying it.
Regular BC members ($5.95 monthly) will receive 15 robux a day.
TBC members ($11.95 monthly) will receive 35 robux a day.
OBC members ($19.95 monthly) will receive 60 robux a day.
Recently Roblox removed tix making it hard for NBC players to get robux.;

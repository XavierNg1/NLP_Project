 The nylon material of the Le Pliage tends to “bubble” when handled improperly. Do not put them in the washing machine! They need to be hand-washed, gently.;
, Wet both sides and the inside of the bag with water. Be careful when handling the bag, make sure it is as flat as possible. Minimize creasing and rubbing it on itself while wet because this will cause bubbling., Keep the material as flat as you can while you soap the inside of the bag, don’t forget the inside pocket. Use the brush to gently remove dirt and grime., Gently brush the material to loosen any dirt, making sure the material is still laying as flat as possible. Gently brush until you’re satisfied that you’ve removed as much dirt as you can. Do this to the other side of the bag and the bottom part, too. Make sure not to crease the material., Generally, the leather is not that dirty and don't need anything more than a quick pass. Try not to get the leather too soaked., Be gentle when handling the bag, avoid crumpling it or causing any creases! Rinse the inside, rinse the pocket, rinse the outside, rinse the leathers — make sure all soap has been rinsed off. Again, please do not crumple the bag or rinse it inside a pail. Just rinse it as best as you can while keeping the material as flat as possible. A hose type shower head is recommended., The back of a plastic chair is best for this. Put the Longchamp Le Pliage upside down over the back of a clean monobloc chair and let the water drip down. The bag’s zipper is open and the back of the chair is “inside” the bag. Let it dry like this for a day or longer., Don’t clip any part of the bag! Just let it hang on a hanger with the zipper open.

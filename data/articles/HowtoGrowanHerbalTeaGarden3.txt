 Plant herbs and flowers of choice and arrange well. If you know which teas your gift recipient will like the most, then choose those.
 List the herbs and flowers, their growing needs, their health benefits and how to make fresh tea. Attach this to the container.
 Provided that the container will not be sitting around in hot sun for too long, you can present your gift wrapped in clear cellophane with a large ribbon bow for a special touch. Make sure that the container has been well watered and is not leaking before wrapping.

 In this version of the code, you will create the code using multiple grids. This will randomize the order of the alphabet a little bit more than using one crosshatch and x grid. It also may be a clearer key for you to work with.


Traditionally, the order of the grids would be crosshatch, X, crosshatch, X or “# X # X.”You can, however, mix up the order as you please to complicate your code. You can write it as “# # X X” or even “X # X #.” Whichever order you choose will determine the order of symbols when you write your substitution code.
 You can choose to write this in alphabetical order or, if you want to be extra careful, reverse alphabetical order. In this version, however, there is only one letter in each space.
 One set of each type of grid should be filled with a dot in every space. To clarify, one crosshatch grid and one X grid should have no dots while one crosshatch grid and one X grid should have one dot per space.
 Like other pigpen codes, the lines immediately surrounding the letters will form the shape of the symbol while the dots/pigs will signal which letter it is. Writing your code out in a list form with each symbol separated will help you keep track of which symbol corresponds with which letter.

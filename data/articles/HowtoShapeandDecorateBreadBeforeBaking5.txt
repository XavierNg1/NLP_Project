 Split in half to make 2 loaves or make 1 large loaf. From this stage, cut each portion into 3 pieces. It's best to use a scale and calculator for best accuracy to ensure each portion is equal.


You may also divide it into 4 for an even more attractive plait, but it's better with the big 1kg loaf to be made into a 4-plait.
 Gather the three together and pinch at one end, if desired you may tuck this seam underneath the finished plait.
 This is just like plaiting hair, otherwise you may look at the three portions as a simple pattern, folding one strand over another: ABC, BAC, BCA, CBA, CAB and so on until you run out of dough.


You may mist with water and dip in seeds if you wish, or use an egg wash for an attractive finish.
 Ideally on a floured cloth or the baking tray. Bake 30-35 minutes for the smaller 500g loaves.


You may also plait small rolls for an attractive finish, or even more attractive is to fold the plait in on itself to make a loop. Flatten the roll slightly and allow to proof.

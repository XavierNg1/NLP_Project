 It's quite normal for your feelings to run the gamut from anger to sadness and back again to a stressful situation. Allow yourself to feel these emotions in an appropriate manner such as crying, screaming into a pillow or even something creative such as writing a poem or painting a picture can help.
 If any of you need a longer, cooling down period, then allow that time to pass before you try speaking with them.
 This is not the time for a long drawn out discussion. A simple phrase such as, "Can you please not fight around me," will suffice.

 Redbud trees prefer light shade, especially in the summer. The tree is fairly adaptable, however, and can also tolerate full sun. In fact, the more sun it receives during the cold months of winter, the better. The only locations that need to be avoided are those with heavy shade., Redbud trees prefer loose, well-drained soil, but they are very sturdy and can thrive in the majority of soil types. If you do decide to amend the soil, though, you can do so simply by chopping the soil up with a rake or shovel to loosen it. If it is extremely dense or clay-like, you could even mix in some coarse grain garden sand to improve its ability to drain. You do not need to add fertilizer, however, since redbud trees are capable of absorbing nitrogen in through the air.
 Local stores are more likely to have stock that can withstand the climate you live in. The tree can be difficult to transplant as it gets older, so you should get as immature a tree as possible., The roots need plenty of room to spread out inside the hole. The hole should also be about equal in depth to the height of the roots.
 Place the tree on its side and gently twist the container off.
 Keep it as vertical as possible, enlisting the help of another person if necessary. Add a little soil back in to help keep the plant standing straight.
 Use a garden hose to fill the hole with water. Wait until the roots and the surrounding soil absorb the water before filling the hole with the rest of the soil, covering the roots completely. Give the soil another thorough watering to help the soil settle.
 Use bark chips or another type of moisture-retaining mulch. Spread the mulch in a thin layer around the base of the tree, above the root area.

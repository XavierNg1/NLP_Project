 It's impossible to create a Yahoo account without verifying it, so to verify an account you must first go through the initial steps of creating one.;
, Before clicking or tapping the Continue button at the bottom of the new account creation page, you should ensure that your name, desired email address, password, and phone number are accurate.


The phone number aspect is extremely important, since the number you enter here will dictate where your verification code is sent.
 It's a blue button below the account creation area. This will take you to the account verification page, where you have the following options for receiving your code:



Text me an Account Key - Receive a text message with your Yahoo verification code.

Call me with an Account Key - Receive a phone call in which you Yahoo verification code will be spoken aloud to you.
 Doing so will prompt Yahoo to text or call your number with your five-digit code.


If you exit the account creation process before verifying your account, your account will not be created and you'll have to start over.
 Depending on the verification option you chose, you'll do one of two things:


Open your phone's Messages app, look for a new message from a six-digit phone number, and then open the message to view the five-digit code.
Answer the incoming call, then listen to the numbers that are spoken aloud.
 This is the text field in the middle of the Yahoo page.


If you're receiving a phone call, you may want to type the code into this field as it is recited to you.
 It's a blue button below the verification field. As long as the code you enter here matches the code in the text or phone call you received, your Yahoo account will be verified and completed.

 Unlike its relatives, poison ivy and poison oak, poison sumac is restricted to a fairly small area of the world. If you are outside the following areas, your chance of encountering poison sumac is almost zero:Ontario, Quebec, and other eastern provinces of Canada
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and all U.S. states east of them, including all of New England
Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and all U.S. states east of them, including all of the South
Texas, and all states east of it along the southern U.S. border, including Florida

, Poison sumac thrives in unusually wet soil, or even in standing water. If the surrounding area is dry throughout the year, there is little chance that poison sumac is present.


During dry weather, keep an eye out for empty riverbeds or dried mud that indicate the area may usually be wet.
 Poison sumac has trouble growing at 4,000 ft (1,200 m) above sea level or above.If you are above 5,000 ft (1,500 m), there is almost no chance of exposure to poison sumac.


Its relatives, poison ivy and poison oak, are also constrained to low elevations, reducing the need for caution concerning poisonous plant exposure at high altitudes.

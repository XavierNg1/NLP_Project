 Getting your cat vaccinated against rabies is the best, most cost effective way to prevent this disease. In many countries, rabies vaccinations are required by law.


Set up a regular vaccination schedule with your veterinarian to keep your cat’s rabies vaccine up-to-date. Some vaccines need to be administered yearly, every two years, or every three years., Another way to protect your cat from rabies is to keep him from away from wild animals. Keeping your cat in the house is ideal because your cat will not be exposed to neighborhood cats, raccoons, or other animals that might be carrying rabies.


If your cat is accustomed to going outside, then only allow him outside under your close watch. Don’t let your cat go near any unfamiliar animals., Wild animals are common carriers of rabies. If your yard is not appealing to wild animals, then there will be less of a chance of your cat coming into contact with rabid animals. Some things that you can do to keep wild animals out of your yard include:placing tight lids on all of your garbage cans
making sure there are no hiding spots for skunks or raccoons, such as under your deck or house
putting in a fence to keep wandering animals out of your yard
keeping trees and shrubs pruned

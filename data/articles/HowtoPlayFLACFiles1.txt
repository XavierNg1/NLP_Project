 This is a fast and easy way to play a FLAC file without having to deal with any customizations or add-ons. Here are 2 programs you may want to consider using.


VLC Player: this media player is available for Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems. It was at one point available for iOS devices, but was removed from the App Store by Apple. The VLC Player installation includes the VideoLAN client that supports FLAC files as well as Flash Video (FLV) and many other file formats. VLC is well known for it's ability to view almost any video file, and plugins allow it to view any that can not in the default installation. You can download VLC Player for free from the official VideoLan website.
Foobar 2000: the Foobar 2000 media player also supports the FLAC format as a native feature, which means you don't have to go through any additional installations to play a FLAC file through the Foobar 2000 player. You can download the player for free from the Foobar 2000 website.;

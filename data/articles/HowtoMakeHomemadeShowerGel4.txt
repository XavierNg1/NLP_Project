Dried herbs such as lavender buds, geranium leaves, rosemary stems, etc. It can help to pulverize them first in a mortar and pestle or food processor.
Dried fruit such as orange slices, grapefruit slices, etc.
Spices, such as cinnamon sticks, star anise, ground ginger, etc.
Pure extracts (vanilla, almond, etc.).

 Sea Life Park, Bishop Museum, Honolulu Zoo, and Hoomaluhia Botanical Gardens are perfect visiting places to enjoy for the entire family. Recommended beaches for toddlers and young kids are Baby Makapu'u (located directly across Kalanianaole Highway from Sea Life Park), Lanikai, Haleiwa, and Waikiki., There's Dave & Busters for games, Rascal's for laser tag, and Ice Palace for ice skating. And don't forget the shopping.
 Depending on what kind of music and style you like, in addition to your age, will depend on what clubs to go to. Ocean's Club is the only one that allows 23 and up, while majority are 21 and up.
 If you are into waves, you're best bet is Sandy Beach in Hawaii Kai, or the world famous North Shore, and if you're wanting to find a cozy, quiet place, relax at frequently top-rated Lanikai and Kailua Beaches.

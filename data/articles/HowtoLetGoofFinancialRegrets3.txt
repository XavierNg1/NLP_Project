 Overspending is the single most common reason for financial regrets. People spend more money they can afford, and then find themselves saddled with debt over unnecessary purchases and investments. Once you’ve put together a monthly “money regrets” budget, stick to it; don’t give into the temptation to purchase goods or services that put your total expenditure over your total income.It’s worth noting your motivation for overspending so you can reign in these impulses in the future. For example, do you overspend absentmindedly, or do you overspend socially (only when out with friends)?

, Many people also experience financial regret due to a lack of savings funds. For an individual without savings, any financial emergency—from medical bills to car payments—can be ruinous. To help leave your savings account intact, view it as money for emergencies or for unexpected expenses; don’t think of savings as a large reservoir of spending money.As a rule of thumb, you should always have on hand (e.g. in an easily accessible bank account) at least six months of net income.
 No matter your age—provided that you’ve at least graduated from college—you should be thinking about your retirement, especially once you’ve found a career or are steadily employed. A large source of financial regret for individuals later in their lives comes from the fact that they did not plan ahead or save enough for retirement.You can avoid this mistake by increasing the amount of monthly savings you set aside (earmarked “for retirement”) or by increasing your monthly payments into your employer’s retirement system or a 401k account.
As a general rule, about 20% of your income should be saved for financial priorities, including retirement and debt payment (if applicable).

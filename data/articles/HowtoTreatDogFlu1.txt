 Supportive care is basically a combination of symptom management and rest, so that your dog's immune system is optimized and best able to fight off the virus. Your dog's immune system is the only thing that can actually fight off the bug itself.


Keep your dog's eyes and nose clean. Wipe these areas down with a cotton pad soaked in water that has been boiled, then cooled to room temperature.
Make sure your dog's bed has plenty of padding. If your dog isn't moving very much, they can develop bed sores. Provide additional padding with a few extra blankets.
Keep your dog indoors and make sure it is not too hot or too cold.;
, If the dehydration is only mild, encouraging your dog to drink more water orally may be sufficient.


A dog needs to drink 50 milliliters (1.7  fl oz) of water for every kg body weight (so, if your dog weighs 22kg or 50 lbs, they need 1,100 ml of water daily). If your dog is not motivated to drink, you can syringe water in through the side of their mouth in small, frequent doses throughout the day.
 A sick dog may not have much interest in eating, but it is important for your dog to keep their strength up. If your dog will not eat, try warming some wet or canned food and offering it to them. The dog may allow you to hand-feed them or may be interested in eating their favorite treats. If nothing seems to be working, ask your vet about Oralade, a liquid food that you can give your dog via syringe., Speak to your vet if you would like medications to help with pain, fever, and/or runny nose and congestion symptoms in your dog (all of which are often present in cases of canine influenza).

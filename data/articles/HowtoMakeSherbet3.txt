 Add 3 cups (425 g) of frozen raspberries that have been thawed until soft, 1 ½ cups (355 ml) of whole milk, and ¾ cup (150 g) sugar to the bowl of a food processor. Process the ingredients until the mixture is smooth.If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender to mix the ingredients together.
Make sure that the whole milk is very cold when you mix the ingredients.
 After you’ve blended the raspberry mixture, place a fine mesh sieve over a large bowl. Pour the raspberry mixture through the strainer to remove the seeds, and discard any solids left behind.Make sure to press on the raspberry mixture with the back of a spoon to get all of the liquid out of it.
 Once you’ve removed the seeds from the raspberry mixture, add 1 ⅛ teaspoon (6 ml) of lemon juice to the bowl. Stir well to ensure that it’s fully incorporated.For the best tasting sherbet, use freshly squeezed lemon juice.
 After all of the ingredients are mixed, transfer the sherbet mixture to your ice cream maker. Mix it for approximately 25 minutes or as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions until it reaches the consistency of soft serve.If you don't have an ice cream maker, transfer the sherbet mixture to a freezer-safe container and freeze it for 6 to 8 hours. Be sure to stir it every hour until the sherbet reaches soft serve consistency.
 When you’re finished mixing the sherbet in the ice cream maker, move it to a freezer-safe container. Cover the container, and allow the mixture to chill for approximately 4 hours in the freezer or until it is firm enough to scoop.This recipes makes approximately 1 quart (946 ml) of raspberry sherbet.

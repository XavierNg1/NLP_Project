 Noobs can be found most anywhere. Noobs often can be found at minigames, but they infest RuneScape everywhere. More and more noobs are being made each day.;
, You wouldn't call somebody a runner at the duel arena, because there isn't much room to run away. You also wouldn't call somebody an eater at Fist of Guthix, because there is no food allowed in the arena.
 Their noob label should be based off of what they are doing that gives them an advantage. Find their strategy, and label it.
 While "noob" normally means a new player, it means something completely different in combat. Calling somebody a noob in combat means that their strategy is superior to yours, although arguably less honorable. adding "noob" to the end of your label is unnecessary, because you wouldn't be labeling them if they weren't a noob.

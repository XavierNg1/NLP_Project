 Discuss the costs of a funeral and burial or research the details online. Funeral expenses vary greatly depending not only on the options you choose, but on location. They will also increase over time.


A traditional burial requires a casket, headstone, burial plot and concrete liner. If you want to allow a viewing, you will also need to consider the costs of embalming.
Cremation is less expensive than a traditional burial, requiring only an urn and the cost of conducting the cremation. You can choose to have your urn buried or placed in a vault, or you can direct that it be kept by family member.
Green burials are becoming popular in some parts of the country. Rather than using embalming and a casket to preserve your remains, a green burial is designed to allow your body to decompose. This allows you to return to the Earth and become food for plants growing nearby.;

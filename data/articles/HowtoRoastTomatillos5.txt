 Slice the tomatillos with a kitchen knife. Cut them into horizontal halves--side to side—rather than cutting them vertically—from top to bottom.,

If using a gas grill, preheat all the burners to a medium-high temperature. Allow the grill at least 10 to 15 minutes to reach an ideal heat.
If using a charcoal grill, light a full chimney of charcoal on fire. Once the coals are covered with gray ash, pour them out into your grill and spread them across the bottom.
 Remove the grate from the grill and coat it in cooking spray. Place the grate back inside the grill when done.

If you do not have cooking spray, you could also coat the grate with vegetable oil.
Make sure that the grate is also clean before you oil it.
 Place each tomatillo half on your oiled grill grate cut-side down. Grill them until they begin to soften.

By this point, the cut sides and skins should both be brown.
 Use tongs to turn the halves so that they are cut-side up. Continue grilling for another few minutes or until they have completely softened.

The skins will usually be charred and blackened by this point.
 Remove the tomatillos and place them in a bowl or on a cutting board sitting out at room temperature. Let them cool until they are safe to handle with your hands.

The skin can affect the texture of your final dish, so if desired, you can peel the skin off your tomatillos after cooking them. Since charred skins contribute a smoky flavor to finished sauces and dishes, though, many cooks prefer to leave them intact.

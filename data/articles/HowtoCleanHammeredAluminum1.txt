 Because aluminum is soft, choose a non-abrasive dish detergent such as Dawn. Spread a squirt of the detergent over the aluminum, enough to use to scrub out stains. During regular use, hammered aluminum can be cleaned like any metal dishware.Alternatives to dish detergent include an orange cleaner, lemon juice, or a degreaser such as Dawn Power Dissolver.;
, Warm water will loosen up stains such as those from food left on dishware. You don’t need the water to be hot. Submerge the aluminum item in the water.
 Again, the brush must be soft or else it will leave scratches. Choose a sponge, non-abrasive pad, a soft-bristled scrub brush, or old toothbrush. Scrub the surface of the aluminum and most stains will come off.Don’t use steel wool or else the aluminum will gain small scratches.
 If the stains are still present or when using an alternative detergent such as orange cleaner, allow the aluminum item to sit in warm water. Leave it alone for about five minutes. The warm water should make it easier to scrub or wipe away the stains.Five minutes is often enough to clear off debris while minimizing water exposure, but for stubborn stains you can try soaking it for 30 minutes.
 Place the aluminum item under warm, running water. Make sure all the cleaner is rinsed off the surface.
 Use a soft cloth to remove all the moisture. Make sure all the water is gone so none of it sits on the metal and causes stains.

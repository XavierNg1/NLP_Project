 They should get at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight, or partial shade, with four to six hours of direct sunlight.


Keep in mind that when planted in full sun, especially in hotter climates, they must be watered more often than if they are planted in partial shade.If they are not watered sufficiently, the leaves may be scorched by the sun.;
, This is especially important during the winter. The wind will dry out the leaves and turn them bronze.
 Test the soil drainage capabilities by digging a 1- to 1 1/2-foot deep hole and filling it with water.


The water should soak into the surrounding soil within 24 hours. If the water is still standing after 24 hours, consider a different shrub or build a raised bed for the boxwood that is 1 to 1 Â½ feet high.
 A soil pH test kit can be purchased at a local garden center or nursery.Take the soil sample from 4 inches deep right where the shrub will be planted. Be careful not to contaminate the sample by using your hands as human skin can alter the soil pH readings.


Let the sample dry, crush it until it has a fine texture, pour it into the test kit container and add distilled water and the chemical provided in the kit.
Shake the mixture and let it settle. Compare the color of the distilled water with the color chart provided with the test kit.
 Mix lime or elemental sulfur into the soil to adjust the pH, if necessary. How much must be added depends on the soil type and how much the pH needs to be adjusted.


It takes 5 pounds of lime to adjust the pH of 100 square feet of loamy soil from 6 to 6.5 or 1 to 1 1/4 pounds of aluminum sulfate to adjust it from 7.5 to 7.
It takes less to adjust sandy soil and more to adjust clay. Incorporate the lime or sulfur into the soil thoroughly with a tiller prior to planting the boxwood shrub.

 Measure about two inches from the bottom of the page and draw a line horizontally. Then measure about 2.5 inches from the left of your paper. Draw a line vertically. Your template should now consist of three separate parts for note taking in class, in an upside-down T shape.


The Cornell outline is organized for almost any number of presentation formats to make scanning, locating, and studying notes easier.
The outline is also aesthetically pleasing compared to page-after-page of unending, and often needless, note taking.
You can find many Cornell templates online if you don't want to divide your own paper up.;
, As with all note taking, your notes should be organized chronologically and topically by placing a heading at the top of the outline for each page. Staying organized will save you time and effort.


Place the title of the lecture, the class, and date at the top of the page for easy reference. If you must take multiple pages of notes, make sure to add page numbers.
 The Cornell outline functions off of the 5 Râ€™s: recording, reducing, reciting, reflecting, and reviewing. All three processes take place within the template you just created. Because this system can be applied to a diverse range of note taking environments it becomes a reusable and efficient system for studying.


The largest column of your template is the note taking section. This is the only section you will use during class to record notes.
The first column on the left, the cue column, will be used after class to help reduce your notes to key words and main ideas.
The bottom section, called the summary, is also used after class to reflect on the meaning of the notes you took in 2-3 sentences.

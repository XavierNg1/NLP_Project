 An origami paper lantern can make a singular decoration on its own. You can also fold multiple paper lanterns in multiple colors and string them together as a party decoration.
 While this is technically a modular piece, its use is more decorative than geometric in nature. Hang these snowflakes or attach them to a window for a unique winter decoration.
 After you fold the pinwheel, push a straight pin through the center and into a pencil or a chopstick. When you blow on the pinwheel, it will spin. You can also place a pinwheel in your garden so that it can catch the wind.
 This heart contains a pocket on the top that can be used to hold a letter, a piece of candy or jewelry. Since sticky notes come in a variety of bright and beautiful colors, you can use a sticky note as the basis for your origami heart.
 An origami envelope is made from a square piece of paper. The larger the piece of paper you use, the larger your envelope will be.

 Put your jeans in your washing machine and run them through a standard washing cycle. Set the machine to the hottest water level possible.









Avoid using delicate or hand-wash settings. Instead, use a permanent press or heavy duty setting.
The combination of hot water and heavy churning will cause the fibers in your jeans to contract.
Use detergent and liquid fabric softener as usual. Detergent will not reduce the effectiveness of this technique, and fabric softener can actually help to prevent the jeans from becoming too stiff as they shrink.;
, As soon as you remove your jeans from the washing machine, transfer them to your dryer. Dry the jeans completely using the hottest setting possible.









The heat of the dryer will cause the fibers to contract even more than they did in the washer.
Let your jeans dry completely. In fact, if you can leave the jeans in your dryer for 5 to 10 minutes longer after they finish drying, you may have even better results.
Do not air dry. Air drying your jeans following this method can actually cause some of the shrinkage to stretch out.
 One cycle is usually enough to tighten up your jeans, but if your jeans still feel a little loose, try running them through another cycle or two.









Try a professional dry cleaner if you cannot get your jeans to shrink sufficiently in your own washer and dryer. The machines at a dry cleaner have higher heat settings.

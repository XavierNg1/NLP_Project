 If you need to view the contents of an MSG file but don't want to install or use a reader program, you can use online conversion websites to convert it to a PDF file. You can then open the PDF in any program that can read PDFs. Popular conversion websites include:


Zamzar.com - zamzar.com/convert/msg-to-pdf/

CoolUtils.com - coolutils.com/online/MSG-to-PDF


, The process is a little different depending on the website you're using. Usually you'll need to browse for the file, but you may be able to drag and drop it.
 This will allow you to read the file on any computer that can open PDFs, which is virtually all of them. Any modern web browser can open PDF files.
 Depending on the service, you may be given a download link, or the link may be emailed to you. Regardless, the conversion process should only take a few moments.
 On most computers, you can just double-click the downloaded PDF file to open it in whatever the default reader program is. You may have to choose one of your web browsers if there is not a reader program installed.

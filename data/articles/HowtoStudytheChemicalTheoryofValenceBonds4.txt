 If you are just starting your first chemistry class, be warned that they are not for the faint of heart. You should read the chapter ahead of time and take notes on what you read. This will help you identify any questions you have about the valence bond theory in advance., Chemistry students are rarely successful at memorizing everything needed to do well with the valence bond theory. Instead, engage in the class and practice thinking in a scientific way. You should also take notes in the class so that you remember the important points that are covered pertaining to the valence electrons and bonding., Lab classes are a critical part of understanding chemistry. They provide a hands on application for many of the concepts that you will see in the text book. It is important to come to lab prepared, and to follow all safety precautions. This is where you can see some of the chemical reactions predicted by valence bond theory in action., Cramming the night before a chemistry exam is rarely successful, and always miserable. Instead, set aside an hour or two after every class to review the material covered in the class and refresh yourself on older material. This will help you stay focused and confident in your chemistry class.


Study groups are a great way to make studying more fun.

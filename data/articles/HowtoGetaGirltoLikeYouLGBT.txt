First of all, you can't be bi or lesbian if you haven't found a girl you like. If you're heterosexual (straight) don't force yourself to like the same gender! You can try, but won't be very successful although some people have been successful on this. If you've already found a girl you like, skip this step.;
,


Unless she's your best friend, but if you've just met this girl get to know her better and try to become her best friend.
 Flirt a bit, but don't make her think you like her. Smile a bit, giggle calmly and cute and make her laugh, maybe if you befriend her enough you can go somewhere!

,


If you really got to know her, ask if she's bi or lesbian. Don't do this if you think she doesn't trust you enough, but after you've earned her trust ask her this question. How you gain her trust is tell her a secret, not your biggest one but one you feel comfortable telling her.



That's part of liking each other, dating! If you feel like she's your bestie now, ask her out casually like "lets go to coffee shop" or take her to a basketball game! Find out her interests first, then take her somewhere that fits her hobbies!

, You should be able to call or text her to get her to be your friend more.



Facebook, twitter, snapchat, instagram, etc ask her to add you/follow etc on a social site, you can know her better this way.
 Don't be scared.

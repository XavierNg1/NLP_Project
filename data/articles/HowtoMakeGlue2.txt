 You will use flour, sugar, water and vinegar to make paper mache glue. You can adjust the recipe as needed to make more or less glue. The basic proportions are 3:1 for the flour:sugar mixture. Use one teaspoon of vinegar for every cup of flour you use.


If you want a smoother paste, you can sift the flour before you make your paste.
 In a small saucepan, mix the flour and sugar with a spoon or whisk until well-blended.
 Blend the mix until it is very smooth and lump-free. It will have the consistency of a thick paste. When smooth, whisk in the rest of the water, ¼ cup to ¾ cup depending on how runny you want your paste, and mix thoroughly. Blend your ingredients until your glue is smooth and a little runny but not watery. Your paste should not be too thick or too drippy.
 Pour your mixture in your saucepan and turn on the heat. Stir the mixture constantly until the mixture begins to thicken. Once your mixture starts to boil, you can turn off the heat.
 When the mixture has cooled, use it for any craft projects including paper mache. Once you have finished, keep any unused glue in a tightly-sealed container in the refrigerator. This glue will keep for 2 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator.
 When cooled, you can use this glue to make paper mache, craft projects, and anything else. It's totally non-toxic, too.









Make sure to dry thoroughly any of the crafts you make with this glue. If the project stays damp, it may grow moldy over time. Mold needs water to grow so as long as you pat your products dry or heat them over an oven, you will keep mold away.

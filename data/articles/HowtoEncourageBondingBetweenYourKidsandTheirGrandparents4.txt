 Oral history is a powerful tool for teaching kids about the past. Interviewing Grandma is a great way to not only learn about her life as a young woman, but to pass on family and regional history that might otherwise be lost. Sit down with your child and make a list of questions to ask Grandma about the past. Record the interview using your smartphone and preserve the resulting oral history for future generations.
 Grandparents often have lots of old photos lying around that tell tales about a family’s history. Ask your children’s grandparents to locate old family photos and then make copies of the originals. Using the originals, have your children work with their grandparents to create a scrapbook with the photos and any stories Grandpa might want to share.
 Learning about their ancestry is an empowering and interesting endeavor for kids. Consider asking your kids’ grandparents to sit down with the children and sketch out a family tree. This will give Grandma an opportunity to share stories about her parents and grandparents that she might not otherwise share.

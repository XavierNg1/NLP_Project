Like oil-based paints, you must first find a container where the water-based paint and thinner can be combined. While water-based paints can be removed with slightly less difficulty than oil-based paints, this container should still be one that you will not miss in the event that it is ruined.



Remove any dried pieces of paint from the liquid you pour into the mixing container.



As suggested by the name, you will use water to thin water based paints. Add clean, cool water in a ratio of approximately 3 parts paint to 1 part water for best results.



Use a stir stick to mix the paint and water. You can then use a paintbrush to apply to it a wall or canvas. As described previously, if the paint is still too thick, continue adding water is small amounts, testing the paint after each addition.

 In this section, you'll learn how to get kilometers from miles. Start by writing the number of miles you want to convert. If you're using a calculator, type it in.


Let's follow along with an example. If we want to convert 50 miles into kilometers, we would start by writing it out like this: 50 miles.;
, Your answer will be the number of kilometers in miles. That's all there is to it!


In our example, we can find the answer like this: 50 × 1.6 = 80 kilometers.
Don't forget the "kilometers" label. You can also write "km" for short. If you're doing this for homework, you may lose points if you leave it off.

 One mile isn't exactly 1.6 kilometers. It's actually about 1.609347218694. This is the official U.S. Survey definition.Use as much of this number as you want to get your answer more precise.


If we want to know exactly how far 50 miles is in kilometers, we can just multiply 50 by 1.609347. This gets us 50 × 1.609347 = 80.46735 kilometers — about half a kilometer more.
You only need to do this for really precise conversions. Just use 1.6 for basic purposes!

, Getting back to miles is easy. Since dividing is basically the opposite of multiplying, divide by 1.6 to "undo" the multiplication.


In our original example, 80/1.6 = 50 miles — right back where we started.
If you used a different decimal than 1.6, divide by it instead. In our alternate example above, we would divide by 1.609347.

 Instead of ignoring them, look at them. Nod, smile, or say hello to show you are aware of their presence. This is a compassionate response that won’t cost you any money., A flat “No” to their request might seem rude and uncaring. Instead, try something like, “I’d like to help, but I don’t have any cash.” It’s respectful, and it allows you to avoid feeling like a villain.
 You could give your spare change, but you can’t control what it will be used for. Instead, if it’s safe to do so, ask what they would like to buy. If they need a bus ticket, offer to buy one for them. If they’re wearing shoes in poor condition or covering themselves with newspapers, ask their shoe size or offer to bring a blanket. This sees to their physical needs and also gives them the dignity and respect that money can’t buy.
 If you’re near a restaurant or café, offer to buy a cup of coffee or a sandwich. This will allow you to address the beggar in a way that’s helpful and open. You also can at least be assured they’ll have food or a warm beverage.Keep in mind some beggars may trade food for other goods or services. You can’t control this once you hand them the food. This doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s good to keep this in mind so you are aware of the possible downsides of giving a beggar food.
 If you think they might be sleeping on the street, let them know the location of the nearest homeless shelter. This will help them get off the streets, at least for a night. It will also connect them with services that could give them the means to rise out of their situation. To find shelter locations around the world, visit:

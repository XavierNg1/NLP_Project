 You want to find an older filing cabinet with a solid bottom. You don't want one that's rusty or in bad shape though.
 Remove the drawers and also the tracks if you can. Sand out the inside and remove as much paint (if there is any inside) as you can. Tip the filing cabinet so that the back is now the base and place the cabinet where you want your new veggie bed to be.
 Using outdoor safe spray paint, repaint the outside a fun new color to start bringing the cabinet back to life. Look for spray paints that are graded to stick well to smooth metal or enamel.
 Get a lining material and line the inside of your cabinet. Weed liner is good for this. It will help keep the metal from becoming damaged too quickly.
 Unless you drill holes in the new bottom of the cabinet, you'll need to place several inches of filler material at the bottom of the cabinet to allow drainage. Start with a base, single layer of river rock, add a 3" layer of gravel, and then add a 3" layer of sand.
 Now, fill your filing cabinet with planting soil. Leave about 2" at the top. More soil can be filled in if needed once your plants are put in.
 Grow or transplant your vegetable plants. Enjoy your colorful, modern garden box!

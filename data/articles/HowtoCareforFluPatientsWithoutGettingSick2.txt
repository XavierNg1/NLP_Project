 If your intimate partner is ill, sleeping in separate bedrooms (if you have a guest room) is ideal until the person recovers. If this is not possible, avoid cuddling and kissing and stay on your separate sides of the bed until the virus subsides.


If you have two or more bathrooms in your home, use separate bathrooms (and separate towels) until the person recovers. This will help to prevent the spread of germs, and will minimize your risk of catching the flu.
Select a chair for the infected person in the living room, so that you can avoid sitting in a chair that is contaminated with infectious germs.
, For this reason, if the ill person can afford time off work (if they are granted sick days from their boss), now would be the time to take them. The infected person's co-workers will be grateful to not be exposed to infectious germs.


Another option, depending upon the type of work that the person does, is to work from home until the virus subsides. This way, others are not at risk of catching the infection.
 Offer them plenty of fluids, encourage lots of rest, and offer tissues and hand sanitizer to the infected person as needed. You can also help out by cooking meals for him or her, and looking after household duties until the affected person recovers.

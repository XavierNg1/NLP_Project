 If you pick it up from nature, wash it first, then bake dry in the oven. Sand purchased from retail suppliers is usually ready for use.


Sand can often be purchased at hardware stores or garden/landscape centers. Explain that you only need a small amount and see if they'll sell just a small amount to you for a small price.
 A shoebox or similar is ideal. Poke holes along the bottom of the box with a skewer, pencil, or similar object.
 The paper should come up the sides of the box, both sides, with enough for you to pull on when the drying is completed.
 Fill the box to about 1/2 an inch/1.5cm.
 Face them downward. Stems and leaves can also be dried at the same time, in the same fashion. Sprinkle with more sand to cover.
 They should sit for at least one week to 10 days. Check that they have dried enough before proceeding.
 Do this over a container or outside, to allow the sand to drain through the holes you punched at the beginning. If you use a container to catch the sand, you can reuse it.


Do not attempt to pull the dried flowers out until the sand has drained; doing so can destroy them––they're fragile!

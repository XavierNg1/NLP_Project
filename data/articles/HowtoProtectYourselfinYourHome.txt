 This creates a "second barrier" even if someone were to break into your home while you slept. This would possibly give you few seconds to wake up, get yourself together, and grab your gun. It's also a safe place that you could run to if someone was breaking in a door or entering your house during the day.;

 This will give the impression that someone is still up and awake.
 Don't let people see straight into your house.
 Or remove them. These are intruder/burglar hidey-holes and can be very attractive to someone wanting to hide. If your house is more open, the neighbors can help keep an eye on things for you. Don't forget to ask them to!

Even during the day, be aware of which rooms have open windows.
If you can invest in windows that lock while open a small way, that is a great option.
For sliding windows and doors, place a strong piece of dowel in the sliding slot to prevent the window sliding back any further.
Always keep the front and back entrance doors locked. Keep keys close by, but not in sight range from outside.
 They scare away burglars as soon as they enter the house, or better still, there are some that will go off if anybody touches a window, door etc.

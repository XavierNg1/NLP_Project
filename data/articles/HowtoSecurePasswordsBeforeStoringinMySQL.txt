In case of a standard, small website, you'll only have to think about "script kiddies" who might use only some online MD5/SHA1 decoder
In case of a website with good amount of visitors, you'll have to consider hackers who might run extra programs.
In case of a website dealing with high amount of money, you'll have to deal with experienced hackers.;

MD5 is a highly used yet unrecommended function due to the fact that it has security problems.
SHA1 is a good function for smaller websites with proper salting. It also has security problems, yet it is still usable.
SHA256 is a good function for medium sites due to the fact that it has no known weaknesses which might decrease its security by a low amount.
For high-traffic websites and websites dealing with money, you should follow some cryptography news and change your method when something concerning your method makes it more breakable. Currently SHA256 is good enough, however, you later might want to switch to SHA3 - which is not selected yet but there are 5 final, experimental candidates for it.

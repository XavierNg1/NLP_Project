 Deadbeat men have no intention of delivering on promises owed to others. This can be financial or emotional. Not paying your rent, spending time with your children, or coming up with excuses as to why they can’t meet an obligation are all signs of a deadbeat man.


For example, if you start dating a man who has children with two other women and is not supporting them financially, chances are the guy could be a financial and emotional deadbeat.;
, One of the first red flags you should pay attention to when trying to avoid deadbeat men is a man who tries to take advantage of you financially. This could be as simple as letting you pay for dinner every time you go out or convincing you to let him move in while you pay all the rent.


If a man you just met asks you for money, this is a violation of your financial and personal boundaries. You can respond by saying, “Alan, I am not comfortable loaning you money. I like to keep my finances and romantic life separate.”

, While there are legitimate reasons for living with family, such as caring for an ill parent, a lack of an independent living situation could signal financial dependence on others. Seriously consider the ramifications of dating someone who depends on others to make his ends meet.

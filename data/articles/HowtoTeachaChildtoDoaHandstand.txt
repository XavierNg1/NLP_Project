 Clear the area of any sharp or hard objects that might cause an injury if the child falls on them. Choose a spot with plenty of room to move around.


Grass, gym mats or a mattress on the ground are good ground surfaces.;
, For example, be near a wall, or use a chair or sofa. For softness, include a gym or yoga mat.
 Have fun with this. Make up games that will keep the child full of energy.
 It might seem crazy but it will get them the hang of being upside down. (If you don't know, a wheelbarrow race involves one person "walking" with their hands on the ground, and a second person walking or running behind the first person while holding that person's legs off the ground.)

, Show them how to roll while falling.
 Have the child practice kicking up into the air and resting against the wall. Then help the child with the landing. Spot the child at all times and help to hold the child in position while he or she gets the feel for the handstand.
 Continue to spot them as they kick (holding up as needed), then help them to land again. Repeat as often as needed but ensure that the child has breaks to avoid getting dizzy or tired.
 Eventually the child will get the hang of it, in their own time.


This takes time.
 It'll take time, so be patient.

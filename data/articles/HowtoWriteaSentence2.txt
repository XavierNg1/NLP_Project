 The simple sentence is the most basic of the sentences. It includes a subject, a verb, and it expresses a complete thought. This is known as an independent clause, because it can stand on its own.Here is an example: "Janet writes."


In the above example, the subject is "Janet". She is the person being discussed.
"Writes" is the verb. It is the action that the subject (Janet) is doing.
Remember, the subject can be a person (I or Janet), place (Baltimore or Bathroom), thing (Chocolate), or idea (Jealousy). , You can add direct objects and indirect objects to simple sentences to add more information.Here is an example: "Janet writes romance novels."


The phrase "romance novels" is the direct object here: they are what Janet writes, so they receive the action of the verb.
Simple sentences can also have compound subjects or compound verbs.

A compound subject could look like this: "Janet and Sujata write romance novels." "Janet and Sujata" is a compound subject here, since there are two people doing the action.
A compound verb could look like this: "Janet writes and publishes romance novels." Janet is doing two things here, writing and publishing, so this is a compound verb.
 When you begin to write your own simple sentence, begin with the subject. Think about what the sentence is going to be about. Next, choose your verb. To do this, think about what the subject of your sentence is doing. Is the subject walking, running, reading, sitting, cooking, or something else?

, When choosing your subject and verb, make sure that the two words agree in number. The rule is that a singular subject needs a singular verb, and plural subjects need plural verbs. A singular subject and verb looks like this: "My son is a doctor".
A plural subject and verb looks like this: "My sons are doctors".

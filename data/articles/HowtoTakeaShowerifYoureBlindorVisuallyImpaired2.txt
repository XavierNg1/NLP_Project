 Whenever possible, purchase shower products that come in non-breakable containers. This will help eliminate the risk of accidents., Many products, including shampoos, body washes, and lotions come in containers that have pump dispensers rather than tops that twist off or pop open. Not only are these convenient, they will also help you avoid spills. Choose products with pump dispensers whenever possible., You can also rely on your sense of touch to help you select the right materials to use in the shower. For instance, you can use one cloth for washing your face, and select a cloth with a contrasting texture to use for washing your body. Likewise, if your shampoo and conditioner bottles are the same size and shape, place a rubber band around one of them so you can tell them apart.

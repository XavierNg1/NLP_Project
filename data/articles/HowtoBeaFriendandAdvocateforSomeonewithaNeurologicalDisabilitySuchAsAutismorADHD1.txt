A developmental disability does not always mean an intellectual disability. While they can co-occur, don't assume that being nonspeaking or flapping one's hands means that someone is less intelligent than you.

If you've met one disabled person, you've met one disabled person. Don't assume that your friend with ADHD will be just like your four-year-old cousin with ADHD.
For example, one might have a tendency to think that anyone who as much as greets them wants to be their friend while another might have a tendency to misread rudeness into subtle negative feelings such as disappointment or annoyance.

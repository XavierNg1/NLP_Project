 Allow as much air as possible to reach your nails. You can achieve dry nails by avoiding tight shoes, hosiery, and tights that create a sweaty environment for your nails and opting instead for open-toed shoes.
 Use a manicure/pedicure kit to groom your nails often. Keeping your nails short prevents bacteria from getting trapped under them.
 Avoid cotton and wool socks if you plan to sweat while wearing them. Synthetic socks are better at not allowing moisture to build up and get trapped inside your socks.
 This not only prevents you from coming into contact with bacteria while performing chores around the house, it also keeps your hands dry. Bacteria likes to live in warm, moist places, so avoid creating this environment around your nails whenever possible.
 This is especially important if you shower in a shared gym. Make sure to wear sandals while showering if multiple people are using the same shower. These perpetually wet, warm places full of sweaty people are bacteria breeding grounds.
 Make sure that the nail salon you visit properly sterilizes their tools and tubs after every client.


If you don't want to ask the owners or you are unsure whether they are being truthful or not, simply bring your own nail kit and ask them to use your tools and polish to complete your manicure or pedicure.
You can also stop painting your nails or getting fake nails altogether. Nail polish traps moisture in your nails and can leave you with small cuts that attract bacteria.

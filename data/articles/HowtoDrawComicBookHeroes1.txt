 Before you get to drawing, have a picture in your head on what you want your hero/ character/ villain/ exc. to look like! Remember, there's no such thing as limits for imagination!
, The BEST materials to draw are:

Mechanical Pencils
Eraser
Colored Pencils
Print Paper (no lined paper)
A good place to draw at, a flat surface will do you good!

, Now if you read those "How to Draw Blah Blah Blah" books, you really don't need to follow the books guide lines. For example, you don't have to do those lines in the beginning and other weird stuff, just get to drawing! Also, if you ever get stuck on something like hands and muscles, look up other characters from other resources (Superman, Batman, Spiderman, exc.) This always helps in case you ever get stuck., and allow whatever your mind comes up with!, After you're done, try some more! You may be asking why, and I will tell you why!And have fun with it!

So that the character sticks around for a while.
So you can compare what you drew (now) to what you drew before.
Just because!

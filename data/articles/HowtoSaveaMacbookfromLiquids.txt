 Once the MacBook is turned off, use paper towels to absorb a maximum amount of liquid. If the keyboard allows it, use paper towels to mop up under the keys.


The problem with liquids is not the deposit that remains after it dries, except for the mechanics; it is the damage caused when the liquid is still present. It creates short circuits which results in components burning, something you usually can't see happening with the naked eye.;
, The inside of your MacBook must be completely dry, that is to say, there should no longer be the slightest trace of moisture. Until you are absolutely sure it is totally dry, it must remain unpowered (both battery and electricity).
 Now, on to the drying stage where two options are available, as explained in the following steps.
 If you choose this method, follow this important advice:


Use the hair dryer on the entire keyboard, not just the area where the liquid entered it.
Don't place the fan too close to the keys, as you could melt them.
Stop occasionally to avoid overheating the MacBook components. Overheating your MacBook would do far more harm than good.
 It's simply using rice. Rice is a highly effective desiccant. In this method, open your MacBook halfway, face down in a box. Line the bottom of the bow with a bed of rice for absorption.
 Turning on your MacBook before then greatly reduces the chances of recovering your valuable object! Good luck!

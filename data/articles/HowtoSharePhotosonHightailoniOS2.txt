 If you’re not yet logged in, enter your email and password for your Hightail account on the welcome screen. Tap the “Log In” button. If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step.
 Tap the folder icon or button on the menu bar to access the folders and files under your Hightail account. Navigate through the folders by tapping on them until you reach the photo you need. Tap on it, and the photo will be opened and displayed on your screen.
 This will bring out the sending screen. A link to your photo will be embedded here.
 At the bottom of the sending screen is a toolbar. You can manage how you share your photo from here.


Setting an expiration date—Tap the Calendar button to set an expiration date for your photo. Tap the toggle button to enable this. Once enabled, you can define the duration until when your recipients can access your photo.
Adding a file password—Tap the Lock tab to protect your photo with a password. Tap on the toggle button to enable this. Once enabled, you can set a password which your recipients need to use before gaining access to your photo.
Setting the Identity Confirmation—Tap the ID badge button to restrict user access to your photo. Tap on the toggle button to enable this. Once enabled, the recipients should be signed into their Hightail accounts before they can access your photo.
 Type in the recipients’ email addresses or Hightail usernames in the To field. Your recipients will be notified that you’re sharing this photo with them.
 Once done, tap the “Send” button at the top right corner of the screen. Your photo will be sent, together with any restrictions you’ve set.

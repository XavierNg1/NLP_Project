The Settings app can be found on your Deviceâ€™s Home Screen. In the Settings Menu, select the General option.



Scroll down until you find the Keyboard menu in your General settings. Tap it to open the Keyboard menu. Select the Keyboards submenu.



In the Keyboards submenu, you will see a list of your installed keyboards. Tap the Edit button in the top-right corner. A red Remove button will appear next to keyboards that can be disabled. Tap the icon next to Emoji.
You can also slide the word "Emoji" to the left to reveal a red Delete button, which does the same action as the Remove icon would.

 If you aren't sure, the best and most reliable way to find out is to ask your teacher. It might also be stated in any textbooks you have been given or any specifications or past papers you have already. Check at the bottom of the page, or at the front of a past paper for a logo. In all likelihood, all of your qualifications will not be from the same exam board, so be prepared to search around a little to find past papers for all of your exams.
 Take a look at some of the documents and check whether it seems like the things you are being taught. You may be taking something like an IGCSE (International GCSE), which will have a different specification to a normal GCSE. Some exam boards, notably OCR, will have different types of a similar qualification, e.g. Mathematics A, Mathematics B and so on.

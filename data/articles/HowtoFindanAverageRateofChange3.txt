 In mathematics, a function is a mathematical relationship between numbers, so that you enter one number and another number is the result. Functions can generally be graphed. They may represents straight lines, parabolas, or random-looking curves that have no easy definition.Some sample functions are:


y(x)=3x+4{\displaystyle y(x)=3x+4} (the function of a straight line)


y(x)=sin(x){\displaystyle y(x)=sin(x)} (a function for a waved line)


y(x)=x2{\displaystyle y(x)=x^{2}} (a function for a parabola)




, Finding the average rate of change of a function means measuring the value of the function at two different points along the x-axis. Select one value of x where you wish to begin measuring, and then determine how far along the axis you wish to advance.

Depending on your purposes, you may choose a wider or narrower range of x values to measure. For this exercise, select the first x-value at 0 and the second x-value at 3.
 Rate of change of the function measures how much the y-values change over the chosen horizontal x-distance. To calculate this change, you need to know the y values at each chosen value of x.For the sample function, y(x)=x2{\displaystyle y(x)=x^{2}}, select the two values x=0 and x=3, for example. The corresponding values of y(x){\displaystyle y(x)}, therefore, are:


y(0)=02=0{\displaystyle y(0)=0^{2}=0}


y(3)=32=9{\displaystyle y(3)=3^{2}=9}




, The rate of change of a function can be written formally as:A(x)=ΔyΔx=f(x+h)−f(x)h{\displaystyle A(x)={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}={\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}}

In this formula, f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} represents the value of the function at the first chosen x-value. f(x+h){\displaystyle f(x+h)} is the value of the function some distance away at a second value of x. The denominator h{\displaystyle h} is the distance between the two measurements.


h{\displaystyle h} can also be represented as Δx{\displaystyle \Delta x}, since it is the distance or change in the chosen x-values.

For the chosen function y(x)=x2{\displaystyle y(x)=x^{2}}, you can calculate the average rate of change from 0 to 3 as follows:


A(x)=ΔyΔx=9−03−0=3{\displaystyle A(x)={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}={\frac {9-0}{3-0}}=3}.
 For this function, the rate of change is a measure of how much the value of the function changes vertically as you move horizontally along the x-axis. In this case, the parabola y(x)=x2{\displaystyle y(x)=x^{2}} begins at point (0,0) and climbs to point (3,9) over the measured interval. Although the function itself is not a straight line, the average rate of change is measured as the slope of the straight line connecting those two points. This line climbs 3 units for each single unit increase in x.Note that the average rate of change for a function may differ depending on the location that you choose to measure. For the parabola example, the average rate of change is 3 from x=0 to x=3. However, for the same function measured from x=3 to x=6, also a distance of 3 units, the average rate of change becomes 8.33.

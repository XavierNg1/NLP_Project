 Police officers are afforded a lot of power in order to enforce the laws of a particular state. With that power comes the ability to wear a uniform, carry a firearm, and arrest people should the situation arise. Criminals, who could utilize this perceived power to inflict harm, are always looking for a way to commit crimes without getting caught. Police impersonators often do what they do in order to commit violent crimes, including murder, rape, and burglary.;
, Impersonating a police officer is actually a lot easier than it may seem. With the advent of the internet, anything that can be sold will be.A lot of authentic looking police gear can be found on auction sites, which often allow the sale of police identifiers so long as there is a profit.One study found that a simple online search produced police badges for sale from almost every state, city, and county in the United States.Impersonators often buy uniforms, badges, utility belts, and vehicle accessories (e.g., lights and decals).
People can even impersonate officers by simply introducing themselves as someone with police authority.
 Police impersonators are often looking for anyone who seems exposed and easily fooled. This means that younger people, as well as the elderly, are most at risk to be victimized by police impersonators. With that said, criminals often commit crimes of opportunity, meaning they may impersonate a police officer in order to commit another crime against anyone that presents an easy target in the moment.
 Impersonating a police officer is a crime in and of itself. Most laws prohibit a person from identifying themselves as an officer, producing a badge of authority, wearing a uniform with the intent to impersonate an officer, and creating a vehicle that looks like a police vehicle.


However, dressing up in a police costume for fun, for example during Halloween, is not prohibited by law.

 Go to the store and buy a loaf of bread (white, whole wheat, gluten free etc), peanut butter (low fat, smooth, use almond butter if allergic to peanuts) and jelly (grape, strawberry etc).;
, Using any kind of butter (lactose free, dairy free, low fat etc) will work any kind of skittles will work as well.
 Go home and start building this delicious sandwich. Set the peanut butter, jelly, butter, and skittles in your work area so you won't waste time looking for them later.
 With a butter knife or spoon, butter one side of each piece of bread. Heat up the butter in the microwave or allow it to thaw if it's still frozen.
 Put a thick layer of peanut butter and jelly on the other side of the bread slices. Add as much as your heart desires. If you like peanut butter more or jelly more the spread more of it onto the bread.
 Open up the bag of skittles with a pair of scissors to prevent spilling. Very carefully add ten skittles in the form of a smiley face on the bread.
 Grease the pan with oil or butter to prevent burning. Turn the stove on high heat and wait until it's done heating (splash water on the pan if it sizzles it's ready).
 Once the pan is done heating, place the sandwich carefully on the pan. Fry the sandwich until golden brown on each side.
 The pan will obviously be hot when it comes off the stove. Dump some cold water on the pan before washing so you don't burn your hands and don't touch the pan or stove.
 Wait to cool and dig! This is a perfect midnight snack or lunch for school.

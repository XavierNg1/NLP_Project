 Some local tourism sites include information about reef-friendly businesses.The Coral Reef Alliance lists its partners (though it does not list reef-friendly businesses, per se). Do your research, and search reviews of any snorkeling company you are thinking of using to see if they give divers information about buoyancy and reef protection., Going local when buying snorkeling products and services helps limit consumption as well as your carbon footprint when snorkeling. Pollution as a result of excess consumption and the transport of goods is directly harmful for coral reefs. So, going local means that you’ll be protecting the reefs in additional ways while snorkeling. They also have the added advantage of being invested in the area, the community, and perhaps even the coral reef itself., By taking pictures you help to document the health and biodiversity in the coral reefs. By sharing the photos, you help raise awareness for coral reefs. You can help people understand the reef’s beauty as well as the danger it faces with pollution, consumption, and climate change.

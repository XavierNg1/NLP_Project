 During the final weeks of pregnancy, many women take time off from work and have more time on their hands. This is a wonderful time to make memorabilia so that you and your child can look back at this important time in both of your lives.
 If you havenâ€™t already started a pregnancy journal or scrapbook, this is a great time to put one together. You can purchase one at a store or make one on your own from a blank book. Be as creative as you want to be.


Just because it is a journal does not mean that it only has to contain writing. Paste in ultrasound pictures, cards and other things that you have collected during your pregnancy.
In the same manner, a scrapbook can also contain journal entries whether they are written directly in the scrapbook or written on a piece of paper and glued in.
 Another thing that you can do is write a letter to your unborn child. This letter can be saved and given to your child, or read to your child, when he or she is older. A letter is wonderful expression of love and the joy you are feeling about having your baby.

 When you weigh the puppy, do it gently. Puppies are delicate, so you should always use care. A good way to do this is to place newborn puppies in a bucket wrapped in a blanket or something soft. You can also wrap the puppy in a blanket before putting them on the scale.Make sure if you weigh the puppy in a bucket or with a blanket, you subtract the weight of the extra material.
Try using the same material each time you weigh the puppy to help with accurate readings.
 Create a chart to weigh each puppy’s weight progression. The chart should record the date and the weight of the puppy. Each day, you should see an increase in the puppy’s weight.The litter should progress at relatively the same pace. Their weights should be very similar each day.
 After the puppies are born, you should weigh them at regular intervals. Once a day is often enough to get a good idea of how they are progressing. Make sure to weigh them at the same time every day.You should weigh the puppies once a day for the first two weeks. After that, weigh them once a week.
 After the first 24 hours, the puppies should increase in weight. By the time the puppy is around a week old, the weight should be doubled from their birth weight. Puppies should gain 5 to 10% of their weight each day.Most puppies lose weight during the first day, and then start gaining it each day.
Each breed is different with the way they will gain weight. Check each puppy’s weight against the other puppies in the litter and their daily weights.
 When you weigh the puppies, you may gently put them directly on the scale. If you don’t use anything between the puppy and the scale, you should clean the scale with a disinfectant after you remove them. This helps reduce the risk of transmitting any germs or bacteria from puppy to puppy.

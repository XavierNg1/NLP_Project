 The NYC recipe is not for a single-drink, but makes a pitcher designed to serve many people.Use a 750ml (25.35 ounces) bottle of rum if you canâ€™t find the one-liter bottle.
You can substitute half the rum for gold or dark rum, and you can also add Southern Comfort for a different variation.
Instead of all or some of the pineapple juice, consider substituting peach, mango, or cranberry juice.
 In a large pitcher, pour in the entire bottle of rum. Add equal parts amaretto, triple sec, and lime juice. Finally, stir in half a bottle of grenadine, and the pineapple juice.


For the amaretto, triple sec, and lime juice, start with a single ounce (30 ml) of each and adjust to taste if you feel the punch needs more.
 Nutcrackers are served cold, as they are meant to be refreshing summer drinks. Consider serving over crushed ice, or chilling the beverage in the freezer for 15 minutes before serving.

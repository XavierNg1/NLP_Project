 A Tarot reading is a narrative, a story that you tell to the Seeker. It's an attempt to highlight past influences, understand present circumstances and predict the most likely future. The future you speak of will not be a fixed or definitive outcome; it's important to remember that there are no conclusive endings or absolutes.
 A "spread" simply refers to the layout of your cards. A Tarot spread is a configuration or pattern of cards. That pattern provides the framework for a tarot reading. Further, each position of the tarot cards in a spread has a specific meaning. Your reading will use the placement or position of the cards within an identified theme. For example, many spreads include positions for the past, present and future. They can also include positions for internal feelings, specific challenges, external factors and so on.There are hundreds of spreads to try, and more experienced readers can make up their own. Experiment with different spreads, trying especially to choose ones that encourage your imagination and intuition. Figuring out what works best for you is important; many readers come to rely on specific spreads that work best for them.
 A three-card spread is great for divining answers to uncomplicated questions, for refocusing on simplicity an for beginners who have just started reading. Assign the positions in advance, lay out your spread and use what you've learned about card meanings and combinations to tell a story.

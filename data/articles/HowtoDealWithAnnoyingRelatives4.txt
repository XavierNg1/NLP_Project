 One and a half hours for lunch is sufficient.If asked for a visit on the weekend, set aside three hours maximum, and try to plan an actual activity, so that you have something to do together., Getting worked up ahead of time can ruin any chance you have of successfully making it through the visit without becoming upset or agitated, and it can ruin your chances at making good choices because of stress.A little stress can help you be more aware, but too much will wreck you. Being able to calm yourself will help you respond appropriately, and you might even surprise yourself., Being a good guest means respecting your hosts’ hours and habits, and following the rules of the house, and even to a degree offsetting the cost of your visit in thoughtful ways.Discuss your plans and free time, so that you know ahead of time what you will need to schedule, rent, and so on.Don’t take over public spaces, spread out everywhere, or take over the bathroom or kitchen.
Don’t talk on the phone loudly or listen to music in public spaces. Go outside or into a bedroom, or use your headphones.
Do clean up after yourself in the bathroom and in the kitchen. If you can, offer to clean up after others too, including putting away dishes, taking out the trash, etc.Do offer to run errands, pick up groceries, or take-out, to keep things running smoothly and to replace what you consume.Leave them with a nice hosting gift, and definitely hand write a thank you note after your departure.

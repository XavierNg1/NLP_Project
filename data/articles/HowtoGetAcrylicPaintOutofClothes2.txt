 The stained area should be completely saturated, so be generous with the amount. You can buy isopropyl alcohol online or at your local pharmacy for a relatively low price. CVS will sell you a bottle for $ 2.50.
 Use your fingernail, a wooden stick, a coin, or another item to scrape away at the paint and try to lift it off the fabric. When scraping, go with, then against the grain of the fabric, back and forth. Lift off as much as you can before proceeding to the next step. 







, Set the cycle you'd usually use for this type of clothing and wash with the usual detergent. Hopefully the washing machine can get rid of the excess paint that you weren’t able to remove with the scrubbing and the alcohol.
 Hopefully the stain will have been lifted out by both the alcohol and the wash. If you aren’t satisfied you can repeat the process over again, but it might be too late.

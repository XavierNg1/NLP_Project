 Handcrafted websites offer a variety of gifts that are unique. You can find something tailored to what your girl loves or even have a gift customized to her. Check out websites such as Etsy, Custom Made, and Shana Logic., Like websites with arts and crafts, you can find one-of-a-kind gifts at local art shows and craft fairs. While sometimes the prices can be high, you're paying for a truly special gift and supporting your local economy at the same time.
 For instance, if your girlfriend loves drawing, art supplies are definitely an appropriate choice. However, so is a book about art, or a painting by her favorite artist (if you can afford it). Have the gift line up with things she loves.
 For instance, if she loves books, giving her a book is an obvious choice. However, you can go one step further. Instead of just getting her any book, try to get a copy of her favorite book signed by the author. That will make it truly unique and special.

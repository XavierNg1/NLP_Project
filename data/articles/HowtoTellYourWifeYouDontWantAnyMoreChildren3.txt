 After your talk, your wife may change her mind about wanting kids. She might also be very disappointed. Either way, give her some space to process this information and don’t try to make her think the way you do about the issue. Don’t bring up the issue again until she says she’s ready to talk.Continue to check in on her emotionally. Ask her how she’s feeling and do random acts of kindness for her like surprising her with flowers or cooking her favorite meal.
 Though your body is your own, you should still make any permanent decisions with your spouse’s knowledge. Discuss your desire to get a vasectomy or hysterectomy with your wife before you make an appointment to do so. This will help foster trust and openness in your relationship., Perhaps you have children from outside of your marriage and your wife has none of her own. In cases like this, the issue of children might be a dealbreaker. Talk to your wife to determine what you can do to keep your marriage together or whether it’s better to move forward separately.

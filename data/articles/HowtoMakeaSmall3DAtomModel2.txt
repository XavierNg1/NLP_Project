 You will need 16 medium-sized polystyrene balls, a paint brush, three different paint colors, 8 small polystyrene balls, strong craft glue, an eye hook, wire, duct tape, and a fishing line., Use the paint brush to brush the paint over only 8 of the medium sized balls. It's recommended to use the color blue as these balls will resemble the protons. Allow the balls to dry until they are no longer wet., Repeat the same process with the other 8 balls. Paint the balls another color, preferably red since this is resembling the neutrons, and set them aside to allow it to dry., Using the paint brush, paint the 8 small balls another color, preferably green to resemble the electrons. Set the balls aside to dry until they are no longer wet., Using the strong craft glue, glue both different colored medium-sized balls together to resemble a nucleus, alternating between the protons and neutrons as you glue.,,, Gently form the wire into hoops to resemble the atom. Secure the wire and atom together using the duct tape.,, You can now show off and display your 3D model of the atom oxygen.

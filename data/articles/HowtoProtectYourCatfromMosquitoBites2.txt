 While mosquitos are active throughout the day, there are certain times that are a lot worse than others. Mosquitos are especially bad at:

Dawn
Dusk
Nighttime, Just as certain parts of the day are worse than others, so are certain parts of the year. As a result, you should consider limiting your cat’s outdoor time during certain parts of the year.Don’t let your cat out during the rainy season. If it rains daily or several times a week, you’ll likely have a much larger population of mosquitos around your home.
Keep your cat in when daily highs begin to move above 55 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius).
 If you are really concerned about the risk of mosquito bites, you might consider turning your cat into an indoor cat. By keeping your cat indoors, you’ll dramatically decrease the risk of mosquito bites and mosquito-borne illnesses.If your cat is used to playing outside, you may need to provide plenty of new toys so it will have something to do inside.
If your cat has been an outdoor cat for many years, it might be very hard to successfully transition it to a life inside. You will need to judge for yourself how your cat reacts to their new life.

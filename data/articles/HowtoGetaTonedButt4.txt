 The upward facing dog pose will strengthen your glutes and will also open up your chest. Keep your wrist joint in a straight line with your shoulder to avoid over-arching your back. Also, be sure to push down through your hands and lift the top of your head to avoid compressing your neck vertebrae.
 This exercise will strengthen both your glutes and legs while stretching your shoulders and chest. If you have flat feet, this exercise can also strengthen your arches. Make sure to tuck your tailbone in as you lower your body. This will keep your back long and straight.
 The crescent moon pose tones your glutes as well as strengthening your chest and arms. Place a pillow or rolled towel beneath the knee that is touching the ground if you find that your knee is uncomfortable. If you have an injured back, then donâ€™t lean back as far when you extend your arms.

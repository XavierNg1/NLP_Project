 These are: a shoebox lid, sand or soil, water, a small container to hold the water (a small tea light candle holder is a good choice), pebbles or small rocks, a bridge, fake or real moss, a comb or mini rake, and any additional items you'd like to add, just remembering that simplicity is important for a Zen garden.;
, If you're going to keep this Zen garden for a while, lay out clear wrap under the sand.
, A traditional Zen garden would have the rocks placed in the corners.
,, If you would like, put the bridge over the water.
 Use it to ponder life's mysteries and to keep yourself calm.

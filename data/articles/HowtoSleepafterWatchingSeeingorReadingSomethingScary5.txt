 Talking to someone else about their day can distract you from your fears. If it's not too late, chat with or call a friend and say "I saw a really scary movie today, and I'm still feeling scared. Can we talk for a while? What did you do today?" Focusing on your friend can help distract, calm, and ground you. Ask your friend to talk about their lives, but to avoid scary subjects.
 Talking about your fears can help alleviate them because sometimes just discussing your fears out loud can help you discover how unnecessary they are.


Talk to a parent. You mother or father might be able to provide the comfort you need.
Talk to a friend. Friends make up an important part of our support systems, so they may provide just the outlet you need to overcome your fears.
Talk to your significant other. Few will be able to understand you and your fears as well as your significant other — husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. Talking to your significant other might also help you overcome your fears.
 You might feel more secure sleeping with someone else — a significant other, parent, friend, sibling, etc.


If you usually sleep with someone else, such as a significant other, ask them to hug you as you sleep for a comforting sense of security.
If you feel comfortable sleeping with a friend, this might also be helpful.
Depending on your age, you may feel comfortable sleeping in a bed with one or both parents or a sibling to help feel secure and overcome your fear.
 If you find you are getting scared easily and cannot overcome your fear even to sleep, you might consider speaking with a psychiatrist.


Speaking with a psychiatrist does have a certain stigma, but don't be too proud — especially if you are losing sleep.
A psychiatrist might be able to offer you medication that will calm you or help you sleep, though these medications should be neither expected nor abused.

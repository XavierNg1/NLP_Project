 Rub a little layer of melted butter around the sides and across the base. This helps stop the cake from sticking to the base and sides.;
, Make a layer of crushed biscuits inside the bowl.


To crush the biscuits, place them inside a resealable bag and roll a rolling pin over the top. Simply tip the crumbs out of the bag and into the bowl.
 You can use one kind of fruit, or a variety of mixed fruits. Use the chopped fruits to make another layer on the top of the biscuit layer.
 Add a little bit of melted butter and strawberry or red colour.
,, Firm down with the back of a large spoon.
 Refrigerate it for 20 minutes.
 Once chilled, your cake is ready to eat. Cut into slices and enjoy.

 When the fertility drug Clomiphene doesn't work, doctors often turn to gonadotropin treatment.In women, LH is needed for ovulation, and gonadotropin acts in a similar way to LH, encouraging your body to produce the other hormones needed for ovulation.In men, LH is needed to produce testosterone. Gonadotropin can act in its place, increasing testosterone and a man's sperm count, which also increases a couple's chances of conceiving., Typically, if you're a woman, you take this this treatment every day for about two weeks, and you or your partner will inject it under your skin. Once your body has responded, you stop the treatment and a doctor will monitor your follicles until they are ready for an egg to be released., When your follicles are ready, your doctor will give you an injection of hCG to tell your body it's time to release the eggs into your uterus. At that time, you can try to conceive for the next day or so., Men usually start with hCG. Generally, you'll have a couple of injections a week. You'll try it for about half a year. If it hasn't helped, your doctor may add hMG to your regimen., The primary side effects of gonadotropin are swelling, irritability, restlessness, headaches, tiredness, and depression.Men may also have an increase in acne, an increase in breast size, and changes in sex drive.

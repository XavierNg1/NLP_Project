 Surface piercings are piercings that are only visible on the surface of your skin. The part of the piercing visible is usually a stud or crystal.


Surface piercings can be on your cheek, nose, above the eyebrow, and above or below your top or bottom lips, respectively.
Try putting a fake surface piercing in only one place first to see how you feel, then add more if you want a bolder look.
 A white base will guarantee that your liquid liner pops out in the light, you want your piercing to be noticeable. Use a cream formula, this will hold more to the skin and last longer. Use a white eyeliner pencil.
Use a thin makeup brush and dip it into your leftover white Halloween makeup.
 A liquid liner will be more effective in faking a facial piercing because it is more vibrant than gel or charcoal liners. Choose any color you want for the eyeliner, be creative with it! Metallic colors such as silver or gold will definitely look the most realistic when compared to actual piercings.
 Do not use the applicator that comes with the liquid liner because it may go on too thick to start, which might not be what you want. Use a thin makeup brush or a thin paintbrush to apply your liner.


Dip your thin brush into the bottle of liquid eyeliner and apply as much or as little as you want, depending on how thick or wide you want your fake piercing to look.
With your thin brush, draw a circle “stud” where you want your piercing. You can decide to draw something other than a circle, i.e. diamond or triangle.
For a nose surface piercing, draw your “piercing” on one of your nostrils.

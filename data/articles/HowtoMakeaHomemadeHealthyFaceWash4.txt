 Place 1 cup (200 g) of coconut oil in a medium saucepan, and place it on the stove. Turn the heat to low, and stir the oil until it melts, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.If you don’t have coconut oil, you can substitute a combination of honey and olive oil. Mix 3 parts honey with 1 part olive oil. There’s no need to heat the mixture, though, because honey and olive oil are both liquid at room temperature.
 When the coconut oil is melted, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool for approximately 5 minutes. Next, mix in 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda, 5 drops of lavender essential oil, and 10 drops of tea tree oil until all of the ingredients are combined. Pour the face wash into a glass jar for storage.Be sure that the jar or dispenser that you use for the face wash is airtight.
It’s best to store the face wash in a cool, dark place.
 When you’re ready to use the face wash, take a small amount and apply it your face. Gently massage it into your skin in circular motions to cleanse thoroughly.Because coconut oil solidifies at room temperature, the face wash may thicken up. Use a spoon to scoop some out and rub it between your fingers to melt it again before massaging it into your skin.
 After you’ve massaged the cleanser into your skin, use lukewarm water to rinse it from your face. When your face is clean, apply your acne treatment products as you normally would.If you’re having trouble removing the cleanser, use a damp washcloth to take it off.

 Once you have found the freecycle organization you want to work with, you’ll need to join a local group.
 On the main webpage for the organization, you will need to enter in your city and state. It will direct you to a page listing all the areas within your city. Select your city preference.


For example, if you live in Houston, Texas, type that in the search bar and it will direct you to your city and all the surrounding cities near Houston.
 Once you have entered your location, and clicked on your preferred area, you will see a listing of all the different items being offered and/or requested. However, before you get to plunge in and go treasure hunting, you’ll need to create an account.


You’ll sign up with an email address and a username. Be cautious about signing up with your own personal email address, as you will get flooded with an enormous amount of notifications about free stuff. It may be beneficial to create an email address just for the purpose of doing freecycle., After you've joined a group, you'll get an e-mail with information explaining how they work. You have the option of receiving notifications as new items are posted, or opting out of notifications and just checking the website periodically.If you’re interested in getting a lot of free stuff, you may want to sign up for email alerts. New stuff goes fast and if you wait later to check the site, you may be too late., After you’ve successfully found your local group and registered with the website, start browsing for stuff being given away.


As good as it feels to always receive; try posting your own unwanted items as well. You never know if your trash is another person’s treasure.

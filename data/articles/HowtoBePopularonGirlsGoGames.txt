 Don't worry, I'll hold your hand the whole way through!;
, For most websites, including this one, the best way to get your name out there is to post lots of comments. You should try to stick to the topic of the game, don't say something like "I got my hair cut yesterday!" while you're playing 'Kitty Cattastic'. Also, try not to post TOO much. You do have real-world issues to address too, right?

, Making friends is fairly easy on girlsgogames, as long as you're nice to others! Once you do, send them a message every so often, or get to know their friends!

, If you've been around for awhile, or if you have major skills in one game, then help others who are lost or confused. Don't just leave them hanging! The consideration is good for you, and you might make a new friend in return!

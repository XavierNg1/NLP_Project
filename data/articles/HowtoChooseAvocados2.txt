 Hold the avocado in the palm of your hand. Gently squeeze the avocado, being careful not to press with your fingertips, as this can cause bruising. A ripe avocado will be soft and will yield to the gentle pressure, but will not be overly squishy.If it is still hard, then it is still under ripe and will take a few days to ripen.
Avoid avocados which are overly soft and mushy, since this would mean that the fruit is too ripe.
Make sure to test out the entire fruit, and don’t judge ripeness by feeling the top of the avocado closest to the stem. This is the first part of the fruit to ripen, so it might be slightly softer while the rest of it is too firm.
Keep in mind you may still opt to purchase firmer avocados if you’re purchasing them a few days before their intended use.
 If the stem is still attached, give it a pull. If there’s any resistance, the fruit is not yet ripe. If comes off easily, and the area where it was is bright green, it’s perfectly ripe. If it’s yellow-green, it could use a day or so before being eaten. If the area where the stem was is brown or dark green, the avocado is overripe.Checking under the stem is one of the quickest and most reliable tricks for determining ripeness, and it removes the risk of damaging fruit by poking and prodding with fingertips.
 Hass avocados, which are the type you’re most likely to encounter at the grocery store, are green when unripe and dark green to near black when ripe. However, make sure you double check any signage posted at the market for the type of fruit and where it was grown. Most Florida avocados, unlike Hass, have lighter-green skin with yellowish tone, even when they are ripe.Avocados that are shiny are not yet ripe enough, but again, you can still purchase these and ripen them at home.
Choose avocados with unblemished skin. Avoid fruit with dark blemishes, brown spots, dents, and bruises.

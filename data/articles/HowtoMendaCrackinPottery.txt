Crack:

Crack in object: Use a toothpick or fine brush to force the glue into a crack in the pottery item. Ensure that the crack has absorbed as much glue as possible.

In this instance, brush the glue lightly along both broken edges and press the broken pieces together gently. Hold in this position for 30 seconds to a minute before releasing.Chip: Fill the chipped area on the pottery piece with glue. Slide the chipped piece into place and when you are satisfied that it is sitting neatly, hold the piece in place for about 30 seconds before letting go.

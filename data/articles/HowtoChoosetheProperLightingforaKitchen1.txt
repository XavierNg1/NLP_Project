 Task lighting are direct beams of light that illuminate a designated work area. These could include prep stations for making coffee or using the cutting board, sinks, desks or tables.;
,, Some people use halogen bulbs, as they produce a light glow, but they aren't too harsh. Others use fluorescent bulbs in all fixtures because they are energy efficient.


A popular choice for task lighting is under cabinet lights. These can be installed when you get new cabinets, or they can be screwed into place later. If you like this idea and you are getting new cabinetry, make sure it leaves enough room at the bottom to shed light on your work area.






Another choice is pendant lights that hang from the ceiling. Many beautiful modern fixtures hang from a single chord to shed light on an area. You can adjust this lighting to the right height over the sink or stove.






A third option is to recess lights into the ceiling, directly above work stations. They give broad, even lighting to your work. This is best done with a home or kitchen remodel because the electrician must wire them extensively into the walls.

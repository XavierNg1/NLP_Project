 This device is similar to an apple peeler. You insert the vegetable and turn a crank to force it through the blade in a spiral motion.


Spiral shredders come in a few different types. In some cases, you place the vegetable inside a small container. While others ask you to insert the vegetable into a horizontal platform.
Read the directions carefully before using the slicer.
 This machine works best with long, straight vegetables. Each squash should be at least one inch in diameter.


Donâ€™t cut the zucchini in half vertically. The slicer will leave a small core that includes the mature seeds.
 Place the lid or crank on the machine.
 You will feel when the crank stops giving you resistance. A small vegetable core will remain.,

 Spider mites will weaken your plant, and the leaves will often form small yellow or brown dots. You may also notice leaves drying up and falling off your plant., Spider mites will leave webs under the leaves and stems on the plant. Look at your plants daily to see if there is webbing on any of your plants., Since spider mites are less than 1 mm in size, they can be hard to see with the naked eye. Purchase a magnifying glass from a department store or online and examine the leaves on your plants. If you see small specks moving on the leaves, there's a good chance you have spider mites., If you don't have a magnifying glass, you can use a white sheet of paper to see the mites. Hold a piece of paper under the leaves of your plant and then shake them. If you see green, brown, or black specks start to move over the surface of the paper, you have spider mites.You can also crush the bugs with your finger. If they streak green, they are plant-feeding mites. If they are orange or yellow, they are probably beneficial predators.

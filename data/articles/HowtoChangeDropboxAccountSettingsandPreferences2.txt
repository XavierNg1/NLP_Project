 If you do not already have it, go to https://www.dropbox.com/ and click “Download the app” in the upper right corner of the page.
 This appears in the Windows system tray in the lower right or the MacOS menu bar in the top right. A context menu with options will appear.
 A window with app and account options will appear.
 This is placed along the top, to the right of the “General”.
 A window will appear to browse and select a new location on your computer for the dropbox folder.
 A window will appear showing the the various subfolders inside of your dropbox folder. Deselecting a checkbox will stop that subfolder and any of the files it contains from uploading to dropbox.
 This will unlink this Dropbox account from the device you are using.


This feature is useful for accessing your dropbox on someone else’s computer or a similar situation.

 While a basic knit has plenty of texture to begin with, you can make your sweater pillow look even more interesting by picking out a sweater with a cable or rib pattern., Center the pillow form as best you can. If your sweater has a ribbed hem, place the pillow form just above it. If your sweater does not have a ribbed hem, place the pillow form about 1½ to 2 inches (3.81 to 5.08 centimeters) from the bottom edge.

The size of the pillow form depends on the size of the sweater. Use a pillow form that is a few inches/centimeters-smaller than your sweater.
 Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to draw around the pillow. Cut around the lines that you drew, leaving a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Do not cut off the bottom hem.Make sure that the sweater panels are big enough to wrap around the pillow form. This is especially important for tightly-knit sweaters and bulky pillows.
 Take the pillow off the sweater and set it aside. Pin the sweater together, if needed, then sew along the top and side edges using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave the bottom hem open for now.You can do this by hand, or you can use a sewing machine.
If your sweater is fraying too much, serge the edges, or finish them off with a zigzag stitch.
 If the sweater is very bulky, you may have to clip the seams on the corners first. This will help reduce the bulk., There are two ways you can do this. You can simply tuck the bottom hem into the pillow case, and sew it shut by hand with a ladder stitch. You can also fold the hem over, and sew it shut with buttons. Here is how to do it:Pin the hem shut, as close to the pillow as you can.
Turn the pillow over, and sew wooden buttons to the back of the hem.
Turn the pillow over again, and fold the hem over onto the front of the pillow so that you can see the buttons.
Sew or glue the hem down to keep it in place.

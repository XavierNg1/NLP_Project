 Singapura cats are known for their smooth, short coats and sepia coloring. If your cat looks as though they could blend right in to an old-timey photo, they could be a Singapura. Look for a tan to light brown color that’s “ticked” or flecked with small bits of white., Singapura cats have big, expressive eyes that are large relative to their body size. Typical eye colors for Singapuras include yellow, green, hazel and brown., Singapuras have exceptionally large ears for their head size. They might call to mind the large-eared cats pictured in hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt. Inside, these ears are usually pale in tone, but the coloring on the exterior may darken as it moves towards the tips.
 Singapuras often look like they’re wearing eyeliner. The breed has dark brown lines running from both eyes down along each side of the nose, much like a cheetah.Use petting as an opportunity to really look at your cat’s face. Pet them gently, examining facial markings.
 Singapura cats are petite in size, ranging from 4-8lb or 2-3.5kg. If you want to weigh your cat at home, a good method is to weigh just yourself, then weigh yourself holding your cat. The difference will be the cat’s weight.Singapuras are so petite that often vets examining a Singapura kitten will think something is wrong with the kitten’s growth. This is just the way the breed is.

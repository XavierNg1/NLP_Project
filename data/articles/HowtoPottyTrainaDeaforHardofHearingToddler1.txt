 The first step in potty training your hard of hearing child or any child is to assess if they are ready to begin the process. If your child has begun to notice when they are wet or indicates to you that they need to potty, then they could be ready. Try to potty train them by age two or three, but do not feel discouraged if they do not catch on immediately., Once your child has indicated that they are ready to begin potty training, commit to it despite any setbacks. Your child is bound to have some accidents, but don’t let up. Though your child is hard of hearing, they are still able to learn skills just like any other child.Determine what times your child is most regular and put them on the potty during those times. Don’t keep them there for more than 5-10 minutes.
 Though your child is not likely to be successful in the beginning, you should still praise them for any attempts they make. If they understand any sign language at this point, sign to them “good job.” If they have some hearing abilities, then you can verbalize your praise to them., When your child does successfully use the potty, reward them so that they will have an incentive to continue the behavior. Give them a treat, a hug, or let them watch their favorite show for a bit., Understand that during these initial phases, your child will likely have several accidents. Though you may feel frustrated when these occur, do not lash out in anger or punish them. Communicate to them what they did wrong, clean up the mess, and move on.Tell or sign to them “Alexandra, you are not supposed to potty in your bed. Now we have to go to the bathroom to clean you up. Only potty in the toilet.”

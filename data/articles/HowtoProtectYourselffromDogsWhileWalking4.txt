 Some dogs aren’t ready to meet new people, so don’t assume that a dog that is out for its walk wants to be petted.The owner can also offer advice on how to best engage the dog if it is friendly.


Don’t run or move quickly toward a dog.
Never approach or pet a dog that is nursing her puppies.
 A flat hand will keep you safe and show the dog that you aren’t a threat.Extend your hand but don’t touch the dog until it’s ready.
 If the dog is open to you petting it, then it will come to you. Keep your hand extended so that the dog can smell you and decide if it wants you to pet it.If you are afraid, don’t reach out to the dog. Dogs can sense your emotions and might get scared.
 A friendly dog will perk his ears and lower his head. A dog that tilts his ears back, growls, or cowers does not want to be petted, so slowly back away. If the dog shows that it’s okay with you, gently pet it.


Pet the dog only on his head or upper back. Lightly pet the dog in his safe spots, avoiding his belly, tails, ears, and feet., If you know that there are a lot of dogs where you like to walk, consider carrying treats, such as a milk bone. Giving the dog a small treat can make you instant friends.Ask the dog’s owner before giving it a treat. The dog may be on a special diet or may have already had treats.

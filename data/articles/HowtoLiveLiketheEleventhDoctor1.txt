 The Doctor was always careful of what he said.;
, The Doctor is always solving mystery cases. In fact, he's almost like a detective. But whether it is you getting angry at someone or losing your car keys, observe all of the aspects to determine how to solve the problem. If you don't know what you're trying to solve, then how can you solve it? Examining  your circumstances shows care and wisdom.
 You have a brain for a reason. Use it! Let's say you lose your car keys. Retrace your steps. At least try to remember when you last had them and where you could have left them.  Using your assets you show intelligence and wisdom. The Doctor was constantly figuring things out using his brain.

 Use a nail clipper to trim the tips of your acrylic nails short. Cut off as much of the acrylic as possible. If cutting is difficult due to the thickness of the nails, use a course nail file to file them.
 Use the course side of a buffing tool to file down each acrylic nail. Work on one nail at a time, filing away the acrylic until it has become a thin layer overlaying your natural nail. Continue until you've filed away as much of the acrylic from each nail as possible.


You may have been able to file away enough of the acrylic that your nails look almost acrylic-free. If you're worried about nail damage, now is the time to stop. Removing the rest of the nail will necessarily involve taking off a few layers of your natural nail, which can cause long-term damage.
If you'd rather remove all traces of the acrylic, continue to the next step.
 Once you've lifted the edge, place the tip of a cuticle scissors under it and use the scissors to start clipping away the acrylic. Continue lifting the edge and clipping the acrylic until all of the acrylic has been removed.


Repeat this process for every nail until the acrylic is completely gone.
Resist prying more than a little of the acrylic at a time from your natural nail. If you pry off too much at once, it will rip off layers of your natural nail.
 Use a nail buffer to remove the last traces of acrylic. Shape your natural nails with a nail clipper and file. Apply cuticle cream and moisturizer.

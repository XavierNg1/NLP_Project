 Besides decorating your home, bookshelves are mostly used to improve enchanting tables. Get started by building the table with the following crafting recipe:


In the lowest row: three obsidian blocks.
In the middle row: diamond, obsidian block, diamond
In the top row: (nothing), book, (nothing)

, Each bookshelf near the enchantment table unlocks more powerful enchantments. You must place them as follows for them to count as "nearby:"Exactly two squares away from the table.
Either on the same level as the table, or one higher.
The space between the table and the shelf must be empty. Even a carpet, torch, or snowfall will block the effect.
 The highest-level enchantments become available once fifteen bookshelves are set up as described. There are a couple easy ways to do this:


Surround the table with a large square of bookshelves, leaving a gap in between. Leave one gap in the square to walk through.

Or make a 4x5 L shape out of eight bookshelves. Place a second stack of eight bookshelves over the L. (This is one more than you need, so you can skip one from the second level.)

, Some enchantments are only available at lower levels. You might also need to save XP by making low-level enchantments. In order to accomplish this, place torches or another easily removed object between the table and some of the bookshelves. Each bookshelf you block will reduce the level of enchantments your table offers.

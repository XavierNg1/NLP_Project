 If you want to listen to podcasts offline, you'll need to download a third-party client to convert URLs into MP3 files. Though there are tons of free cross-platform options, managers such as Juice, gPodder, and Zune all come highly recommended. Another great option is iTunes. Even if you don't have an iPhone or iPad, iTunes is a great music, video, and podcast manager, especially since it stays consistent with updates and it's free.
 Once you've downloaded your program of choice, check out your options to customize aspects like file type, download destination, and player preferences. Some managers, such as iTunes, will allow you to play your podcasts within the interface.
 Unlike mobile podcast platforms, your computer gives you freedom to browse any and all podcasts in public record, rather than simply the ones in app databases. Use this to your advantage! Once you settle on a podcast, click on it to view specific episodes.


You may have to create an account with a podcast site in order to view specific podcasts, so be ready to enter a valid email and password if needed.
 If you are using a manager like iTunes or Zune, you can simply click "save" or "get" next to the episode's name to save it to your computer. Otherwise, you will have to copy the podcast's URL and paste it into your manager. Every manual client differs slightly in its method of downloading, but most use the provided URL to access the podcast's feed. You'll want to click the "subscriptions" tab or its equivalent in your manager of choice; from this step, you can usually download specific episodes.
You can click a "refresh" button to check for new episodes.
 Once you've downloaded your podcast to your chosen file location, play it to make sure it downloaded completely and correctly.

 Changing the name of a minor child can be complicated. The court does not have to grant your request to change your child’s name. An attorney can evaluate your situation and advise you whether you are likely to be successful in changing your child’s name.
 You must file the petition in the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which you live.
 The amount of this fee may vary. You can file an IFP (in forma pauperis) petition and order if needed. This petition asks the court to waive the normal fee because you are unable to afford the fee or are considered to be low-income. If the judge agrees to waive the court’s fee, you will receive a signed order waiving the filing fee by mail.
 A court cannot change the name of a minor child without the other parent getting notice. You must send notice of the petition for name change to the other parent by registered or certified mail. You should ask for a return receipt when mailing the notice. You must file the return receipt along with a certificate of service with the court. This proves that you properly gave notice to the other parent., The court will hold a hearing to determine if the child’s name should be changed. The best interest of the child standard includes a number of different factors to consider.


The natural bond between parent and child
The parent’s history of visitation with child
Whether the parent has paid child support
Whether the parent has been consistently involved in child’s life
Whether ties exist between the child and the parent’s extended family
The social impact or respect according the child’s present name in the community
The age and ability of the child to understand the significance of changing his or her name

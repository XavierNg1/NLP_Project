 Beat the eggs lightly in a shallow dish. Stir in the milk.
 Mix the seasoned bread crumbs and crushed crackers in a shallow dish. Taste the mixture; if you want it to be spicier, add more black pepper and a dash of cayenne.
 Take a croquette and dip it in the egg wash, completely covering both sides. Then dredge the croquette through the bread crumb mixture, coating the croquette entirely. Place it back on the tray until it's ready to be fried. Continue washing and dredging the remaining croquettes.


If the croquettes tend to fall apart while you dredge them, return them to the refrigerator for another 20 minutes, then try again.
When you're finished dredging all of the croquettes, place the tray back in the refrigerator until you're ready to fry them. You may wait up to 4 hours before frying the croquettes.

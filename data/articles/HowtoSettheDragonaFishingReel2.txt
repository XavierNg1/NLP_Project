 Set up your rod and thread the line as though you are going to actually use the rod. Be sure to thread the line through all of the guides in order to get an accurate reading.
 You'll need to tie it securely to the hook at the end of your digital or spring scale. Make sure the line can't slip off when the scale is pulled.
 Hold the rod at a 45 degree angle. It's useful to have a friend hold your rod or the scale. Keep the scale vertical so that the hook and line are at the top.
 At first, your line won't do anything other than bend down with the weight. Then, you should notice the drag start to slip and the line extend. As soon as this happens, look at the scale and take a measurement.
 Look at where your drag is and what it should be set at. Use the drag adjustment knob on your reel and tighten or loosen as needed. Check the drag on a scale.

 Dissolve 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of non-iodized sea salt or Epsom salt in 1 cup (250 ml) of warm water in a clean cup, preferably in a disposable plastic one for each treatment. Soak the piercing or make a compress with a clean washcloth saturated with the salt water. Do this two to three times per day, fifteen minutes per session.If you don’t see improvement in 2-3 days, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your piercer or doctor for help.
Be sure to cover the entire piercing with the salt soak, on both sides of the hole. Continue to clean the piercing regularly with warm water and mild anti-bacterial soap.
It’s also okay to dab a small amount of antibiotic ointment onto the wound if infection is present.
 If you notice slight signs of infection like some redness or swelling that doesn’t go away, it’s okay to call your piercer and ask for advice on how to care for it. You can also go in to see them if you start to have drainage – they’ve seen so many piercings they can probably tell you whether the discharge is normal or not.


This only applies if a trained professional pierced you. If not, consult a doctor with any medical questions.
 Infections in piercings usually stay localized to the area of the piercing. However, if an infection spreads or gets into your bloodstream it can result in a serious, even life-threatening systemic infection. With severe infection you can have a fever, chills, nausea or vomiting, or dizziness.If you notice that your pain, swelling, and redness near your piercing start to spread to a larger area, see your doctor right away. This might be a sign that the infection is worsening and moving to larger areas of your body.
Your doctor will probably prescribe you antibiotics to prevent a severe infection. If the infection is already in your blood, you’ll probably have to stay in the hospital and have IV antibiotics.

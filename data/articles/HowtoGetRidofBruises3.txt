 Mix vinegar with warm water, and rub it over the injured area. Vinegar increases blood flow near the skin's surface, so it may help to dissipate the blood that has pooled in the bruised area. Witch hazel will also do the trick.
 Bromelain, a digestive enzyme found in pineapples, breaks down proteins that trap fluids in the tissues after an injury.
 Take a handful of fresh parsley leaves, crush them and spread them all over the bruise. Wrap the area with an elastic bandage. Some experts claim that parsley decreases inflammation, reduces pain and can make a bruise fade more quickly.
 Arnica is an herb that has long been recommended for bruises. It contains a compound that reduces inflammation and swelling. Find an ointment that contains arnica, and rub it over the bruise once or twice a day.
 If you have access to a holistic medicine supply store or a very well-stocked Chinese medicine store, you can apply a live leech. It will remove the surface blood in a bruise in a few seconds. The leech's saliva also acts as a mild painkiller, so you won't feel the bite. Apply rubbing alcohol or petroleum jelly to remove the leech.


This is only recommended if you can be sure that the leech is farm-raised and free of disease.
 Elevate the injured area on a cushion or pillow. Use a reusable heat pack; try not to use electric blankets. Wet heat is better for injuries than dry heat.


Apply heat pack for only a couple of minutes at a time, and only after attempting to use an ice pack. Only try using the heat method if ice hurts too much or makes your skin ache. For some people, this is a real problem and ice can exacerbate cold reactions.

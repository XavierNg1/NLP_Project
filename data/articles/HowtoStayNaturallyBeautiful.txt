 Make sure you cleanse and moisture your face two times a day. Early in the morning and just before going to bed. This will help keep your skin clean and looking fresh. Find a cleanser that suits your skin type. If not then just use mild or baby soap. If you have oily skin then use an oil-free moisture but if you have dry or combination skin then you might use a different one.;
, Nothing helps a face look more beautiful than a bright white smile. Brush your teeth at least twice a day. And using a whitening toothpaste will help keep them looking their very best.
 That is basically 2 liters (0.5 US gal). Trust me you need water. 75% of your body is made up of water and without it you won't be able to live for more than 3 days. Drinking water will keep both your skin and body clear. Just try drinking 8 glasses of water for 2 weeks and you will already see the results. Also drinking lots of water means going to the toilet a lot so don't keep it in.
 Fruit and veg are not just important but vital to you. Eating them will help keep your skin glowing. Even if you think you can't have that apple, go for it!

, When people think of the word exercise they think running 1 mile (1.6 km) to keep fit. That's not true. Just make sure you are active and do something everyday and before you know it, you'll be fit.
 The big one and most secret one. It's smiling. Yes that's all, smiling. Just smile to everyone you see, whether it's your mum, dog or even teacher. Smiling will make you feel a whole lot better and it will make you and other people realise what a better person you are. Let your inner self shine

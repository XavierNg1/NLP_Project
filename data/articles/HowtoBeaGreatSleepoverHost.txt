 Make sure you have music, movies, games and other activities available for your guests.;
, When guests arrive, give them a tour of the house; show them where the bathroom and the phone are, in case of any emergencies. Also tell them the "off limits areas" such as parents rooms, studies, siblings rooms, or any other room your parents don't want people barging in.
 Have your guests introduce themselves so everyone gets to know each other.
 Turn on some music everyone will enjoy, soon enough you will be dancing your feet off.
 But most times everyone likes pizza. So, just make sure you bring at least 2 different toppings.
 When you are finished eating, bring out a couple of games to play so your guests will be entertained and not bored.
 Start to have a vote on what movie you want. Make sure you check with your friend's parents to see if the ratings are okay.
 If your friend wants to go to the bathroom, pause the movie so they don't miss out. You can also have mid-night snack breaks if your guests (or even you) are hungry.
, Make eggs, pancakes, bacon, toast, or even fancy omelets, and remember the guests always come first.
 You can also go out to eat, too.
, Also make sure they don't forget their stuff.
 The party might be over but you have a mess to clean up: candy wrappers, dirty dishes, games, and crafts.

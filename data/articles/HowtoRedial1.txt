 If the phone number you've called is currently busy, hang up the phone before you attempt to redial the number.


Note that this method will only work with landline phones equipped with a “Redial” button. If your phone does not have this feature, you will need to use a different method.;
, Pick the phone back up and look for a button marked with the word “Redial.” Press this button and listen to the dial tone.


The phone should automatically redial the last number you dialed. It will not redial the last number to call you, however.
If you place the handset next to your ear, you should hear the phone dial and connect to the other line. It will ring as usual if the line is no longer busy, but you will hear a busy tone if the other line is still busy.
 If the phone number is still busy, you can hang up and try again later using the same procedure.


There is no limit on the number of times you can redial the last number, so you can continue pressing the redial button until you reach the intended recipient.

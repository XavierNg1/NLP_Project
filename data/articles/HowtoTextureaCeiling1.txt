 First, remove as much furniture as possible from the room. Cover all remaining furniture, as well as your floors, with drop clothes. Tape off or otherwise cover ceiling fixtures. Finally, tape plastic sheeting around the ceiling’s perimeter to protect your walls.


You will also want to remove any faceplates which are on your ceiling, such as vent covers.;
, You will want to be sure that the base layer of your ceiling is in prime condition. Repair cracks in plaster and generally ensure that the ceiling is as smooth as possible. Cracks can worsen over time and inconsistencies (as well as cracks) will be made more visible by the texture of the ceiling.


Some cracks and inconsistencies can be fixed with spackle, but others may be structural and should be addressed by an inspector or contractor.
 Paint a coat of paint primer on your ceiling before adding the texture. This can help to reduce the appearance of a previous color but it will also help the new paint adhere to the wall. Choose a primer in a color as close as possible to your final color.
 There are a number of ways to texture a ceiling. You can buy pre-textured paint (which will likely be the easiest option). You can also texture the ceiling by adding materials to either latex or oil based paint. Purchase material that is meant for texturing paint, such as special sand, and mix it according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as well as your own preference.


Generally, you will mix 1 part of the additive to every ten parts of paint. This works out to roughly 1 ½ cups of texture for every gallon of paint.
 Once you believe you have the paint mixed properly, you will want to do a small test patch to ensure you are happy with the texture. Try to do the test patch in a corner of the room or otherwise in a less visible area. Adjust your paint as necessary.

 A choking victim will often have their hands around their throat. If you notice someone making this gesture, look for other choking signals. You should only perform the Heimlich on a choking person. Look for the following:Cannot breathe or experiencing loud, difficult breathing
Cannot speak
Inability to cough effectively
Blue or gray color to lips and fingernail beds
Loss of consciousness;
, Tell the choking person you want to help them. Let them know you know the Heimlich Maneuver and are going to perform it on them., Stand with your legs separated to best support your body. Gently wrap both arms around their waist. Lean them forward slightly.
 With one hand, make a fist. Which hand you use does not matter. Position your fist below the ribcage, but above the navel. Then, wrap your other hand around your fist., To make a thrust, press hard and quick into the abdomen. Pull inward and upward as you press. It should feel like you're trying to lift the person off the ground.Make the thrusts quick and forceful.
Perform five abdominal thrusts in quick succession. If the object is still not dislodged, repeat with five additional thrusts.
 If the object is not dislodged with the Heimlich maneuver, do back blows. Deliver five blows to the person's back with the heel of your hand. Aim for the area between the shoulder blades.Press down hard, as you need to use enough force to dislodge the object.However, keep the force confined to your hands. Do not squeeze the area surrounding the person's ribcage or abdomen.
 Call emergency services if the object is not dislodged. Preferably, have someone else call emergency services after the Heimlich fails the first time and you are performing another round of back blows. When an emergency service worker arrives, they can get the object dislodged. At this point, stay away from the choking person.

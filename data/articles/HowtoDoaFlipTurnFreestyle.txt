 This can be hard to judge as it all depends on the length of your legs. Normally, there will be what looks like a T on the bottom of the pool. Depending on how long your legs are, normally you should do 2 strokes after the T then do your turn.
 As your arm enters the water, tuck your head in and keep kicking your legs to propel you over. As you tumble, breath out hard through your nose to prevent any water getting up it.
 The fastest way to get off the wall is to push off on your back underwater, rather then turning onto your front and then pushing off. Place both feet firmly on the wall and push off hard UNDERWATER and turn onto your front before you surface or do any kicking.

 Stretching your wrists can help relieve the pressure on your nerve and reduce your pain. Try doing ten reps of the following exercise at least once a day:Hold your arms straight out in front of you with your palms facing down.
Bend your wrists towards you so that all ten fingers are facing up towards the ceiling, and hold this position for five second.
Relax and straighten your wrists.
Make a tight fist with both hands.
Bend your wrists away from you so that all ten fingers are pointing towards the floor, and hold this position for five seconds.
Relax and straighten your wrists. Wait five second before repeating.
 Try incorporating a yoga practice into your routine. It has been shown to reduce pain from carpal tunnel syndrome, while also improving hand strength. If you don't want to take classes at a studio or gym, you can purchase a video or find a free one online. Then you can practice your yoga in your own home whenever it is convenient for you.
 As much as possible, try to avoid doing things that cause your carpal tunnel pain to become worse. If you are not able to stop doing some activities (particularly typing) you may be able to find ergonomic devices that will decrease the strain on your wrist while you do them. The following activities are common triggers for carpal tunnel pain:Activities that put a lot of pressure on the heel of your palm (like push-ups)
Activities that require constant back and forth movement of your wrist (like typing, sewing, or playing video games)
Activities that require forceful grasping (like using garden clippers)
Activities that expose your hands to vibration (like using power tools)

 Spread the bags out evenly in the bottom of a shallow baking tray or similar container.This is a great way to recycle teabags already used to brew tea.
If you use loose tea leaves instead of teabags, place the leaves into the bottom of a paper cup, ice cube tray compartment, or similar mold.
 Carefully pour a small amount of melted candle wax over each tea bag, using just enough wax to cover the bag or the leaves.


You could pour liquid paraffin over the teabags instead of using melted candle wax, if desired. Either option should work just as well.
 Allow the coated teabags to sit out, undisturbed, until the bags and leaves absorb the melted wax.


This means that the wax will also cool and harden. When ready, the teabags will feel stiff and cool to the touch.
 Place the teabag firelighters in resealable plastic bags or containers. Store them away from any excess moisture until ready to use.

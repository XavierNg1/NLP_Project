 A great way for your kids to spend quality time with their grandparents is to plan a sleepover. Sleeping over at Grandma’s can help your child build her independence and confidence being away from Mom and Dad while having fun watching old Disney movies in Gran’s living room., A great adventure to foster bonding between grandparents and their grandchildren is a family vacation. Consider inviting your kids’ grandparents to the beach next summer, or take a weekend trip to the city where kids can visit the zoo and play in the park with Grandpa. If your family loves the outdoors, consider a camping trip at a state park.


To reduce stress, consider booking separate accommodations for the grandparents.
 If you have multiple children it can be challenging for Grandma to get enough time with each of them during her weekly visits. Encourage your children’s grandparents to plan one-on-one excursions with your kids. This can be something as simple as catching a Saturday matinee or a more involved adventure like a weekend trip to see a show on Broadway. Make sure each child gets his or her own one-on-one adventure to avoid jealousy.
 Grandparents have skills that they can share with your kids, presenting a perfect opportunity for bonding between the two generations. Does Grandma have a secret family recipe for spaghetti? Does Grandpa still cook the borscht his mother taught him how to make years ago? Encourage your kids to ask their grandparents to share these skills with them., Hands-on skills like gardening, woodworking, or even bird watching can be a fantastic way for your kids to bond with their grandparents. If Grandpa has a skill set to share, encourage him to show your daughter or son how it’s done. Not only will this facilitate bonding, it will also ensure that the skills are passed on to the new generation.

 If you're going to air dry parsley, you want to make sure you gather it at its most tender point, which is early in the morning, but enough after sun-up to have burned off the dew from the night before.


Don't worry about washing the parsley if you've picked it. It should be as dry as possible to start out with.
 Keep them fairly loose so that air can circulate around the leaves as they dry. You can make bundles as big as your hand or you can keep the bundles smaller if you wish. Just make sure they're not too tight when you tie them.
 Rubber bands are easiest if you have bigger bundles. Secure the stems of the parsley, letting the larger, leafier portion fan out while it dries.
 Storing the drying bundles in bags will keep them dust free and won't allow sunlight to bleach the color from the parsley. Cut some holes in the bags to allow air to circulate, and keep the bundles nice and dry.


Store the bags in a cool, dry place with good air circulation. Stacking them on a drying rack, or an old clothes rack can be a good method of storing them.Alternatively, you can leave them out of the bags and tie them with string to hang in your kitchen and dry. Hang the bundles upside down for a more decorative, but equally effective, method of drying.
 The parsley is dried when it becomes easily crumbled in your fingers. Spread the bundles on the counter on a piece of wax paper or a cutting board, and crumble the bunches, taking care to remove the woody stems.
 Save old herb containers to reuse for your dried parsley, keep them in mason jars, or other containers. Store in a cool dry place in your kitchen.

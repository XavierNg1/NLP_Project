 A clear case will work the best for this, but you can use a colored one depending on the design that you pick. Once you have your case, choose one of the decorating ideas from the list below., Buy some puffy or dimensional fabric paint from the art store. Use it to draw designs on the outside of your case. Let the paint dry completely before putting it onto your phone. Great design ideas include dots, spirals, zigzags, and chevron., Trace the front of the case onto a piece of lace. Cut the lace out, then coat the inside of the case with decoupage glue. Press the lace into the glue, then coat it with another layer of decoupage glue. Let the glue dry, then cut out the camera hole with a craft blade.Make sure that the glue is clear and glossy.
Add a piece of fabric on top of the lace for a layered effect.
 Choose a solid-colored case in a color that you like. Buy some washi tape in coordinating colors or patterns. Wrap the tape around the case, including the sides. Be sure to leave some space between each piece so that the case's color peeks through. Cut out any socket/speaker/camera holes with a craft blade.You can find washi tape in the scrapbooking section in an arts and crafts store.
Try a chevron pattern for something more interesting.
 Lay down strips of washi tape over the back of a cell phone case. Make sure that the edges touch and the patterns align. Flip the phone over and trim away any excess tape hanging over the sides. Cut out the camera hole as well. Finish off by coating the outside of the case, include the sides, with clear, glossy, decoupage glue.You can lay the tape down horizontally or vertically.
Do not cover the sides of the phone case.
 Trace the case onto a piece of scrapbook paper, then cut it out. Coat the inside of the case with clear, decoupage glue. Press the paper design-side-down into the glue. Let the glue dry, then cut out the camera hole with a craft blade.You can also use patterned, cotton fabric instead.

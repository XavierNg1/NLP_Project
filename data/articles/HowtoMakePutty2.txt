 Spoon 1 tbsp (15 mL) borax into 1Â½ cups water. Stir until it dissolves, using a popsicle stick.
 Take the cap off the glue and start pouring in glue in a thin stream. With your other hand, keep stirring the water in a circular pattern, using the popsicle stick.
 The glue should clump around the popsicle stick. Remove it once it starts looking like putty and knead it to finish the process. If it sticks to your hand or feels runny, dunk it back in the water and stir some more.

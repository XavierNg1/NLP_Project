 If you believe in lucky numbers, they're probably digits that center around important dates or events in your life. Mix the numbers of significant numbers together. For instance, you might use your grandfather’s birthday month and year,10/1929 and your mother’s birth month and day, 3/21. Together you might come up with something like 10-19-3-21-29. Other examples of significant numbers might include::


Birthdays: Yours, your children's, your spouse's, and so on.
Anniversaries: This could be a wedding anniversary date, or the date of another significant event.
Ages: Using your age or the ages of your loved ones is also a common practice.
Addresses: The address of your childhood or current home is another tactic you can try.
Phone numbers: Try breaking down your phone number into a sequence of single- or double-digit lotto numbers.
 Some folks have a lucky number they use for everything. It isn't connected a birthday or anything like that, they just like the number. If this is the case for you, add your lucky number to your lottery number. You never know. You might get lucky!


If you're playing a lottery game such as Powerball, consider making your lucky number the Powerball pick.
Also if you’re lucky numbers are 7 and 11 lucky, keep in mind that those are really common lottery picks. If you win with these numbers on your ticket, you might end up sharing the prize with a lot of people.
 Some people choose a number sequence that they consider lucky and play it over and over again until it comes up a winner -- if it ever does. For instance, if you’re favorite number sequence is your favorite number, combined with your birthday and your spouse’s lucky number and birthday (3-6-11-9-10-31), then you would play this number religiously every time you play the lottery. Then, you wait for your number to come up a winner. This could be considered making your own luck.

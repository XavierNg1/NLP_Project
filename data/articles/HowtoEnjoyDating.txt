 The good ones are not all taken. If they were, you would be sipping mai tai on a beach with your beloved right now.;
, Are super models breaking down your door begging you for attention? Are moguls whisking you away to Spain for tapas? No? Perhaps, it's time to accept a date simply because someone was lovely enough to ask you.
 Please don't be rude. Saying please and thank you will make moms proud and endear you to your date. Promptly returning phone calls, whether or not you plan to accept an invitation, is appropriate and respectful. "Coy" is for the fish.
 Just be confident and show your characters and all your best side to your date to get a great impression.
 Insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting a different result. In other words, every time you tick off your list of "must haves and can't dos" you limit yourself to dating similar people. Has that worked for you so far?

, These can include physically active dates (such as mountain biking or rock climbing) to creative dates (such as going to a pottery or ballroom dancing class).
 Even if you're 10 minutes into the worst date ever, a sense of humor goes a long way. Every hideous detail can be used later to regale your friends with laughter.

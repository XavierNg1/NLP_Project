 Making a clay keychain requires mold-and-bake clay (also known as polymer clay), a small cookie cutter, a large needle or toothpick, and a split ring or keychain assembly. Make sure to cover your space with newspaper or something that can keep the clay from sticking onto the table!


Split rings come in a variety of shapes and sizes. You can buy larger ones that a decorative clay shape can be directly attached to or you can buy a more complex split ring and chain assembly that is made specifically to attach your own keychain art to. Pick whichever one you like. You can even reuse parts from an old keychain if you have one lying around.;
, The clay should come out smooth and the thickness should be uniform throughout.









If desired, press more than one color together to create a swirled effect. You can even make small shapes and press them into a larger piece of the clay. Be creative!

, Choose the shape of your choice, such as a flower for Mother's Day, a clover for St. Patrick's Day, a heart for Valentine's Day. Sports fans will enjoy a keychain shaped like a basketball, baseball or football.









You can also create your own shape for your key chain with a sharp paring knife or utility knife.










This hole will be used to attach your clay shape to the split ring, so make sure the hole is in a position that will make this possible.
Many mold-and-bake clays allow you to attach small jewelry findings, such as small metal loops, directly into the clay before baking. If the clay you purchased allows this, it may be a good idea to attach a loop of wire to your clay shape so that a split ring can be easily attached to it later.
 Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before attempting the next step.
 Be careful not to be too rough when connecting the two pieces together, as it could break your beautiful new keychain.

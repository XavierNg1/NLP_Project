 Each time we paint something using the Brush Tool we can chose a Blending Mode for the stroke. A Blending Mode is a way to mix the colors with the object(s) behind them using several mathematical formulas working over the RGB values of each pixel. Letâ€™s try some of them -



Normal Mode, which paints the color as is without applying any transformation to the color pixels.

Dissolve Mode adds some noise at the edge of the brush stroke.

Behind Mode paints behind an existing stroke even if they are both on the same layer.

Clear Mode can delete a section of an existing stroke.
 You have a lot to experiment with here, no matter how many years you have been using Photoshop, you never stop learning about Blending Modes.

 Do so by entering https://www.facebook.com into your browser's URL box. This will load your News Feed if you're already logged into Facebook.


If you aren't already logged into Facebook, enter your email address (or phone number) and password before continuing.
 You'll usually find it near the top of the left-hand column of options in the News Feed.


If you can't find your group, click ▼ in the top-right corner, click New Groups, click the Groups tab in the top-left corner, and click your group's name under the "Groups You Manage" heading.
 This tab is in the upper-left side of the page. Doing so will pull up a list of all people in the group.
 Make sure you don't remove yourself during this process. To do so:


Click ⚙️ to the right of a member's name.
Click Remove from Group.
Click Confirm when prompted.
 Once everyone except you is gone from the group, click this gear icon to prompt your own drop-down menu.
 This will invoke a pop-up window.
 It's the blue button in the pop-up window. Doing so immediately removes you from the group and deletes the group itself.

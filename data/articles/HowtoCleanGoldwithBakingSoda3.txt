 Make sure the shiny side is facing up. If you have more than two pieces of gold, then line a flat surface, like a glass pan or a cookie sheet, with foil. This way you can ensure that each piece of gold is touching the foil., Place the gold in the bowl (or pan), making sure each piece of gold is touching the foil. Sprinkle an adequate amount of baking soda onto the gold pieces until they are completely covered. You should not be able to see the gold pieces., Heat one to two cups (240 to 480 ml) of water in the microwave for one to two minutes, or until it is boiling. Then pour the boiling water over the gold until it is completely submerged. Let the jewelry soak for three to five minutes.Alternatively, you can use your stove to heat the water (about eight to ten minutes on a high heat setting).
 After your gold has finished soaking, use tongs to remove the gold from the water. Rinse the gold thoroughly under cold running water. Then dry it with a soft cloth until all the water is removed from the gold.Do not use this method if your gold contains glued on crystals or pearls. The boiling water can unglue the crystals and damage the pearls.
This method is safe for gold that contains gemstones, unless the gemstones are glued on.

 The emo style of clothing typically includes wearing band t-shirts or ironic t-shirts, sweaters and hoodies, skate shoes like Vans or Converse, and accessories like piercings and a messenger bag. Black eyeliner is also popular on guys and girls.


If you can’t or don’t want to spend a lot of money, you can find a lot of simple emo clothes and even band shirts at thrift stores. A more worn-in look on your clothes and shoes is better than new anyway.
A Christian cross also looks great with this style too. Don't forget your relationship with your Lord!

, Grow out bangs (the hair around your face) and then part your hair far to one side, so that the bangs fall partly or fully over one eye. You can use gel or mousse to style the bangs or slightly spike the rest of your hair. You can also buy hair dye in a dark color to add to the look.
 These are three separate subcultures that are associated with slightly different types of music and fashion choices. While emo is generally characterized by sideswept hair, hoodies, and sweaters, the scene look usually has brighter neon colors and the goth look is generally all black.


If someone confuses you for scene or goth, don’t get upset or defensive, just explain why you identify as emo. It’s good to know the difference between these three styles, but it’s not worth an argument. All are valid, and everyone has a different definition of what it means to be emo, scene, or goth.

 There are no licensed injectable veterinary medicines for use against ear mites. However, Ivermectin Cattle Injection can be effective in extraneous circumstances. As mentioned above, the ivermectin family of drugs acts by inhibiting nerve transmission in arthropods, causing paralysis and eventual death of the parasite.


Because ivermectin is not approved for this purpose, it should be reserved as a treatment of last resort for difficult-to-handle animals where more traditional intervention is not possible.Ivermectin 1% Injectable (cattle formulation) is usually dosed at 200 micrograms/kg body weight, given by subcutaneous injection (a shot), two weeks apart.
 Ivermectin should never be used in Collies, Australian Shepherds, Long-haired Whippets and Shelties. These breeds have a genetic mutation which means the drug can penetrate the blood brain barrier, cause CNS toxicity, non-reversible coma, and possibly death.


Certain dogs have similar sensitivities. An intolerance to this drug is not necessarily predictable by breed â€“ all the more reason to avoid this alternative if possible.It is not advised for use in small animals because it is so potent. If your pup is small, this is not an option unless given the go-ahead by your vet. Only owners of large, difficult-to-handle dogs should entertain this option.

Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products are all good choices.Avoid processed carbohydrates like muffins, cookies, and chips.
Opt for whole grains like oatmeal, whole wheat, or brown rice.;
, Proteins are critical for the building and repair of muscle tissue, skin, hair, and nails. While proteins are not a primary source of energy during exercise, they help keep blood glucose at a healthy level through liver gluconeogenesis.Young athletes should choose lean meats, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, nuts, and low-fat dairy products as protein sources.
 Fat is an essential element of proper nutrition, especially for young athletes. Fats help the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins and they also nourish the body with essential fatty acids.

Calcium stones. Calcium stones come in two forms: calcium oxalate stones and calcium phosphate stones. Calcium oxalate stones are the most common form of kidney stone. Calcium stones are often caused by high sodium intake.
Uric acid stones. Uric acid stones form when urine is very acidic, and are often because the patient has a diet high in animal protein (meat, fish, shellfish).
Struvite stones. These are usually caused by kidney infections. Staying free of infection can usually stop struvite stones.
Cystine stones. These are formed when cystine leaks into the kidneys, resulting in stones. Cystine stones are caused by a genetic disorder.

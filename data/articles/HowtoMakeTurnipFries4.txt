 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the fries, set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat. Next, lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil to prevent the fries from sticking.You can substitute canola oil for the olive if you prefer.
 Add ¼ cup (20 g) of grated Parmesan cheese, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of Italian seasoning blend, and salt and black pepper to taste to a small bowl. Use a fork to mix the ingredients together so they’re well-blended.If you like, you substitute or mix other herbs in with the seasonings, such as dried thyme or dried marjoram.
 Place 2 large turnips that have been peeled and cut into wedges into a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil, and toss well so the turnip fries are well coated.You can substitute canola oil for the olive oil if you prefer, though the flavor won’t be as rich.
 Once the turnip fries are coated with the oil, sprinkle half of the seasoning mixture over them. Stir the seasonings in so the turnips are fully coated., After you’ve mixed the first half of the seasonings into the turnips, add the remaining seasoning mixture to the fries. Toss them again to evenly distribute the seasonings.If your fries don’t appear to have enough seasoning, you can mix up another batch of the Parmesan cheese and seasoning mixture and add as much as necessary to flavor the fries.
 When the fries are properly seasoned, spread them out on the greased baking sheet in a single layer. Place them in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake until they are golden brown, which should take approximately 30 minutes.Halfway through the baking process, turn the fries over to ensure that they cook evenly.
 When the fries are finished baking, remove the baking sheets from the oven. Transfer the fries to a platter and serve while they are still warm.The herbed turnip fries pair well with a garlic aioli or other creamy dipping sauce.

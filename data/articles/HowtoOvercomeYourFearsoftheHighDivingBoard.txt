 Have fun and get comfortable., Go head first and feet first. Get used to entering the water and enjoy the easy, soft landing., What do they say about it? Most will say it's fun. They're saying it because it's true. Once you get used to it, it really is a lot of fun., Remember, you are trying this dive to have fun.
If people start trying to "encourage" you, don't let them get to you.
Ignore anyone who is jeering or being pessimistic. Unless your dive is a belly flop, it really won't hurt.
,,,,, Expel all the air from your lungs. As you start to inhale, bounce off slightly. You will be airborne for about a fraction of a second. In your excitement, you will inhale sufficiently.,, You already know how to do this from the low board.,, Don't think about it, just do it. This will get you accustomed enough to the activity that those old fears won't creep back in for next time.

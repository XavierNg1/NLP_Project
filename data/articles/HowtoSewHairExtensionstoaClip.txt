Make sure the weft is similar to your own hair's texture. Buying an extension that is the color you desire also is important if you do not plan to dye the weft.
Choose an appropriate length, too. Although you can cut the weft to the length you desire, it's easier to just purchase one that is the length you prefer.;
, Combing through the hair weft first prevents problems with snarls as you work with the hair.
 Sew or cut a piece of hair to match the width of your weft clip. Start at the top of the hair weft and continue to cut down the length of the hair.


Your packages of weft clips can contain many different width sizes to work with. You can create a customized look by combining several weft clips together to make a wider hair extension. For example, use 4 weft clips for an 8-inch (20 cm) piece of hair, 3 weft clips for a 5- or 6-inch (13 or 15 cm) section, and 2 for a 2-1/2-inch (6.5 cm) section.
 The front of the clip should face you. You'll know you have it right if the clip is convex to the surface and you can see a bar across the comb.
, Beading thread is best, but you can also double up regular cotton thread.
 Knot the thread securely to the weft clip when you are finished.
 Spread it out over a drop cloth or old magazine. You can use regular hair dye that you can buy at a mass retail outlet or beauty supply store.
 You can do the whole piece or just apply strips of color throughout. Let the color sit on the hair weft for 15 to 20 minutes.

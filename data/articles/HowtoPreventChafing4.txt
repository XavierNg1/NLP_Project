 Gently wipe between your thighs, under your arms, or over your nipples with water, or a warm wet cloth. Be sure to dry the area well after washing it., This will sooth and heal the chafed skin.If the area is very painful, swollen, bleeding, or crusty looking, talk to your doctor about a prescription for a medicated ointment.
 Continued friction in the area will only make it worse and could lead to infection. So take a break from your morning run or walk. Switch to pants instead of shorts for a few days.If the chafing does not improve after several days, talk to your doctor. You may need medicated ointment or cream to heal the chafing.

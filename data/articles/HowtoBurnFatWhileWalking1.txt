 Before you begin developing a walking regimen, it is important that you consult your doctor. This is especially important if you have preexisting medical problems such as a heart condition.;
, In order to burn fat while walking, you need to calculate your fat-burning zone — or the heart rate at which you are likely to burn more fat. Start by warming up on a bicycle for 10 minutes. An indoor bicycle is best, but an outdoor bicycle will work as well., After your warm up, cycle for an additional 20 minutes at the highest pace you can maintain for this duration. Don’t overdo it. Your legs should burn and your breathing should be hard, but you need to be able to maintain this pace for the full 20 minutes.If you are on an indoor bicycle, aim for between 70 and 90 RPM.
 Use either the handles on the stationary bike or a heart rate monitor to record your average heart rate during the 20 minutes you are cycling at your maximum sustainable pace. After you subtract 20 beats, add three beats from the number to get the high end of your range and subtract three beats to get the low end of your range. This is your fat-burning zone.For example, if your average heart rate was 160, then your maximum fat-burning heart rate zone is between 137 and 143 beats per minute.
 Take the number 220 and subtract your age. This is your maximum heart rate. Now calculate 50% to 65% of the resulting number. This is your heart rate for your maximum fat-burning zone., While many treadmills, stationary bicycles, and exercise machines have built-in heart rate monitors, it can be difficult to track your heart rate if walking outside. Purchasing a heart rate monitor, while unnecessary, can help you make sure you’re walking in your fat-burning heart rate zone.You can also check your heart rate manually by placing your two fingers over your radial artery. Once you feel your pulse, count the number of times it beats during 15 seconds and multiply this by 4 to calculate your heartbeat per minute.

 Using a mane comb, comb the mane into narrow sections. Start at the top and work your way down. As you get further down the mane, the hair gets thinner, so your sections will become gradually wider in order to ensure evenly sized braids. Secure each equal section with a loosely wound elastic band.


For practice braids, choose a band color that stands out. For competitions, choose a band color that matches your horse's mane.
Traditionally, an odd number of sections are used. Use more sections for horse's with short, wide necks, and fewer sections for horses with long, thin necks.
 Remove the band before braiding, and begin at the top. This can be a basic braid or a French braid. For a basic braid, divide the section into three pieces and alternately weave the left and right section over the middle.


Pull the hair down as you work, not toward you, so the braid lies in the right direction.Dampen the section again with the body brush if it is difficult to work with.
 Fold the tip of the braid back under itself a short distance. Secure the tip of the braid with a tightly wound elastic band.


If the mane is long, fold the braid tip a second time before securing.
 Repeat with each section, trying to make it as neat as possible. Optionally, place a small dab of egg white or hair gel for horses over each braid to help keep it in place.


Never leave the braids in overnight without protection (see Tips). After removing them, brush the mane out with water.
Optionally, if you want a tidier and showier braid, move on to the section on sewing button braids.

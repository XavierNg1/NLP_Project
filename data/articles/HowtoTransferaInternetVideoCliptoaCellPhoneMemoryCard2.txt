 If using an iPhone, open iTunes. If using an Android phone and Windows, make sure that Windows Media Player 10 or later is installed. If you are using an Android phone and a Mac, make sure you have the Android File Transfer tool installed.
 Open iTunes. Click File then Add File to Library… Browse for the video file that you want to add. Alternatively, drag and drop the video into the iTunes window.


Sync your iPhone. Since the video was added to your Library in the previous step, it will be automatically synced to your phone.
Open your video. Your video will be viewable in the Videos app of your iPhone.
iOS supports MP4, MOV, and M4V file formats.
 Find your phone’s drive. In Windows, open Computer and double-click on your device. In Mac OS X, open the finder and select your phone under Devices.


Navigate to the Videos folder on your phone. This is where you will copy the video to. Either click and drag or copy and paste the video file or files that you want to add. A window will open showing the time left in the transfer process.
Open your video. Your video will now be viewable in the Video Player app on your phone. If the file type is not supported, look for a media player that supports it in the Google Play Store.

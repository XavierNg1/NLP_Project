 It is normal and healthy to experience bad moods every now and again. But if your bad mood lasts for more than two weeks or if it is seriously infringing on your ability to function, you should talk to your doctor about it.There is a possibility that you have a physical disorder, such as an abnormal thyroid, which will require medical treatment., Some people experience clinical depression, which is more serious than a typical bad mood. Depression can cause physical as well as mental distress and hurt someone's ability to work, sleep, or function normally. If you cannot shake your feelings of distress, or if you are considering hurting yourself or someone else, you should seek mental health care as soon as possible.Remember that depression is an illness that requires treatment, just like a physical disorder. It is perfectly normal to need the help of antidepressant medication or talk therapy to recover., Some women experience difficult, serious bad moods during the days leading up to their periods. This is known as Premenstrual Syndrome or PMS. If you feel like your PMS is hurting your ability to function in a healthy and happy way, talk with your doctor about whether you might benefit from hormonal birth control. Many women report an improvement in PMS symptoms and in their moods while on hormonal birth control.Note that hormonal birth control can have side effects that are potentially serious. Talk carefully with your doctor about your options.
 If your bad moods take place during the dark winter months, coupled with increased irritability and anxiety and lower energy, it is possible that you are experiencing Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD is caused by the lack of sunlight and can be effectively treated with light therapy, talk therapy, and antidepressants. Be sure to talk about these options with your doctor.

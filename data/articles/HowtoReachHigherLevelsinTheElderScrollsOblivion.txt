 When choosing your skills, you want to make sure you get an equal balance of the different attributes to level up a good well-rounded character. (ex:Heavy armor/Endurance, Light armor/speed Alchemy/Intelligence etc.);
, Now what you want to do is to go out and max all of your skills without sleeping in a bed once. (so that you don't level) Depending on what skills you chose this may be rather difficult, but in the end it will all be worth it. Make sure that you level any skills you chose under the Endurance attribute first so that as you level you get as much health as possible.
 Now, go to the Skingrad Mages Guild and acquire any of the Drain Skill spells from the mage, Sulinus Vassinus. This spell requires you to at least be apprentice in Destruction so if you're not, pick up any novice spell you can find to help you train. Now, find a spellmaking altar and create custom Drain Skill spells affecting some of your chosen major skills.. They should be on self, have a magnitude of 100, and a duration of 1 second.
 If by now you haven't caught on to what you're doing let me fill you in. Every level you can find a skill trainer and have them train a skill 5 times per level. So, every time you sleep and gain a level find a skill trainer that trains one of your major skills, cast your custom spell, and train. The reason the skill your training should already be at 100 should become quite clear as of now. You're training your skills over 100. These skill increases will count towards leveling thus, if you continue to do this for each level you will be able to extend your levels beyond what's normally possible.

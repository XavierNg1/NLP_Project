 Very small holes are usually caused by nails or screws and can be repaired easily and quickly with spackle.


There are a variety of spackling pastes for sale. It's usually a good idea to get a non-shrinking spackling paste, so that a crack does not develop at the seam between the wall and the patch.
Small cracks between molding and trim can be filled with spackling paste but it is probably easier to use paintable caulk, which is available at any home improvement store. Simply run a bead of caulk along for crack and smooth with a wet finger.;
, Do not put a lot of spackling paste on your knife. While it depends on the size of the hole, you will usually only need a small bit approximately the size of a marble.
 The goal is to make the transition between the wall and the patch as seamless as possible. Using a damp cloth, wipe off any excess spackling paste that may have gotten on the wall around the hole.


If you mess up the smoothness of the patch, feel free to start over with a bit more spackling paste on your putty knife.
 Sometimes a hole is so small and your wall color is light enough that retouching the paint is not necessary.

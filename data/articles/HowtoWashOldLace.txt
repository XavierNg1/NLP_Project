 Use a gentle soap, such as liquid castile.;
, If it isn't unravelling, weakened or coming apart, wash by dipping it into the soapy water. Very gently squeeze and knead the lace.
, If you'd like to stiffen the old lace again, use gum arabic.


Dissolve 125g of gum arabic in 1⁄2 liter (0.1 US gal) of hot water.






Strain the mixture. Pour into a bottle.






Add 1 to 3 tablespoons of this mix at room temperature to every 1⁄2 liter (0.1 US gal) of warm water at the rinse cycle stage when washing the lace.
 Simply roll it in a clean towel until it has almost dried.
 Iron over the lace under the towel. This will both press the lace and cause the pattern to stand out.

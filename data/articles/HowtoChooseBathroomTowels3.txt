 It’s important to choose towels that are sustainably sourced and easy on the environment. Look for towels that are made with organic materials free of biocides and fertilizers. Organic cotton is just as soft and durable as regular cotton. Another eco-friendly option is to buy towels that are “quick-dry” since they require less time in the laundry., Your towels can provide the perfect finishing touch to your bathroom – if you choose the right color. Find complimentary colors and stack them neatly on the counter between two bathroom sinks, or place them on a shelf. For instance, if your bathroom is painted magenta or aqua, you could try a set of white towels.White towels are almost guaranteed to match any bathroom, though they stain the easiest.
If you have a white bathroom, try towels in a vivid primary color like blue, green, or red.
 Towels of Turkish cotton have a natural sheen that can add pep to a dull bathroom. Towels of viscose – a synthetic fiber made of bamboo plants – also have a natural sheen that looks great stacked neatly on the bathroom counter., If you’re buying towels mainly for decorative purposes, you should locate jacquard towels that have beautiful patterns woven directly into the fabric. A related type of towel, the print towel, has a printed image or design on the towel’s surface. Embellished towels have a fancy trim or embroidery to enrich their surface. These towels won’t stand up to frequent laundering or heavy use, and should be treated delicately., When you buy towels, you should also purchase a single washcloth made by the same manufacturer, in the same color as the towels you purchased. Place the washcloth and the receipt in a drawer and do not use it. If your towels fade after washing, bring the towels, the receipt, and the unused washcloth back to the retailer where you obtained them. Show them the towels and compare them to the unwashed washcloth to prove that they’ve faded.

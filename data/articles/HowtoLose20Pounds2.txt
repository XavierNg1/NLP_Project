 Your basal metabolic rate or BMR is how many calories you body burns per day performing basic metabolic functions, such as breathing, digesting food, etc. This calculation is important for determining your basic caloric needs.


If you are a women, calculate your BMR using the following formula : 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years)

Example: A 5'7", 135 pound, 30-year-old woman's BMR would be 655 + (4.3 x 135 pounds) + (4.7 x 67) – (4.7 x 30) = 1408.5.


If you are a man, calculate your BMR using the following formula : 66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years)

Example: A 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old man's BMR would be 66 + (6.3 x 180 pounds) + (12.9 x 72) – (6.8 x 30 years) = 1924.8.
 If you are sedentary, multiply your BMR by 1.2. If you are moderately active, multiply your BMR by 1.3-1.4. If you are very active multiply your BMR by 1.4-1.5. This resulting number is an estimate of the number of calories you burn per day.


Example: If you, like the above man, had a BMR of 1924.8 and lived an active lifestyle then you would need to multiply your BMR by 1.4. If you did this, you would find that you burn approximately 2695 calories per day.
 A reasonable calorie goal would be to consume 15-30% less calories than you currently burn per day. To perform this calculation multiply how many calories you burn per day (as calculated in the the "Calculate total calories burned per day" step) by 0.70 - 0.85.


Example: If you, like the above man, burned approximately 2695 calories per day then you would want to eat between 1886 (2695 x 0.70) and 2291 (2695 x 0.85) calories per day.
The larger your deficit, closer to 30% (1886 calories/day), the quicker your diet will be but the harder it will be to maintain. The smaller your deficit, closer to 15% (2291 calories/day), the easier your diet will be to maintain but your weight loss will be slower.

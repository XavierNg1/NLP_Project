Make sure you also are in a dust-free environment.
WhyÂ ? Because the moment you'll place that lens back, you'll have lint and particle under the lenses again!
BE REALLY CAREFUL not to make any scratches on them, for that you will not forgive yourself.
DO NOT use Kleenexes, your t-shirt, or any cloth other than a specialized cloth from camera stores, or ones for eyeglasses.
Do NOT apply pressure, take your time and inspect those lenses really carefully, dirt places itself everywhere!

 You'll need 1" square dowels, high quality wood-suited glue (like Gorilla Glue or Titebond 3), spray paint, and paper or vinyl sheets for the tops of the squares. A frame clamp is useful but not required.
 However, the dimensions are easy to change to your needs.
 You'll need to cut the dowels (a table or circular saw would help with accuracy) to the following lengths:


Four at 1"
Eight at 2"
Twelve at 3"
Sixteen at 4"
Twelve at 5"
Eight at 6"
Four at 7"

, You'll need to glue the dowels together in a symmetrical pattern that compliments the pieces. You can of course glue them together however you want, but this pattern is recommended (makes one side, mirror to get the whole board):, Clamp the dowels together with a frame clamp if you can get one. If not, do the best you can to secure them together tightly with rope. Let the glue set thoroughly before continuing.
 Once the form is dry, sand the outside until the sides of the dowels are completely flush with each other.
 Use spray paint to paint the entire board to to a single color.
 You will want to make the tops of the squares different colors so that you can more easily see what's happening on the board. Don't feel limited to black and white! You can carefully paint the squares, or you can cut out carefully measured squares of self-adhesive vinyl.
 Enjoy your new, unique chess board.

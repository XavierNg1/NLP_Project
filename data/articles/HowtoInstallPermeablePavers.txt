 Almost all ground has the capability to allow water to seep through down into the groundwater system but different types of soil and different conditions determine how fast the water will seep through. Take into account the soil, how much rain you get in the area and how much traffic goes over the surface. The principle is to place enough rock and gravel that will be able to hold the rainwater load long enough for the soil underneath the rock to absorb the water. Gravel and sandy soil drain water the best or the fastest and clay soil drains the worst or the slowest. So if you have an area with a lot of rain and clay soils, the rock and gravel with have to be very deep to be able to hold the rainwater while it slowly seeps into the soil. If you live in an area where there is little amount of rain and very good draining soil like sand and gravel, the depth of the rock and gravel might be very shallow, only 8 inches (20.3Â cm). The next factor to consider is the traffic flow. The more traffic, the deeper the base. If it is a residential driveway used only to park cars, the depth of the base would be far less than a commercial street. There is software program available from Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute that contractors and engineers can use to get the correct depths and stone sizes.;
, This is usually done with a jackhammer to break up the existing driveway, and a bobcat or the like to remove the pieces.
,, The purpose to the geotextile is to keep the soil from mixing with the rock and gravel base. Without the geotextile, the rock would work its way into the sub soil, decreasing the effective depth of the base material.
,,,,, In this case we are using a concrete bond beam that the border pavers are set into when the concrete is still wet. This prevents lateral movement.
, All water should be absorbed with zero run off.

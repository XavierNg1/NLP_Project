 Many students choose to apply themselves as tutors in a class that they find enjoyable or easy. They elect to tutor other students in that particular subject. This is generally contained within a particular school or institution, and is a good way for the tutoring student to make some extra money.Sometimes the tutor may not remain in the same school, but will remain in the same district. For example, a high school student might tutor a middle school student in introductory science.
For example, a student of one college or high school would rarely ever be a tutor at another.
 It is important that you understand the course that you are tutoring. Most places require that you have taken the course you wish to tutor. Usually, you must have earned an A- or better in the course. Sometimes, a lower grade will be accepted if the professor recommends you.Sometimes you can tutor for a class that you tested out of, for example, introduction to chemistry.
 Most institutions have a specific training course that you must complete before being instated as tutor. This is to ensure that you can properly communicate information to your fellow students. After completing the training, you will generally be listed in the institution’s tutoring center where students will come for study help., As a fellow student and a tutor, your interactions with the people you tutor can sometimes be tricky. You might often run into a student who doesn’t recognize your authority on the subject because you are a student. You should also recognize that, to some degree, you hold a position of power over your fellow students. Be careful not to abuse this position, such as asking for favors in return for tutoring.

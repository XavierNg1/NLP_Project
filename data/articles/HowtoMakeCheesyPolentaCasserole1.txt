 It is important that the oven is preheated before you bake the casserole. This will ensure the casserole bakes evenly and reaches the desired internal temperature., You will need a glass baking dish that measures 9 x 13 inches or 23 x 33 centimeters. Use cooking spray, olive oil, or butter to lightly oil the baking dish. Set aside., Add the polenta or corn grits, water, milk, salt, and pepper to a medium sized pot or saucepan. Cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, whisking frequently. When the polenta is ready, it will be creamy but still loose in its consistency. Once the polenta is done, remove it from the heat and set aside., Add the olive oil to a small saut√© pan. Place the pan on the stove and turn the burner to medium heat. Add the yellow onion to the pan and cook until the onion is soft. This should take about 5 minutes., Set aside half of the Parmesan. Then combine the remaining Parmesan with the Gorgonzola, green onions, cooked yellow onions, whisked eggs, and polenta mixture. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly combine the ingredients, and then pour into the prepared baking dish., After 30 minutes, remove the casserole from the oven. The casserole should be bubbling when you remove it from the oven., Make sure you sprinkle the cheese evenly across the top of the casserole, then put it back in the oven. The cheese should just be beginning to brown when you remove the casserole from the oven. This will take about 5 minutes., You will need to let the casserole cool before you serve it. Once the casserole cools, slice it with a knife. Serve with a side salad.Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

 If you have dry or damaged hair, you can replenish it while you sleep by applying a hair mask. Most will require you to wash your hair the next morning, so make sure you have time to do so.To keep the products in your hair, you may want to wrap it in a towel, a t-shirt, or even cellophane wrap.
These products might stain your pillowcase, so be sure to protect it with a towel if you're concerned about your wrap not staying put.;
, If you don't want to splurge on an expensive hair mask, you can make your own at home. Homemade hair masks are even messier than store-bought ones, so be sure to wrap your hair securely and give yourself plenty of time to wash it the next morning. You can find a variety of recipes online, but some common moisturizing ingredients include the following:Avocado
Mayonnaise
Olive oil
Raw egg
Shea butter
Aloe vera
Yogurt
Pumpkin
Banana
Coconut oil
Milk

, To wake up in the morning with beautiful waves, try pinning your hair up in small buns or braids before you go to sleep. You can also try wrapping your hair around a headband. In the morning, let your hair down, apply a bit of styling product if necessary, and you'll be ready to go.Depending on your hair type, you may want to apply a light hair spray, curling product, or even tanning oil to help it hold the wave.
 No matter what kind of hair you have, you can help keep it looking great between shampooing by tying it up in a silk scarf before bed.If you don't want to wear a scarf to bed, try sleeping on a silk pillowcase. It will create much less friction than a cotton pillowcase, which means less frizz.

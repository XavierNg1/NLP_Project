 The first thing you must do is decide how much you are willing to spend on a wedding. People have had beautiful weddings for as low as $2500 while others have spent over $30,000. Decide what you are financially able and willing to spend on your wedding.


Discuss with your fianc√© where the money is coming from. Are you going to save? Use loans? Ask your parents for help? This is a huge financial decision that must be agreed upon by both you and your significant other.;
, Before you can create a budget, you must find out how much wedding related expenses cost in your area. By doing your research, you make sure you budget appropriately. Otherwise, you might end up under budgeting (or even over budgeting) for certain items.Widen your net a bit when you are researching. If you live in a city, check some smaller towns close by. Many times, things will cost less outside of the city.
Make a table to keep track of your research. List the prices, the name of the business, and which part of the wedding it is.
 After doing your research, make a list of what you want for your wedding. What do you and your partner want? Is food and the venue more important than invitations and flowers? Decide what you want to spend 75% of your budget on. Then, decide what you want to spend very little on. Most importantly, decide what you can live without. If you don't care about chair decorations, wedding favors, and flowers on every table at the reception, cut those out. You'd be surprised how much money you'd save.Receptions can be extremely expensive, sometimes over 50% of your overall budget. When planning your budget, carefully plan for the reception so you don't spend all of your budget there.
For less expensive weddings, you will probably be looking for free venues and reception spaces. Most of the decorations will probably be DIY by either you or family members.
For example, for a $3000 wedding, the reception may cost $1100 (for food and utensils), alcohol and beverages another $600, a discounted photographer (who is a friend) $400, homemade invitations $175, flowers $50, decorations $300, and hired staff $375.Everything else is either free or DIY by the couple, families, and friends.
 When creating a budget for your wedding, decide what is important. One technique many brides and grooms on a budget follow is to choose the most important thing to splurge on. This is up to your personal preference - is there a caterer you really want? A dress that's calling your name? A photographer you just have to have? Choose this thing and start your budget there.Deciding to spend more money on one item can help you prioritize. Your wedding will still feel lavish because you're spending the money on what matters to you.
 If you are having a wedding on budget, you will not have a luxury wedding that should actually cost $20,000. That doesn't mean you can't have a beautiful, perfect wedding. Adjust your expectations for your budget. Trying to replicate an expensive wedding can end up in disaster for you.


This is why prioritizing is so important. By deciding what is important for you and your soon-to-be-spouse, you ensure that you make things count where it matters. In 20 years, you may not remember that you didn't serve alcohol, but you may always be disappointed you didn't spend money on a quality photographer.
 Planning a wedding yourself will save you loads of cash. The earlier you start planning, the less last minute decisions you will make, which can lead to bad decisions or unnecessary money being spent.


The earlier you start planning your wedding, the better deals you can find. Giving yourself plenty of time allows you to look for sales, discounts, and comparison shop., This is your and your soon-to-be-spouse's wedding - no one else's. Just because a blog, a magazine, or your great aunt said you need to do something at a wedding for it to be proper doesn't mean you have to do it. Just because someone said not hiring a DJ or the groom not wearing a tux is tacky doesn't mean it actually is. This is your special day. Skip unnecessary traditions. Decide what you and your soon-to-be-spouse want, and make that happen., Before you start budgeting for your wedding, decide what things are musts for your special day. Do you want a specific wedding dress or flowers from a florist? Do you want a 5-course meal? Do you want a fancy wedding photographer? Knowing what things are important to you and your soon-to-be-spouse will help you know where to put your money, and where to cut corners.
 This can be hard. How do you decide who you invite and who you don't? This can be especially difficult with regards to family and friends. Many people invite extended family and acquaintances to avoid drama. Remember the golden rule: This is your wedding. Invite those people who are most important to you and who you want to share the special day with.


A small 25 person wedding can easily morph into 100+ people once you start guilt adding people. Make a list of people you both care about and stick to it. Each person adds a significant amount of money when you factor in space and chair rental, invitations, thank you cards, and food.
If you have acquaintances and extended family you'd like to celebrate with, consider having a low-cost party after you return from your honeymoon. This party can be at your home, and you can keep the costs low.
 Wedding gowns can easily reach over $1000. When you add this cost to bridesmaid dresses, you can really rack up significant costs.

You might encourage your bridesmaids to buy cheaper dresses from department stores as long as they buy it in a certain color.

 As you plan your wedding, don't feel you have to do everything on your own. Ask family members and friends to add their input; they might have ideas for cutting corners you haven't thought about.


Getting ideas from family and friends might also help you find a surprise florist, photographer, or wedding cake baker. If you have talented family members and friends, consider asking them to do the wedding photography at a cheaper rate for a gift, or baking the cake for you.

Or if someone you know has a beautiful backyard, see if they'll let you use it for the special day., Did you go on your first date to the zoo or aquarium? Did you get engaged at the coffee shop you both frequent? Many places will rent out their business for weddings. Zoos, art galleries, and aquariums are beautiful, unique places to have a wedding.

Towns outside of the large cities also might have some gorgeous garden spaces or halls that would make perfect wedding and reception venues., By having a wedding earlier in the day, you eliminate the need for large dinners. Instead, you can serve brunch, a light lunch, or warm hors d'oeuvres instead of a large expensive dinner.

If your wedding has a theme, think about serving a signature cocktail.Or skip the alcohol all together. If you're not planning on drinking, don't spend that excess cost on something just for the guests.

If you are crafty, you can add accents, ribbon, and lace.
 Unless your dream wedding is one where you're surrounded by tons of flowers, think about limiting the flowers you use. Florists and flower arrangements can rack up the costs, so instead of spending hundreds or thousands on flowers, have your bridesmaids carry a single rose while you carry a small bouquet.If you're having a wedding during flower season, grow your own flowers to use in the ceremony, or get them from a garden of a friend or relative.
Skip extravagant flower centerpieces on the tables. Instead, opt for cheaper centerpieces.

, Do this by holding the taped ends and encircling your wrist. Make any adjustments needed (either subtracting or adding more beads).
 Lay the bracelet down, with the first spacer facing downward. Thread the strands (from top strand to bottom strand) through the second spacer. To tie off, bring together both ends of the threaded strand and tie into a single square knot. Repeat for each strand. At this stage, the bracelet should now have spaces between each strand.
 To secure the knot, add a dash of glue to each knot and allow to dry.
 It's now ready for wearing or giving as a gift.

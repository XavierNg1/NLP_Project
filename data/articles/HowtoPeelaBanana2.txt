 If it's too ripe, you may find yourself in the middle of a mushy disaster if you try to snap it.
 Make sure the banana is "smiling" or making a "U" shape, instead of frowning, or making the upside-down "U" shape. If it's pointed in the wrong direction, it'll be hard to snap it open. Think of it this way -- if the banana is "frowning," then you'll be frowning too, when you're unable to peel it.
 Use both hands to crisply snap the banana in half, like you're breaking a Kit-Kat bar. You'll need to apply some force, but not too much here. Remember, if the banana is too ripe, the skin will be softer, making it tougher to snap.
 Now, just peel the skin off each banana half and enjoy your tasty fruit. Do what you would do traditionally, by peeling the skin from the top down. The skin will most likely still be connected -- it's tough to truly snap it in half -- so peeling both halves may take some finesse. You can try to break the connecting skin first and then peel one half, eat it, and then repeat with the other half.

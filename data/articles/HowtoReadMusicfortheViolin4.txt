 Tablature, or “tab,” is a shorthand way of describing where and when to place a finger on a string to play a note. This format often does not tell you note duration, however. A tab has 4 lines, each representing one of the strings on the violin.The lines are designated, from the bottom to the top, as G, D, A, and E.
 A tab will tell you which finger to place where on a given note, and if you have the placements marked already, it will be easier to read a tab. These markings can be made with tape or a dab of paint or white-out directly on the fingerboard of the violin. Measure these placements from the nut, or the connector between the fingerboard and the pegbox and tuning pegs.1st fret: 1 and 7/16 inches from the nut

2nd fret: 2 and 21/32 inches from the nut

3rd fret: 3 and ¼ inches from the nut

4th fret: 4 and ¼ inches from the nut

, Each of your fingers (minus your thumb) on your left-hand will have a number that corresponds to a fret. The index finger is 1, middle finger is 2, ring finger is 3, and pinky finger is 4. A 0 denotes an open string (no finger pressing the string).
 Each note will be marked with a number on a particular string line in the tab. For example, if there is a 0 on the top line of the tab, this means you will play the E string as open (no finger pressing the string). If there is a 1 on the top line of the tab, you will press the first fret with your index finger on the E string. If there is a 3 on the third line up on the tab, you will press the third fret with your ring finger on the A string., There is a wide variety of songs written in tablature for the violin that are available online.

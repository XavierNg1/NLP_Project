 Since you want to avoid freezer burn you’ll want to make sure each lid is on well.
 These pies can be stored for up to six months in the freezer if well maintained.


Consider placing the jars in a large freezer bag for storage. Reduce the possibility of your pies being “infected” by freezer burn and place each jar (or two jars) in a large freezer bag before placing inside your freezer. Mark each pie with the type of pie and date made so you’ll know exactly what you are getting when its time to eat.

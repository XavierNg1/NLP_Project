 A herniated or slipped disc is the most common cause of sciatica.


The spinal column is made of multiple vertebrae, enfolding or containing nerves as a sort of protection.
Between each vertebrae there is a disc made of a fibrous jelly material that ensures the support of the vertebrae and fixes them in place.
If the outer part of the jelly ruptures, gel leaks out and escapes between the upper and lower vertebrae, and the disc slips.
This puts pressure on the nerves contained within the spinal column, and if it happens at the lumbar area of the lower back, it can press on the sciatic nerve's roots and cause sciatica.
This usually happens as a result of trauma, wrong movement, heavy lifting, or aging.;
, Spinal stenosis describes the narrowing of the spinal lumen, the are through which the spinal cord runs.


Especially if spinal stenosis occurs at the lumbar region, it can lead to irritation of the nerve.
This is often seen when there are changes or damage to ligaments of the spine, brought about by diseases such as Pagetâ€™s disease or old age, which can damage spinal structure.
 There are several other causes of sciatica that can be equally as painful. These include:


Infection, injury, or tumor formation at the lumbar part of the spine, which exerts pressure on the nerves.
Piriformis syndrome can cause sciatica, by pressing and irritating the nerve running through the piriformis muscle, a muscle located near the buttocks.
Pregnancy can cause sciatica, because of increased pressure on the sciatic nerve due to the additional weight of the fetus.

 In many instances you’re going to be terrified. But that’s okay. It’s a job interview. The interviewer knows you’re nervous but they want you to do well. They’ve invested a lot of company time in recruiting. They want you to shine. There is nothing worse for an interviewer to see a dazzling application form and call someone for interview only to watch them fall to pieces before their eyes. Again: they want you to do well. Remember this.;
, Treat it as such and revise. You want to be ahead of everyone else that applied. Your competition will not have prepared as meticulously as you have. This is your advantage.
 Focus on your breathing while you wait. This can be more useful than revision. If you can relax a little you’ll think on your feet.

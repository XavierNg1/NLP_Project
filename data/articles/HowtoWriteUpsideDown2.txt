 Most people find it much easier to write upside down English from right to left, instead of left to right.This results in texts that looks normal if you turn the page upside-down. However, if you're right-handed, the right-to-left method can lead to smudging or discomfort. You can try writing sideways or at an angle instead, but this is more difficult to learn., Teach yourself to write upside down the same way you learned to write regularly - by tracing the letters repeatedly and putting in lots of practice. Keep working on this, and you'll see your upside down penmanship improve.


Try practicing individual letters first. Once you have them down to muscle memory, start stringing them together in words and sentences. Move on to cursive if you're ambitious!

, Take writing upside down one step further with a small hand mirror. Hold the mirror at a 90-degree angle to the paper, facing you. Now try writing such that your words are legible in the mirror. Your text will be not only upside down, but backwards, and will require a mirror to read easily.

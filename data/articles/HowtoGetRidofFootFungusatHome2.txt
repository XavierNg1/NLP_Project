 There are a number of herbs that have potent antifungal properties. A great way to apply these is through herb-infused essential oils. Make sure you buy 100% pure essential oils to ensure that you are getting a quality product. There are many different kinds of oils that have antifungal qualities, so you can pick which one you like the best. These include:Tea tree oil
Black walnut oil
Neem oil
Myrrh oil

, After you pick the essential oil you like best, mix equal amounts of the essential oil with either olive oil, grapeseed oil, or aloe vera gel. The oils and the aloe vera gel have additional antifungal properties to help with the fungus. Then, massage the mixture onto the affected foot area or toenails. After you apply it, put on cotton socks and wash your hands very well. Repeat this application twice a day.


You can also use an essential oil infused foot soak. Add four to five drops of essential oils to two quarts of water. Let your feet soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat twice a day., Essential oils, like other medicines, are not going to work overnight. Fungal infections of the nails require you to use the essential oil salve for about six months. The nails grow slowly, which means you have to treat it until all of the affected nail is gone to ensure the infection does not return.


You will know it is working when a clear and normal looking nail begins to show at the base of the nail.

 Use this method if you know:

multiple speeds used to travel; and

the amount of time each of those speeds was traveled for.For example: For example: If Ben traveled 50 mph for 3 hours, 60 mph for 2 hours, and 70 mph for 1 hour, what was his average speed for the entire trip?


, The formula is S=dt{\displaystyle S={\frac {d}{t}}}, where S{\displaystyle S} equals the average speed, d{\displaystyle d} equals the total distance, and t{\displaystyle t} equals the total time., To do this, separately multiply each speed by each time period. This will give you the distance traveled for each section of the trip. Add up these distances. Substitute this sum for d{\displaystyle d} in the formula.

For example:50 mph for 3 hours = 50×3=150miles{\displaystyle 50\times 3=150{\text{miles}}}60 mph for 2 hours = 60×2=120miles{\displaystyle 60\times 2=120{\text{miles}}}70 mph for 1 hour = 70×1=70miles{\displaystyle 70\times 1=70{\text{miles}}}So, the total distance is 150+120+70=340miles.{\displaystyle 150+120+70=340{\text{miles}}.} So, your formula will look like this: S=340t{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{t}}}


, To do this, add up the times, usually hours, that were spent traveling. Substitute this value for t{\displaystyle t} in the formula.

For example, If Ben for 3 hours, 2 hours, and 1 hour, you would determine the total time by adding the three times together: 3+2+1=6{\displaystyle 3+2+1=6}. So, your formula will look like this: S=3406{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{6}}}.
 This will give you your average speed.

For example:S=3406{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{6}}}S=56.67{\displaystyle S=56.67}. So if Ben traveled 50 mph for 3 hours, 60 mph for 2 hours, and 70 mph for 1 hour, his average speed was about 57 mph.

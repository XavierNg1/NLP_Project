 Consider your local environment and biodiversity before adding a plant that sprawls with great ease.;
,, Choose soil that is well-drained and in a sunny position. The type of soil isn't really an issue provided it drains well. Evening primrose will grow in cool, warm, hot, arid, places; it's not too fussy.
, Do not over-water.
 Evening primrose "thrives on neglect" so it's fairly hard to lose it for lack of nurture. The real problem is keeping it under control because it self-seeds so readily. Be prepared to clean up any spread regularly.


Snap off the flower stems after the blooms fade and discard of them. Doing this will prevent the seeds from ripening and spreading.

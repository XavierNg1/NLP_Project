 Disconnect the unit from the water hose. Use a dry cloth to wipe the head of your sprinkler. Wipe it clean of any dirt, mud, silt, or other organic material.;
, Pay special attention to openings in which the water is forced through the sprinklers, and check for any obstructions. Rocks, mud, insects, and lawn clippings are often the culprits and are easily removed., Bend one end of a paper clip or piece of wire and carefully insert into the opening of the sprinkler head. Often this is enough to dislodge dirt and other debris that has built up in the small openings of an oscillating sprinkler.
 For more expensive irrigation systems, you may need to physically take apart the sprinkler head to do this. These systems often contain internal screens that you do not want to puncture by inserting an object directly into the sprinkler head.

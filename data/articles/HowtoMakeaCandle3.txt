 A makeshift DIY candle can be created using vegetable shortening, crayons for color, essential oil for aroma, and an old candle jar or mason jar.Be sure to remove the paper from the crayons before using them.
You will also need a double boiler and spoon.
 In a double boiler on medium heat, heat the shortening until it is completely liquid. Remove it from the heat.
 Chop your crayon of choice into small pieces. When the shortening is still hot, add the crayon and stir until the color has saturated the shortening. Allow the shortening to cool for about 10 minutes, then add your fragrance of choice.
 Prepare the wick like you did for the candle in a jar. When the shortening is ready, pour it into your jar, leaving about an inch of head space at the top. Let the shortening cool to room temperature and set.

 Badoo doesn’t allow instant deletion of any user account. It sends an account re-activation link via your registered email address, which expires after 30 days. You can use the account re-activation link from your email’s inbox to get back your Badoo account.


Log into the email client you used to register with Badoo. Search your messages for an email from Badoo.
Open the email, and you should see an account re-activation link included in it. Click on the link, and a new tab will open in your browser.;
, You have to set a new password for your reactivated Badoo account on the account reactivation page.


The email address will remain the same for your Badoo account.
 After finishing the password-setting process, go to Badoo’s login page.


Enter your email address and the new password in the required fields. Hit the “Sign me in” button below to log into your Badoo account.
Once you log into your Badoo account, it will be successfully activated, and you can use your profile to meet new people as you did before.

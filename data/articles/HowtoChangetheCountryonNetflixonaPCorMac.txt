 Connecting to a VPN allows you to disguise your real location from Netflix. For tips on choosing a VPN and installing its software, see Use a VPN.


When you’re setting up your VPN, select a country where the content you want to watch is viewable. For example, if you want to watch a movie that’s only available to people in the US, select “United States.”
Though many VPN applications are free, most will charge you to use advanced features, such as specifying your location.;
, The steps vary by operating system. See Set Up a VPN on Windows 10 if you’re using Windows 10 or 8.1, or Set Up a VPN on a Mac if you’re using macOS.
 You can now view content that’s only available in the country configured in your VPN settings.


When you browse Netflix in a country other than the US, the address bar adds that country’s abbreviation to the end of the URL. For example, if you browse from the Philippines, the URL in the address bar appears as https://www.netflix.com/ph.
If you set your VPN to a US location, you won’t see another country code after the URL. So, even if you’re in the Philippines, the address will read https://www.netflix.com.

 Remove the top of the pumpkin and scoop out the stringy insides and seeds.






;
, Cut the remaining pumpkin shell into squares or slices. Smaller squares and slices will cook more quickly.










Boiling method: Boil the squares in a saucepan over medium heat, uncovered, until they're soft. Cook the pieces longer for a heartier texture and more intense flavor in your pie. Cool and remove the skin if you are peeling during this step.
Oven method: Heat your oven to 275-300ºF (135-149ºC). Roast the pumpkin in a shallow pan until it's tender when you poke it with a fork. Roasting caramelizes the pumpkin meat and preserves nutrients that could be removed by boiling.
, Add the milk, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Blend the ingredients to form a thick filling for your pie.
 Empty 1 cup of filling into each bowl.
 Blend the eggs in with a whisk. Avoid using an electric mixer; this could give your pie filling a gluey texture. 







, Spray 2 pie pans with nonstick cooking spray.
 Use your hands to press the crusts into the pan. As directed, poke bottom of pie crusts with fork, to ventilate. Flute the edges with a fork.
 Spread the filling over the crust using the back of a spoon, and sprinkle the top with cinnamon.
 Check on your pies after 30 minutes to make sure that they don't burn. If your pie crust edges are browned before your filling is done, wrap the edges with aluminum foil and continue to bake the pies.
 Let them cool at room temperature before serving them with some whipped cream and a small amount of fresh grated nutmeg.

 Your wool, suede, or leather coat should be professionally cleaned before packing it up for the season. While this can get expensive if you have a number of natural fiber coats, it’s a necessary step in preserving their quality and extending their lifespan. Perfume, food, and even imperceptible stains, for example, can discolor leather or suede and cause irreversible damage.Use leather conditioner before storage to keep your leather jacket from drying out while it’s put away. Always test out a conditioning product on an inconspicuous spot first, like under an arm.
 Believe it or not, freezing your leather overnight is actually a good way to freshen up your leather. It’ll kill bacteria and tiny insects, and get rid of odors. It’s also great for wools and cashmere for the same reasons, and you’ll be far less like to have any little bugs eating your fabrics while they’re stored away.Use an appropriately sized bag to cover up your garment.
Using plastic is okay here: there’s a difference between keeping an item in plastic for a matter of hours versus storing it sealed in plastic for months.

Cloth bags will prevent mold and mildew while letting natural materials breath.No wire hangers, Mommie Dearest: use only wood. Thick plastic hangers are a fair substitute if wood hangers aren’t available.
Try to find a closet that’s about 65 to 68 degrees, low in humidity, and away from any heat ducts. If leather gets too hot, it could crack. Heat and humidity aren’t good for other natural fibers, either.

View Source with Internet Explorer or Safari: Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) in the browser window somewhere outside of the Flash game and select "View Source" from the drop down list.
View Page Info with Firefox. Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) in the browser window somewhere outside of the Flash game and select "View Page Info" from the drop down list. Click the “Media” tab to display URLs referenced in the page. To sort this list by type of file, click the word “Type” above the list.
 Click on the window that comes up and press Ctrl+F to search (⌘ Cmd+F on a Mac) and type .swf. Your game should be the first or second .swf file to show up in the search results, depending on the website.


In Firefox, you’ll have to scroll through the list and look for the .swf file that contains the name of your game.
 Double-click on the URL of the .swf file and copy it by right-clicking (Control+click on a Mac) and selecting “Copy” from the menu. If you’re using Firefox, just click on the file and select “Save As.”


If the .swf file does not have a domain name before it (i.e., it says “/strategygames/crimson-room.swf” instead of www.addictinggames.com/strategygames/crimson-room.swf -- but replace the domain name with the one which hosts your favorite game), then type the domain name before the path to the .swf. file before copying the URL.
 Press Ctrl+S (⌘ Cmd+S on a Mac) and choose a save location you’ll remember.
 Navigate to the .swf file that you saved and open by double-clicking. The game will launch in your web browser, but because you’re running it right from your computer, you won’t need to connect to the internet.

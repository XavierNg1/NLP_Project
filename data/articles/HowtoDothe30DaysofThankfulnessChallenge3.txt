 Try to do things that will motivate you to post about your gratitude. Participate in activities that relieve stress, make you happy, or fill you with awe. These things will not only inspire you to keep posting, they will also give you new material for posts.


Try to pursue your hobbies and your passions during your challenge.
 If the thought of posting for 30 days seems a little daunting, take it one day at time. Focus on writing each day’s post and do not concern yourself with what you will post tomorrow. You may find that focusing on achieving a small goal each day makes it easier to complete the bigger challenge.Creating a list of things that you are thankful for before the challenge begins will also help mitigate some of this stress.
 Finding others who are participating in the challenge will help you stick with the challenge. Using the hashtag, chat with other people who are participating in the challenge. Give them encouragement about their gratitude and share your experiences. Try to bond with others over your common experiences of friends, family and thankfulness.Remember to stay positive and try not to be critical or judgmental of other people’s posts. Starting a flame war with someone about the thankfulness challenge will not make you feel good about yourself or the experience.
 If you do not get the response that you expected, do not give up on the challenge. The goal is for you to focus on the things in your life that you appreciate. If you do not get many likes, shares, or retweets, try not to get discouraged. Although you are sharing with other people, the emphasis should be on your emotions and your appreciation of the things in your life.

 Be ready! Hope you hid your chest well, too, because protections disappear as the walls fall. You can either go out and join the fight against other Withers, or stay behind and defend your Wither.
 Dash to it and defend it.
 You will receive alerts in the chat when it is ready. Follow the instructions to activate it. Tornado (on Shaman) can be used to destroy other teams' blockades, for example.
 Now's your chance! Start fighting those Withers! And remember to watch out for maxed classes because they can destroy you.

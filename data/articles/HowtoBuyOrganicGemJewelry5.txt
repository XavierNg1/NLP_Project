 Elephant tusks have been the most common source of ivory throughout the gemstone's history. Due to the manner in which elephants are illegally poached for their tusks, however, the trade of new, contemporary elephant ivory is internationally banned. Typically speaking, though, you can still buy old elephant ivory that is decades or centuries old. You can also buy mammoth ivory, which is, perhaps, the most human form of ivory in existence since it comes from the tusks of mammoths that died of natural causes over 10,000 years ago.
 Since new ivory is banned, your best chances at finding ivory jewelry come by shopping in antique malls and online. Make sure that the merchant is certified and that no complaints have been filed against the shop.
 Ivory used in jewelry is off-white in color and usually polished until it becomes slightly glossy. The ivory is usually carved into intricate designs, from flowers to cameos, but smooth, simple ivory bangle bracelets are also common.

 Follow your usual routine for washing your hair. Add conditioner and rinse it out. Use a towel to dry your hair so that it is just damp.
 Foam mousse will add texture and volume to straight hair, helping to hold the shape of wavy hair.








Dispense a quarter-sized amount into the palm of your hand. Gently work it through all of your hair. If you have really long hair, you might want to use more. If you have pretty short hair, start with a smaller amount.
 A diffuser is an attachment to a hair dryer. It is round with prongs that come out of one end. The diffuser will reduce the velocity of the air coming from your hair dryer, which leaves your hair less frizzy. It will also help with wave and curl formation., Use a medium to cool setting on your hair dryer. It’s best to use the cool setting, as this temperature will “set” your hair better.
Tilt your head upside down or sideways. Place sections of your hair into the diffuser and move the diffuser up towards your scalp. Let your hair get about 80 to 90% dry.
Stand upright and finish drying your hair with the diffuser.
 Instead of a diffuser, you can use a funnel system attachment.This attaches directly onto the mouth of your hair dryer.


Place your hair through the funnel and turn on your hair dryer to a cool setting.
 After your hair is dry, turn off your hairdryer and scrunch your hair with your hands. This will give your hair a little bit more wave to it.
 To set your look, spray hairspray over your hair. Hold the container of hairspray a few inches from your head and spritz all over.

Have a talk with your spouse, partner or travel companions about which activities you want to do with the kids. These activities might include swimming in the pool, taking part in excursions at your ports of call and attending evening shows.
Allow yourself some non-child time too. Decide when you will take advantage of babysitting services and kids programs so that you can have some adult time.
 Small children might be a little nervous, so talk to them about what they will be doing and get them excited.
, Whether you want to feed stingrays or swim with dolphins, give your kids an experience they will never forget.
 Putting your children in charge of the camera will give them a project, and help you preserve some of the best memories of your trip.

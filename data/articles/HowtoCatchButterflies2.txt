 If you need to do so, you can handle the butterfly. Simply grab it lightly just above the body with the wings folded together. Unless the butterfly is very delicate, it won't be harmed by this operation. Monarchs, for instance, are sturdy. You can also turn it over to make it calm down., You can store a butterfly in a glassine envelope, which is a stamp or coin envelope. These envelopes are semi-clear, made of a waxy paper. You can also simply use a small triangular envelope.Make sure to mark any information you need on the outside of the envelope in permanent ink.
You may want to use a specimen number or note the date, time, and area you found the specimen. You may also want to note if the specimen was with a partner., If you are going to keep the butterfly alive, you need to transfer it to a cage when you get home. Generally, the best cages for butterflies have netting or screens on the outside. You'll need to provide nectar or sugar water appropriate for the butterfly.Glass or plastic isn't as good because the butterfly can't walk on it.
Some butterflies won't eat at all. However, most eat nectar or sugar water., You can kill the butterfly in the net so it won't damage itself. Simply squeeze the middle body segment (the thorax) hard between your fingers until the butterfly stops struggling. Then you can slip it in an envelope for later.

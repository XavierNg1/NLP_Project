 Before you start your channel, try to pick an animal you know you'll stick with. Play around with patterns, colors, and whatever items interest you. Once you've decided how you want to look, move on to the next step, As much as you may dislike it, people are more likely to respect you if you have a lot of rare items and money. Work hard to get all the Rares on Rare Item Mondays, and trade those up for bigger and better items. Who knows- that black long may even fit perfectly into your new look! You'll also need to play lots of minigames, to get gems. If you get tired of Overflow, try recycling items you never use. Once you're fairly rare, and have around 20,000 gems, you're ready for the next step., Now that you have an awesome username, a great look, and tons of rares and money, it's time to go on to YouTube!

Before you know it, 10,000 subs will seem like nothing.

Keep your hand in one place.
Pause noticeably between individual words.
Avoid long nails or excessive jewelry, as it can be distracting to someone reading your hands.
When finger-spelling an acronym, move each letter in a small circle to let the reader know that they should not be read together as one word.
Don't bounce your hand between letters, unless there are two letters, in which case the bounce indicates the repetition of the signed letter (dragging the letter slightly to the side can also indicate repetition). Bouncing between every individual letter can make your finger-spelling difficult to understand. To prevent this from happening, hold your wrist with your free hand to prevent it from moving up and down when you practice. After a while, you'll get used to keeping your hand still without thinking about it.
Face your palm forward, except when you're signing the letters "G", "H" "C" and "O"(in which case the palm should face sideways).
Keep your finger-spelling hand at shoulder height.
Keep a consistent pace. Don't try to rush through finger-spelling. The more important thing is to sign each letter at a consistent rhythm (but without bouncing!) so that the reader can easily distinguish a pause. It's better to go slow and steady than to rush and suddenly pause when you can't remember a sign--the reader may misinterpret this as the beginning of a new word.

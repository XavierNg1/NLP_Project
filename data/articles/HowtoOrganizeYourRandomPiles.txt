 This will help to motivate you to stick with the cleaning up job. Choose music that you like and that has a good beat to it.
 Determine what you have left to pile up, such as clothing, books, papers, rubbish, bits and pieces, and the like.

Check the corners of your room for piles.
Check your desk and any chairs for piles.
Check the floor for piles.
Check the tops of cupboards, wardrobes, shelving, etc., for piles.
Check that closet. It's a hiding spot for random piles.
 Sort them into non-random piles to begin with, placing like with like. Put the clothes together, the stationery together, the books together, and so forth. Once you have these piles, it'll be easier to discard items, then put the rest back where they should be., As you restore the items to their proper places, such as drawers, hangers, boxes, pencil holders, and so forth, be sure to discard the items that you no longer want or that are just rubbish. Donate items that are still in good condition, so that someone else may benefit from them., If you don't have standard places to return some of the items to, this is likely to be the cause behind the random piles. If this is the case, make new storage areas for the items that don't yet have a standard home in the room. You can purchase baskets, boxes, file holders, and similar items, to hold your items neatly. It can also be helpful to use containers that have labels, making it easy for you to find things quickly.

Put the items without a place into the new storage items. Place the storage item somewhere neat in the room.
 This will take a conscious effort on your behalf but it's worth it to save you from having a big cleaning-out exercise every now and then. Also, it's much easier to find your things when you know where to look.

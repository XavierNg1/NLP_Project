 If you want to attract better men, you can’t repeat the mistakes of your past relationships. Instead of mourning over the time you wasted on less amazing men, take a lesson from it. If you want a different type of man, you have to seek out a different type of man.


If you never had good luck meeting good men at bars, stop trying to meet men at bars. If you’ve all of your past failed relationships are with bad boys, don’t date bad boys.
 When your intuition says to run, don’t ignore it. When you meet the right man, you shouldn’t feel troubled or apprehensive. Don’t ignore your instinct. Every day that you waste with the wrong man is a day that you miss out meeting a better one. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and walk away., This is a no-brainer and is absolutely non-negotiable. Good men will never, under any circumstance, pressure you into doing something. In fact, the best kind of men will admire the fact that you know your own boundaries and self-worth and will speak up when you don’t feel right about something.If you find yourself having to repeatedly say “no,” he is not the kind of man you want. Move along, and find yourself a better man!

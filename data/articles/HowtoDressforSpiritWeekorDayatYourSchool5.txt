 One option is to simply roll out of bed and show up at school. After all, it's pajama day, and you can wear what you wore to bed. That way, you can get extra sleep and still show your school spirit!Make sure it's school appropriate. For instance, don't wear pajamas with a bunch of holes in it.
Make sure your pajamas still follow the dress code.
 Another option is to wear a different pair of pajamas to bed, then get up and put on your favorite pajamas. That way, your pajamas are fresh and clean for school, not all wrinkled.For instance, you could wear a fun pair of plaid pajamas.
Another option is a set of character pajamas.
 If you don't have any you like, you can also get a new pair for the occasion. Silly and fun is best for something like Pajama Day, so if yours are all boring, consider splurging on something new. You could even hit the thrift store for a more budget-friendly option.For instance, you could get a silly pair of footy pajamas, even if you're a teenager. It's all in good fun.
Alternatively, pick out a pair with crazy fun stripes or polka dots.
 Once again, you can just roll out of bed and go to school as is. It's your bed hair, after all! Alternatively, you can accentuate the bed hair by spiking it up all over the place with gel or putting it up in a messy ponytail or bun., If your slippers are school-appropriate, slip them on.Just make sure they provide good enough protection for you to wear all day, especially if it's icy out or very hot. You may want to take a pair of shoes to change into when you get outside.


Try to wear the most outrageous slippers you have, such as monster feet or character slippers.
You can also match your slippers to your pajamas.

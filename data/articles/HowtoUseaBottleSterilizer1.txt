 Most bottle sterilizers require the addition of about 7 oz. (200 ml) of water, but this amount can vary depending on the manufacturer. Too little water may not sterilize the bottles properly, but too much could cause the basin to overflow.;
, Place one bottle upside-down on each prong. Do not attempt to load more bottles into the sterilizer than there are prongs. Most only have room for about six bottles, so if you have more than that, you will need to clean the bottles in batches.
 These other pieces should be spaced apart evenly enough so that they do not touch. If the sterilizer has lower prongs, space them in between these prongs to hold them in place.
 In order to clean the bottles, the sterilizer will need to generate steam. The steam needs to be contained in order to have the desired effect.
 It should automatically begin heating the bottles to 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), creating enough steam to kill off any bacteria. For most electric steam sterilizers, the process takes about 10 minutes.
 Do not attempt to remove them until after the sterilizer finishes its cooling cycle. Dry the bottles with a clean dish towel or allow them to air dry.

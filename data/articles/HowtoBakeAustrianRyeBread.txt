,,, After about 10 to 15 minutes, or until you are free to add it to the bowl, little by little add the flour and yeast water. Add sufficient flour and yeast water until the dough cleans the bowl on mixing it with a mixer.
 Mix until it is constant in structure and there are no riffs and air bubbles in the dough.
 The baking paper will ensure that the bread does not stick to the metal sheet.
 Cover the bowl with a tea towel for 1 or 2 hours. Watch as the dough rises and the grooves you put on the dough with a knife start opening.
 Put the dough in for ten minutes.
 Let it bake for another 40 minutes.
 Allow to cool before slicing, although it's okay to enjoy it warm too.
 Add some slices of meat or tomatoes, some salad and a bit of your favorite spread. Delicious!

 Each painting requires its own special attention to avoid damaging it in any way. Avoid stacking paintings on top of each other when moving or storing them, as this can easily damage them and reduce their value.If a painting is too large for you to move yourself, have a friend help.
Never lean your painting against a sharp object, or something that could scratch it.
 If you are transporting a painting, wash your hands and avoid touching the surface of the art.Use both hands and lift the painting by the frame with your hands securely centered on each side of the frame.


The natural oils in your hands can leave fingerprints and damage a painting's value., Hanging jewelry or wearing other sharp stones could potentially scratch or poke the surface of your painting.Poking the backside of a canvass can create a bulge that will create spider-web cracks along the surface of your art., A faulty frame could cause the painting to fall out of your hands and get damaged. Frame keys are small triangular wedges that regulate the dimensions of the stretcher frame and can fall out over time. Make sure to replace these by inserting new ones if they fall out.You can buy framing keys at most art stores.
You can have your art re-framed by a conservator, with brass mending plates and screws, for extra security and longevity.

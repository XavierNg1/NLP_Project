 Mix olive oil and a few tablespoons of salt in a small dish. Pour the mixture into the cast iron cookware. Use a paper towel or other cloth to scrub the salt into the cast iron, focusing on the areas with caked-on food. Continue until the food remnants have all been loosened, and dump them in the trash.
 Take a second paper towel or cloth, dip it in oil, and wipe the cast iron until it is clean.
 Set the cast iron cookware in the oven. Turn the oven to the self-cleaning setting, and let it run its course.









Before trying this method, be aware that this method will require re-seasoning the cast iron.
The cookware will emerge covered with ash and a layer of rust. Don't use it until you've followed the instructions for cleaning rusty cast iron cookware.

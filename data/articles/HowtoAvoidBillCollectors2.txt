 There is no law that says you have to communicate with debt collectors. In fact, according to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), debt collectors have rules that they have to follow when contacting you. A cease and desist letter sent through the mail, will force them to stop calling you. Keep in mind that the letter only applies to the debt collector, not the actual creditor.A cease and desist letter is simpler than you might think. All it has to say is that you wish for the collector to stop contacting you. If you wan't them to stop contacting you at work, for example, then it should say that. A useful template can be found here.
Send the letter through certified mail to be sure that the collections agency has received it.
 If you and the collections agency cannot come to an agreement, you may find yourself being served with a notice of lawsuit. You will need an attorney who specializes in consumer law to represent you in court. The National Association of Consumer Advocates can help you find a qualified lawyer. Collectors tend to go for easy targets, meaning people without attorneys. If they see you are prepared to mount a defense, they may drop the suit.Collectors don't always act ethically and may file a lawsuit based on very little evidence of money owed. This means that a case may be very weak and quickly dismissed in court, provided you have a competent lawyer.
 That's right, you can sue the debt collectors for a cash payout. Collectors have to obey laws when pursuing payments of debt. They sometimes break those laws, either maliciously or not. If you have recorded proof of a law being broken, you can take them to court. The agency will likely settle for a cash payout instead of going to trial.Violations of the law include misrepresenting the amount of debt owed, failure to investigate claims that credit files have inaccurate information, or other statutes which can vary by state.

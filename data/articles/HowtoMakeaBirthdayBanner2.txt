 The best paper to use for this is cardstock. You can find it in the scrapbook section of an arts and crafts store. It comes in many different colors. You can also use construction paper, but it will not be as bright and it will not be as durable.;
, You should be able to fit several letters onto one page. Make sure that the letters are several inches high; you want to be able to read the banner easily from across the room.


Try to use a pencil while tracing so that you can erase the lines later.
You can also print the letter outlines out onto the paper. If you are using cardstock, feed one sheet at a time through your printer.
 You can use scissors or a sharp craft knife. Be sure to cut just inside the lines you made when tracing the letter. If you see any pencil marks, be sure to erase them.
 The string needs to be long enough to fit all of the letters, plus an additional 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) at each end. This will allow you to hang the banner.
 They can be as close together or as far apart as you like. They will hang better, however, if you include some space between each letter.
 Flip the letters over. Draw a thin line of glue along the top edge of each letter. Press the string down into the glue.


You can also use clear tape to stick the string to the back of the letters if you are short on time.
 Depending on the type of glue you used, this can take anywhere from a few hours to a whole day.

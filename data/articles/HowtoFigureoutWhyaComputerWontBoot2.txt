In case the screen displays the “Windows” logo and asks you to choose an option for booting, read the directions carefully and make your choice.
 Press F8 as your device reboots. This will take you to Safe Mode.
 Uninstall any new software or driver that you installed or updated recently. This may automatically resolve the issue.
 Look for the root of the issue. In case you have overclocked, set your FSB and vCore down to stock levels.


Once you are done, click on “Exit and save changes”.
 Unscrew only the screws at the back, which are located on the very outer rim.


Keep touching the metal part of the case, before you delve into your computer. This helps prevent electrostatic shock, which could potentially harm your system.



Take out the memory card, graphics card and wires attached to the CPU (Central Processing Unit) pins.
Remove the battery. This is located near the bottom of the motherboard. It is usually housed inside its own little holster, with a lever on one end.
Wait a couple of minutes.
Then reconnect each component.
 Then restart it.


Perform steps 7 and 8 only if you are comfortable working with computers. Otherwise you could end up complicating matters further.
 In case you are not very comfortable working with PCs; or if all the above-mentioned steps failed; take your system to a computer repair shop. Describe the issue as best as you can and let them handle the problem.

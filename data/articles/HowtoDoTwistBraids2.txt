 Make sure your hair is washed, conditioned, and dry. If it is curly, straightening it a bit might make this look easier to achieve. Make a part in your hair at the place where you want the braid to start.


Layered hair can make doing a twist crown braid a difficult proposition. It’s worth a shot, but you may find you have trouble getting your hair to stay put., If you want the braid to go left, take a section of hair starting at the left of your part, and vice versa. Split this section in two, so that you have one section on your hairline, and the other just behind it.
 Hold the back section of hair still. Bring the front section behind it, and then back around to the front. Keep the back section taut, and grip both firmly.
 Separate another bit of hair from the hairline, and make it part of the front section. Keep a good grip on it to make sure the two sections stay together.The section of hair you separate from your hairline should be about the same size as the section you’re incorporating it into.
 Loop the back section behind the front section, and twist it around to hang in front. Separate the next bit of hair from your hairline, and incorporate it into this section.


Make sure always to twist each section in the same direction.
 Incorporate a new piece of hair from your hairline into the section currently hanging in front, then twist the back section around it to hang in front. Add more hair to this new front section, and repeat the twisting motion. Continue to follow your hairline until the twist crown braid reaches your desired length, and then use a bobby pin to secure it in place.You can pin the braid at your temple, or continue all the way down to the nape of your neck for a more regal look.

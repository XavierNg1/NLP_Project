 Before splinting, check the injured limb and document any damage to the patient’s skin or surrounding area. Most importantly, check their nerves and blood vessels for injury – you will need to compare this after splinting to make sure the splint is not compromising blood flow, nerve conduction, or swelling.This assessment will also help you to determine whether a splint vs. a cast is appropriate.Let the patient know that they should seek immediate medical attention if they experience any tingling, loss of sensation, increased pain, delayed capillary refill, dusky appearance to skin, or severe swelling.
 Different splint methods are used for different injuries. This is not a comprehensive list, so be sure to study or consult a trained professional to establish the correct type and posture for splinting. Generally, consider these guidelines:


Use an ulnar gutter splint for Boxer’s fractures (fracture of the distal 5th metacarpal) and other injuries to the 4th and 5th fingers and metacarpals.Use a sugar tong splint for fractures of the humerus.Use a long-arm posterior splint for elbow injuries.
Short-arm splints may suffice for distal forearm and wrist injuries.Use a thumb spica splint for thumb injuries.Splinting and taping one finger to another, one leg to another, or an arm to the torso can effectively immobilize a limb.
 Plaster splint material can produce dust, and water may drip from the material onto the patient. If time and urgency allow, drape the patient’s clothes with a sheet, towel, or cloth to protect their clothing.

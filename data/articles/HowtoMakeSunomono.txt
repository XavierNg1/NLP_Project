 Mix one part mirin (a sweet rice wine), one part rice vinegar, and one part dashi (traditional fish and seaweed soup stock). If you don't have dashi, you can use water.;
, Slice cucumbers using a mandolin or knife in thin rounds.
 Sprinkle a generous amount of salt on the cut cucumbers and mix thoroughly. Marinating the cucumbers in salt and water will soften them.
 While waiting for the salt to seep into the cucumbers, place the dry wakame in a bowl with hot water for few minutes. This will hydrate it, making it expand in the process. When fully hydrated, squeeze away the excess water.
 When the cucumber has marinated, wash the slices in cool water and squeeze out the excess water.
 Mix the cucumber and wakame with the sauce and add a garnish of sesame seeds and sliced lemon.

 In pencil, draw a few curves to guide the twist of the trunk.;
, Sketch loosely and go over lines until you are happy with the shape.
 Olive trees have fairly rounded, regular foliage, so go with soft curves. Also sketch some rocks for the roots to grow around.
 Olive trees have long, pointed leaves, so use lots of pointed, angular strokes rather than lines or curves. Draw some groups of little lines within the shape too.
 Because the bark is knobbly, there's no need to be precise â€“ let your lines go wobbly!

, You can also add color if you want to!

 If you do not have a stand, put her between your legs.;
, Take a spray bottle filled with water, and lightly spray each section of hair.
 Brush hair in sections. Begin brushing at the ends of the hair. Work the brush up to the roots. Once the tangles are out, you can run the brush down the hair from roots to ends. Repeat on each section.
 Comb the hair from the ends to the roots. Repeat on each section. Once all tangles are eliminated, divide the hair into smaller sections. Take one section and twirl it around your finger. After you do that with each section, her hair should look great!

,, Undress the doll. Put a hand towel over her cloth body, and place a washcloth over her face to keep her dry. Make certain not to let water get in the doll's eyes because they can rust. The hand towel and washcloth should remain in place throughout the washing process.
 Carefully place the doll's hair under the running water to wet her hair. (The doll should be face up to prevent water running into her eyes.)

 Do not wring or rub the hair.
 Leave it to air dry overnight.
 Lightly dust the doll off with a dry washcloth.
 Wet a clean washcloth. Wring the cloth until it is not dripping. Carefully wipe the doll's face, arms and legs with the damp cloth until clean. Some stains such as ink may take longer to remove. Be sure to rub gently.
 Spot clean any dirt marks off the doll's cloth body.
 Wet a clean cloth and wring out the excess water. Wipe away any soap residue

, Stand the doll up to air dry for a few hours before dressing her to ensure there is no trace of moisture.
 Your or your child's AG doll will be as good as new, all fixed up, supreme, beautiful, fancy, and the best of all best!

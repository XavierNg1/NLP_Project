 The bulk of the job consists of adjusting and repairing things. You should have a mechanical aptitude if you wish to pursue this line of work.
 Since fixing cars is what you’ll be spending most of your time doing as an auto body repair tech, you should get some hands-on practice before making a career of it.If you have dents or damage to your car, try to fix it using repair manuals and guides. You could also approach a family member or friend and explain that you’d like to get some experience in auto repair to help you prepare for your future career.
 You should be able to work on a number of collision repair duties at the same time or on the same day. For instance, you might start by installing a new door on a damaged car, then replace a dented fender on another car, then sand and buff repaired surfaces.
 The location you work will be quite noisy due to the constant buzz of machinery.If you prefer working outdoors or in a more contemplative environment, you might want to look elsewhere for work.


Besides the irritating noise, you should also be prepared to deal with dust and fumes caused by painting or sanding. Be sure to follow all relevant health and safety protocols when painting or sanding, since the debris can cause respiratory issues.
 You will also have to manipulate heavy auto parts and equipment. If you do not wish to engage in strenuous activity, becoming an auto body repair tech might not be right for you.
 For instance, in order for a technician to restore a unibody vehicle to its original form, you must be able to follow instructions and diagrams, either in print form or digitally, and make precise measurements to ensure accurate placement of vehicle body sections relative to one another.


Technicians must be detail oriented.
Strong skills in geometry and art might help.

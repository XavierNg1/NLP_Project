 The low setting will lessen the chance of scorching the carpet and it's important that there's no steam. This way the moisture won't melt the wax back into the carpet. Practice ironing on an old shirt if you've never used one before. This will ensure you do not scorch your carpet.
If you donâ€™t have an iron, you can use a hair dryer., Barriers should be white cloths, white paper towels, cardboard, or paper bags.Don't use paper bags or cardboard with print on them. The ink may transfer and stain the carpet.
 The barrier should be clean and should cover the entire stain.
 Gently press the preheated iron over your barrier of choice and begin moving the iron in a circular motion. The wax underneath the barrier will begin to melt and transfer itself to the barrier.Never let the iron sit still for long while face down as it may burn the carpet.
 This may need to be done several times depending on how much wax has been spilt.


Have extra cloths, towels, cardboard, or paper bags on hand.
Use a clean barrier each time until all the wax has been completely transferred and none remains on the carpet.
 Baby oil or vegetable oil will dissolve left over wax residue that you can then blot up with a paper towel.

 For example, if you're trying to decompose 27, the largest power of 2 that's closest to 27 would be 24, or 16.;
, If you continue the above example, you would subtract 16 from 27, and get 11.
 If you continue the above example, you would find that 23, or 8, is the largest power of 2 smaller than 11. Subtract it from 11, which will result in 3.
 If you continue the above example, you would:


Find the largest power of 2 closest to 3, which is 21 or 2, and subtract it from 3, resulting in 1.
Find the largest power of 2 closest to 1, which is 20 or 1, and subtract it from 1, resulting in 0. Stop here, because you've reached 0.

 Many grocery chains also have a floral section, and depending on the store, you might find good options there. However, if you want the help of the actual florist, it may pay to go to a real flower shop.;
, Look for flowers and bouquets that seem fresh and in good condition, as well as meeting your color and type requirements.
 A florist can generally put together a beautiful bunch of flowers for you; if you're lost, just ask for their input and they can help you come up with something your mom will love!

, Most florists will accept a wide range of payment forms. They may also offer fancy vases and other small gift items to go along with your purchase, if you'd like to pay extra for those and up the ante on your gift.
 If you're taking the bouquet to your mom in person, just be sure to be gentle on the bunch in the meantime, and ideally deliver them quickly. You don't want the flowers to be wilted or battered by the time you get to her!

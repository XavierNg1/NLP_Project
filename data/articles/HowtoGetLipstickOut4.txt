 Lipstick can stain hard surfaces such as acrylic plastic, glass, porcelain dishes, stainless steel, vinyl, and more. Once you see the stain, get a cloth, dish soap, and ammonia.
 Use warm, sudsy water to wet your dish cloth. Wipe over your stain in small, circular motions. After 5-10 minutes, rinse well and wipe dry.
 If the stain remains, add a few drops of ammonia to your cloth. Dampen your cloth once again with sudsy water and scrub.
 Use a clean cloth to rinse and wipe clean. It will pick up any remaining lipstick from your hard surface.

 Carbon monoxide can accumulate when the ventilation in your house isn’t working properly. Look for air conditioning vents and check for dust and other debris building up in the cracks.


You don’t need to clean the vents unless you see noticeable accumulation of debris. At least once a year, remove the vent cover and look for any kind of large debris blockage behind the vent.When you do clean them, remove the vent cover with a screw driver. Put the vent cover under some running water to remove dust and then wipe it down with a paper towel. Dry it with another paper towel before placing it back on the vent., Clogged chimneys are one of the primary causes of CO accumulation. Even if you only use your fireplace once or twice a year, you’ll need to get the chimney cleaned once per year. If you use your fireplace at least once a week, have it cleaned every 4 months.You won’t be able to adequately clean a chimney without the proper tools. Unless you own an extended scrubber and know how to use it, hire a professional.It’s also a good idea to remove noticeable soot from the fireplace itself to prevent CO accumulation. Use a heavy-duty cleaner like ammonia to spray down the inside of the fireplace and then scrub it with an abrasive scrubber. If you’re using a corrosive chemical, purchase a surgical mask to wear while you’re cleaning., Cooking devices, especially ovens, can also emit CO. If you use it regularly, check your oven for soot buildup at least every other week and clean it with ammonia and an abrasive scrubber when it’s dirty.If you notice that soot is building up easily, you may want to have an electrician look at the oven.Smaller devices like toaster ovens can also emit harmful amounts of CO. Check for soot around the heating filament and clean it if necessary., If you are a tobacco smoker, smoke outside. Continuous and prolonged smoking indoors, combined with poor ventilation or other risk factors, can lead to a serious CO accumulation.

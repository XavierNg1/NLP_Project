 Select the cup size you typically use so you can re-purpose the cup corset a number of times.


Measure your fabric and felt. Leave approximately 1” gap in the fabric and felt length. You will want a small gap so you can harness/tie corset together.;
, Be sure you line up the felt and fabric so both materials are of equal size.
 Add several dabs on the felt and then match up the fabric so they become one piece. Hold in place (don’t squeeze so that glue oozes out of the fabric) and allow time for the glue to dry.
 Wrap the fabric around the cup so you can see how it will look when you are finished.


Using your fabric pencil, mark off 3 places on each end of the fabric where you will add holes (you will have a total of 6).
 Add a little muscle in your punch as you will need to punch through 2 pieces of joined fabric.
 You will be threading the ribbon through the punched holes and tying into place.



Weave ribbon through the holes (like threading a pair of sneakers) and tie at the end. Add a bow for flourish.

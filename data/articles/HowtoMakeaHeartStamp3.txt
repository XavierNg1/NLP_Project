 You can use an empty toilet paper roll or an empty paper towel roll. Be sure to pull off any bits of paper. If you are using a paper towel roll, consider cutting it in half so that you can make two stamps.
 Set the tube down on a table. Squish it flat with your hands so that it gets a crease on both sides., You should have something that looks like a leaf or an eye.
 Use your fingers to press one of the creased edges into the tube. Your tube should now start looking a little more like a heart!Make sure that you fold the crease in from top to bottom.
 Gently push the top loops of your tube together until you get the heart shape you like. Hold the tube in one hand, then wrap a piece of tape around the middle to hole the loops in place., Hold the tube gently in your hand. Tap the open part of the tube into a puddle of acrylic or tempera paint. Press the tube against a sheet of paper, then lift it away.

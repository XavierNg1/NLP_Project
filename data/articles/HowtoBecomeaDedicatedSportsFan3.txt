 Make sure you choose a better team, because you don't want to be made fun of because your team is awful! Now that you have decided on your team, you can talk teams with friends and family members that enjoy your sport as well! Read the next few tips on how to become a real dedicated fan.
 Everyone should know which team is yours with the following products:


Jerseys. Every team and every player has a jersey. Choose your favorite player and sport his jersey. Or, over time, save up your money for a jersey. Watch your money though! Jerseys can be expensive, depending on how well the team and player is.
Wristbands, Headbands, and Knee Pads are available for every team. Usually they are only available for the team, though! They aren't very expensive, but you won't need many!
Water bottles. All teams have reusable water bottles, and they aren't very expensive. There are also player water bottles available, as well.
School Supplies. Many stores (Walmart, Target, Staples) may sell very known player and team supplies, but you may want to look up appropriate team and player supplies on the internet.
Autographs. Autographs can cost hundreds of dollars, or they can be free or at a very low price! Always check and make sure you are 100% certain about your purchase BEFORE you buy the autograph.
 Cheer your team on at their games. Be careful, because many sport events can be very expensive. This all depends on the sport and game though. For example; the Super Bowl can cost a lot of money, while a swim meet can be very inexpensive.

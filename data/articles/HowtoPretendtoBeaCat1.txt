 Different breeds of cats all have unique features and personalities. Are you refined like a Persian cat or are you wild like a Manx? You can even pretend to be a big cat like a lion, tiger, or a cheetah.;
, There’s no need to buy a costume (although you can if you really want to!). Check your closet to see what you already have that could give you the same coloring as your chosen cat breed. If possible, pick something fuzzy or at least soft to the touch.


Buy or make your own pair of cat ears to wear.
Buy or make your own tail to wear.
 You can use a black or brown eyeliner to give yourself cat eyes and whiskers. Choose the color that best complements your cat breed’s coloring.


Line your eyes all the way around with eyeliner and extend the line beyond your upper and lower eyelid so that the two lines meet on the outer corner of your eye and form a point or a tail.Use the eyeliner to draw an upside down triangle on the tip of your nose. Fill it in completely. Then, give yourself whiskers by drawing three or four lines extending from the bottom of your nose (near your nostrils) out onto your cheeks.

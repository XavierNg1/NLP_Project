 If you know what types of inedible items your dog likes to eat, put them out of its reach.For example, if your dog likes eating toilet paper, close the bathroom doors. If your dog prefers eating your shoes, keep them in your closet and keep your closet doors closed.


If your dog likes eating empty food wrappers, stay diligent about throwing away all food wrappers.
 If you make the inedible items less desirable, your dog will lose interest in eating them. Consider sprinkling a bitter-tasting substance, like cayenne pepper or Bitter Apple®, on those items., Changing your dog’s diet could help stop the pica behavior. High-fiber diets promote a feeling of fullness. If your dog feels full, it may not want to eat inedible items. Talk with your vet before changing your dog’s diet.

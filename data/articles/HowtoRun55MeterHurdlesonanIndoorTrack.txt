 You could use both legs as dominant legs if you take an even amount of steps between the hurdles. Otherwise, you will take an odd amount of steps (like 5 steps for beginners, or 3 steps for the more experienced) between the hurdles and have one dominant leg.;
, You need to land with your non-dominant foot as the last step before you jump the hurdle, in order for your dominant leg to lead you. There are 13 meters between the starting line and first hurdle; you need to learn how many steps it takes you to sprint those 13 meters. If you take an even number of steps to the first hurdle then you start with your dominant foot back and your non-dominate foot on the starting line. If you take an odd amount of steps to the first hurdle then you start with your dominant foot on the starting line, and your non-dominant foot behind. Most people take 7 or 8 steps to the first hurdle.
 You want your dominant leg to be slightly out from the center of the hurdle. (Right dominant slightly right of center, and left dominant slightly left of center)

,,, This leg should be bent at the knee, with toes pointed up and outward. The trailing leg should be level when jumping over the hurdle, and then pulled toward the hurdles center before landing. The trailing leg is the part that is most likely to hit a hurdle during the sprint. There is no penalty for hitting a hurdle during a race, but it slows down the runner and disturbs balance. Make sure to pull the trailing leg over the hurdle and back toward the hurdles center.
 This conserves speed and energy for the runner.
 You must land with the intention to keep running your sprint. The amount of steps between hurdles will decrease over time. Most people run 5 steps between hurdles (3 if you have mastered the techniques) in order to keep the same dominant foot throughout. Take 4 steps if you are alternating dominate legs. Take the amount of steps you are comfortable with and continue to jump over the next 4 hurdles.

 If you're going to handle records for cleaning, thoroughly scrub your hands first. That prevents you from transferring as much dirt and natural oil from your hands to the records, which helps keep them cleaner.When washing your hands, use soap and water, and scrub for at least 20 seconds, getting in between your fingers as you do.;
, To keep oils off the record, hold the record by pressing your hands along two opposite edges. Try not to touch the grooved part where the music plays. You can also use the paper label to hold the disc., It may be that you don't need to use a cleaning solution to clean the disc. You may be able to blow the majority of the dust and dirt off the disc using canned air, making the playback much better without using chemicals. You can find canned at big boxed stores near the electronics.It can help to blow off the record ahead of cleaning, anyway, so you don't scratch the record when you rub against the dust.

, Recall that a cross product is represented in index notation using the Levi-Civita symbol. Because there are two cross products, there will be two Levi-Civita symbols, and since the indices i,j,k,l,m{\displaystyle i,j,k,l,m} only represent numbers, they will commute with the vector components.


(a×(b×c))i=ϵijkaj(b×c)k=ϵijkajϵklmblcm=ϵijkϵklmajblcm{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}({\mathbf {a} }\times ({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} }))^{i}&=\epsilon _{ijk}a^{j}({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} })^{k}\\&=\epsilon _{ijk}a^{j}\epsilon _{klm}b^{l}c^{m}\\&=\epsilon _{ijk}\epsilon _{klm}a^{j}b^{l}c^{m}\end{aligned}}}

In the second line, we recognize that k{\displaystyle k} is the “output” of b×c,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} },} so to write the second cross product, we introduce two new indices for the two vectors, not three.
 Because k{\displaystyle k} is summed over, we can contract the Levi-Civita symbols by making use of an argument. 

First, let’s make use of cyclic permutation to write the Levi-Civita symbols in a manner that will allow us to comprehend the argument more easily.


ϵijkϵlmk{\displaystyle \epsilon _{ijk}\epsilon _{lmk}}



Let’s assume that k=1.{\displaystyle k=1.} This means that for ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } to be non-zero, i,j,l,m{\displaystyle i,j,l,m} all have to be either 2 or 3, and of course, i≠j{\displaystyle i\neq j} and l≠m.{\displaystyle l\neq m.}

So in order for ϵijkϵlmk=1,{\displaystyle \epsilon _{ijk}\epsilon _{lmk}=1,} both symbols must output the same number. That is, they must both either be 1 or -1. The only way that this could happen is if i=l{\displaystyle i=l} and j=m.{\displaystyle j=m.} If k=1,{\displaystyle k=1,} that means that i,l{\displaystyle i,l} must both take on the same value, and j,m{\displaystyle j,m} must both take on the other value. For example, i=l=2,j=m=3.{\displaystyle i=l=2,\,j=m=3.} We can therefore make use of the Kronecker delta to write this mathematically.


δilδjm{\displaystyle \delta _{il}\delta _{jm}}



Of course, if the Levi-Civita symbols are different, then the opposite is true: i≠l,j≠m,{\displaystyle i\neq l,\,j\neq m,} and the output will be -1. Since these four indices can only be one of two numbers, it nicely turns out that i=m,j=l.{\displaystyle i=m,\,j=l.} We can again write this in terms of a Kronecker delta.


−δimδlj{\displaystyle -\delta _{im}\delta _{lj}}



Now we add these two deltas together, because we have laid out the two possible scenarios after going through the summations.


ϵijkϵlmk=δilδjm−δimδlj{\displaystyle \epsilon _{ijk}\epsilon _{lmk}=\delta _{il}\delta _{jm}-\delta _{im}\delta _{lj}}



The above identity is highly useful for simplifying expressions in index notation.
 Now that we have the vector triple product in terms of Kronecker deltas, contracting indices is much easier now. Here, we can contract l{\displaystyle l} and m.{\displaystyle m.} For example, δilbl=bi.{\displaystyle \delta _{il}b^{l}=b^{i}.}


(δilδjm−δimδlj)ajblcm=ajbicj−ajbjci=bi(ajcj)−ci(ajbj){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(\delta _{il}\delta _{jm}-\delta _{im}\delta _{lj})a^{j}b^{l}c^{m}&=a^{j}b^{i}c^{j}-a^{j}b^{j}c^{i}\\&=b^{i}(a^{j}c^{j})-c^{i}(a^{j}b^{j})\end{aligned}}}


, We can clearly see that j{\displaystyle j} is being summed over, just like a dot product.


bi(ajcj)−ci(ajbj)=bi(a⋅c)−ci(a⋅b){\displaystyle b^{i}(a^{j}c^{j})-c^{i}(a^{j}b^{j})=b^{i}({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {c} })-c^{i}({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {b} })}

Since this is exactly what we were looking for - the i{\displaystyle i}th component of the vector triple product - we have proven the BAC-CAB identity.


(a×(b×c))i=bi(a⋅c)−ci(a⋅b){\displaystyle ({\mathbf {a} }\times ({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} }))^{i}=b^{i}({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {c} })-c^{i}({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {b} })}


a×(b×c)=b(a⋅c)−c(a⋅b){\displaystyle {\mathbf {a} }\times ({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} })={\mathbf {b} }({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {c} })-{\mathbf {c} }({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {b} })}

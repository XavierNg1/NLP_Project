 Many celebrities live in these cities, and spending time there may increase your chances of meeting someone famous.
 Either make clear your hobby of taking photos with the stars, or casually mention your particular interest to one person. You never know who knows the guy who knows the guy who knows the guy who trains Brad Pitt.Play it cool. Just as you would protect your friends, colleagues, boss, or employee from someone who seems threatening, someone involved in the life of a celebrity is not going to introduce you if you seem dangerous, bizarre, or embarrassing.
Express your interest in a particular field of art or entertainment, rather than one particular person. If your social and work network knows of your love of film, music, or theater, they are more likely to share information, tickets, and news pertaining to a wide variety of people in your interest group. You might get information on a Beyonc√© concert if your friends know you love pop music. But if they think you only are interested in Taylor Swift, they may not bother to tell you.
 When you go for coffee or lunch in a popular area, ask the people working there who comes in. Some people can be very open, and may even tell you which day of the week, or time of day, certain people tend to get their groceries or pick up their takeout.
 Theater performances, gallery openings, book signings, and other official appearances will be noted.


Visit the theater or gallery where the celebrity is scheduled to appear. Talk with the people who work there. You never know who may tell you a bit of information regarding his or her whereabouts.

 For stubborn stains, you will have to use water. Load lukewarm water into a spray bottle and spray it onto the cloth. Alternatively, dip the cloth into lukewarm water and squeeze out excess moisture.Distilled water is better to use than tap water. Tap water, even after filtration, contains minerals and chemicals that can build up on the screen over time.Never spray liquid directly onto the screen.
 Pass the cloth over the screen. Most stains will come off without you having to press down on the screen. Continue to wipe the screen using minimal pressure until the stain is completely removed.
 For the worst stains, you can add a squirt of a gentle detergent, such as Dawn, to your water. Spray the cleaner onto the cloth or dip the cloth into the water. Wring out excess moisture before use., In large quantities, isopropyl alcohol can damage the screen. In a pinch, however, it can remove tough stains. Dilute it into a cleaning mixture by adding one part isopropyl alcohol to four parts water. Dampen a soft cloth with the mixture and use it to wipe off the stain.Vinegar can be substituted in for isopropyl alcohol. However, it dries slower.Other strong, abrasive substances such as ammonia and benzene will certainly damage the display. Check the label on any liquids you intend on applying to the screen.Commercial cleaners for plasma screens are available. Some include isopropyl alcohol in the mixture, so consult the label first.
 Use water or the gentle detergent mixture for clean the rest of the device. Dip the cloth into the water, making sure to wring out the excess. If the cloth drips, it will leave water that can run into the device or back onto the screen. Wipe the cloth gently over the surfaces of the device.
 Take another microfiber cloth and wipe it over the screen. Dry off the rest of the device as well with the cloth. Make sure all moisture has evaporated or been picked up by the cloth. Once the screen is completely dry, you may turn the screen back on.

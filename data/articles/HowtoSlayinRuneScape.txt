 It is like training right outside of the bank! If you can not make Slayer rings yet, use the fairy ring code AJR to access the slayer dungeon and bank in Zanaris. Use house teletabs and the Kharyrll portal for convenient access to the slayer tower.

If you are forced to use a different transportation method, you might want to train somewhere else. These two sites are relatively devoid of people and have some of the best monsters in RS! We never advocate using a cannon as it is the least efficient weapon in the game for a DIYer, and more expensive than even Karil's X-bow if you are buying bolts/balls. However, they are great for fast kills and running through slayer tasks. Ice Trolls on the Fremmy Isles are the only monsters in a multi combat that might be worth it.

, Waterbirth Island is another Guthans Only training site with great payoffs, both in drops and the Waterbirth armour sets. It is always empty due to the location and the fact you need a friend to go past the first room. Bank with jewelry and Rellekka POH tele or Enchanted Lyre your way back. Restore food supply by either fishing from the dock or thieving the stalls and cooking on the fire near the chief. We find that fishing while we fight can really break up the monotony.
 Bring Excalibur or the Ancient Mace along for free Defence or Prayer pots if you are not planning on using your Specs. If your target is far from a bank and drops bones, pick up some Mage Xp by learning and using Bones to Peaches. This is ideal for Monsters such as Dust Devils.
 If it wields a club, wear Chain mail. If it wields a Sword, wear Plate armour. If it wields a staff or has a mage based attack, wear D Hides. If it wields a bow, leave it alone Nah, Granite and Crystal work best against range.

 Get as many close people in your life around for such a happy occasion.
 Put your drawings on the fridge, put your eggs in a bowl for display, put your flowers in a vase, and put your cupcakes on a rack. You want a organized look to the party.
, Go to the crafts store and buy some decorations, or make some yourself. A bright house is perfect for the Easter spirit.

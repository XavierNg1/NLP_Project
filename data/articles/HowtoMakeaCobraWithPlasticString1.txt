 Pick 3 to 4 strands of string. Only two of the strands will be used, however - the remaining strands will simply be used as a central strand. If done correctly, the central strand will not be able to be seen at all, so use a color you do not care about.;
, Remember that the finished bracelet will be about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) shorter than the length of the central strand, so cut the string accordingly. For the two working strands, cut a length that is about four times the length of the central strand.


Tie the two working strands together in a loose granny knot.






Stick the end of the central strands into one of the outer knots and pull slightly through.






Tighten the granny knot.
 With one of them, make a loop and put it in the front.
 You will always start with this strand.
,,, Remember to always start with the same strand. Continue until you form a length long enough to turn into a bracelet.

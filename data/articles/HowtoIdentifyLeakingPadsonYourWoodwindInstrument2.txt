 You need a light that will travel down inside your instrument, so a tube flashlight that you can easily bend works best. Look at your local hardware or home improvement store, or search online at sites such as Amazon to find one that will work. Streamlight offers a variety of models that make good leak lights.A length of rope lighting, which is typically used for decorative purposes, can also make an effective leak light.
Using a leak light is an especially effective method for finding leaky pads in woodwinds that don’t break down into separate joints, such as the flute and saxophone, because it allows you to examine all the way down into the body of the instrument.
 Make sure that you’ve turned your leak light on, and gently being threading it down into the instrument. You can either allow it to move all the way to the bottom keys and carefully pull it up as you go to examine each pad, or set it near the top keys and slowly move it down into the instrument as you go., To test each pad, you’ll need to close each key and form a tight seal with the pad. Your leak light should be directly behind the pad that you’re testing. Once you’ve pressed down on the key, look around it to see if you observe any light shining through. Light indicates a leak.It’s usually easier to see if there’s light around a pad if you do the test in a dark or dimly lit room.
While this method can be very effective in identifying significant leaks, it may not alert you to smaller issues. It also won’t help you determine if the pad is seated evenly around the tone hole.
Using a leak light won’t work if your woodwind instrument has translucent pads because the light will be visible even if there isn’t a leak.

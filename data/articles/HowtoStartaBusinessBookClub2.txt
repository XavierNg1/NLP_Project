 The ideal size for a business book club is about 10 to 12 people. Since most people will miss a meeting here or there, you will probably be short one or two people each meeting. Having fewer members may make it difficult to get an active discussion going, but having more members may make it equally difficult for everyone to chime in during the discussion.
 Unless you hate everyone at your office, the most sensible place to start is at your own place of work. Odds are, you know many of the people there well enough to determine if they would make a valuable addition to your book club. You also know that many of their business interests will line up with your own, especially if they work in your department.
 If you just signed a new client or are in the middle of pitching a new deal, refrain from mentioning your book club since it has nothing to do with the business between you and the other party. If you are on good terms—a “first name” basis—with contacts from partnering companies, however, you could consider telling them about your new business book club via e-mail or during non-office hours.
 You will want to keep the subjects discussed at your book club fairly focused, and the best way to do that is to make sure that your members are all interested in the same thing. For instance, if you work in sales, you will probably have different interests than someone who works in the IT department.
 Even if none of your friends or relatives share your vision or are in the same field of business, they may know someone who is. Tell your loved ones about your new book club and ask them to pass to word along to anyone they know who might be interested.
 Put an ad in the local paper or post one on a free classifieds website. You can also scour business blogs and message boards that have posters who live locally.

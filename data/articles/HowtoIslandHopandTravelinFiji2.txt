 There are several tour companies on the major Fiji islands that offer extended passes for travel from 5 days to 21 days. 5 day passes start at around $200, while 21 day passes are around $500.


Look for a pass that will allow you to renew if you come to the end of your pass's validity and you want to keep traveling. For example, if you purchase a 7-day pass and you later decide you want to extend it to 10 days, ask about that option before you buy.
Review the schedules. Some passes will allow you to hop to 1 island per day, others will allow unlimited time getting on and off the boats.
 Private citizens offering boat rides are not regulated for safety, and you will be traveling at your own risk.
 Many of the accommodations on the islands are small, so walking in without a reservation will not work. Some boats and charters will not let you board without proof of a hotel reservation.
 Some ferries and catamarans will allow you to buy a pass that includes transportation on their boats as well as hotel accommodations on certain islands.
 If it does not, you will need to arrange for local transport on different islands, and your pass will not cover the costs.
 The local cuisine is fresh, abundant and cheap. Many islands will have farmer's markets and the larger islands will have a good selection of restaurants.

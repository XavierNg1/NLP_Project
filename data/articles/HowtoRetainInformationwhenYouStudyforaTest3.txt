 You will have a harder time studying if you are disorganized. In order to make your study sessions most efficient, organize your supplies ahead of time.Make sure to separate materials by class. Keep a folder where you keep all your notes, past papers, and old quizzes.
Keep your study area organized. If your study area is very messy, this can affect concentration. Tidy up your study area after each study session.
 You will not retain information if you try to cram it in all at once. Instead of studying for hours on end, stick to reasonably timed study sessions with breaks in between.Keep yourself on a schedule regarding breaks to make sure they don't take too much time. You can, for example, agree on 50 minutes of studying and then 5 minutes of break time.
Make sure to time your breaks. A 5 minute internet break can easily turn into an hour internet break unless you're diligent about setting a timer.
 You cannot retain information unless you're getting a solid night's sleep each night. Make sure to go to bed at a reasonable hour, and aim for a full night's sleep each day.Sticking to a sleep schedule will help you fall asleep faster. If you go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day, your body's natural circadian rhythm will adapt.
You should also engage in a relaxing ritual before bed each night. Try reading a book or taking a warm bath. Avoid electronic screens, as these can make sleep more difficult.
 Regular physical activity can actually increase your brain's ability to retain information. Aim for half an hour of aerobic exercise a day to maximize your ability to recall information.Pick a form of exercise you enjoy, as you'll be more likely to stick to it.
If you're very busy, see if there's a way to incorporate exercise into your daily routine. You can, for example, bike to class instead of walking or taking the train.

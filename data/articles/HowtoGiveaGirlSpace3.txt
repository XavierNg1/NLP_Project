 Space is not effective unless some reflection is done during the process. Think of what you may have done to prompt her need for space and assess whether or not you can prevent doing so in the future. If the space was not prompted by you, think about her life at the moment and what she might be needing. The space could have little or nothing to do with you, so don’t take it too personally., Once she has a bit more free time or she is reaching out to you on a more consistent basis, check in with her and see if she is still looking for space from you. If not, spend some time together. And if she does need more time, give her that for as long as you can.You might say something like “I wanted to see if you still needed some space from the relationship. It’s okay if you do, but I wanted to check in before I started contacting you more frequently.”

, Ask her if she had any moments of clarity during this time of space, if she enjoyed it, and if she would like to make it more permanent. Tell her what you learned as well and reaffirm your commitment to the relationship if you still feel that way. Talk about ways to avoid needing space in the future or ways to provide more alone time.For instance, perhaps you had been going out with her and her friends when they would have dinner or go to the movies. See if she would like that time with them alone, instead.
 After the two of you have taken a bit of space from one another, you might both find that you enjoy your time apart more than you do your time together. Though this can be a sad realization, know that it is time to move forward separately. Let go of the relationship and wish her the best.

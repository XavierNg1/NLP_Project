 For a casual, yet tailored look, try wearing your tee underneath a blazer. The blazer should fit you well and have a certain amount of structure to it. Try half-tucking your tee into your pants for a super cool, slouchy look., Tuck your tee into a pair of high-waisted shorts to make your legs look super long.Try mixing fun, whimsical tees with dark color shorts to make the tee pop.
 Try wearing your casual tee tucked into a floral skirt. The tee will keep the skirt from looking too girly. This is the perfect outfit to wear to school on a warm, spring day, or add leggings and boots to wear during the fall., Since graphic tees are casual, you can dress them up with fun and fancy accessories. Try pairing your tee with an expensive looking bag and heels, or a chic pair of oversized sunglasses.Your bag and shoes don’t actually have to be expensive, they just have to look like they are.
 If your shirt is slightly oversized, trying wearing it over a pair of leggings with some dangly earrings.If your shirt is tighter and more cropped, try pairing it with an a-line skirt or a looser fitting pair of pants. Generally, the rule is if you’re wearing something tight on top, you should wear something looser on the bottom (and vice versa!)

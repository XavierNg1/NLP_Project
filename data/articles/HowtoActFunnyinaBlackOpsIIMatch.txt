 Not angry rants, just on anything. A funny story, your favorite movie, anything!;
, Act surprised when you do well.
 Do impressions and imitations of celebrities. Crack a few jokes.
 If you don't care about your K/D R, dance around the map and sing random songs.
 You never know; there may be more than one goof in the lobby!

, That's the main point of this.

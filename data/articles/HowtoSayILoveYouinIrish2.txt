 This is roughly pronounced "mow grah hoo." The first word rhymes with "low." Don't be fooled by the th in the last word — "thú" should sound like the noise an owl makes. Some regional accents pronounce it a little more like "huh," but the important point is that you should use an h sound for the word.Literally, this means "my love you," but the meaning is essentially "I love you."

, This is pronounced "GRAH-im hoo." Notice that the first word is actually two syllables even though it looks like it might be just one. Also note that the first syllable is stressed, rather than the second.


This is a shorter, easier version of the phrase above. The meaning is more or less the same.
 This is pronounced "Iss brah lum too." Use a hard s sound (as in "sass") for the first word. It should not sound like the English word "is." Note that "breá" rhymes with "raw" and that the second word rhymes with "strum" regardless of how they look like they would be pronounced in English.
 This phrase should sound like "Iss even lum too." Notice that the only word that is different between this phrase and the one above is "aoibhinn." Despite how it looks, this word is pronounced almost exactly like the English word "even."The rest of the words are pronounced the same way as in the step above.
While the phrase above means "I love you," the literal meaning here is closer to "you delight me." The meaning is less romantic and more affectionate. You can also use this phrase for objects (see below).

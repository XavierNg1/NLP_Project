 It's almost a free pass to your favorite sniping spot. Depending on the game mode, you'd either want to overwatch an objective, or a hot spot. The bridge in Overgrown could be considered a hot spot in Domination.
 Bolt action snipers (M40A3 and R700) are highly recommended for campers, the M40A3 more so than the R700. This is due to the one-shot-kill damage stat. The Barret .50 Cal is still a viable option, yet not so much as the M40A3. Which sniper you use is up to you, the M40A3 has one more bullet but the R700 (supposedly) does more damage. This is false. All sniper rifles do 75 base damage. The multipliers are what really makes them different.
 For traditional campers, perk one should be claymores, perk two should be stopping power (normal match) or UAV jammer (hardcore), and perk 3 should be Extreme Conditioning, Steady Aim (for random CQC encounters, or Deep Impact if the map has a lot of cover points. For stealth campers, perk one should be bandolier. You will be moving a lot, so claymores will just convince you to stay, thus defeating the entire purpose of your class. Perk two should be UAV Jammer (hardcore) or Stopping Power (normal match), and perk three should be Extreme Conditioning or dead Silence.

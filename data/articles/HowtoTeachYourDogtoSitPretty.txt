 A good way to reward your dog for a job well done is by giving them a treat. Some good treats to use are bite size soft treats (from the pet store) or small pieces of meat.;
, Call his/her name and show them the treat. If your dog isn't paying attention, they will not be able to learn the trick.
 If your dog doesn't already know how to sit read the steps below. If your dog does know how to sit, move on to the next step.


Get your dog's attention
Stay in the same position and wait until they sit because of boredom
Reward your dog and say "sit"
Repeat until your dog sits every time
You could also hold the treat just above their nose and they might sit.
 Now that your dog knows how to sit, you can teach them the advanced version. Have your dog sit in a place where there are no distractions. Hold a treat in your hand and move your hand over your dog's nose. Your dog should lean back and lift its front paws off of the ground. Reward your dog and say "sit pretty" Repeat until your dog sits pretty every time.
 Now that your dog can sit pretty, it is time for your dog to master the trick. Have them sit pretty like usual, but this time see how long they can hold it for. If your dog is having a hard time balancing, try helping them by holding their paw. Repeat until your dog can hold the position for at least 5 seconds. Now you can show all of your friends and family what a cool dog you have!

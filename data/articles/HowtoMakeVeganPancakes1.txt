 Mix them together with a spoon until everything is evenly combined.;
, Use a tasteless oil, such as canola or vegetable. Olive oil will affect the flavor too much.
 Stir until everything is just mixed together, and the batter is a little lumpy. If you over mix your batter, the pancakes will end up tough and chewy.
 You can leave your pancake batter as is, or you can add some extra goodies to make it even yummier. Here are some ideas to get you started:½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
3 tablespoons dairy-free chocolate chips
3 tablespoons chopped nuts
¼ cup (25 – 50 grams) blueberries, strawberries, or bananas

, Whatever you choose to cook your pancakes on must be very, very hot. If the surface is not hot enough, the pancakes won't turn out right.These 5 minutes will also the baking soda enough time activate, which will give you fluffier pancakes in the end.


Heat electric skillets to 350°F (176.67°C).
Set stoves (for skillets or griddles) to medium-low to medium-high.
 Some surfaces, such as non-stick griddles, do not need to be greased. Others do. You can tell if the surface is hot if you sprinkle some water on it, and the water sizzles., Depending on the size of your skillet/griddle, you may be able to make more than one pancake at a time. You want each pancake to be about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) in diameter.
 The pancake is ready to be flipped when it starts to turn bubbly, and the outer edges (about ½ inch or 1.27 centimeters) are matte instead of glossy.
 The pancake is ready when it turns golden brown., You can serve them on their own, or add your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, cinnamon, or berries.

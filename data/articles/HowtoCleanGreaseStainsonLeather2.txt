 One particularly effective method of cleaning grease from smaller items is to use a bit of dish soap and distilled water to create a lather and clean the item. You'll need a couple of clean micro-fiber cloths, the soap, and water. Consider using a spray bottle to make the job easier.
 Dip the cloth into the liquid detergent. Dab the patch test area with the cloth, being gentle to work with the grain of the leather.
 Use your clean fingers to rub the patch test area until you work up a gentle lather. Apply more water as needed to clean the stain.
 Allow the piece to dry fully before attempting to clean again. You might have to attempt several applications before the stain is shrunken significantly or completely removed from the item. Give it time to dry before attempting to clean it again.

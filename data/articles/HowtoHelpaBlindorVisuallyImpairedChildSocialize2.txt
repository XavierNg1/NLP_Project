 Talk about and identify common gestures used in speech. Teach your child how to gesture and explain why people use gestures while speaking. Discuss nonverbal behaviors and how they communicate sometimes just as much as words.For example, nonverbal cues can indicate interest or disinterest, such as moving closer or further from someone who is speaking. Learning nonverbal cues can help your child communicate more effectively.
 Help your child understand that people enjoy having some space around them. Many people are off put by someone being either too far or too close to them while they speak. Teach your child to gauge their distance by the other person’s voice. If they are too near someone, gently encourage them to back up a bit.If your child is not sure whether they are giving enough space or not, have them ask, “Am I crowding you?”

, Blind children miss out on reading expressions on people’s faces that can clue them in on how they feel. Practice making faces together and discussing how they feel and why a person might make that face. Guide them to make these expressions and to feel them on your face.Understanding expressions can help with understanding nonverbal cues and emotion.

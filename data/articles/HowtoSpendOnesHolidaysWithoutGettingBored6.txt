 The holidays are one of the few times each year when most people have lots of free time. If you have no pressing commitments with family or friends, consider using your time to finish duties that you've been putting off for a long time. For instance, if you've neglected cleaning your room for ages, devote your entire afternoon to doing so. Other good ideas include filing your taxes, running errands, paying bills, re-organizing your closet, and servicing your car.

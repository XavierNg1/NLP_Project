 Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (220 C). Tear off parchment paper and line two baking sheets with the paper. Set them aside while you make the butternut squash chips.Ensure that one of your oven racks is in the middle of the oven. This will help the chips cook evenly.
 Wash one large butternut squash and use a vegetable peeler to remove its peel. Use a sharp chef's knife to carefully trim away the ends of the squash. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Slice the squash into thin sticks or thick wedges.Keep in mind that thinner sticks will cook faster than thick wedges of butternut squash.
 Transfer the pieces of butternut squash to a large mixing bowl. Drizzle the squash with Â¼ cup (60 ml) of olive or coconut oil and sprinkle 2 to 3 teaspoons of dried herbs (like rosemary or parsley) over the squash. Toss the mixture together to coat the squash completely.You can also add sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
 Spread the seasoned butternut squash pieces on the prepared baking sheets. They should be in a single layer so they cook evenly and crisp up a little. Bake the squash for 20 to 25 minutes or until they're golden brown. Remove the chips and serve them immediately.These baked butternut squash fries won't be as crisp as traditionally fried chips. Baking them in a single layer will help them crisp up more on one side.

 Give your friend a genuine smile.


Girls: Close your eyes and think about how much you love your friend when hugging. Press as much as you feel like without squishing your friend. Do not clap the person you're hugging on the shoulders. Some girls think you don't like them if you do it that way.
Guys: Embrace strongly, and clap each other on the top of your backs. If you're having an emotional moment, hold the hug for a brief moment and do not clap each others backs.

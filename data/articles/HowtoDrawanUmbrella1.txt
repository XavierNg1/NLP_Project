, Decide how you want to draw your umbrella, which way it will face, how big is it going to be, what will the umbrella's patter be, and what color you are going to make your umbrella. It is not necessary to work out all this detail now, you can decide later while drawing and you can always change your mind, experiment!

, The space between the two is where your umbrella will be, so draw them as far apart as big you want to have your umbrella. You don't have to draw the spike now you can draw it later, it doesn't really matter.
 If your umbrella will be on the ground draw a ground as a guide to where the outline of your umbrella should go up to. When drawing your umbrella's outline, keep it in mind to make it any shape you want, but be sure to draw it lightly. It is up to you to decide what shape your umbrella will be. There are umbrellas that are very big, very small, very flat, and very round, so it depend on you what you want it to be like.
 Umbrellas have metal rods in them which give it it's shape, so mark the place where these rods will go. When drawing the dots make sure to draw the middle ones a bit lower than the ones on the side to later give it that 3D effect.
 Make sure to have these lines the same shape as the outline of your umbrella only being a bit flatter and a bit longer. Notice how the middle line reaches down further than the ones next to it, which reach down further than the lines on the side.
 These lines should not be straight, they should be curved. Draw these lines like you see in the picture: the sides of the lines connecting to the bottom of the lines of the metal rods you drew in the previous step, and the middles bending upwards.

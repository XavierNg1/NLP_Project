 The screen should be cut to fit the size and shape of the bottom. Having it in your pot will prevent your soil from draining with the water, keeping things much cleaner.
 The rocks create air gaps in between the underside of your pot and the surface it sits on, which allows water to drain more thoroughly.
 For a 15-gallon (60 liter) pot, you should cover the bottom 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) with soil.
 Push the stem of the plant into the existing soil, just enough to give it a base of support.
 Pack the soil around the stem of the tomato plant as you go, making sure that it remains securely fixed in the pot and does not wiggle around. By the time you finish, about half of the stem should be beneath the soil.
 Soak it with water once, and then wait another 10 minutes before soaking it again. The soil should be completely saturated, soaking the root, as well.


After soaking it so thoroughly, your tomato plant may not need additional watering for an entire week. Constantly saturating your tomatoes will destroy them.
 Your tomatoes need at least six hours of sun per day in order to grow and eventually produce fruit.
 Trim the leaves from the stem before adding more of the planting medium, packing it around the stem as before. By filling the pot in with soil as the tomato plant grows, you help the plant build its root mass.


Continue to fill the pot with soil until it reaches the near top, with only 3/4 to 1 inch (2 to 2.5 centimeters) of empty space in between the surface of the soil and the rim of the container.

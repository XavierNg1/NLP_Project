 You will need to find a good spot where to enter the water. Find an area where the water is calm and where there are no rocks and is in shallow water.;
, Slide your kayak into the water with the bow(The front) first, place your hand firmly on the stern (The back) grab loop and position the kayak so that the cockpit area is in shallow enough water to stand in.
 Have your paddle in one hand and walk along the side of the kayak up to the cockpit.
 Start by placing your paddle perpendicular to the boat just behind the seat in the kayak and up against the cockpit rim. Put your closest hand across the kayak and on the paddle with your closest hand on the paddle and your fingers holding onto the cockpit rim., then steady the kayak.
 Place your leg into the kayak and into position, shift your weight and butt over the kayak while keeping your other foot on the ground.
 At this point you should still have your hand holding onto the paddle. Grab onto the paddle with your other hand to steady yourself and put your butt back of the kayak and sit down on the back of the cockpit.
 Use the paddle to steady yourself with your hands gripping them on either sides of your body, lean back on your butt, and keep your foot on the floor of the kayak. Bring your other leg into the kayak.
 Make sure your balance is good and you have both of your feet firmly planted on the floor of your kayak and your hands gripping the paddle, now slide into your kayak.

 If you are speaking to a butcher or fishmonger, ask that the steaks are the same thickness, so that they cook uniformly.;
, Although this step is not essential, this is the best way to create a richer flavor before placing your salmon on the grill. A good marinade ratio is one part acid to one part oil to one part aromatics/hers, along with salt and sugar to taste.


For example, try combining 2 tbsp. of white vinegar with 2 tbsp. of olive oil and some sugar, dill weed, salt and pepper to taste.
Alternatively, you can use one part hoisin, miso or soy sauce along with one part sesame oil for an Asian marinade.
Use one part olive oil, one part lemon juice and one part (several cloves) crushed garlic and salt for a simple fresh marinade.
 Place the salmon steaks inside and seal it. Refrigerate the bag for one hour.


Turn the bag once to ensure you salmon is well coated in the marinade.
 Consider coating the grill with oil before you grill to stop salmon from sticking. Do not do this over an open flame or the grease will splatter.
 Do not pat the salmon or the marinade will come off.
 Close the cover. Cook for five to seven minutes on each side.


Cooking time will depend upon how you like your salmon-rare, medium rare or well done. If the fish flakes and has no pink coloration, it is well done.
 Make an easy dill sauce with one part mayonnaise, one part Dijon mustard, one part dill weed, one part white whine vinegar and 1/3 part sugar. Add salt and pepper to taste.

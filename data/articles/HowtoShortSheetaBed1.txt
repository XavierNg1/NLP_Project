 Remove the comforter and any other top layer sheets to access the fitted sheet. This prank only works when the bed has both a fitted and a flat sheet. If your victim sleeps under a duvet without a flat sheet, you'll have to find another prank.


Don’t crinkle up the top sheets; fold or strategically place them on a piece of furniture.
If the victim comes home to a wrinkled or ruffled comforter, they might suspect something and inspect the bed.;
, Spread out the flat sheet as you normally would to make the bed. Then, instead of tucking the sheet at the foot of the bed, tuck it in at the head of the bed. This is the main part of the prank. Straighten the sheet so that it rests flat across the bed. If your victim is an impeccable bed-maker, ensure that the sheet isn't wrinkled, since it will be noticeable.
 Take the edge of the flat sheet near the foot of the bed and fold it up toward the head of the bed. Make it resemble a properly installed flat sheet, with the edge of the sheet resting just under the pillows.


Take note of how your victim normally folds their sheet, and try to emulate it. Some people will do an additional fold with their sheet to make it look neater. Other people keep it folded nearly in half so it is easy to hop into bed., Place the pillows, additional blankets, and/or bedspreads as they’re made normally. These top layers will cover up the fold you created. Be sure you recreate the way the victim typically makes the bed.


Make sure the folded sheet is covered by pillows and top blankets.
Do a quick inspection of the bed to ensure it looks like a normally made bed.
 Watch the person try to get into bed. They'll find that their feet are trapped in the fold! Once you see them struggling and confused, jump out and say “gotcha.”

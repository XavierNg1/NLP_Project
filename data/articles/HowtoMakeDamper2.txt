 You want to make sure your oven is warm enough to cook your damper. Set the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius) before setting your bread in the oven.If you have a gas oven, the temperature settings may not be 100% accurate. You should use an oven thermometer to make sure your oven is actually at the right temperature.
 Place your damper on a baking tray that's lightly greased or dusted with flour. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Allow your damper to bake this long at 425 degrees Fahrenheit., After the 25 minutes have passed, reduce the heat of the oven. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius) and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes., Make sure the damper is done before serving. When the damper is done, it will be golden brown. Gently turn it over and tap the bottom. When tapped, the bottom should sound hollow.

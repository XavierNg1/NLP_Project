 Watch the how to stop procrastinating video by wellcast.
 Even if you think you can multi-task. You can't. Just try short bursts of work if you have a short attention span. There is no point doing 1 hour of work when you have a 20 minute attention span.
 So clean out the clutter in your office to get more done.
 New research confirms that all the distractions invading our lives are rewiring the way our brains work (and drop our IQ by 5 points!). Be one of the rare-air few who develops the mental and physical discipline to have a mono-maniacal focus on one thing for many hours. (It’s all about practice).
 Every productive person obsessively sets To Do Lists. But those who play at world-class also record what they commit to stop doing. Steve Jobs said that what made Apple Apple was not so much what they chose to build but all the projects they chose to ignore.
 Why buy your groceries at the time the store is busiest? Why go to movies on the most popular nights? Why hit the gym when the gym’s completely full? Do things at off-peak hours and you’ll save so many of them. Get things right the first time. Most people are wildly distracted these days. And so they make mistakes. To unleash your productivity, become one of the special performers who have the mindset of doing what it takes to get it flawless first. This saves you days of having to fix problems.
 Turn off your emails on your phone. Use a simple to-do-list like TeuxDeux  and only put THREE things on it to get done each day. Plan your day according to the most important, biggest task, not the smallest and easiest.

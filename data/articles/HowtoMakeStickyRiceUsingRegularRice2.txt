 Most people rinse rice for sanitary purposes, and to get rid of the starch dust. Starch is what causes rice to become sticky and clump together. If you cannot bear to eat rice without washing it, then rinse it once or twiceâ€”but don't rinse so much that the water runs clear. You still want some of that starch left.;
, Some people find that letting the rice soak in water helps it become stickier in the end. Try soaking it for 30 minutes to 4 hours. Drain the water once the rice has finished soaking.
 Using more water than you actually need will help make the ricer stickier and clumpier.








Consider adding a dash of salt. This will give the rice some flavor and make it taste less bland.

Both jasmine and basmati are considered to be medium-grain.

 Transfer the rice to a serving plate. If you want, you can fluff it a little bit with a fork to make it less clumpy.

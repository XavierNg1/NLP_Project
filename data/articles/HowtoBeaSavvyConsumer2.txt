 You should always do research on vendors before you buy from them. This means reading reviews of specific products online as well as reviews of the vendor or seller. You should make sure the vendor has a high rating online and mostly positive reviews from buyers.You can also read the company’s report with the Better Business Bureau and Consumer Reports. If the company requires licensing to operate, you should contact the licensing authority to confirm the company is properly licensed and has no record of disciplinary action.
You should also make sure there is legitimate contact information for the vendor available online and in person. The vendor or seller should have an address and a phone number that you can verify is real and legitimate.
 You should also confirm the vendor is trustworthy by asking them for referrals from other customers. There may be referrals available on the vendor’s website and in their promotional material.Check to see if the referrals appear to be written by third party individuals, such as customers who have a history of using the vendor in the past. You should also check that the referrals are written by customers who have written many referrals for other businesses and services. Often, customers with many referrals for a variety of businesses will be discerning, savvy consumers.
 You can also get an idea of the business's customer experience by checking their social media accounts. In particular, Facebook allows for customer complaints or praise to be displayed prominently and gives the business a chance to respond. Look out unanswered complaints or a lack of positive comments when reading through the page. Businesses are aware that most customers check their Facebook before making a purchase, so reputable ones will strive to maintain a professional presence there.

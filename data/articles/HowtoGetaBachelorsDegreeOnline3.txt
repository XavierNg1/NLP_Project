 The last thing you want to do is find out you have one last class to take, right before you graduate. Pay careful attention that you meet every last requirement for graduation. Contact registrar or student services to see if your requirements will be met on time.
 Many schools require that you file or announce your intent to graduate by a certain date.In some cases, you may not be permitted to graduate if you have not filed to do so on time. Even if you have met the requirements, you may be made to wait until the end of he next term to graduate. This could potentially harm employment chances or moving on to other postgraduate education.
 Many schools will withhold a diploma until you pay all the fees associated with attending the program.Be sure that you will have covered any due costs you may have incurred, to insure you graduate in a timely manner.


See if there are special fees associated with graduation.
Make sure you do not owe any fines for lost or damaged materials if you rented them from your school.
Be sure that you are current with your tuition.
 This is one of the best parts for most people. It is possible to decline the diploma, and so it is a step that you must choose in order to complete the degree. Unless you have a well-thought and supported reason to do so, you should not decline the degree.

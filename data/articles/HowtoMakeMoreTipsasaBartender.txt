 A clean bar is just as important as good service.;
, If you're waiting on another customer, smile at the new or returning customers or nod a greeting.


Walk over to greet your customer as soon as possible. If your customer is a regular, be sure to address him by name. Customers feel welcome, liked and important when you do this.
 You may score a bigger tip if you remember details, such as whether a customer prefers a twist over a lemon wedge, no ice or a splash of soda in a cocktail.
 The majority of a bartender's income comes from tips, so good customer service skills are essential.


If a customer has to wait more than a couple of minutes for service, it can have a negative impact on your tip. The customer may also decide not to visit your bar again.
Keep your customer's glass full. When you notice an empty glass, ask your customer whether he would like another drink.
Be sure to garnish all drinks, unless you know the customer does not like garnish. If you can remember whether a customer prefers a lime, lemon, olive or celery, you may increase your bar-tending tip.
 This is a great way to make a new friend and earn a better tip.
 Some customers like to have fun. They may respond well to jokes, minor flirtations or casual conversations. Others prefer to sit and drink quietly.


Listen when your customers are upset or unhappy and want to talk but don't get involved. Politely excuse yourself when necessary to wait on other customers. You want to be sure you don't neglect anyone.
 Be creative, tell a good joke or do a magic trick when time permits. You won't make more tips by just mixing drinks.

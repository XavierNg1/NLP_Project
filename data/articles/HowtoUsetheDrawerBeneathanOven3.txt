 A bottom drawer broiler is most common in gas stoves. If you have a gas stove that has a bottom heating source, then your bottom drawer is most likely a broiler. The trays for the broiler will be a maximum of five inches from the heating source., If you are still not sure what your bottom drawer is meant for, the best way to know is to consult the instructions that came with the oven. The instructions will tell you if it is a pull-out broiler drawer and how to use it properly. You can most likely find instructions or product features for your brand of oven online if you no longer have the instructions., You can put the food on a grated broiler pan, or use a cast-iron skillet. Foods cooked in a broiler will typically be finished within 5 to 10 minutes. Foods like fresh vegetables that can be cooked quickly, thin-cut meats, and tender foods are best to broil because usually only the outer surface of the food is cooked.You can also cook foods in the oven first and then put them in the broiler to finish and vice versa.

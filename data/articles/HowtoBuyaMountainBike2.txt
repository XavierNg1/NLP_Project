 Have a clear idea in your mind of how much money you have to spend. Mountain bikes can cost anywhere from $200 to $10,000+. If you are new to mountain biking, keep your budget smaller until you develop the expertise to know exactly what you want. You can get a decent mountain bike for under $1,000.Don't forget that on top of a bike, you may want other items such as helmets, gloves and spares.
Factor in a maintenance charge of about $100 per year so that you can get a tuneup.
 Research on the internet or in catalogs to find a bike that meets your requirements. Online bike forums contain a lot of valuable information as well (try pinkbike.com/forum or forums.mtbr.com). Narrow down the selection to 4-5 bikes and Google them to read reviews.


To search online, you can look on Amazon, REI, or your city’s Craigslist for used bikes.
Bikeradar.com has a useful list of quality mountain bikes for under $1,000.You could also go to your local bike store to see what they have.
 When you have chosen a bike, look at dealers that stock it. Try to find a bike store or sporting goods store in your area that sells your bike. You want to find the best price, while also looking to see if that dealer will provide services and spare parts for you.


The internet is a good place to find online dealers, but you may have to pay for shipping and handling, plus you have the problem of finding a repair shop.
 Buying a bike second hand is a good way to get a great deal, but it is also easy to get ripped off. If you don’t know much about bikes, the seller can easily overcharge you and likely will not allow you to return it.If you do buy second hand, make sure to inspect the bike before buying it and to bring along an experienced biker to look at it. Then proceed with extreme caution.
You can find second hand bikes on bike forums or Craigslist.

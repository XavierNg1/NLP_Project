 The fresh air will flood in, spiking your senses and helping you stay awake. Stand at the window when you start to get sleepy.
 This is particularly effective for women. When your fingers make contact with your ears, they press into energy points that will send an extra boost of energy flooding through your veins. Massage your ears every couple of minutes or whenever you start to feel sleepy.
 Although your spirit may be determined to stay awake, your flesh is weak. Eventually, you'll find yourself dozing off without meaning to.


Hard, cold surfaces are the best to sit on. Try finding a metal chair to perch upon while performing your activities.
Don't lie on the floor. This will only cause you to fall asleep more easily.
 This will keep your mind and mouth engaged. Peppermints are an excellent option, as they stimulate the mind and perk you up. You could also nibble at small snacks, but avoid the crunchy ones - the noise could wake up your family. However, if you begin to doze off with the candy in your mouth, take it out - you could choke.
 While you may receive a large boost of energy, it won't sustain you throughout the entire night. You'll eventually find yourself suffering from a sugar crash, and this may result in falling asleep. Hot drinks, such as warm milk, are not recommended either. They will cause your body to relax, and you'll start to feel even more sleepy.

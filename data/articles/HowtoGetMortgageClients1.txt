 Co-marketing is an effective tool that allows you to network with businesses who may either be in the same industry as you or in a complementary industry. Make a list of professionals that you have a working relationship with now or would like to in the future. This could be real estate agents, bankers, or even title companies. While you need to have some common ground with the company you are approaching, you have to ensure that there is no conflict of interest involved.


For example, you would not want to work with a real estate agent who always sends his or her referrals to a relative in the mortgage loan business.;
, Once you chose 2-3 professionals, set up a meeting with each to discuss the benefits of partnering up. The partnership will need to be beneficial to both parties. During the meeting discuss:


Strategy/Opportunity to buy leads online. You can buy addresses, phone numbers and email addresses from lead generation companies such as Hoovers or Avention.
Marketing Options (flyers, Internet ads, etc.)
Creation of product such as an ebook or newsletter (Optional)
Development of a written plan describing roles and responsibilities. For example, who will write direct mail letters, who will post videos on YouTube, who will implement the mobile marketing campaign, who will pay for costs, etc.
 After you have chosen a professional to work with, make sure that you both know what is expected, such as agreeing to share customer leads with each other. Set-up weekly meetings to review progress and measure success.

 You should find out if your bag is made of washable materials. If there are no care instructions, go online or call manufacturer for information before ruining your bag.
 Dust it down to remove any dust, specks, fluff, etc. This is a good time to consider whether spot washing might be a better solution than a whole wash


Check the bottom of your Vera bag for a cardboard insert that helps keep the bag upright. Make sure you take it out before you put it in the washer.(Not all bags have a slit to take the cardboard out.)

, Use only cold water.
 This is the only addition that you need - no detergent

,, Try hanging it on a clothes hanger from a hook in the laundry. Over the laundry sink is a good place to allow it to drip gently.
 This will prevent stains in the future. Whenever you purchase a new Vera Bradley, Scotchgard it from the beginning, to avoid having to wash the bag in the first place.

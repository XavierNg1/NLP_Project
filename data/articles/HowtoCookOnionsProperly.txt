 It takes 40 minutes to achieve a decent tasting onion. Quick cooking leaves the onion in its acrid-tasting state and does not bring out the sweetness hidden within the onion.;
,,, Allow the onion to caramelize in its own natural sugars during this time.

Slice as usual, place in a microwave proof dish and cover it.

Place in the microwave and zap until soft.

Do not add water.

Add the microwaved onions to the pan for preparation as part of your chosen recipe, and they'll already be sweet.

, Some research has shown that drinking only water and limiting yourself to less than 200 calories per day for only 3 days can help you reboot your immune system in addition to dropping some quick pounds.This form of “forced starvation” depletes your energy reserves (in the form of glycogen), which triggers your body to recycle and then create new immune cells once you finish the fast.Warning! Fasting can be harmful, especially for young or old people, or for those with other health problems. If you’re seriously thinking of trying a 3-day fast, you should consult your doctor first.

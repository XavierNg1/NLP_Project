 Pellets and seeds are sold in pet stores specifically for mice. Mice do not require a lot of food. A tablespoon of pellets or seeds per mouse should be enough.Go for a ceramic bowl over a plastic one as these tend to be sturdier and more resistant to chewing.
Pick a smaller bowl. You do not want the bowl to take up a lot of space in your mouse's home.
Make sure to place the food bowl far away from the bathroom area.
 Healthy treats are okay once in awhile and can help with your mouse's health. Dog biscuits or treat branches are good for chewing. You can also give your mouse fresh fruits and vegetables from your own kitchen.Feed your mouse things like greens, blueberries, and apples once a day. Opt for small amounts and chop bigger fruits into pieces to help your mice easily swallow them.
 Mice are nocturnal, so it's best to provide food close to nighttime. You should also provide a continual supply of water at all hours of the day.Make sure to set some kind of alarm or alert. Mice need food every day, so you should not skip meals.

 For older versions of Excel, go to Go to Data > Group and Outline > Auto Outline.



When grouping, Excel looks for data sandwiched between logical bookends (i.e. headings at the beginnings and formula totals at the ends), singles it out, and gives you the option of minimizing it. If Excel informed you that it could not create an automatic outline, it’s because your spreadsheet contains no formulas. You will have to group your data manually (skip to Manually Group Data below).;
, Depending on the complexity and arrangement of your spreadsheet, you will notice that section(s) of your data have become grouped and are now marked by bars along the top and/or left side of the cells. The example spreadsheet is very simple and has only been grouped in one place.

In the example outline, that data between the first row (the header) and the final two rows (both of which contain formulas) has been automatically grouped. Cell B7, for example, contains a SUM formula.


Click on the button to minimize a group of data.


Look at the data that remains. This is usually key information, giving the viewer the option of whether or not to investigate the specifics and making your spreadsheet easier to digest.
 If Excel has misinterpreted your data and you aren’t pleased with the results, you can clear your outline by going to Data > Ungroup (or Group and Outline) and selecting Clear Outline; from here, you manually group and ungroup data (see method below). If it’s close, you may only want to tweak the automatic outline to save yourself time.

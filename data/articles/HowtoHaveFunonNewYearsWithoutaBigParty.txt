 Make sure that the people you do invite are close friends and/or family. That way, you'll know that they're likely to be the people who are fun to be around and fun to spend time with. Choose people who have a positive vibe and like to have a good time.
 Do whatever works best for you but keep it all low key. To save your own time and effort, consider asking every guest to bring a plate of snacks or their favorite meal dish to share. Just be sure to get a balance between main course and desserts, unless you're keen for an all-dessert bash.

Have a few drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Encourage people to drink slowly and keep the champagne for midnight.
Snacks such as chips, nuts and cupcakes are good to have around for guests to help themselves to.
 Keep it low key, not too loud. Choose an interesting selection of music, to match everyone's tastes., You could watch the fireworks from a distance if they can be viewed from your house, watch movies, sit around and chat, look at photos or movies of everyone during the year past, play boardgames or cards, do charades, play Twister, make up stories, do a wine tasting, and whatever else takes your fancy.

Ask the guests ahead of time what they'd be interested in doing at the party. Make it easier by including a list of suggestions, including "Other... please state".
 There's no need to keep staying up unless you really want to. If you're worried about people driving home, let everyone sleep over and have a brunch together the next morning.

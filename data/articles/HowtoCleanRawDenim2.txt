 When you need to wash your raw denim, consider hand washing it. Soaking the denim in the bathtub and washing it by hand can protect it from the harsh cycles of a washing machine. It can also protect it from shrinking.Handwashing is the best option for the first time you wash the raw denim.
 Every time you wash your raw denim, turn them inside out. This helps reduce the color bleeding. Cover the denim completely in cold to lukewarm water.If the jeans float and won’t submerge completely under water, use something to hold them down in the water.
 Use a specific denim wash detergent to clean the denim. This product will be gentle on your raw denim and not mess it up. Let the denim soak in the detergent and water for at least an hour.You may want to dunk the jeans a few times or move the water around.
If you don’t have denim wash, you can use a color protecting gentle detergent.
 After the hour, rinse the denim with cold water. Refill the tub with cold water and let the denim soak in the clean water for around 10 minutes. This should remove all soap or solution.Don’t wring the denim because that may cause damage to the material.
 Remove the jeans from the water. Turn them right side out. Hang them on a surface that will allow them to drip and air dry. Make sure to place them in an area that can catch the dyed water, like outside, or place a bucket underneath them. You may also lay them flat. Leave them until they are completely dry.You may use a towel to blot the excess moisture. Just be aware that the dye may fade and towel fibers may transfer onto the denim.
If you want to wring the water out, do it very carefully so as not to damage the denim. Lay out flat afterwards.

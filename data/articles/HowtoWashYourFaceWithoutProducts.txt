 Never ever touch your face with dirty germy hands. Even though you can't see it, it's there! Wash your hand thoroughly soap.;
, Get a thick, strong headband and move your fringe, bangs or anything on your face out-of-the-way!

, Make sure not a spot is still dry.
 Fill it with water. As fast as you can, splash it with water.
 Do not scrub along your face or you can let it air dry for about 2-4 minutes.
 Fill a bowl up with hot water that steams. Put your face right in front of the water, make sure your nose doesn't touch it. Keep your face there for about 5-7 minutes. The steam from the water opens your pores for a clean face.
 It keeps your skin smooth and prevents it from becoming dehydrated.

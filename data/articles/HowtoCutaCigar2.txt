 A cigar punch just punches a hole through the head of the cigar. There are, however, three different kinds of cigar punches available:


Bullet punch: Fits on a keychain, it twists to expose a circular blade that cuts into the head of the cigar.
Havana punch: Safer than a bullet punch, it has a recessed tip that can be fitted into the cigar head, and which draws out the tobacco plug after a cut is made.
Multi-punch: Offers more sizes for punching different sizes of cigars.
, the cut portion will come out as well.

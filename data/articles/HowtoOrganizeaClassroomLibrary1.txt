 For an elementary school reading library, shelves with only two rows are best. You can use the top of the shelf for display items, and the children will be able to reach al the books.Use half shelves to section off one portion of the classroom for quiet reading time. You'll be able to see over the shelves easily, so you can watch over the kids using the area.
 If you have a limited area to work with, consider tall, slender shelving units. Alternatively, you can use revolving racks that house a large number of books in a small area., Books for small children are often oversized, so they may not fit on regular book shelves. They are also usually slender books, so it can be difficult to read the titles on the spines. A system of storage bins works much better for these, and the kids will find it easier to access them.

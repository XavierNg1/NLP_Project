If your a kitten, say something like "The small kitten playfully tackled his/her siblings.", If a bear attacks you in your roleplay, say something like " Tackles the bear, sinking claws into it's neck." Or, if your attacking another cat, say something like "The stray cat pounced on the other cat, biting it's neck." You need to be strong while roleplaying!, Don't be useless and say "The stray cat backed away, and ran off," because the enemy could follow you.

 When you’ve skipped a school day, your school will want to know where you’ve been. Write a pretend note from your parents to explain why you missed a day.


You can choose any excuse that sounds real, like you had to go to a funeral, had a dentist appointment, or that a pet died.
Type the note instead of writing it by hand. Your handwriting probably doesn’t look like an adult’s handwriting to a teacher, so it won’t be convincing. Typing the note is safer, and it will also look more official.
 Make up really good details about the day you had when you were out of school - what happened, who you saw, how you felt. Then, use those details to have a conversation with your friends in earshot of a teacher.


Say things about how sad it was to see so many crying people at a funeral, or how long and annoying it was to get your teeth cleaned at the dentist.
 Most teachers know that kids skip school to get out of doing work, so your teachers will never guess that you skipped if you ask for makeup work the next day. This will also make you look a like a responsible student.


To make it even more believable, act like you really want to do the work, even if you don’t.

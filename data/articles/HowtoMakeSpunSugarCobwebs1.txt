 Before your begin making spun sugar cobwebs, you will need to prepare your workspace. Take a large sheet of parchment paper or baking sheet and set it out on the countertop where you will be working. This will be the surface you will use to construct your spun sugar cobwebs., You will use an upside down bowl as the surface upon which you will shape your spun sugar cobwebs. If you want to create spun sugar cobwebs for cupcakes, use a small bowl like a cereal or fruit bowl. If you want to create a large spun sugar cobweb for a cake or pie, use a large bowl similar in size to your cake or pie.


Use a glass, glazed ceramic, or rimless metal bowl. These material types will prevent the spun sugar cobwebs from sticking to their surface.
 It is important that you grease or oil the bottom and outside of the bowl. This step will ensure your spun sugar cobwebs don’t stick. Place a few drops of vegetable oil on your fingers. Lightly oil the bottom and outsides of the bowl by rubbing your fingers in small circles over the bowl’s outer surfaces until completely oiled.
 You will need a bowl of ice water to cool your sugar syrup in prior to making the spun sugar cobwebs. This bowl should be large enough to fit a small saucepan. Fill the bowl halfway with water and then add 10-15 ice cubes. Set aside.

 This includes her grooming products, such as make-up, hair products, shampoo, shaving gel, hairbrush, and toothbrush.If your roommate is a girl, try on her make-up and use a lot of it while she's gone. Find the one thing she uses on a daily basis and use it ever so subtly. The best way to annoy a roommate is to let things subtly build up over time.


If your roommate is a boy, use up his shaving gel, aftershave, or deodorant.
 Every once in awhile pop open one of her cans of pop and start eating some of her chips. It doesn’t matter if she is home or not. Sooner or later your roommate will start to notice her food and drinks are disappearing.If you do eat her food in front of you, be prepared to be confronted by her.
Some roommates are okay with sharing food and wouldn’t be bothered by this.
 When she is out of the house go through her wardrobe and try on some of her clothes.If they look nice on you, wear them out to class or the park. Don’t deliberately get her clothes dirty or stained. The point is for her to spot you out wearing her clothing.
 Start little by little, just moving some stuff around. Then start to take things and hide them. When she asks if you know where her stuff is just say, "I’m not sure. I haven’t touched it"

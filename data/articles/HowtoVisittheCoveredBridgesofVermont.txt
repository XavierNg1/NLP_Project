 Vermont is directly south of the Canadian border, east of New York State (look for Lake Champlain), west of New Hampshire, and north of Massachusetts. http://www.mapquest.com/mq/3-i1zG;
, Covered bridges were roofed and enclosed to protect the wooden structural elements from the weather, which in Vermont can be quite harsh. Structures such as these were an commonsense approach to make sure the bridge lasted a long time. As with the rest of the country, covered bridges have gradually been replaced as the result of expanding highway systems, intensive commercial development, and often physical neglect. Still, Vermont has the greatest concentration of covered bridges in the USA, and in the recent past has become dedicated to their preservation. Vermont law now protects all covered bridges and none can be torn down without the permission of the Governor and the Board of Historic Sites.What once was regarded as a symbol of lack of progress is now often the pride and centerpiece of Vermont towns.
 Not every Vermont city or town has a covered bridge. Some, however, have many. Check out such sites as:

, You can make the bridge or bridges your choose your destination. However, touring covered bridges easily folds into bicycle tours, photography safaris, and stops on the way to other Vermont attractions.

 Once you decide that you “like” someone, go for it. Observer her without staring or being too creepy. Take mental notes of things she says in the classroom. See who her group of friends are. Notice if she hangs out with a boy already.Do not begin to stalk this girl, or else you may get a bad reputation.
 A good way to get her to take notice of you, is to begin asking questions about her. Her friend will definitely tell the girl that you are asking about her. Regardless of how she feels about you, this will flatter her. You could potentially ask something like:


”What does Samantha like to do on the weekends?”
”Do you know if Jasmine has a favorite book?”
”Does Jamie have a boyfriend?”

, You need to put yourself out there and that involves being vulnerable to being made fun of. You can combat feeling embarrassed by having a positive outlook on your actions. If you are asking about a girl you like, then you’re acting normal.


People who tease you for this are insecure that they don’t have the courage to talk to the ones they like., Never talk down about the girl you like when confronted about your feelings. Stand up for her and yourself. It is easy for some to try to back out of liking someone when they are in the spotlight. Say nice things about her and she’ll appreciate your respect.Remember the point is for the girl to like you and not for a group of kids to like you.

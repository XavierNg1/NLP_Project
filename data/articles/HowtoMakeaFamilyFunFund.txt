, There are special times that you can aim towards for the end date of the fund. Or, you can just get going now and use any time of the year. Special times of the year to aim for include:


Christmas time (this is a great time if a vacation is to follow)
An anniversary of a family-important occasion
A birthday
The birth of a baby
The return of a family member from overseas
The start of a long vacation period

, This isn't necessary, as you might prefer to have a spontaneous pot of money available to spend on anything but it can make it more exciting and motivational to have a goal to save for. For example, a family holiday, an enhancement to an outdoor area, a large electronic item such as a new TV or computer, etc. are some things to consider.
 Consider making a jar with a label and place it somewhere accessible in the house but out of sight.
 The amount can be decided in advance, or can be based on what people have left over. It is a sensible idea to bank the savings regularly to avoid loss if you are burgled. You might need to open a special account just for this.

 Click the "Apple button" in the upper left corner of your screen. Select "About This Mac". Click "More Info." If your Mac is one of the following models, you can run Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) :


iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)
MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)
MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)
MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)
Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)
Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)
Xserve (Early 2009);
, From the same "About This Mac" screen, check what version of OS X is currently on your computer . If you are running Lion (10.7.x) you can directly upgrade to Mountain lion.


If you are currently running OS X Leopard or an older operating system, first you need to upgrade to OS X Snow Leopard, before you can upgrade to Mountain Lion. You can do this at the apple store or here http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard .
 Update to the latest version of OS X Snow Leopard before you purchase Mountain Lion . To do this click the "Apple icon" and click "Software Update" to install Snow Leopard v10.6.8 and enter credentials if prompted .

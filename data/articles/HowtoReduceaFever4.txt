General weakness
Warm body
Shivering
Sweating
Depending on the cause of the fever, you may also see any of the following symptoms: headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, or dehydration.
 Children's bodies are more sensitive to the effects of fevers than adults’ bodies are. Call the doctor in the following cases:You have an infant under three months old with a fever over 100.4 °F (38.0 °C)
You have a baby three to six months old with a fever greater than 102 °F (39 °C).

You or another adult have a fever of 103 °F (39 °C) or higher, particularly in conjunction with excessive drowsiness or irritability.
 A fever that lasts more than two or three days may be a sign of a deeper problem that needs to be treated separately. Don't try to diagnose yourself or your child; go to the doctor to get it checked out. You should see the doctor if:The fever stays longer than 24 hours in a child under 2
The fever stays for 72 hours (3 days) in any child over 2
The fever persists past 3 days in an adult

 Warm clothing, especially when it's layered, not only prevents exposure, it also helps retain body heat.


Wear a warm hat and thick socks. We lose most of our body heat through our head, hand and feet.
Layer your clothing. Long underwear is thin, so it fits easily under most everyday clothing, including jeans and shirt. Bundle up with a fleece or a woolen sweater for extra warmth.
Wear comfortable pajamas, thick socks and heavy clothing while you are inside a private house.;

Keep blankets on your couch so that you can wrap yourself up while reading or watching TV, and get extra blankets to sleep with.
 Water retains heat for a long time, making hot water bottles an affordable and effective way to stay warm. You can use one while sitting at your desk or watching television, and a water bottle under the blankets will keep your bed warm through the night.
 Delicious winter soups and hot cocoa are part of the fun of the season. Hot tea and coffee, and substantial foods like pizza, meat and toast will keep your body warm as well.
 They're a nice way to relax your muscles, especially after a stressful day, and can warm you up in no time. If you really want to relax, add some candles and soothing music. Be sure to dry off well afterwards.



Find a place to get cozy, wrap yourself in army-style 100% wool thick blankets and slowly but surely your trapped body heat will warm you right up!
Get up and get moving! An active body heats up quickly – run, dance, jump until you break a sweat. You can jump for a few minutes, ride an exercise cycle or dance to your favorite music. And if you don’t mind being a little cold at first, a mile’s walk around the neighborhood will get you sweating pretty quickly.
Use other people’s body heat: big holiday parties warm a house quickly, thanks to the body heat generated by the many guests. Snuggling also works, so cuddle up with your honey. Don’t have a honey? Maybe you’ll meet someone beneath the mistletoe at that holiday party!

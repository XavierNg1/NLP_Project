 Some cats prefer hunting on the ground and as a result enjoy playing with ground toys. This may be because the cat feels it can remain hidden while playing on the ground and stalking toys. Alternatively, it could be due to physical restraints. An overweight cat will not be able to jump through the air chasing after toys.If your cat enjoys ground play, try dragging a toy along the ground. Move the toy slowly and then quickly across the floor so your cat can stalk, and then pounce on the toy.;
, Many cats enjoy hunting birds or flying insects, such as butterflies. In order to mimic hunting through the air, you can use a wand or feather toy. Dangle the toy in the air so that your cat can leap and jump to catch the toy.Play in a safe space with lots of room so that your cat does not get injured while jumping.
 Your cat’s play preference may change as they become older and less mobile. Alternatively, your cat may become bored if you only ever engage in one style of play. Even if your cat has a preferred style, you should always mix up your play strategy. This will keep your cat engaged and you will notice if your cat’s play preference changes.
 This will provide your cat with a reward and will keep them engaged in the game. If the cat is never able to catch the “prey” they may become frustrated and bored.It is always a good idea to end a play session after your cat catches the toy.

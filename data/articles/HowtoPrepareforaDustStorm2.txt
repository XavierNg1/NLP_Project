 Don't stay outdoors during a dust storm intentionally. If hear a dust storm warning don't ignore it. If you have any way to get inside a building, do it quickly.Well-sealed buildings are ideal but any structures that will withstand the storm and give you some protection are best.
 If you cannot get inside a building or a car, find a location that is relatively protected from the storm. This could be against the side of a building or under a piece of vegetation, whatever you can find. Just be sure to stay off roads and out of areas that may be more dangerous than helpful.


Avoid laying in ditches or dry riverbeds for protection. Dust storms are often followed by thunderstorms, so you protected area may quickly become a spot for flash flooding., Most importantly, find something to protect your breathing. If you cannot get inside, find something to breathe through before the storm hits. Ideally this would be a particulate filter mask but any dust mask or thick piece of clothing will suffice.


Cloth will not keep all particulates out of your respiratory system but it is better than nothing. It will help to keep large particulates out and will help you get the oxygen you need to breathe and survive.
Although you shouldn't, if you are determined to go outside in a severe dust storm, then you should wear a particulate filter mask and airtight goggles to protect your mouth, nose, and eyes. This will help to assure that you do not inhale the dust, which is dangerous for your health and can cause serious breathing problems and even death., Before the storm actually hits, or as soon as possible, you should cover up your face. This will allow you to keep breathing and to avoid damage to your eyes.In addition, if you have a hat or piece of clothing that you can cover your ears with, do that. Dust from a dust storm can easily get in your ears and clog them. However, don't protect your ears over protecting your eyes, nose, and mouth.

 Take note of any ingredients that can be portioned easily.


Butter, for example, usually comes in a 4 ounce stick. So if the recipe calls for 6 oz of butter, use 1 1/2 sticks. If 3 oz is required, use 3/4 of a stick of butter.
Chocolate for brownies, for example, come in blocks with the weight published on the packaging. Break up the block of chocolate in the appropriate portion to obtain the amount required. For example, a block of chocolate may be 8 oz or 250 gms. If the recipe calls for 200 gms, break it up into 5 portions and use 4 portions of it. 200/250 = 4/5.;

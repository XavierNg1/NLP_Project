 Buying a pencil case will help you keep your pencils all together.;
, Use masking tape to write your name or something to know that it's yours. If you don't want to do that you can also use little rubber bands and tie them on. Just anything to let you know that it belongs to you.
 Make sure everything is in!

, Never leave one behind. After every period you should make sure what you used is back in the case where it belongs.
 After the end of the school day or whenever you have time try looking for it. Remember it is easier because you have marked your pencil so you know it is yours.
 It might turn up. If it doesn't, oh well. Just work harder next time.
 It will make your life easier.
 Keep only 2-3 pencils in your pencil pouch so that you honestly don't have pencils to give to the pleading classmate (and you won't feel bad for lying to them later on). But if you really can't say no to your pencil-less pal, keep a pencil in your case that you don't mind losing and use it as a loner pencil to give to others.
 Such as, simple routine, and set a reminder after each hour/period. Or whenever you use your pencil/pen.

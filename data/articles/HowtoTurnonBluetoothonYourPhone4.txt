 Many times your phone, like a computer, can overheat or simply be running for too long of a period. Sometimes we don't think of our phones as a computer, but phones can benefit from a simply reboot. After turning off your device, wait one minute before restarting it.


Sometimes your phone only needs a soft reset and can be fixed by turning on and off "airplane mode".You could also try to reset your settings. This will not erase your data and applications on an iPhone.When resetting your settings on a Windows or Android phone, you will lose your data and contacts.If you're one of the latter users, then back up your device to a computer before resetting your settings.
 Do you ignore your phone's alerts about an update? Well many of us do, and usually they send updates in order to fix certain glitches, like not being able to turn on Bluetooth.


You'll often need to either be connected to a computer or WIFI to preform an update. This process takes some time, so be ready with you're charger nearby.
 If you are having trouble with a device you've already paired your phone with, try starting from scratch.An issue might appear to be a matter of whether your phone's Bluetooth is on or not, but really you need to re-connect your phone to the device.


For Apple phones, tap the device and click "Forget this Device".For Android phones, tap the device name and click "Unpair".For Windows phones, tap and hold the name of the device, and then press "delete".

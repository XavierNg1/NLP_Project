 Crawfish will die if storied in water for too long, so leave them in the air.;
, Live crawfish can be kept at 36ºF to 46ºF for a few days. Drain them as needed, so you aren't leaving them submerged in water.


Be sure to remove the ice and let the crawfish return to room temperature before purging and cooking.
 Make sure your container has enough room to thoroughly clean them. Also make sure they won't be able to somehow crawl out.

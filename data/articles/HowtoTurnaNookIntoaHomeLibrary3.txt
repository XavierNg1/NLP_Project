 Book lice are attracted to dust filled corners and termites are attracted to dirty bookshelves. Silverfish and mice are also attracted to the glue and other materials in books.
 This will keep your books free of dust bunnies and other dirt. Cleaning your library should be a priority to ensure that you do not cause any damage to your books.


If you find an infestation in your books, you can place your books in a sealed plastic bag and stick them in the freezer to kill the insects.
 If that is not possible, you can use an air conditioner or a dehumidifier to control the moisture in the air.
 Try to keep your books organized according to your chosen filing system. Keep track of books that are borrowed in a small register on your library desk or table.

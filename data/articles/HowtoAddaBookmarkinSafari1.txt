 While you can manually add bookmarks for any site to Safari, the quickest way to do it is to load the page that you want to bookmark.;
, By default, bookmarks are added to your Bookmark Bar, which is located directly underneath the address bar. If your Bookmarks Bar is hidden, click View → Show Bookmarks Bar. There are a few different ways that you can add the page you are visiting to your bookmarks:


Click the Bookmarks menu and select "Add Bookmark..."
Click and drag the site's icon from the address bar into your Bookmarks Bar.
Press ⌘ Command+D


, When you add a bookmark, you will be able to edit the details before it is added. Safari will use the page's title as the default name for the bookmark, but you can change it to whatever you'd like. For example, many websites have a tagline attached to the title. Removing this from your bookmark's name will make your bookmark list less cluttered.


You can choose alternate locations for your new bookmark as well. By default, it will be placed in the Bookmark Bar, but you can place it in a different folder.
 When you have a lot of bookmarks, things can get lost or shuffled pretty easily. The Bookmark Bar can only display so many bookmarks, so creating multiple collections of bookmarks can save you a lot of headache.


Open the bookmark manager by clicking the Bookmarks menu and selecting Edit Bookmarks, or by pressing ⌥ Option+⌘ Command+B

Use this menu to organize your bookmarks by clicking and dragging them to new locations and creating folders to help your bookmarks structure.

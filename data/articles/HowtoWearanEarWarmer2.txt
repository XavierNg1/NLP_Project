 Brush your hair before putting on your ear warmer to remove any knots. Use your hands to fluff out your hair and to give it volume. If you have curly hair, you can use your hands instead of a brush so that it keeps its natural form. People with shorter hair can part their bangs on one side.


Longer hair or hair that tangles easily are styles that are the most prone to get messed up by wearing ear warmers.
 If you are wearing a headband-style ear warmer, putting your hair up in a bun will make it easier to fit the ear warmer over your head without messing up your hair. Use a hair tie or hair clip to give yourself a high ponytail or bun before you put on your headband ear warmer.


You can also use a jaw clip to put up a portion of your hair while the rest of it hangs. This will give you a more bohemian look.
Putting your hair up is not required, but can help prevent messing up long hair.
 Stretch out your headband ear warmer by pulling it apart from both ends. Hold it above your head and lower your hands so that it slides down and is around your neck. Once it's around your neck, position it so that the front of the head warmer pointing towards the front of your body.


If your headband attaches via a button on the back, you can skip this step.
Most headbands will have a embellishments or logos on the front side.
Knitted headbands are typically thicker in the front and smaller in the back.
 Finish by pulling your headband up over your forehead. Your ear warmer should be at an angle and cover both your forehead and your ears. If your headband attaches by a button in the back, instead of pulling your headband around your neck and up onto your forehead, you can simply attach the headband to your head on an angle and button the back to secure it. If you've put your hair up, then make sure that the back of the ear warmer falls below your bun or ponytail.


If you put your hair in a ponytail or bun, you can let it down over the ear warmer or just keep it up.

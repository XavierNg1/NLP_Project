 Many contemporary churches now have websites that will display the dress code for church goers to read.Before you attend service, make sure to research the church online and see if you have clothes that meet the dress-code.


Many churches will have photos of service on their site. If people in the photos are dressed casually, there’s a good chance that the church has a loose dress code.
 There are many contemporary churches that encourage their congregation to “come as you are” or “dress how you choose.” Dress up the first time you attend a new church and determine how you should dress based on the majority of people around you.


In some contemporary churches, dressing casually is completely acceptable, although some may still frown upon it.Dressing casually the first time you go to a new church could mean that you stand out and look silly among the rest of the dressed-up church goers.
 If you attend church with your family, you can try to get their opinion on the dress code for your specific church. If not, then you can ask other people, after service is over, to get a better feeling for how your specific church expects its members to dress.


Try to meet new people by opening up conversation. Try to work the questions about dress code into the conversation.
If you have friends who go to the same church, you can ask them via text or give them a call on the phone.
 The best source of information about about dress codes is someone that works in the church. Your clergy leader will be able to tell you what they think appropriate dress is.


Many churches will list their phone number on their website.If you have the opportunity, try to speak to your faith leader before or after service.

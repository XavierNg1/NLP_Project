 Before you leave for vacation, have your pet get a check up to ensure all vaccinations are up to date, and to make sure the animal is in good health.


Talk to your vet about your vacation destination. Some locations may require extra precautions if there are dangerous conditions. For example, a heavily wooded beach area might require a vaccination against Lyme Disease.;

Get a crate to accommodate your pet if you are flying. Most airlines will not allow you to carry a pet onto the plane unless it is very small and will not disturb other passengers who may have allergies.
Make frequent stops if you travel by car or RV. Let your pet get some fresh air and exercise. Stops can also provide an opportunity to give your pet food and water, and allow the animal to relieve itself.
 Most accommodations will advertise themselves as pet-friendly on their websites.

Check sites such as Petfriendlytravel.com and Petswelcome.com for lists of pet-friendly hotels, resorts, house rentals and bed and breakfast facilities.
Expect to pay a pet deposit. Most hotels charge pet deposits of between $10 and $30 per night.
Consider camping on the beach. This is a good way to keep your pet close. You can find a campground, a beach cabin or an RV site along many coastlines.
 California has the most pet-friendly beaches in America.


Check the beach's website, or the parks and recreation department of the city where you will be traveling. They will tell you about any restrictions on pets at the local beaches.
 Most beaches will require you to keep your pet on a leash or in a harness.
 This is especially important on the beach, where many people are walking, running, sunbathing, and swimming.
 Being in the sun and getting extra exercise means more water is necessary.

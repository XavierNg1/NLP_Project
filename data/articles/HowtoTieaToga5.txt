 While standing, hold the sheet horizontally in front of you. Fold the sheet widthwise until it is the proper length. It should cover from your armpits to your legs. How much, or little, of your legs you cover, depends on what you want.
 Holding the folded sheet horizontally in front of you, first wrap one side around your chest and then the other side - like a towel. Leave 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) of one corner loose at the front of your body.
 Twist the 4 foot (1.2 m) length a few times to make a sort of rope. Run this twisted sheet over your shoulder and behind your neck. Tie the end of the twist to the sheet running across your chest.
 Spend some time smoothing the layers and folds. Then pin the toga onto your tube top. Take extra time to pin the halter securely.
 Tie a belt or rope just under the bust or at the natural waist.

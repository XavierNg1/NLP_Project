 Rather than jumping right back up on your horse, you’ll be better off if you take a minute to assess your situation. Take note of any symptoms of shock, such as sweating, weakness, and dizziness. If you experience any symptoms of shock, bleeding, or feel any pain or weakness, you should call your local emergency phone number. However, if you feel fine, you can take five minutes to relax and catch your breath., If you are not in shock and have not experienced any major injury, you can slowly get back up. Feel your limbs to make sure you haven’t sprained anything. Take note of any bruises or scrapes. If you feel up to it, you can go and retrieve your horse.If you feel okay but not quite up to retrieving your horse, you could ask a fellow rider to do it.
 If you aren't injured, consider getting back in the saddle right away. By getting back on the horse and finishing your ride, you can end the ride on a good note!If you are working with a green or difficult horse, it's important for them to understand that throwing you will not get them what they want.
If you aren't going to ride any more, spend some time walking with your horse, removing its tack, grooming, and talking to it after the accident.

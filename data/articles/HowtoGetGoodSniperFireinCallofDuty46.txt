 Do not even bother to attempt this in Core, as the lack of Stopping Power will make it impossible to achieve any real success. If however you want to try it anyway, the Dragunov is the gun to use in Core. M21 should only be used in Hardcore. You MUST know the map. Learn it better than the developers. Learn where the unused routes are, the tricky lines of sight to a common camping spot. Playing a mobile sniper is almost like playing a stealth sniper. In fact, it's exactly like it.

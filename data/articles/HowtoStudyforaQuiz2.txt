 Don’t just go over your study materials once, but three or four times. Repetition is key here. Review the information until you have grasped the important concepts.For example, if you made flash cards, review these once a day for a week before your quiz day. As you review your flash cards, repeat important concepts and dates out loud.
 Try not to wait until the last minute to study for your quiz. Study at least one week in advance. This way, you have enough time to review your notes and flash cards more than once. It will also give you time to ask your teacher questions to clarify concepts you don’t fully understand.For example, if you have a quiz on Tuesday, begin reviewing your notes and creating flash cards the Tuesday before.
 Discuss the information you are learning with friends or family members. Story telling can be very useful here. By presenting the information to your friends in the form of a story, you will connect the information with visual imagery. This will help you recall important information during the quiz.If you need to learn about an important person for your quiz, for example, then tell your friends an exciting story about the person.

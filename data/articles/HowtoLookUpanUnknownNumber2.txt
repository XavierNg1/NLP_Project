 If you have downloaded the Facebook application on your mobile phone, you can use this to identify an unknown number. The Facebook app sometimes scans your contacts or those who've called you. If you skim through the "People You May Know" search bar on Facebook, Facebook may have added the caller to your list.This option usually works best if you have some idea of who might be trying to contact you.
 Many different phone apps are available for both Android and iPhones. Phone apps use search engines and their personal databases to identify callers. Some phone apps also allow you to block spam calls altogether.


Some apps may take up a lot of data. If an app is very big, you may want to avoid using it unless you frequently get unknown calls.
 Some phone apps allow to install CallerID in your smartphone. CallerID can instantly recognize numbers and provide information like names, city, and state for most calls. If the CallerID app cannot provide a name, it can provide some general information as the call is coming in that can help you decide whether or not pick up your phone. Calls are usually identified with some kind of pop up notification, but this varies depending on the app.

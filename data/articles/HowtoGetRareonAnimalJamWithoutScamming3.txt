 Try to get lots of adventure den items.
 Dance and say "shop/store my den". Jammers will go to your den. You will see some will stand near an item saying, "mine". This means they want to trade you for it.
 Or, you can say, "I only accept rares". Be nice about it though.
 Repeat as often as needed.

 This form of renewable energy uses water falling from a height to produce energy. It is usually sourced from large commercially produced dams and sold to you via a power company; hydro-power schemes cost a lot to put in place but once built, they last for a long time.
 This will only be an option in areas where there is a good water supply and the infrastructure has been put in place.
 If you have a stream that runs regularly and strongly through your property, it may be possible to install a micro-hydro system. Look online for retailers and ask plenty of questions about the effectiveness of this system for your terrain and water availability.

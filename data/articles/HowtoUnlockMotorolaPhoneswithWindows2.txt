 There is no reason to unlock a phone that is not a GSM phone, as only these phones can be used on different networks.
 To test your phone's lock:


Insert a new sim card.
If you get a message along the lines of "Enter Subsidy Password", "Contact Service Provider" or "Enter Unlock Code" then your phone is locked.

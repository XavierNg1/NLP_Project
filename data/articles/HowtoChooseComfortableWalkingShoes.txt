 So, you will need a flexible sole and more bend in the toe than a runner. You should be able to twist and bend the toe area. Manufacturers like New Balance and Brooks make specialized shoes for walkers.;
, The last thing you want is a heavy walking shoe.
 Be sure your foot has enough room in the toe box. There should be a thumbnails width (or about a half inch) between your toes and the end of the shoe. The shoe should be wide enough in the toe that your toes can move freely. Your heel should not slip, and the shoe should not pinch or bind, especially across the arch or ball of your foot.
 Also be sure to wear the same socks you will be wearing during your walks. This can make a huge difference in how the shoe fits. Try on both shoes. Your feet may not be the same size (really!).
 It is worth the effort to find the right shoe for you and it is worth spending a few extra dollars.
 Don't venture outdoors until you are sure the shoes are going to work for you. (If the shoes are not going to work out you will want to exchange them before scuffing them up outside.)

, (If you are wearing very light weight shoes, are overweight, or you are hard on your shoes stay toward the low end on mileage.) To extend the life of your shoes be sure to only wear them only for your walks. Also rotating two pair of shoes will give them time to "bounce back" between walks.
 Your feet and legs will thank you for it.

 The aloe vera plant has many therapeutic properties, including treating burns, cuts, and infections. It is also effective on oily skin and acne.


Cut an aloe leaf in half and squeeze out the gel.
Apply the gel evenly over your face.
Allow the gel to dry. After it dries, rinse it off with cool water.
This can be repeated two or three times a day.
 Yogurt helps open up pores, exfoliate the skin, and absorb excess oil.


Take one tablespoon of plain yogurt and spread it evenly over your face.
Leave the yogurt on for 15 minutes, then rinse off with cold water.
Repeat once a day.
 Cucumbers are often applied during facials and spa treatments because of their soothing properties. They contain vitamins and minerals that can help fight swelling, redness, and excess oil.


Slice up a fresh cucumber and rub the slices on your face.
Leave this on your face overnight, rinsing with warm water in the morning.
Repeat daily.

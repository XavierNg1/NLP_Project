Airway. The victim must have a patent airway. There can be no obstruction and air should freely move in and out. Without a patent airway, nothing else matters. If the patient cannot get oxygen, the patient will not have a heartbeat much longer.
Breathing. After you have ensured a patent airway, check the victim to see if she is breathing on her own. If she is not, you will have to breathe for her. If you do not have a bag-valve-mask, start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Circulation. When you are checking for breathing, you will also need to check for a pulse or a heartbeat. If one is not detected, you will need to start CPR immediately.;
, Once these are stabilized, you will need to make sure that there is no major bleeding that needs to be controlled.
 Feel the C1 through C4 vertebra. These start from the base of the skull to the shoulders. You are looking for swelling, tenderness or crepitus. Be gentle.
 Look for bruising or clear fluid leaking from the ears.
 Again, you are feeling for pain, tenderness or swelling.
 Trauma in this area would have been significantly severe if these strong bones were damaged.
 The victim will have major anxiety and not knowing what you are doing only adds to this. Speak to the victim in a calm, reassuring voice, explaining what you are doing while you are doing it. This goes a long way in keeping the victim calm and relaxed.
 Hold the victim's head and keep it perfectly still. The neck should stay in line with the axis of the spine. 3 other rescuers should take their positions alongside the victim's body. The 4th should stand by waiting to move the backboard into place.
 Log roll her back onto the backboard and secure her head, shoulders, abdomen and legs. Once the victim is completely immobilized to the board, move her onto a cot and transport her to the nearest hospital.

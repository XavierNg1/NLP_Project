 You can either ask him/her directly or ask your partner's friends if he/she would enjoy a specific activity. If your date is expecting the classic dinner and a movie, he/she might not be thrilled with the idea of playing tennis or going bowling.


Active first dates are good ways to break the ice, if you don't know your partner very well.
 Play a round of laser-tag, mini-golf, or go bowling. You and your date can be as competitive as you like when it comes to keeping score. This low-stress activity can be great for first date jitters since you'll be in a casual atmosphere.See if your bowling alley or laser-tag company offers any special features, such as black light nights.
 Be sure to determine your date's skill level and preferences when it comes to hiking. Choose a trail that allows you to talk and enjoy each other's company, nothing too strenuous. Bring water and let your date know to wear comfortable shoes.


Consider packing a meal for your hike. Look for nice places to stop and eat or wait till you reach the end of the trail. You can tailor your picnic to be as casual or romantic as you like.

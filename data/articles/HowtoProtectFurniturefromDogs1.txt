 Exercise will stimulate your dog mentally and physically; allowing your dog to burn energy that may otherwise be directed toward chewing furniture.


The amount of exercise your dog should receive will vary on the breed and size of your dog. Most dogs will require between 30 and 60 minutes of continuous exercise that can include walking, playing fetch, running, or tug-of-war.
Consult with your dog's veterinarian to find out exactly how much daily exercise your dog should receive based on their size and breed.
If you are unable to exercise your dog on a daily basis, hire a dog-walker or pet-sitter that can perform this task for you.;
, Your dog should have a variety of toys for different types of activities.


Purchase toys to help keep your dog active; such as tennis balls they can chase, rope toys they can swing or toss around, or toys and bones made of materials that are difficult to chew, like nylon.
Purchase specific toys that may comfort your dog if they are feeling lonely while you are away from home. Examples of comfort toys are soft, stuffed, plush toys or items that carry your scent that you don't mind your dog having; such as an old, unwashed t-shirt you no longer want.
Buy toys specifically designed for hiding dog treats inside of them. These toys can be used as a distraction for your dog if you ever see them start to chew on your furniture.



Place your dog in an enclosed yard with a fence, or in a dog run; each of which will allow your dog to roam freely without damaging any valuable items or furniture.
You can also place your dog and their toys in a room without furniture to prevent them from causing any damage.

 Alright, so maybe your target is one of those folks that is heavily anti-social networking and prides himself on having a non-existent Google results number. What do you do then?


Rack your brain. Who do you know that might have a lead? Did you both hang out with Edwin your sophomore year of college every Wednesday for pints and pizza? Maybe he knows where John is! You might have to hit up an old friend you haven't spoken to in years, but the effort could pay off.
 So you can't seem to think of any mutual friends that know the whereabouts of your mystery person. Now you may have to do the dirty work. This works best if your target has stayed reasonably local.


Think of the last place you knew they lived, worked, and frequented. If the government can track and find people, you might as well give it a shot! See if you can stumble across someone who knew them by recreating their steps. They may be able to point you in the right direction.
 Alright, so this one may be a tad much, but if you have money to burn, why not? A PI can do all the dirty work for you while you sit back and enjoy not sifting through Google result after Google result.


A PI can have a hefty fee and some people may not be too thrilled that they're being stalked by someone who you paid to do so. This option is only legitimate in the most extreme of cases.

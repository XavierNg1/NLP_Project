 You can see a writer's personality in their writing. Reading books also helps you gain knowledge. To look like a writer you need to be able to back it up.
 Writers are very unconventional people. If someone doesn't like you, then don't take it too seriously. Writers have a booming personality, so some others are bound not to like you. Writers must be comfortable and confident in themselves; criticism of your work will be typical, and you need to know how to weather it and stay whole.
 Everyone wants to look up to a writer... they're those people you admire for their style, charisma, attitude, and ability.
 A good writer is a mixture of people-person and solitude seeker. People-watching is key to your craft, while finding time alone is essential for writing uninterrupted and unimpeded by other's opinions and views. Find a good balance between being around people and being in solitude.
 Most writers brainstorm by jotting things down such as what they see, hear, feel and think, and look for inspiration everywhere. Everything is inspiration to a writer. Even wear a pencil behind your ear.
 Show your passion for what you write about.

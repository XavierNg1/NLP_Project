 The space doesn't have to be large, but it helps to feel comfortable, not cramped. You may sit, stand, or lie down, as you prefer.;
, Bedrooms are generally not a good place to meditate, especially if you meditate in the morning. Move to another quiet room or nook.


If you don't have another comfortable place to meditate, you can set aside an area of your bedroom to be used only for meditation or worship.
 Choose a place where you can expect privacy for the duration of your meditation. Avoid places with noise, television screens, and other distractions. Keep the area clean and free from clutter, even when you are not using it.
 Some people prefer to sit on a cushion (zafu in Zen Buddhist tradition) or other special object used only for meditating. This and other materials are completely optional, but include them in your meditation area if they help.


If you have an appointment you need to make, have a stop watch or phone set to notify you when you need to stop meditating.
You don't need the picture-perfect meditation set up. Incense and mood lighting are entirely optional.
 All you really need to meditate is the desire to do it. Setting up a meditation area can help, especially for beginners, but don't use noise or discomfort as an excuse not to try it. Meditation can happen anywhere.
 The natural silence of the early morning can be the perfect catalyst for meditation. Wake up, wash your face, and go to your meditation spot.
 Many people meditate because it's on the schedule, or because it's supposed to be good for them. Going through the motions like this makes it difficult to benefit from the experience. Find the time to meditate when you want to meditate. Set aside the excuses for why you can't do it, give it an honest effort, and it will become easier.
 Close your eyes and concentrate on:


Being peaceful
Rejoicing
Vibrancy, or feeling full of enlightenment

, Try to forget the memory of any bad moods and negative thoughts. Clear your head.

 If you think your partner is having an emotional affair, ask them. See if they get defensive, evade, or get upset. If you don't feel comfortable outright asking, you may choose to instead ask questions about the other person.Try not to accuse your partner of anything. Instead, say, "I feel you are spending a lot of time with this person. This hurts me because you are my partner, and I feel like we are not as close as we used to be."

, During this conversation, you should remain calm. You will not get anywhere if you are both angry. If your partner denies or admits the closeness to this other person, don't yell and get upset. Instead, take a deep breath before responding.If your partner denies everything, then take the opportunity to discuss the problem in your relationship, like how you feel emotional distance or feel neglected.
 You may want to figure out why you believe your partner is doing this in the first place. Have they had an emotional or physical affair before? Have other people noticed your partner's behavior? Is this based on your own issues? Determining this can help you figure out how to proceed.


Examine your own feelings. Are you jealous by nature? Are you insecure? Have you been cheated on in the past? These things may make you more sensitive and suspicious.
Talk to your partner about your feelings. Sharing your insecurities or past can help you build a stronger future.
You may also consider talking with a trustworthy friend or family member about your suspicions. Choose someone who you think would give you objective feedback and who your partner would not feel threatened by you confiding in them. Make sure the person is someone who will not tell other people about what you have shared because this may cause your partner to feel betrayed.

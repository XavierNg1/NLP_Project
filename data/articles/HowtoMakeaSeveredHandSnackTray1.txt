 Invite some friends over and make a party out of it. Just remind them to wear old clothing that they don't mind damaging.;
,,, Purchase alginate online from Amazon or another website. You can also look for "life casting" starter kits that have all of the tools for mixing alginate in a single package.


The recipe is usually about 3 parts lukewarm water to 1 part alginate.
If the water is too warm, the mold will will set too quickly. If the water is too cool, the mold take longer to set.
Leave at least 1" (2.5 cm) at the top of the bucket so that the alginate level can rise when the model puts his or her hand into the mix.
Mix the alginate until it has the consistency of a thick, creamy yogurt. You'll need to mix quickly before the alginate starts to set up.
 Doing this will ensure that your model's hand comes out of the mold easily without ripping hair out of his or her hand or arm.
 Use a chip brush to paint the hand so that you can break up any bubbles.
 Your model should hold his or her hand with the palm facing downward and parallel to the bottom of the bucket. About 2" (5 cm) of his or her wrist should also be submerged.


Have the model curve his or her fingers as though holding a tray. Doing this will ensure that you can set a snack tray on top of the severed hand.
Tap the bucket lightly. Doing this causes air bubbles to float to the top and makes a better cast.
Ask your model to sit still until the alginate sets, which usually takes 7 to 10 minutes. The alginate is cured when it's firmer and less spongy.
 If the mold cracks slightly at the wrist, don't worry. The container will push the cracked part back together while you're casting the hands.

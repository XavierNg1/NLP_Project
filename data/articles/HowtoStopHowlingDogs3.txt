 Many dogs will howl in response to external stimuli, like sirens, other dogs, or thunder.Pay attention when your dog howls to see if the behavior follows a specific trigger.


If your dog’s howling is caused by an environmental trigger, it will usually stop once the trigger goes away or ends. If the occasional brief howl does not pose a problem, you may just want to let your dog be.
 If the howling caused by an environmental trigger is excessive or needs to be controlled (because the noise is bothering neighbors, for instance), then you may need to change your dog's behavior using desensitization and counterconditioning techniques.If the environmental trigger can be controlled, you can try desensitizing your dog to it. For example, if your dog howls at the sound of your dryer, try to keep it calm while the dryer is on for only a minute, and offer it a treat. Gradually increase the amount of time the dryer is on, as long as your dog is calm. Hopefully, your dog will become desensitized to the trigger and not howl.
If the environmental trigger cannot be controlled (such as a siren or thunder), you can still use counterconditioning to stop your dog’s howling. To do this, download a sound effects album featuring the scary noise. Play it at a low volume and reward the dog when it is calm in the presence of the unpleasant sound. As your dog becomes more tolerant, slowly increase the volume.Do this consistently, and your dog may come to associate the trigger with getting a reward instead of needing to howl.
 If you cannot determine that your dog’s howling is caused by an environmental trigger, separation anxiety, or another obvious cause, then the cause may be health-related. Have your veterinarian inspect your dog to determine if it is howling because of illness or injury.

 Pressing this button once will open your most important contacts.
 If the person you need to contact isn't in the Friends app, you can either start a call using Siri, by opening the People app and finding them in your contacts list, or by opening the Phone app and starting a new call.









To start a call with Siri, raise your Apple Watch to your face and say, "Hey Siri, call Name or Phone Number."

, Your Apple Watch will begin dialing the person using your iPhone. The call will be handled entirely through the Apple Watch.


Avoid making sensitive calls in public areas, since calls come through the Apple Watch speaker.
 You can also send and receive text and iMessage messages with your Apple Watch.








Find the person you want to message in the Friends app or People app, then tap the Message button. You can also open the Messages app on your Apple Watch, tap the "New Message" button, then select the recipients.
Select from a few prewritten messages, or tap the microphone to dictate a message. You can also tap the emoji button to select and send emojis.
Tap "Send" to send the message after composing it.

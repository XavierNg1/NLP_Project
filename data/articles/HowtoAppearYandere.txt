 This is very important, since this will be the person you will go yandere for. You can either choose someone you are in love with, or someone you feel you can appear to be in love with. It doesn't even have to be a love, really. It could be a sibling or a friend. It's just love that's the most famous yandere-type.;
, If it's someone you don't hang around with that often, you could stare at them smiling, creepily. You could begin talking to that person after a few days. If it's someone around you, you could still act a bit odd (like staring more than often, gazing into their eyes while they are talking) and talk to them more often.
 Note down things about them and follow them everywhere. But don't be seen!

, First things first, you should seem adorable. Act like the ideal, cute and kind girlfriend/sister/brother/friend, etc. Giggle, show lots of care and tilt your head. Play with your hair and bite your lip, gently!

, Every time your beloved hangs out with someone else besides you, give them the death glare! Your logic through this whole thing should be: Why would they ever need anyone else but me? Try having them all for yourself.
 Now, this is a daring step but if you really want to be a yandere, you need to get more violent. Gently threaten people to make them leave your beloved. Act more creepy, like if you're cutting vegetables then suddenly stop and look at the knife, asking the beloved something like, "You do love me, right?" or "We're friends, aren't we?", trying to make them uncomfortable. Start questioning things straight out.
 You didn't mean for anyone to find it, now did you? Remember it's not bad to get in trouble sometimes!Â 

, You do want to appear as the ideal wife, so cook for them and do anything to get their approval. Respect them.

 Add four tablespoons (8 grams) of rooibos tea leaves to 1 liters (4.2 cups) of cold water. Cover it with the lid and place it in a shady, cool area in your kitchen., Leaving your jar of water and tea leaves will impart the taste of the leaves into the water. You can submerge your leaves in water before going to sleep or while you're out of the house at work., Use a tea strainer, sieve, or a French press to separate your tea from the tea leaves. Straining your tea will eliminate any sediment or pulp from the tea leaves, making your tea smoother and cleaner., Storing your tea in the refrigerator will make it chilled for when you want to drink it. When you're ready, fill a glass with ice and add whatever sweetener you want. A slice of a citrus fruit like lemon or orange goes perfectly with rooibos tea.Rooibos tea can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

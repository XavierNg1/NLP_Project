 Shoulder pads are a classic solution to narrow or small shoulders. Some clothes come with built in shoulder pads, such as blazers and coats.You might also be able to get away with putting shoulder pads on under a thick sweater.



Be careful not to overstuff with shoulder pads or they will look too obvious.
 Baggy clothing can actually make your shoulders look narrower, so it is best to avoid it. Instead, choose clothing that fits you well, such as fitted jeans and shirts.It is especially important to choose clothing that is fitted around your waist because this can help to create the V-shape that makes your shoulders look wider.
 Wearing horizontal stripes across your chest and shoulders can also make your shoulders look wider. Try wearing a sweater that has a stripe or two going across the chest and/or shoulder area., White can make you seem like you have wider shoulders as well by making the top half of your body appear larger.Try wearing white dress shirts and t-shirts to see if this enhances the size of your shoulders.
 You can take advantage of the effects of layering your clothes in the winter to give the look of wider shoulders. Try wearing a sweater over a long sleeved shirt, or layer a t-shirt over a waffle shirt.You can also try wearing two or three t-shirts in warmer weather to create this effect. However, make sure that the collars or sleeves of the other shirts donâ€™t peak out or it may look odd. Wear a larger shirt over the others to hide the edges.

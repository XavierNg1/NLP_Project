 Although it might seem like a good idea to let the smaller puppies nurse before their bigger siblings, this may actually tire out the little ones before the mother releases her milk. Instead, let the bigger pups nurse first, to release the mother’s milk, and then allow the smaller pups their chance. If the mother is producing enough milk, the bigger puppies will have the stamina to get the mother’s milk released, then you can make sure that the entire litter nurses.If the mother is not producing enough milk, you should skip this step and simply pull the larger puppies before they nurse.
 If the mother is having some difficulty releasing her milk, you can also rub her mammary glands and stomach. This will encourage milk production and make it easier for your smaller puppies to nurse. Be sure to do this before you rub the puppies' faces on the nipple., If a small puppy is struggling to nurse after you remove its larger siblings, it may need a little assistance. Try rubbing its face sideways against its mother’s nipple to get it to attach. This should help stimulate your puppy’s appetite and get it to start nursing., If the small puppy is still having trouble nursing, talk to your veterinarian about an appetite stimulator. This sugary supplement should energize your puppy and get its appetite going. Give the puppy a few drops of the appetite stimulator before nursing to perk its hunger.

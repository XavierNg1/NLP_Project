Cat colors include black, brown, yellow, and sometimes very dark blue. Don't put on pink or green!

 Usually for clan leaders, use stars, for warriors, elders, or apprentices, use thunder bolts, leaves, fire flames and smudges.
 You'll look unprofessional if you go around wearing sports jerseys and Mohawks. Instead, try collecting a few rares that are suitable for warrior cats.


Lockets, arrows, and swords are good accessories. Things like wings or masks aren't.
 It's frustrating and chances are it will take along time. Its better to spend your time working and progressing with you're clan.
 In-store items have member swords, leaf necklaces, leg armor, elf bracelets.
 But always be willing to try! Non member pirate swords are officially available in beta adventures and sky high. rare leg armor is recommended but not necessary, fox hats also work, but if its not worth the time for you, don't bother.
 Act like a warrior. Be brave, and sometimes get into fights in the Sarepia Forest.

 Use a shovel or similar tool to clear away any snow that surrounds the car. Try to make it so you can see all the tires. Then, use a screwdriver or a similar tool to break up the ice immediately surrounding the tires. Be careful not to puncture the tires.Remove as much snow as you possibly can.;
, After you’ve dug out your car, make sure that the tailpipe is free of snow. While you may have removed the snow from around it, make sure the tailpipe itself is clear and doesn’t get buried again. This is important, as the exhaust could build up in the car if the tailpipe isn’t clear.
 Pour a gritty substance in front, behind, and on the sides of your tires. Gritty substances will help your tires gain traction when you try to back up or move forward. Some substances you can pour include:


Salt, which will not only help tires gain traction, but will melt the ice and snow underneath them.
Kitty litter.
Sand., If gritty materials don’t work, look for other materials that could help your tires gain traction. This includes pieces of plywood, ridged sheet metal, or similar items. Then, place the items in front of or behind your tires so you can back or drive onto them and then out of the snow.


If you have snow chains, you should put them on.

 Insert it just like you would a USB flash drive. Your computer should automatically detect the device and install any drivers that are needed. If not, look for drivers for your specific dongle online.


Bluetooth signals are able to pass through obstacles much easier than IR signals. You don’t necessarily need to worry about having line-of-sight between the dongle and the device.
You should see multiple messages in your System Tray informing you that the drivers are being installed and that the Bluetooth dongle has been successfully connected. A Bluetooth icon will appear in the taskbar.;
, You can find this in the Start menu on your computer, or by pressing the Windows key + X and selecting Control Panel in Windows 8


Open "Bluetooth Devices" (Windows XP) or under "Hardware and Sound", click the Add a device (Windows 7).
 Check the box next to " My device is set up and ready to be found" and click "Next".
 Windows will begin configuring your device and automatically downloading the correct drivers.


You may need to enter a PIN or code to connect the device. If you don’t know the code, try entering 0000.
You will only need to pair your device with the computer once. After that, the device will be automatically connected as long as it is within range and the dongle is plugged in.

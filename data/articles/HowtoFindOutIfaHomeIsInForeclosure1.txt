 If you know your neighbor and fear that his home is being foreclosed, you may want to try talking to him, if you're comfortable doing so. Perhaps the rumors you heard about his impending foreclosure were false, or perhaps your neighbor did default on his mortgage but was able to get caught up on his payments. Either way, if you have a good relationship with your neighbor, speaking with him directly may save you a lot of time and trouble.

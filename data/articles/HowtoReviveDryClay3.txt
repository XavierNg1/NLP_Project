 Old childrenâ€™s putty often separates into multiple dried, hardened chunks. Gather all of the pieces you want to moisturize and place them in your hand, molding them into a ball as much as is possible.
 Place your ball of clay beneath a steady stream of water for 10-15 seconds--or longer, if the dough is completely hardened. Hold it carefully in your hands, as extremely dried-out clay may begin to come apart and could fall down the drain.









Alternatively, you can fill a cup with water and pour the water directly onto the clay.
To prevent clogging the drain, lay down a drain trap to catch any runaway pieces of clay.
 Place the dough on a clean, non-stick surface, such as a granite counter or porcelain sink. Work the dough through your hands, keeping all pieces of the dough together.
 Take the kneaded dough and run it under the tap (or cup) for another 10-20 seconds, kneading the dough as you do so, allowing the water to reach all pieces of the clay. Squeeze the dough through your fingers to help the water penetrate the clay thoroughly.








If the clay persists in being dry or unworkable, add an additional 10 seconds to your underwater kneading time.
 Place your dough back onto the nonstick surface and knead once more, this time for 60-90 seconds. Make sure you work the clay through your hands, as well, as the oils and moisture from your hands can help bring the dough back to life.
 Continue the process of wetting and kneading until the dough has reached the desired consistency. Once it has reached the desired consistency, be sure to store it in a sealed, airtight container to prevent drying out in the future.









If the clay does not become usable again after repeating the steps above 4-5 times, it may no longer be viable.

 Boys don't like an uptight girl who will adjust her makeup and hair every five seconds. The point is to not be so girly, but don't be one of the guys either. You will not be able to flirt unless you can find the perfect balance between one of the boys and a girly-girl.;
, The mall would be the perfect place for this. Flirtatious behaviour includes winking, blowing kisses, tiling your hair, posing to show off your best features, giggling and blushing.
 Preferably one that you are attracted to.


Glance up at him until your eyes meet, then smile at him. This is how you flirt.
Get up to get a drink, not anything else, just as a drink, then pass by him on your way to the soda fountain - heading for a vending machine, kettle or other beverage containers will not work. It has to be as soda fountain, this will give him the idea you want to be noticed.

Try to giggle with your friends (if they are with you). Don't giggle too loudly, though, or you may get kicked out of the church, class, the park, the mall or wherever else you are.
 There are many ways to show you are sexually attracted to a boy, here are some for a guy you don't know well:


Wink at a guy when you catch him staring at you.
When he walks by, try to stop whatever you are doing. If you do this enough, he will notice. Then he will think that you think he is so stunning.
When you are walking down the hall and notice him alone, quickly say, "Hi!" and do a little wave. Make sure you also walk backwards so you can get a big glimpse of him.
Lightly bump into him, and say, "Oh, I'm so sorry!" smile big and turn to walk away. After about four steps, look back. If he is still looking that means your tactic has worked!

,
Use a fake name to ensure the recipient can't tell who the signer really is.
Talk about how much fun you had after you work on a project together or whatever.
Make friends with his friends and be sure you leave a good impression on them too! That way they will talk to the guy you like about you.

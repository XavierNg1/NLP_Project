 Tuck in that shirt. Straighten your tie. Ravenclaw’s founder, Rowena Ravenclaw, was known for her beauty, and while not every Ravenclaw can hope to match hers, aspire to achieve an elegance in how you dress.Take pride in your appearance. Give yourself a glance in the mirror before heading out to make sure you don’t look sloppy or disheveled.


Contrast Harry Potter of Gryffindor to his brief love interest Cho Chang of Ravenclaw. Harry often looks like he rolled out of bed already wearing his robe and clothes, while Cho always seems to have taken the time to comb her hair and adjust her clothing so that she appears perfectly presentable time and time again.
 Whether you choose a striking accessory or clothing whose cut, color, or design sets it apart from the norm, set yourself apart from the crowd with a sense of fashion that is clearly your own and no one else’s. Keep it tasteful, though. Remember that Ravenclaws value elegance., Choose blue as your primary color for outfits, since this color is a constant for Ravenclaw in both books and films. If you are a purist, accent your outfits with bronze, which complements the color blue in the books. If you love the movies’ aesthetics, go with silver instead. Or be the open-minded Ravenclaw that you are and work with both silver and bronze!, Look for items that use the letter “R” as an emblem. Use the Ravenclaw Common Room’s ceiling as inspiration and pick clothing and/or jewelry that includes stars in their design.If you favor the books, look for items that feature an eagle, since this is Ravenclaw’s mascot in the original works. If you are a bigger fan of Ravenclaw’s mascot in the movies, go with ravens instead.

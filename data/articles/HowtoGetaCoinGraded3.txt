 Be prepared to pay for the service, but understand that the initial investment in grading the collection could actually save you hundreds of dollars and prevent you from overpaying for a collection.


Obtain appraisals from dealers who are members of professional associations. The American Numismatic Association Certification Service (A.N.A.C.S.), the Numismatic Certification Institute (NCI), the International Numismatic Society (INS), and Accugrade are all reputable organizations that certify qualified coin appraisers.
 These coins are graded and then encapsulated in plastic. Buyers can have a great deal of confidence in the quality of their purchase when they buy coins graded by a third party.
 Never buy a coin if you doubt the grading or if you are not completely satisfied with your purchase.


Avoid purchasing coins online unless you are absolutely confident in your grading abilities. Make sure that the dealer has a reasonable money-back option if you are not completely satisfied with your purchase.

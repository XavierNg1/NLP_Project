 For instance, if it calls for a cup of butter, use 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup margarine.;
,, Equally sized cookies will cook the most evenly. I make my balls about 1 1/2-2 inches in diameter for most drop cookies. For peanut butter kiss cookies (the ones with Hershey Kisses in the center) make them much smaller and cook them for a much shorter time.
 Cheap cookie sheets (and even some of the Wilton expensive ones or my mother-in-law's stainless steel) seem to burn the edges for me. I find too that with each new oven I prepare cookies in, I have to play with the temperature and perhaps in some very poor ovens, rotate the pan to prevent unequal cooking. The goal is to get a golden crust on the outside and a soft middle. Not so doughy that it falls apart when you take it off the sheet, just doughy enough to stay soft. This optimum can be reached by playing with the temperature. (keep in mind most ovens don't change instantly to setting changes) I find 375 works better then 350, but this might be a variable you have to play with. The margarine helps with this too; I find butter makes the cookies sometimes too runny, which could likely be resolved with additional flour if your heart is set on butter.
 With the ball method, you can roll them all at once and it makes this step very fast. I cool the cookies for about 10 minutes on cooling trays or aluminum foil. Wax paper tends to leave wax on my counters, so I wouldn't suggest that.

,, While the design and location of the shells is up to you, they look good evenly spaced around the whole of the wreath.
 Make a bow that uses four loops for maximum impact. Glue to the base of the wreath and adjust to ensure it dangles down neatly. You can also glue seashells to the end of the bow to help weight it.
 Or, use it as a decoration inside your home or business.

 So the aiming ability is really different that other weapons. Due to this weapon is a knife (not a gun) and cause the aim sight is smaller than others. So your aim needs to be precise. Just having someone in the middle of the target doesn't guarantee a kill.;
, Whenever the opportunity comes along that you get a chance to kill someone with the Ballistic, try to catch them running. Whenever you do actually for a kill, you'll then want to shoot a little ahead of them because they will run right into it.
 You can also try aiming above your enemy to have the knife drop when it flies out of the knife, so this will allow for a distanced kill.

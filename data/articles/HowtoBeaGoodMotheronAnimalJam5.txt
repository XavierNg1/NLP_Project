 While you don't need to go into too much detail with him or her, be sure he or she is willing to care for a pet. Make sure your child understands that the pet is not a toy.
 Make sure you both agree on it beforehand. That way, you won't start arguing in the middle of the search.
 Not only is it the adoption center for children, but it's also a shelter for animals - both wild and tame. For more choices, it's best to go into a full world.
 State what type of animal you want (ex: dog/wolf). Make sure you're clear that you're not adopting a child.
 Let him or her interact with them to see which one he or she likes best.
 Tell the pet that he or she is welcome to go to your den.

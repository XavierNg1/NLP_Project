 If it sound like a drum that watermelon has hollow heart. Hollow heart is when there are parts in the middle of the melon that are empty. Also inspect the watermelon for bruises or parts that have been smashed. Smashed parts usually make a weird texture to the watermelon that feels flaky.
 Usually if you want a ripe watermelon choose a darker green one. Lighter green ones may not be as ripe. Remember all watermelons have one yellow area at the bottom if they have more that means the watermelon did not get enough sun light.

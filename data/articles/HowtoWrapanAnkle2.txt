 Start at the ball of the foot and wind the underwrap around the foot and up to and around the ankle, stopping a few inches above it. The heel may be left exposed.
 Wind the athletic tape around the top of the underwrap, a few inches above the ankle. Use a scissors to cut the tape and overlap the end with the starting point to make sure the tape stays in place. This is called the anchor because it forms the foundation for the rest of the tape wrap.


Don't wind the tape too tightly. It should be secure, but comfortable.
You may want to use more than one piece of tape for the anchor to make sure it stays in place.
 Align the tape with the outside of the ankle. Place the end of the tape on the stirrup, then wind it under the foot and up to the other side of the ankle. Secure it on the other side of the anchor. Repeat with two more pieces of tape that slightly overlap each other. This forms a stirrup, which helps keep the ankle stable during movement.
 Place the end of the tape at the ankle bone and extend it diagonally over the top of the foot, then wind it under the arch of the foot and toward the inside of the heel. Bring it around the heel and run it diagonally over the top of the foot to complete the "x."

, Place the end of the tape on the outside of the ankle. Wind it over the top of the foot, bring it under the arch, back over the other side of the foot, and around the ankle. Repeat this figure 8 shape a total of 3 times, overlapping the tape a bit each time.


Make sure the tape wrapping is comfortable for the person wearing it. If it pulls at the skin or hair, you may need to start over.
The tape wrap may be worn all day and during physical activity. It should be changed when it becomes dirty. Remove the wrap if the toes turn white or a numb or tingly sensation is felt.

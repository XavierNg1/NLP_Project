Keep the knee elevated above your heart while lying down. Prop the knee and foot on pillows or on the arm of the couch.
Use crutches if it hurts to straighten the leg or to put weight on it.
 Apply ice directly on the swollen part of your knee for 10-20 minutes. Do this 3 times a day to reduce the swelling.You can also use a frozen cold pack or a bag of frozen vegetables like peas instead of ice.
 If you have sustained an injury that results in a swollen knee, avoid placing heat on your knee. This includes hot packs, hot showers, or hot tubs., Wrap your knee in an elastic bandage to apply compression. This will help decrease the swelling. Try an elastic bandage with a fastener that sticks to the bandage so that you donâ€™t need clips.

Be careful not to wrap your knee too tightly. If you feel any numbness, tingling, odd coloring, or increased pain, your bandage is wrapped too tightly.
 Massage at a very gentle rate may help increase blood flow to your knee.

 Iodine is available at most drug stores in the first aid section. Buy an iodine solution with 2% iodine. Anything stronger than 2% iodine can be harmful to your skin.
 Use antibacterial soap and warm water to cleanse the ringworm site. Pat the area dry with a hand towel or a paper towel. Place the paper towel into a bag and seal the bag shut, or set the hand towel aside for laundering.
 Iodine comes in a small glass or plastic bottle. Pour a small amount of iodine onto a cotton ball or dip a cotton swab into the bottle. Use gentle strokes to apply the iodine to the ringworm area.
 Applying iodine more than 3 times a day can increase your risk of iodine poisoning, which results in symptoms like vomiting, increased thirst and difficult urination. It can take up to 4 weeks for the fungus to be destroyed and the visible signs of ringworm to disappear.
 Wash personal items, such as towels, sheets and clothes, in hot water each day. Separate these items from other household laundry to keep ringworm from spreading to others in the household.

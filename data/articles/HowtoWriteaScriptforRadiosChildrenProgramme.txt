 Research won't help, because it varies with child. Find the most common likes with children between ages 5-12. Face it, not all kids will agree on one thing between the ages of 5-12, but maybe something that's a common like with kids will work.;
, That makes it a lot easier, because you could introduce songs with little jokes, like for example, if "We wish you a Merry Christmas" was going to come on, you could say something like, "We're going to play We wish you a Merry Christmas, because it's coming up! And I certainly hope all you viewers have a merry Christmas."

, Have cute contests with prizes like webkinz or toys R us gift cards. The questions should be fairly easy, but not so easy they don't have to think it through. And remember most kids won't want to be given educational questions. Also let them request songs, and call the phone number of the phone in the room you're broadcasting from. Be sure to tell them to request appropriate songs!

, And boys may like hearing about Pok√©mon, Bakugan, or Nickelodeon TV shows.
 There's nothing like a good joke to break the ice. Make sure it's not corny, like any joke about the chicken crossing the road! Every kid has heard that joke before! Kids may like gross out jokes (But not too gross, for the parents' approval.) and other jokes. Knock knock jokes are great, too!

, This is the most important rule! Don't bring up anything inappropriate or else you'll be getting plenty of calls from parents! And trust me, they won't be good conversations! Never swear or say any name calling words, never mention drugs or alcohol, and never say anything too gross.
 One thing about kids is that they get bored easily. Have cute activity ideas for them like games they can play (That they don't already know, like tag or cost money, like board games.) or crafts they can do.
 Have two types of countdowns. A countdown of the top 10 kids' songs of the week and countdowns to kid-popular holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas.

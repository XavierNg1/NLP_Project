 Electrons are attracted to the nucleus at the center of the atom because it is positive and they are negative. That also means that electrons are repelled by each other. An atom is at its lowest energy state (most stable) when the electrons are as far from each other as possible. This makes the geometry of electron orbitals very important to the valence bond model.Common types of geometry for atomic orbitals are linear, bent, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, and octahedral.
 Lone pair electrons are valence electrons in an atom that do not bond with another atom. Since they are not bonding with other atoms and being pulled outward by other nuclei, the lone pairs orbit closer to the center of the atom. This exerts slightly more repulsive force on the other electrons, and alters the shape of the atom or molecule.For example, water could be expected to be linear (H-O-H), but the oxygen has lone pair electrons that interact with the shape of the molecule. This pushes the hydrogens closer together than they would be otherwise, and gives the molecule a bent geometry.
 In some cases, an atom’s bonding is not accurately predicted by the s and p orbitals it possesses. When this happens, valence bond theory suggests that the orbitals of the atom have been hybridized. In short, that’s a way of saying that some s and p orbitals merged together to form orbitals that share characteristics of both. This phenomenon helps to predict the shape and bonding activity of some atoms.For example, carbon is sp3 hybridized (1 s and 3 p orbitals merged). This allows the orbitals to spread out optimally and reduce electron-electron repulsion. It also allows the carbon atom to form four bonds.

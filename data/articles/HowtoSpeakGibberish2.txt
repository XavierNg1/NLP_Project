 "Gibberish" is an umbrella term for any nonsensical language that is hard to understand, such as baby talk. However, all established variants use the same pattern: A nonsense sound is inserted into every syllable when speaking. The same nonsense sound is used over and over, so words get much longer and all sound quite similar.



Pig Latin is a pseudo-language that is another way of speaking in code. It's a little more common and a little easier to deduce.
 Generally, every syllable in a word contains one vowel sound. Here are some words and their syllables:



Tree: Tree

Bottle: Bot / tle (pronounced tul)

Symmetry: Sym (sim) / me (meh) / try (tree)

, If there are only vowels (e.g., "I"), add it at the very beginning. Regardless of whether there are 1,2, or 3 consonants at the beginning, add it before the first vowel sound. The result will sound something like this:



tree: tridigee

bottle: bidigottle

symmetry: symm"idig"etry

For a word like "street," remember to keep the consonants together (it's still one syllable). The word, in gibberish, would be pronounced, "stridigeet."



, If you were to say the word "hi" in gibberish, it may be tempting to pronounce it "hi-tho-gi," instead of "hI-di-gi." which sounds like your saying "hit a guy" Don't do it! It's harder to decipher when you add in a different vowel sound.


"My name" is not "mi-thag-eye nay-tha-game," it's "mI-dig-eye nI-dig-ame."
"-idig-" has the same initial sound as "dig" (not "pig"), in case you were curious. In the IPA, it's a schwa, or /É™/. Think of a caveman grunt.

 You can find iTunes by clicking on the musical note on your dock on the bottom of your screen.


If you don't have it on your dock, you can search for it in Spotlight, which is the magnifying glass in the upper right corner of your screen. Just click on the magnifying glass and type in "iTunes" and click on your iTunes when it pops up.;
, If a screen pops up that asks you if you'd like to download the latest version of iTunes, click "Download iTunes." If this happens, you're lucky, and have opened your iTunes just after a new version was ready. Just wait for your computer to download and install the latest version of iTunes, and restart your computer when it's done.

It's more likely that you've been asked to download the newest version of iTunes before, and turned it down. If so, skip to the next step.
 You can find this option on the top left of the iTunes toolbar.
 This option is fourth from the top of the iTunes drop down menu.


You can also click on the "Help" option to the top right of the iTunes toolbar, and search "Updates."
You will be taken to the Updates Tab in "App Store" window. If you don't see iTunes in the list of updates, it means that you do have the most current version of iTunes.
 You should see that iTunes will start downloading.

, There are a few options found at the top of the page to control your survey settings. Check each of these, and tick the ones you’d like to apply on your survey.


“Show progress bar at the bottom of form pages”—Tick this option if you want a progress bar displayed for every page of the survey. This will let the respondent know their overall progress in the survey.
“Allow one response per person”—Tick this option if you want to limit responses to only one per respondent. This can be a good option to have if you don’t want to skew your results and only capture unique respondents.
“Shuffle question order”—Tick this option if you want your questions to be shown in random to different respondents. This can be good if your questions aren’t related to each other or aren’t in sequential order.
 Click the “Untitled form” text and edit the name of your survey. You can also put an optional description underneath the title to provide a background, objectives, or instructions to your respondents.

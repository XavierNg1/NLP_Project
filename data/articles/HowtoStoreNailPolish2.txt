 Making a cake stand nail polish display is easy. You will just need to gather a few special items before you get started. You will need:a cake platter
a plate
a candlestick
strong glue, such as a ceramic glue

, Flip your cake platter upside down. Then take your candlestick and apply some glue to the bottom of it. Center the candlestick on the bottom of your cake platter and press it into place.Hold the candlestick for about 30 seconds to ensure a strong bond.
 Next, take your smaller plate and hold it facing right side up. Then, apply some glue to the top of the candlestick. When you are ready, press the plate onto the candlestick so that it is centered.Press down on the plate for about 30 seconds to ensure a strong bond.
 Let the cake stand nail polish display dry overnight. After it has dried, you can place your nail polish collection on the upper and lower tiers.If you like, you can also paint designs or glue some glitter onto the upper plate and/or lower platter, but this is optional. Make sure that the paint/glue is dry if you decide to decorate your cake stand nail polish display.

 You should never leave a knife in the kitchen sink. It's a safety issue as you could get cut reaching into the dish water. Knives are also susceptible to damage and rust if immersed in water for too long. Place dirty knives beside the kitchen sink., As stated, leaving knives wet can increase their likelihood of rusting. Always dry your knives immediately after cleaning them., Knives do not do well in the dishwasher. The blade can get dinged and damaged during the washing cycle. Dishwasher detergent is also highly acidic and can cause premature rusting., Quality kitchen knives should not be stored in the utensil drawer. They can bump against other silverware, causing scratches and other damage. Invest in a kitchen board to store your knives or keep them in a separate drawer. If you do store your knives in the utensil drawer, cover them in leather sheaths.

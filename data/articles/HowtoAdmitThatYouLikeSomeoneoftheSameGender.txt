 Start with a trusted friend or family member, preferably someone whom you know to be open-minded about same-sex relationships or attraction.;
, Do this at your own pace. The only reason to talk about a same-gender attraction is that you want to. If you want to turn it over in your head for a while first, that's fine. If you're dying to tell someone right away, that's fine too! Pick the time that works for you. Make sure there's time for a conversation, and that you're in a good comfortable place to chat. If you're not sure that the conversation will go well, make sure you're somewhere that you can exit easily if necessary. It may be easier to have the conversation in person, on the phone, or online. Do what feels best.
 It may be easier to just admit the attraction, or it may take time. Go with the approach that feels best. The person you're talking to may have questions. Divulge only as much as you feel comfortable with. If you don't feel comfortable, just explain that this is new to you and you're not ready to go into detail.
 Especially if the person you confide in is very surprised to hear about your attraction, or if you are the first person to confess such an attraction to him or her, there may be many questions after the initial conversation. Be prepared for this, and again answer only the questions that you're comfortable answering.

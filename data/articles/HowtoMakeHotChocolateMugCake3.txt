 The mug needs to be able to hold at least 8 ounces (240 milliliters). If the mug is too small, the batter may overflow and make a mess in your microwave.


You can eat the brownie straight from the mug with a spoon. If you'd prefer to serve it on a plate, grease the mug with cooking spray first.
 If you can't find any hot chocolate powder, you can use 2 tablespoons (15 grams) of unsweetened cocoa powder and 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 55 grams) of sugar.
 If you have not already, melt the butter in a small saucepan over the stove or in the microwave. Pour it into the mug along with the butter and vanilla extract. If you are vegan, you can substitute your favorite oil instead.
 You can do this with a fork or mini whisk. Keep stirring until no clumps remain, and the mixture is smooth. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl often.
 Do not stir these in. Let them float on top of the brownie.They will melt slightly as the cake cooks, and give you a toasty, fluffy topping.
 Don't overcook the brownie. It will appear wet and soggy in the middle., Use a pot holder or an oven mitt to take the mug out of the microwave. Set the mug down on a heat-safe surface, and allow the brownie to cool for about 5 minutes.
 Add a handful of mini marshmallows on top. If you'd like, you can add other popular hot chocolate garnishes, such as whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or crushed peppermint candy.


If you greased the mug with cooking spray, invert the mug onto a plate first.

 These accounts allow you to make a monthly payment to the account and set a date to take the money out. People used to add money to the account in time for Christmas purchases.


These accounts usually offer a slightly higher interest rate than a savings account; however, you cannot touch the money until the date you specified earlier.
 Most banks specify time limits, maximum payments per month and early withdrawal fees. Make sure you can follow the terms before signing up.
 Since there is likely to be a maximum payment amount per month, you will need to contribute for a longer period of time. If plans change, you will still have the money, plus interest.
 Airfares and some packages go up at this point.
 Many VIP accounts have a maximum amount that you can contribute each month. Schedule a monthly transfer or pay into the account whenever you have a little extra cash on hand.

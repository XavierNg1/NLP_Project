;
, You will need a zip/unzip program to do this.
 Check out the three options:


Compare all images within primary datafile (one folder or image list)
Compare images between two datafiles (no comparison within the datafiles)
Compare single image to primary datafile (no comparison within the datafile)

,, This is the second tab. You will need to build your datafile if you haven't already.
 You will need to experiment to see what works. Click OK.


If you have a slower computer, this process may take a while (a long while). The program is looking for file paths.
, This only looks at your duplicates and not your whole computer so it is faster.
 Click on the 'Find Dups'.
 After you have chosen the various 'duplication parameters', you can go through the duplicates and verify that they are duplications and delete them if you choose.
 You will want to make that neither image is necessary for another project.


If you do decide to delete one of them, and find others fitting the same location pattern, delete the same one. For example:

Folder 1 >> certain pictures
Folder 2 >> same certain pictures

Always make the same choice; i.e. Folder 1
Be aware, though, that the world won't end if you aren't completely consistent.

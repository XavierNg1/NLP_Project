 Combine one cup water and two tablespoons of white vinegar in a spray bottle.Vinegar is a natural home remedy that has been known to deodorize a room.It’s not likely to be a long-term fix, but you can also put bowls of vinegar around your home to absorb odors., You can purchase the microbial agent online or at your local hardware store. Microbial agents have live bacteria that eat odor-causing microorganisms and claim to remove harsh odors from your home., Whether using vinegar or a microbial solution, spray everything including walls, cabinets, the carpet, the ceiling, grease traps, and draperies. Pay especially close attention to areas of built-up grease where the odor tends to permeate.Before spraying, test for color fastness, or make sure a fabric will retain its color. Spray a small amount of mixture on an inconspicuous area of fabric. Wait a few minutes and blot with a napkin. Note any changes to the fabric, or any color rubbing off onto the napkin.Avoid spraying around electronics and electrical outlets.
Check your filter’s instructions to see if they are washable. They may be able to be washed in the solution while others will need to be washed in soap and water. Still, others may need to be replaced and can be purchased at your local hardware store.
 Drain vents can often clog, causing odors to continue to saturate your residence. The microbial agents will help to clear the plumbing and eliminate odors.Follow instructions on the bottle’s label regarding how much to pour and how often.
 If the smell doesn’t go away immediately spray your solution and air out your home once a week. This allows the microbes to remain alive and to continue to break down the odor-trapping grease.


If the smell still remains after 4 cycles, try combining with other odor-removal methods.

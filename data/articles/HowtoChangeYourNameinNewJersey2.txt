 Take a copy of your marriage certificate, your old social security card, and a picture identification card, such as your driver’s license, to your local Social Security Administration office. Your marriage certificate allows you to change your name on your social security card. After submitting a short application, the Social Security Administration will mail you a new card in about 10 – 14 days.


The Social Security Administration does not charge for this service.
You do not need to take any additional actions to change your name due to marriage, such as filing a name change petition with the court.
 Once you have received your new social security card, take it to your local Motor Vehicle Commission to change your name on your driver’s license. Also bring a copy of your marriage certificate and your old driver’s license with you. The MVC will issue you a new driver’s license that reflects your new name. There is typically a small fee charged for this service.
 Once you have your new driver’s license or picture ID card, you can use these documents, along with your new social security card and your marriage certificate to change your name with other government agencies and offices. These offices might include your health insurance company, your employer, and your doctor’s office.

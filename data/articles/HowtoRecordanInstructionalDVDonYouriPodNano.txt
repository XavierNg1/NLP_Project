 Make a few sample videos from the monitor you'll be recording from, to get the feel for how it works and to see how the videos turn out.
 Note which areas will need zooming in; be aware that due to the Nano's small screen, ripping is not the best option.

The Nano does not have a telephoto feature; instead, hold it close to the monitor and even closer to magnify certain parts of the screen.
The Nano has a lens on one side and a preview screen on the other side. The preview screen displays exactly what the finished video will look like.
 This will allow you to set chapter marks during the recording process. The Nano does not have a fast forward or a rewind, so you'll need to rely on its chapters feature to navigate forward or backward., The Nano does not need any additional lighting, other than that emanating from the monitor., Be sure you're comfortable because the recording process will be lengthy., Record in front of the monitor and with the speaker volume turned up slightly higher than normal.

Frame your video so it doesn't need cropping; in other words, your finished video won't have a border around its edges.
 Take care not to put your finger in front of the lens.

Even if your recording isn't perfect, remember that the recording is for use as a study tool and is not a technical work of art.
 So that you will be able to read the important details of the video later, hold the Nano close to the monitor; manually "zoom" it in. This is the advantage of making a hand-held recording.

Alternate between holding the Nano close and far.
 Divide your recording into at least five or six chapters., Key in the chapter labels., On your computer, each chapter will be displayed as a large icon with the opening scene. Use your DVD player controls, like stop, pause, fast forward, and rewind, to get to the scene that gives you the best visual clue as to the contents of the chapter.

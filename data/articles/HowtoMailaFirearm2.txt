 As a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder, you may ship to any state in the United States. Don’t try to ship a firearm internationally without proper authorization. Familiarize yourself with any laws or restrictions in the state or locality you’re shipping to., If you are shipping to a different state, federal law requires the recipient to hold a current, valid FFL. You also can ship within your state of residence to non-licensees and FFL holders.


If you’re shipping out-of-state to an FFL holder, have them fax, email, or mail you a copy of their FFL license certificate. Ship only to the person and address listed on the certificate.
When shipping to non-licensees, conduct a background check to make sure they aren’t:

A felon
A convict of domestic violence
A subject of a domestic restraining order
A fugitive
An unlawful user of a controlled substance
An undocumented worker
A dishonorably discharged veteran
A former U.S. citizen (who has renounced their U.S. citizenship)
Someone declared mentally deficient or involuntarily committed to a mental institution., You may ship handguns, rifles, and shotguns through the USPS, UPS, and FedEx. File USPS Form PS 1508 with the branch where you’re shipping the handgun. If you want to ship a handgun by USPS, try to find a local licensed dealer to ship it via USPS for you.

 As with federal licenses, the U.S. Small Business Association provides links to useful information about licensing for many businesses. From the home page, www.sba.gov, choose the “Starting and Managing” link, and then select “Business Licenses & Permits.” From there, choose “State Licenses and Permits” to find a list of all 50 states and several territories., Clicking on the name of the state will lead you to that state’s official government website for business. You will need to research that site for the licensing requirements for your particular business.For example, if you select New Hampshire, you will be redirected to the New Hampshire business page. On that page, under the right-hand column, you will find the heading for “Licenses and Permits.” Under this heading, you will find links to Environmental Permits, Food Service Licensing, Licensed Occupations in NH (this one will require more in-depth review), Alcoholic Beverages, Meals & Rentals Tax License, Oversize/Overweight Permits, and Professional Licensing. If any of these fields apply to your business, you will need to select the link for further application materials.
 After selecting your state and field of business, you will need to review that state’s licensing requirements. Some of these may consist of a simple, online application form, while others may lead to more complicated application procedures. Whichever it is, be sure that you read the application instructions carefully, follow all the steps, and complete the forms as directed.For example, if you want to become an alcohol wholesaler in New Hampshire, you will select the links to New Hampshire, then Alcoholic Beverages, and then “Apply for a License.” This will direct you to the New Hampshire Liquor Commission’s page for licensing applications.

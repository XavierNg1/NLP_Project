 Find a long, open stretch of ice to practice on. Ideally, pick a time when there is not much skate traffic around you, so that you don't need to worry about colliding with other people. Make sure that there are no turns, holes, or other obstacles ahead of you. Put yourself in a space where you only need to focus on the act of stopping.
 If you are going to be stopping suddenly at high speeds, then safety is of the essence. This is especially the case if you are stopping in the midst of a high-intensity activity like a race or a hockey game. You can use hockey pads or non-ice skating pads â€“ anything that will protect you from the ice! If nothing else, make sure to protect your head, your hands, your elbows, and your knees.
 Look online for videos of other people stopping on ice skates.Watch hockey games, speed-skating races, or figure-skating competitions on television to get a feel for the motion. There may be other tricks and styles of stopping that pertain to specific types of ice skating.

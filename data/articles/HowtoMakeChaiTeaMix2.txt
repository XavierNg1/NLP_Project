 Making authentic chai using the masala mix takes only about 10 minutes, and requires only a few simple steps. To begin, place one cup (240 ml) of water into a small pan or saucepot on the stove. Then add 1 ¼ teaspoons (6.15 ml) of loose black tea, such as Assam or Darjeeling, to the pot of water.Assam and Darjeeling are traditionally used to make chai, but you can use any strong black tea that you wish.
You can also use a teabag of black tea in place of loose black tea.
 While the tea is heating, add ¼ teaspoon (1.23 ml) of the Indian chai masala you prepared into the tea and stir once.Make sure that the teaspoon of masala you use contains pieces of all the spices in the masala, including a cardamom pod, and piece of cinnamon, and a piece of dried ginger.
It’s ok to exceed ¼ teaspoon in order to include the cardamom pod and other chunks that are missing from the masala you added.
 Heat the chai until it comes to a boil. Once it begins boiling, turn off the heat or remove the chai from the burner. Then pour in ½ cup (118.29 ml) of milk into the chai, along with about 2 teaspoons (11.8 ml) of raw or cane sugar. Stir to combine.Whole milk will give you a more authentic chai, but you can use whatever type of milk you choose.
 After you add the milk and sweetener to the chai and stir, let the pot of chai sit for one minute. Allowing the chai to sit helps the flavors to combine., Place a fine mesh strainer or tea strainer over a mug. Then pour the pot of chai over the strainer so that the chai masala pieces are caught in the strainer, and the hot chai pours into the mug. Then drink your chai while it’s hot!

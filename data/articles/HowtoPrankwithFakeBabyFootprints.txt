 Color the side of your palm evenly. Start with mixing some color of your choice with water in a dish. Let the color not be too thin with too much water. Make it's consistency just about enough to create a neat, drip free print on the surface. You may either dip the side of your palm in the dish or ask someone to paint your palm.;
, Fold your palm to make a fist. Press your colored fist on the paper to make the print.


This is how the print would appear.
 When you get the fist print done, color your finger.


You may make all the toe prints with any one of your fingers. You may use the finger you find the most steady if you like.
 The first toe must be slightly tilted. It must also be a little bigger than the rest if the toes.
 The other toes could be done all at once or one by one. To do it all at once, just dip all your four finger tips (excluding the thumb) in the paint and make the imprint a little over the palm's print.
 The impression you make with your left palm will make the left footprint.
 Color the side of your palm thoroughly or you may get incomplete footprints.
 If you feel that the toes are a bit too apart, you may make the rest of the four toe prints one next to the other using one finger only.
 You may try making more prints in different sizes by asking someone else to do it.
 Try making more prints one over the other to create a trail of foot prints.

 Disabled children grow into capable, lovable disabled adults. Your child will be able to live happily. If worry is consuming you, go read things written by disabled adults. See that they are alive and okay.
 Life will be hard sometimes. Meeting other parents will allow you to empathize and share ideas, while your child does the same with their disabled peers.
 Find specialists, disabled people, and parents of disabled children who know what works and what makes life easier. A team of caring, supportive adults can help you do the best you can raising your child.
 If you are constantly harried and stressed, you aren't doing any favors to your child or to yourself. Get rest so you can feel calm and centered each day. Take a bubble bath, read a book, take a walk, or do whatever it is that calms you.


Set aside a specific time each day during which you can relax.

Make a calming down corner not only for your child, but for yourself. Teach them to let you be when you are using it (just like you let them be when they use theirs).
 Engage in silly play, let their interests shine, and don't let disability overcome your lives. Disability is important, but so is parenting, and don't focus on one at the expense of the other.

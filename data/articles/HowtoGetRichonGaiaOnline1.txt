 This is the currency of the site, but you should be able to work your way up to having a few thousand (abbreviated as "k", so, for example, nine thousand would be 9k) by just finishing the "New tank quest", which you'll be prompted on when you first enter your aquarium.
 Don't worry though, just buy a nice inexpensive outfit, two of the cheaper stores for common clothing are Barton Boutique and Crate and Apparel., You've probably noticed that your gold count isn't very high, and to fully complete any of these following steps, you must make that count to about ten thousand, or 10K. (It will look like Gold Count: 10000) If you already are here, or maybe a little less or more, you're good. Once you are here, you're ready to continue.

Once you have your starting gold, there are two main ways to go about this. One involves real money, the other involves quick reflexes, thinking, and bargain shopping. Others exist, and can be things such as selling art if you are able to draw well.

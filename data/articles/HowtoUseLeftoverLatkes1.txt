 Use one tablespoon of oil in a medium or large pan over medium heat. Once the oil has begun to warm, it will look shinier and begin to spread. Lift the pan from the heat and swirl the pan around horizontally. You should have enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan.The oil shouldn’t smoke or burn. If it does, turn the heat down a bit.;
, Think about what you would like in your breakfast scramble. Cook the fruit or vegetables for five to seven minutes, or until softened. Produce will shrink down a little bit, but aim for bite-sized chunks when you chop fruit or veggies to add to your scramble.The oil should be warm enough that the food you place on it sizzles. If not, turn up the heat a bit.
You may want to add white onions or green onions. Other vegetables to consider are kale or spinach. Fruit, such as apple, strawberries, blueberries or banana can add an interesting twist.
 If you want to add meat, cook it completely in a separate pan first. For example, make breakfast sausage or bacon. Cut up meat into bite-sized pieces. Transfer the meat only (not the grease) into the skillet with your vegetables, once the produce has become soft.


If you’re making bacon, you may want to absorb some of the grease before adding it to your scramble. Place the bacon aside on a paper towel-lined plate. Press a paper towel on top of the bacon strips. Let it sit for a few minutes.
 Tear them into bite-sized chunks and put them into the skillet. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to stir the contents. Then push the mixed contents around so that there are several empty pits, one for each egg you want to use., Crack one egg into each “pit” you created. Cover the skillet and allow the eggs to cook, until you’re satisfied with their consistency. You can check their doneness by lightly rubbing a fork over the whites nearest the yolks, to see if it’s still runny or jiggly.

 To fully register for the consultant program, you must meet with another Avon consultant to complete paperwork and discuss the program in more detail.


Ask the Avon consultant about the materials you should bring to the meeting; such as identification, and registration fees. The fees for becoming an Avon consultant will vary depending on the region and country in which you live.
 During your meeting with the local Avon consultant, you will be provided with the necessary registration paperwork for becoming a consultant.
 The Avon consultant will address your concerns, and answer any questions you have about the consultant program in its entirety.

 You don't have to pretend to be someone that you're not. Be true to a personality that fits you, and that feels natural to you. Uniqueness in your personality is itself an attractive quality.


Avoid seeing your personality as static. You will likely change over time. You may become less shy. You may become more open-minded. Or maybe, you become more stubborn as you grow older.
Whatever your personality is or becomes, it is adaptable. It is uniquely yours, and you have the ability to adapt it, change it, or keep it as is.
 Ultimately, your personality may tied to your sense of happiness. You may wonder how you can change your personality to be a happier and healthier you. It starts with finding your inner happiness. What gives you peace? What makes you feel calm, relaxed, and rested?


Learn ways to cultivate happiness in yourself.
Do relaxing activities. Meditate. Listen to music. Take a walk in nature. Take time for yourself.
 Remember that developing a sense of yourself and your own unique personality starts and ends with loving yourself. Appreciate who you are and what you have to offer to others. Believe in yourself.Avoid negative talk or thinking. If there are others putting you down, avoid defining yourself on their terms. You determine who you are.
Find supports that boost your positive personality traits. Find others that welcome you, and make you feel loved. Share with them your concerns.
Be kind to yourself every day.

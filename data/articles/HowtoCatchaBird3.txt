 Birds that don’t spend much time outside probably will not recognize their home.However, your bird may be drawn back home by the sound of their bird calls. You can also try leaving your bird’s cage along with lots of your bird’s favorite food on your front lawn or doorstep. Your bird will be drawn to the familiar cage (and his favorite food)., If you can purchase a trap at a pet store and place it outside with food. This will draw them in. Otherwise, you can try placing an extra cage on your roof with some food and watch for signs of your bird. Either way, it should be placed as high as possible, because birds prefer to be in the air.Check frequently, because your bird will likely panic when captured.
You will want to use what is called a "live trap," which traps the bird without causing physical harm to it. Typically, this will be a cage trap, which, like it sounds, is a cage that will trap any bird that steps inside., It is extremely probable that a domesticated bird left in the wild for an extended period of time will contract some sort of illness or suffer from malnutrition. Take your bird to a vet as soon as possible to check for any problems.


Don’t be disheartened if your bird doesn’t reappear immediately though. Some birds can live for years in the wild.

Place cages 4-6 inches apart for a week.
Switch bedding between cages.
Switch cages.

Choose somewhere your resident rats do not normally go. Otherwise they may get territorial.
Place a towel or blanket down for protection.



This allows the rats to become friends with the new rat one-to-one without the risk of the resident rats ganging up on the new rat.
Start with the least dominant resident rat.
Be prepared for small scuffles and dominance acts initially.  These include "power-gooming", grabbing the nape of the neck or ears, rolling the other rat onto its back.
Separate the rats if one makes the other scream (squeaking is fine), draws blood, or is excessively dominant for a long period of time.
When one rat is introduced, hierarchy has been established and both rats are playing or uninterested in each other, take the resident rat out and introduce another resident rat.



Make sue the cage, bedding, toys, tunnels, hammocks and hidey-holes are clean, this will prevent territorial acts.
Be prepared for more establishing of the hierarchy, but if any rats show true aggression, or more than one rat is ganging up on the new rat, separate them and go back to step 1
Be prepared for dominance acts the first couple days.  If it goes on for a week or one or more rats are picking on the newcomer, separate the rats and return to step 1.

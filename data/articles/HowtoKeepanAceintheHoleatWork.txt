 If you want to climb the ladder at work, make an effort to develop a friendly rapport with your bosses and your boss's bosses. Get as personal as is possible for your work environment without crossing the line between professionalism and indecency.;
, However obvious this sounds, it bears mentioning that when you do well, people notice. Many people complain about their jobs and daydream about getting a job promotion when in actuality they are slacking off at the jobs they do have. Don't be one of those people.
 While working on a Saturday may not be your first choice for weekend fun, it may payoff when it comes job promotion time. If you spend your time off work sitting on the couch or watching television, then consider the benefits of giving up that lazy time in exchange for a chance to prove your worth on the job and, in turn, climb the ladder.
 Sometimes this requires being the leader and other times it requires taking orders and humbly completing tasks. Prove your adaptability and you will stand out, even if you are standing in the background.
 No one likes a complainer. Stand out from the herd and obtain job security by steering clear of griping co workers and keeping your eye on the prize.
 Bring pictures of your family to work. Talk about your personal interests. Show your sense of humor. These things will make you human and likable (and, in turn, favored) amongst your co workers.

 Blend the ricotta and cream together in a food processor until smooth.Set the blended cream mixture aside until ready to use.
You could also use a blender if you do not have a food processor.
Heavy cream will create a smoother, richer sauce, but half-and-half will create a lighter, healthier sauce.
 Use a small to medium skillet and heat the oil over medium heat.


If you do not have olive oil, canola oil or vegetable oil will work as substitutions.
The oil is hot enough to work with once it begins to glisten slightly.
 Add the chopped onion to the hot oil and and Sauté for 5 to 6 minutes.The onion should become translucent and soft.
Stir the onion continually with a heat-resistant spatula as you Sauté it.
If you do not have fresh onion, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) dried minced onion flakes, instead. Add the onion flakes when you add the cream and ricotta blend to the pan.
 Toss the minced garlic into the skillet with the onion and oil. Cook for an additional 1 minute.


The garlic should become fragrant.
Stir the contents of the pan continually as they Sauté.
If you do not have fresh minced garlic, use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder, instead. Add the garlic powder to the pan when you add the cream mixture.
 Add the ricotta and cream mixture to the skillet and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for another 3 minutes.


The sauce should simmer slowly as it cooks. Once it thickens and reduces slightly, it can be removed from the heat.
 Add the parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir the seasonings into the sauce with a wooden spoon.


If you do not have fresh herbs, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) dried parsley and 1 tsp (5 ml) dried thyme, instead.
More salt and pepper can be added, if desired. Stir the salt and pepper in according to taste.

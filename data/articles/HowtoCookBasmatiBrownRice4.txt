 Mix 2 cups (470 ml) brown basmati rice, 2.5 cups (590 ml) of water and 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) salt in the pressure cooker and turn the burner to medium-high or high heat to reach high pressure., Begin timing when the pressure cooker reaches high pressure.Various models will have different types of valves to alert you when the pressure cooker is at high pressure.
Those with spring valves generally have a bar or rod that rises; jiggler valves will rock and jiggle slowly at first and then rapidly; weight-modified valves will whistle and hiss as they lift up and down., Reduce the burner's temperature until the pressure cooker has stabilized and let the rice keep cooking.The total time from reaching high pressure until you're done should be between 12-15 minutes.


Again, the time depends upon the amount of time you pre-soaked the rice., Allow the temperature and pressure to drop naturally for about 10-15 minutes after turning off the heat. The safety-locking mechanism will disengage or an indicator will alert you that the pressure has dropped.Alternatively, put on oven mitts and place the pressure cooker in the sink. Run cold water over it to decrease the pressure. Then remove the valve and push the button/twist/press the lever to release water vapor and any remaining pressure.Either way, be careful while doing this and know from where the vapor will shoot out so you aren't burned., Use a fork to fluff the rice and serve now, or refrigerate or freeze for later use.

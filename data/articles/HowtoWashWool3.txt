 Lay a clean, dry towel out on a counter or other flat surface, then lay the wool garment on top of the towel. Roll the towel from one corner to the other with the wool item inside.The clean towel will help to absorb the excess water from the wool so that it will take a shorter time to air dry.
 When the towel is rolled completely, gently squeeze the roll from one end to another. Donâ€™t twist or wring the rolled towel, as this can damage the fibers of the wool., Unroll the towel and take out the wool item. Lay out another clean towel, then place the wool garment on top of the clean towel to air dry. To speed up the process of drying, place a fan or dehumidifier in front of the drying wool.Do not hang up the wool garment on a hanger to dry, as this can cause the item to stretch and become misshapen.
 Exposure to water sometimes has the effective of shrinking a wool garment. If your garment looks smaller than it was before washing, stretch it while it is still damp, starting by stretching it from top to bottom, then working up the garment while you stretch it side to side. Also stretch the sleeves if your garment is a shirt or sweater.


You can also stretch the garment and pin it in place to the towel with sewing pins so that it dries stretched out, but this should be a last resort since it sometimes warps the pinned areas.

 A basic announcement is always appropriate if you feel too overwhelmed to write anything else. You can keep your announcement to a few sentences. However, there may be other situations where you want to write a short announcement.


You’re publishing an announcement in a newspaper. There may be a word limit, so you may want to keep the announcement as short as possible.
You want to invite people to the funeral but don’t know them too well. You can limit the amount of information you share with people you don’t know. You can send a more intimate announcement to friends and family.;
, You can begin your announcement with a simple sentence stating who has died and the date of their passing. You may also choose to include their age. Often, you will make this announcement as a family.


For example, you can write, “The Smith family announces with great sadness the loss of their beloved mother, Eileen, age 81, on September 1, 2016.”Here is alternate wording: “The Smith family announces the passing of their mother, Eileen, who died peacefully on September 1, 2016.”
Another wording: “Eileen Smith. 81. Our beloved mother passed away on September 1, 2016.”, You might hold a mass or a funeral—or both. You should state when the event will be held and where.


For example, you can write: “A Holy Mass will be held on September 8, 2016, at 8:00 pm at the Catholic Church of St. Ann.”If you’re having a funeral, then write: “A funeral service will be held on September 8, 2016 at 2:30 pm at United Methodist Church, Any City.”

, Those in grief might want to contribute money in the memory of your loved one. Make sure to mention any foundation or scholarship fund they can contribute to.For example, you can write, “Memorial donations in Eileen’s name may be made to the NAACP College Fund.”

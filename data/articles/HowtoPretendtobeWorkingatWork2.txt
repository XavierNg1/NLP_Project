 Move about a lot, don't sit idle a lot. Shift around from time to time to look like you're thinking.
 Remember, busyness does not equate with getting things done; busy activity just looks so urgent and productive people make assumptions that it is. And a busy person has an excuse to be in the cafe several floors down... doing something but who knows what.
 Ask hard work-related questions so that people actively seek to avoid you. This will end up buying you space as people deliberately veer away from you.


Think up a few important-sounding questions to ask your boss or colleagues concerning your work. Keep this up until they make excuses when they see you coming.
 When hanging out, keep a sad face so that people will know you have problems with that heavy pile of work stuff that you're trudging through tragically. Twitching your eyebrows regularly may help.
 If a colleague who isn't trustworthy comes visiting your lab, start working more vigorously. If you can't manage that, drop something quickly and start clearing it up.

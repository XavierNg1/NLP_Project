 When you've finished diving for the day, rinse your suit in fresh water as soon as possible. Most dive operators have a rinse tank. Salt water can cause neoprene to lose its flexibility, and an non-rinsed wetsuit smells bad.;
, As soon as you are able, soak your wetsuit in clean, warm water for about 15 minutes. You also should wash your suit occasionally using wetsuit shampoo or baby shampoo.
 Use a special wetsuit hanger if you have one; if not, use a plastic hanger. Never use a thin wire hanger. The metal will cause the neoprene to degrade. Do not hang it to dry in the sun, the neoprene can crack, find a nice windy spot in the shadow,like under a tree. Let the wetsuit dry thoroughly before storing it to keep it looking and smelling good.
 Before you store your wetsuit, check for any rips or tears. It's easy to get them fixed when they are small.
 Store your wetsuit flat or hung as described above. Do not fold it or shove it in a drawer. The wetsuit will crease and lose some of its insulating effectiveness.

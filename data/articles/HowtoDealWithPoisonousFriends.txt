 Grab a blank notebook and start writing. Who do you want to be? What do you like about yourself? How do others see you? What are your values? If you could change anything about yourself, what would you change? Decide how you want to live your life. This does not have to be a comprehensive evaluation, but it should include those things which are most important to you.;
, Do you say what you honestly think or feel? Do you put others down because you know that he or she will enjoy it? Do you feel like you have to impress him or her? Do you fight for his or her attention? Ask yourself questions like these.
 From now on, you will be true to yourself and your values. Think before you speak or act. It might be difficult to begin asserting your true self, but it will be worth it.
 Don't be afraid to be apart from your poisonous friend.
 Get a hobby. Invite a new friend to a movie (do not flaunt this to your friend, though, since that would make you a somewhat poisonous friend). Join a gym, volunteer or do something that makes you a better person and makes you feel good about yourself. Just try to set yourself apart from your friend.
 Be discreet and gradually reduce the time that you spend with this person. Remain polite and friendly when you see your friend but don't make bigger arrangements to see each other.
 Don't share personal information or secrets with someone you do not absolutely trust, as that person could break your confidences. Be kind to everyone, but be choosy when it comes to developing close friendships. This is not snobbery, this is wisdom.

 If you're creating archives of your data, or don't want someone else overwriting what you've put on the disc, use a DVD-R or DVD-R DL (Dual Layer). If you want to be able to rewrite and edit the content on the disc, use a DVD-RW.
 Most modern operating systems allow you to burn data DVDs directly from your file explorer without any additional software. Opening the blank disc will allow you to add files and folders.


In Windows 7 and later, you'll be prompted to select whether you want to use the disc like a USB drive, or like a traditional finished DVD. Selecting "Like a USB flash drive" will allow you to rewrite the disc, even if it isn't a rewriteable disc, but it will only work in Windows. Selecting "With a CD/DVD player" will make the disc act like a traditional disc that will need to be finalized and can only be used once.If you are using OS X, the blank disc will appear on your desktop. Double-click it to open it in the Finder., You won't lose the original copies of the files. You can fit about to 4.38 GB worth of data onto a single blank DVD-R. The status bar at the bottom of the window will display how much space you have left.
 Once you're finished adding files, you can finalize your disc and eject it so that you can use it on other computers. The process is a little different depending on your operating system and settings.


If you selected "Like a USB flash drive" in Windows, just eject your disc after you're finished adding files and the disc will be made ready to use on other Windows computers. This may take a minute or so.
If you selected "With a CD/DVD player" in Windows, click the "Finish burning" button to finalize the disc. This may take a few minutes.
If you're using OS X, click the Burn button next to the disc name in the left sidebar.

 If you haven't already, first create a PayPal business account as described in Part 1. Your customer will be able to click on the payment button on your website and easily make a payment using a credit card, a debit card or a checking account.


PayPal also allows you to send invoices with a "Pay Now" button linked to PayPal that allows your customers to pay instantly.
 Use the "login" bar in the top right. You'll need to input your email address and the password you chose for your account.
 You'll see a button that says "Create payment buttons for your website." Click this button.
 Using the drop-down menu, you can select a variety of messages for your button - "Buy Now," "Add to Cart," "Donate," and others. Enter the required information about your product or service, then click "Create Button."


If you're selling a product, you'll need to know the cost of shipping and any associated tax so this can be added onto your invoices.
At the bottom of the page, you'll see additional options for tracking inventory and customizing your PayPal features.
 You'll then be taken to a page that contains a box of HTML code. Copy and paste this code into your website's HTML to create a button on your page. To do this, you'll need the ability to edit your website's HTML code.


If you don't know what HTML code is (or you're not confident enough to edit it), consult one of our many guides on the subject, several of which are listed here: HTML How-To Articles

If you employ a web developer, send him or her the HTML code in the body of an email - he or she will be able to add the button to your website.

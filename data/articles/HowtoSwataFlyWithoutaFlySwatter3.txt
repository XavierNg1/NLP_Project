 Get the fly to an area you can more easily swat at it, like a small, clean room with lots of flat open surfaces. Wave your hand near it to disrupt its current resting place and move it in the direction you want.


Close off interior doors in your house to contain the fly to one room. This will give it fewer objects to land on, and help you see it and keep track of its movements in a smaller space.
You may also use an object like a newspaper or magazine to help shoo the fly by “fanning” or moving the air around the fly with it to help guide it in the right direction.
 Find a suitable surface for swatting at a fly effectively with your hands or another object. Look for hard, flat, and even surfaces that will make it easier to hit the fly.


While a vertical surface like a wall may work sufficiently, a horizontal surface like an empty tabletop typically works best, as you have the additional help of gravity when swatting downward.
It helps to pick out several possible surfaces in the fly’s area that it might land on and that you can be ready to approach slowly.
Be sure that any surface you have in mind is clear of items that might get disrupted or broken by a heavy swatting motion. For instance, avoid a wall with hanging pictures or a glass-topped coffee table.
 Once you’ve ushered a fly into the room you want, wait until it lands on one of the surfaces you’ve picked out as good for swatting. Be patient in waiting for this to happen.


Try waiting earlier or later in the day to catch a fly if you can. Houseflies are more active in the hottest part of the day, when their food sources are decomposing quickest, so they will be harder to catch resting in any one spot.You can also try to tempt a fly to one of your ideal surfaces by placing a small amount of moist food containing proteins or sugars on it. Try a small dab of fruit jam, for example, or even a little piece of raw meat.

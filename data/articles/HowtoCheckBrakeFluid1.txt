 It's best to do this when the car is stopped on a level surface, with the engine cold.

, On most cars, the master cylinder is located at the back of the engine bay, on the driver's side. There's a reservoir above the cylinder itself.
 On most newer cars, the reservoir is transparent, with lines marked "Min" and "Max"; the brake fluid level should fall between these lines. Cars older than the 1980s may have metal reservoirs, requiring you to remove the reservoir cap. (Newer caps screw on and off, while some older caps need to be pried off with a screwdriver.)








, Pour the fluid carefully into the reservoir, wiping up any spills, as brake fluid is toxic and corrosive.









Use only the brake fluid with the DOT specification recommended in your owner's manual. There are three main specifications: DOT 3, DOT 4 and DOT 5, each having its own properties. It is possible to use DOT 4 brake fluid in some cars that call for DOT 3 fluid, but never the reverse, and DOT 5 brake fluid can be used only in cars that call for that specification.










If the brake fluid level is significantly below the "Min" or "Add" line, you should have your brakes inspected for excessive wear. As brake pads wear down, brake fluid can channel itself out of the brake lines into the calipers.
It is also possible to have the brake fluid reservoir full and not have the brake fluid reaching the master cylinder. If your brakes feel spongy even with the reservoir full, take your car to a mechanic.

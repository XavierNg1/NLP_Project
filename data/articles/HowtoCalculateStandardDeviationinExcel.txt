, Standard deviation is generally used on a small sample of data that needs to be graphed or an entire population.


Excel has different formulas for figuring out the standard deviation of an entire population and the standard deviation of the sample of a population. Keep this in mind when you choose your formula later on.



The locations and functions of the Excel program can differ greatly depending upon the version you use. If you cannot find a button on the formatting bar, look in the top horizontal toolbar.
 In most cases, you will start in box A1.


Enter headings at the top of the columns.
Enter the name or date that identifies each occurrence on the left of each row. Enter the corresponding data on the right.

You can also place the standard deviation number in any other empty cell in the Excel spreadsheet. Excel may automatically figure out your data range if you put it underneath a list of numbers.
 Remember that the formula should be entered without spaces.
 This is the Excel syntax for standard deviation. When you use this abbreviation for a data range, Excel will figure out mean and standard deviation automatically.


Excel formulas differ depending upon the version of Excel you are using. Although STDEV is fairly standard, you may need to use STDEVA or STDEVAP in its place.
Choose either STDEV.P or STDEV.S to signify whether you are using an entire population or a sample population.
 A data range is a series of numbers in a certain column or row.


In Excel, data ranges are listed in the following manner: (C2:C15). Your entire formula would be "=STDEV(C2:C15)."

, Your standard deviation for your sample should appear in the box.


You can also use the Excel formula wizard to choose the standard deviation formula. Click on "Insert" in the Formula bar. Then, select "Statistical" and select "STDEV." Type in your data range in the box that pops up. Press "Ok" or "Enter" to complete your formula.

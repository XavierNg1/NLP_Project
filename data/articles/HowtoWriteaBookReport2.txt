 In the first paragraph, state the title and author of the book. Your teacher may want the publisher, year of publication, genre, and the number of pages, too.


In addition to the basic facts, you should give a short summary of what your book report explores. Touch on very basic plot points of the book and the themes the author used.
 For the next few paragraphs, refer to your teacher's assignment sheet to decide which parts of your outline you want to expand on in the meat of your report.


Consider giving your opinion of the book. Was it good? What about the book made it good or bad, powerful or dull? How does this work compare with others by the same author or other books in the same genre? You can and should use examples from the book to back up your claims.
Dig a little deeper. What major themes, motifs, or terms does the book introduce, and how effective are they? Did the book appeal to you on an emotional or logical way? Would you recommend this book to others? Why? What would you tell them before they read it? What would you talk about after you read it?Don't try to summarize each chapter or every angle. Choose the ones that are most significant and interesting to you.For non-fiction, provide a general overview of the author's topic, main points, and argument. What is the thesis? What are the important conclusions? What are the author's qualifications to write about the subject? Do you agree with the author's arguments and conclusions? What is your overall response to the book? Did you find it interesting, moving, dull?, Restate your thesis or main idea in your conclusion. Review the major points and, if appropriate, state your opinion.


Pull all your thoughts together. Leave the reader with the impression you were left with and, if the book was good, make them want to read the book for themselves.

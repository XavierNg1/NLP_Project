 A good way to save money on vet care for your dog is to insure them. Pet insurance can cover injuries, illnesses, wellness care, hereditary conditions, and even behavioral issues. Each plan is different, and the cost varies according to the type of plan and coverage you select. Talk to your vet about finding a health insurance plan that is right for you and your dog, and make sure you shop around before deciding on a plan.You can also look for pet insurance through your home or automobile insurance company.
 If pet insurance doesn’t seem like the right option for your pet, you can cushion the shock of unexpected vet bills by setting up a savings account. Deposit a set amount of money to the account each month, and dedicate this account solely to your pet’s veterinarian care. Having money set aside for vet care will make dealing with pet emergencies or illnesses easier., Many veterinarians will offer payment plans to help you cover unexpected vet care costs. Oftentimes these plans will help you pay for high-cost procedures slowly over time, through monthly or weekly installments. Some vets also offer preventative plans that help you save on routine vet care costs like dental cleaning, vaccines, or diagnostic tests for a monthly fee., Shopping around can sometimes result in savings on vet care for your dog. This is especially important if your pet is undergoing a costly procedure. Call several veterinarian practices in your area and ask for quotes on routine vet care or specific procedures.

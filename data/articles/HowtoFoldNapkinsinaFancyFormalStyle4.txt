 Arrange it so that the bottom edge of the napkin is facing your chest, and the top edge is facing away from you.









For best results, press the napkin first so it doesn't have any creases. If you want it to stand up straight, use starch.
If you're using a patterned napkin, the patterned side should be facing down, and the less colorful side should be facing up.
 Bring the bottom edge up to meet the top edge, so that the crease is facing you. Press the fold with a hot iron.
 The napkin will now be in the shape of a small square, with all of the corners layered on top of one another. Press the folds with a hot iron.
 Situate the square in front of you so that the napkin's corners are in the top right corner. Take just the top layer from the stack of corners, and roll it diagonally down toward the center. Stop rolling with the top layer is just past the center of the napkin, forming a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right corner. Use an iron to press the roll flat.
 Take the next layer from the stack of corners, and fold it down diagonally so that the tip is tucked under the roll you just made. Leave about an inch of the layer untucked. The width of the untucked portion of the layer should be the same as the width of the roll. Use a hot iron to press the fold.
 Take the corner and fold it under, rather than folding it down like you did for the first two layers. Tuck the corner under so that the width of the untucked portion of the layer is the same as the width of the roll and the folded second layer. This will give the appearance of three pockets stacked in a row. use a hot iron to crease the fold.
 Take the left edge of the napkin and fold it under so that the ends of the folds are hidden and the napkin is rectangular in appearance. Use a hot iron to crease the fold.
 Since the fold provides three pockets, consider tucking in a menu, silverware or a flower.

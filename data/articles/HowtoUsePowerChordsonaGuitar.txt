 For the sake of learning, start with it on the 3rd fret of the low E string. This note is a G. Wherever you start your index finger is the type of chord you'll be playing. If you started on the 5th fret of the E string you'd be playing an A power chord, for example.

, Continuing the example of the G power chord, you place your ring finger on the 5th fret of the A string. This simple form -- two strings, two frets apart, is all you need for a power chord.

, If you would like, add in an octave by simply barring your ring finger on the string below, here the D string. You can also use your pinky. Your final chord would look like this:

, You can use the fleshy part of your index finger to lightly dampen the lower strings, resting on them so you can't hear them when you strum. However, unless you're making big, dramatic strumming motions you can just focus on playing the right strings.
 Remember, power chords are movable; you can play them anywhere by maintaining this same shape and hand position. Start on the 5th fret, 5th string to play a D, slide down two frets and play an E. Come up a string to the 7th fret, 6th string and play a B power chord. You can move anywhere.









Remember that, in terms of written music, these chords are often written as fifths, like a G5 or an A#5. They will not be written out as "G power chord," or "G P.C."

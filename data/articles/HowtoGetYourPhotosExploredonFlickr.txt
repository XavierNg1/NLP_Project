 Lots and lots of photos, of lots of different things, nature, animals, people, random or creative? Have a selection for all!;
, So you can save uploading space(unless you are a pro. Non pro flickr members have a 100mb limit per month)

, A photo of a simple flower could have lots and lots of tags like: Pretty, Flower, Nature, Simple, Beautiful, Beauty, Leaves, Petals, Buds, Outside, Grass, Bug, Sky, etc.
 Go to flickr explore, look through the 500 photos, pick some really good photographers. Add them as contacts, and comment on their photos. They should most likely comment back, and give you some critique!

, Some groups offer 10+ comments when you comment on ten and post a photo. Some people add their photo to over 50 groups, just to get comments quickly. This devalues the photo's interest and will not give you a good chance of getting on explore.

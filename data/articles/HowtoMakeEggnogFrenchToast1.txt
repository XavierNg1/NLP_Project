 Put the eggnog, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Break the eggs into the same bowl. Whisk these ingredients together until well blended. Pour the mixture into a wide, shallow dish., Take a nonstick skillet and coat it with butter or nonstick spray. Put it on the stove over medium heat.


If you have an electric skillet, set the temperature to 300 degrees.
 Cut your French loaf into 12 even pieces. Each piece of bread should be about 1 to 1 1⁄2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) thick. Take a piece of bread and dip it in the egg mixture. Move the piece of bread around to make sure the side is coated. Flip the piece of bread over, coating the other side in the same way.


You can leave your bread in the mixture anywhere from 10 seconds to 1 minute. The longer you let it set, the more your bread will soak in the mixture. If you like bready French toast, don't let it soak too long. If you like moist French toast, let it soak longer.
You can cut your pieces either thickness. The thicker the piece, the more bready your piece of French toast will be.
Depending on how long your loaf is, you may have leftover bread.
 Take your coated bread and place it into your pan. Let it cook on this side until it is golden brown. Flip the bread over. Let it cook on this side until it is golden brown as well. Remove from the pan and place aside. Continue with each piece of bread until you have made them all. Top with syrup and butter or powdered sugar.


This recipe makes 6 servings.
If you want to keep your toast warm while you cook, cover the plate of toast with aluminum foil or place in a warmed oven.

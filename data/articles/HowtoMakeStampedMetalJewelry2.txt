 Adding color to the letters and shapes that you imprint in the metal will help them to stand out more. To add color to your letters and symbols, you will need to use a permanent marker, such as a sharpie, or acrylic paints.Choose the colors that you want to use before you begin.


Black works well for most designs, but you could also use red to emphasize a heart shape that you have imprinted, or go for red and green if you have created a Christmas design.
If you are using acrylic paint, then you will need a fine tipped brush as well.
 When you are ready to add color to the letters and symbols you have imprinted into the metal, trace the marker or paint brush along the indented parts of the metal. However, do not worry if you go outside of the lines.Make sure that the color is dark and that there are no unfilled spots.
Try not to use too much paint if you are using acrylic paint to fill in the indents. This may result in clumps of paint in the grooves of the metal, which may look sloppy. Start with a small amount of paint on the brush and add more as needed.
 After you finish coloring in the indented areas, apply some rubbing alcohol to a clean paper towel. Use just enough to make the paper towel damp. It should not be dripping. Then, wipe over the areas you just covered. This will remove the marker from the areas that are above the indentations.You may need to wipe the metal two or three times to get all of the excess permanent marker off. When you are done, the only place that marker should appear is in the indented areas of your metal tag.

 Pack the kale into a resealable plastic bag, but do not seal the bag yet.


If you're working with a larger batch of kale, place the kale into an airtight plastic container. Keep the leaves relatively loose and don't pack the container too full since doing so could bruise or otherwise damage the kale.;
, Squeeze out as much air from the bag as possible before sealing it.


The paper towel should be able to absorb any excess moisture and prevent the kale from spoiling faster.
When storing kale in plastic containers, line the bottom of the container with one paper towel before putting the kale inside, then place a second paper towel over the top of the kale before sealing the container.
 Place the kale in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator and use it within five to seven days.


If you don't have a crisper drawer, keep the kale in the door compartment or on a standard refrigerator shelf with the stems facing toward the back of the refrigerator. The back of the refrigerator is the coldest area, and the stems are the hardiest portion of the kale, so they're less likely to become damaged from the cold.
Note that the kale may become more bitter after several days, even with proper storage, so it's still best to use it as soon as possible., If the kale begins to dry out and wilt, you can rehydrate it by dunking the bundle into cool to lukewarm water for approximately 10 minutes.If you need to continue storing the kale afterward, thoroughly dry it using a salad spinner before returning it to the bag. Wet kale will spoil faster.
 Rinse the kale under cool, running water and dry thoroughly with clean paper towels prior to using or consuming it.


Do not wash the kale prior to storing it. Doing so could introduce too much moisture into the storage container and may result in quicker spoilage.

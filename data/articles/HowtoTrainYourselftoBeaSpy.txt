 Especially if you have wooden floors. Creaks can always give a spy away. When walking, stay near walls as the floor in those areas will creak less, and travel down stairs on all fours. When walking, land feet on the ball of your foot and roll into the toes, making no noise.;
, Always find places to hear but you're still not noticed. Listening through vents is one of the best techniques for hearing secret conversations while not being seen. Stay low, and do what you can to not move if suspected.
 Even household items can be very useful. You can watch videos on YouTube on how to make cheap and effective tools to help you. The most useful of all tools is a recording device, such as an audio recorder, wire or notepad.
 Take what you know you'll need not what you think you'll want!, The best time for missions is during the night, where you can't be seen. To get a better night vision, duck low and use light reflecting off of objects to see better. Wait 20 minutes to have full night vision.
 In case you get caught, you will need to defend. Escape is always good, but be ready to disable the target then escape.
 It's not very likely that you'll get away from a gunman, but it's good to be prepared. Get a partner and let him throw soft balls, such as tennis balls, at you and you must dodge them. It is encouraged to also stretch before doing any espionage.
 Try sitting in a quiet, dark room for extended periods of time to hone and develop senses.
 If you're trying to blend in, it won't work if you're jumping around like a kangaroo. Practice getting into a prone position quickly without hassle. This may also come in handy.
 You'll never know if someone could be listening, so practice something like navy hand signals, or use a code (morse, roman sticks, anagrams, etc.).

 The United States spans six time zones: Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, Pacific Time, Hawaii Time, and Alaska Time. These time zones range from 5 to 10 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT-5:00 to GMT-10:00), depending on which state you are calling from. Lithuania is in the Eastern European Time Zone, which operates two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT +2:00). This means that, during most of the year, midnight in Lithuania will occur at 5pm Eastern and 2pm Pacific. The exception is around the changeover dates between standard time and daylight saving time because these begin and end on different dates in Europe. If in doubt, and you are calling Lithuania after midday, place your call an hour earlier.;
, In order to dial international calls to Lithuania you will need: the United States Exit Code, Lithuania's Country Code, the local Lithuanian City/Area Code and the Subscriber phone number you are calling. You may find most of this information on line.


United States Exit Code is 011.
Lithuania's Country Code is 370.
Subscriber numbers vary in length - small towns have 5 digit numbers whereas the capital Vilnius has 7 digit numbers. However, the area/city code together with the subscriber number are always 8 digits. This is true of mobile numbers also. If you see a 9 digit number, such as (8383) 99999, the 8 should be omitted, as it performs a similar function to the "1-" before US area codes.
 If you are placing a call from New York, United States to Moletai, Lithuania you will dial: 011 370 383 XXXXX (X equals the subscriber number).

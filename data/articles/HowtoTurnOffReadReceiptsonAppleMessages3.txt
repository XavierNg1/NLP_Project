 If you have read receipts enabled but wish to disable them for a specific contact, you can do so from within a conversation with that contact.
 If you're already in a conversation, tap < in the top left corner of your screen to return to your "Messages" menu.
 This is the encircled "i" in the top right corner of your screen.
 It should turn grey.


If this switch is already grey, your read receipts are already turned off.
 Your contact will no longer receive read receipts!

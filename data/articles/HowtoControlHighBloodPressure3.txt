 Stress and anxiety is one of the major causes of high blood pressure. Take time to think about what is stressing you and how you can solve the problem to alleviate your hypertension. Is there an area of your life that may be exacerbating the problem?


If stressors can't be done away with, how can you change your coping behaviors? Consider taking up yoga or taking time out of your day to meditate or work on deep breathing.
 Depending on how high your blood pressure is and its consistency, your appointment frequency will vary from those of another person. It's always better to err on the side of caution!


Find a doctor and stick with him/her. When your doctor knows you well, he/she can better treat you. The more they're familiar with your history, the easier it will be to get you on a path to lower numbers!

, This is something that should only be done upon the advice of your doctor. Diuretics and beta-blockers are two of the most common that your doctor may recommend. Diuretics dispel excess salt and toxins from your body and beta blockers slow your heart rate down. But there's over half a dozen other varieties, too!As for supplements, though they can be taken with the best of intentions, they're not always good ideas. Talk to your doctor beforehand before taking anything.
 Friends and family can help you lower your blood pressure if you let them. They can back up your exercise plans or make appointments for you at the doctor's office. And they can keep junk out of the cupboards!


Blood pressure is such a common thing nowadays, it's a safe bet you know other people going through the same issues (especially since it's hereditary). If you can, find a workout or cooking buddy to make the good habits come a bit easier.

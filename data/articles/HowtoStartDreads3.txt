 This method of forming dreadlocks does not work with shorter hair. Your hair will need to have substantial length in order to form natural dreadlocks. This process also takes time: it can take at least three years for naturally made dreadlocks to form.Natural dreadlocks will only form for individuals with curly, natural, black hair. Individuals with Caucasian or Asian hair will need to use another method—or visit a hair salon—in order to obtain dreadlocks.
 In order for your hair to form natural dreadlocks, it should first be clean. While various rumors may imply that hair needs to be unwashed—or even deliberately soiled—in order for dreads to form, this is untrue. Your hair makes its own oils, which are necessary for healthy hair, but too much of these oils will prevent hair from forming dreadlocks.Once you start naturally growing dreadlocks, you should take a two-week break from washing your hair, to avoid breaking the locks apart. After this two-week period, begin regularly washing your hair again, once or twice a week.
 This is the central step to forming natural dreadlocks: you’ll need to resist the temptation to brush or comb your hair, and let your hair naturally bind itself together. It’s difficult to predict the growth form of natural dreadlocks; unlike other methods, you will not be able to guide or control the shape of your dreadlocks.It’s possible to make minor adjustments to naturally formed dreads, however. For example, if your hair develops a thin dreadlock, you can combine this into a larger dread using rubber bands and dread cream.

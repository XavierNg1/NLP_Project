 If your baby is born in a hospital located in the United States, then you will apply for a birth certificate at the hospital soon after your baby is born. When you are providing information for your baby’s birth certificate, you will be asked if you want to apply for an SS number for your baby. Mark ‘yes’ in the appropriate space on the birth certificate application., If you say ‘yes’ to applying for an SS number for your baby along with her birth certificate application, you should provide both parents’ SS numbers if known. However, it is still possible to apply for an SS number for your baby without this information., Applying for an SS number for your baby at the hospital is voluntary, but if you do apply for an SS number along with your baby’s birth certificate application, then the state agency that issues birth certificates will share the baby’s information with the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA will then mail you your baby’s SS card.Applying for an SS card for your baby at the hospital is a much more efficient way of getting an SS number for your baby. If you choose instead to apply at an SSA office later, this could add up to 12 weeks of processing time because the SSA would need to verify your baby’s birth certificate from the office that issued it. This verification process is designed to prevent people from using fraudulent birth records to obtain SS numbers.Know that in some localities, the Post Office will not deliver your baby’s SS card unless her name is on your mailbox.

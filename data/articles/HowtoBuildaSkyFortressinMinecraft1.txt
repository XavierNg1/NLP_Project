 Build a tower with ladders up to the height you want your sky fortress to be.


The tower here doesn't have to be made of anything fancy, though if you want to keep it, it should probably match the material of your sky fortress.
In creative mode, ladders are not necessary. In survival mode, they are the only way to get to the top!;
, Choose how wide and long you want your floor to be, what you want it to be made of, and get building.


This is by far the hardest step, though it is far easier in creative mode. If you have cheats enabled, type "/gamemode 1" to go into creative mode, and "/gamemode 0" to go back into survival.



If you build it up 2 blocks at a time, it will save a lot of falling damage.
A wall that is four blocks tall, with a ceiling one block above that, will feel vary spacious.
 Again, this is much easier in creative mode, particularly if your walls are tall.
 If you want to have that really spacious feel, or to separate different stuff, or just to have multiple floors, then repeat steps 3 and 4 on top of the roof of your current fortress, as many times as necessary.
 Your sky fortress is now ready to be filled with both useful and decorative items. You can set your spawn in your fortress if you have a bed, which will save a lot of going up and down the ladder.

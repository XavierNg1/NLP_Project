 For this experiment you’ll need a Bunsen burner, a six inch metal rod, wax, and tacks. Heat resistant gloves might also be useful for this experiment.
 Mold the wax around the tacks so that they will stick to the metal rod. Put one tack every inch along the length of the metal rod. Make sure that they are all on the same side of the rod.


You should have six tacks connected to the metal rod in all.
 Light a match or a lighter and then turn the gas tap on the Bunsen burner to the left to allow gas to release from the spigot. Place the flame over the gas spigot and the Bunsen burner will light. Be careful. Once you’ve lit the Bunsen burner you can secure the metal rod over it. The whole rod doesn’t need to be over the burner, just the outermost inch or so.


If you have heat resistant gloves and no other way to secure the metal rod over the burner, you can hold the rod there. Keep a steady hand.
 As the metal rod conducts heat the tacks closest to the burner will start to fall off. The wax will melt and the tacks will drop off onto the table. Once the final tack falls off you can turn off the Bunsen burner. Be careful not to touch the rod with your bare hands.


This experiment illustrates how metal conducts heat. You can visualize how one end of the metal rod got hot rather than the entire rod heating up at an equal pace. This is based on where the Bunsen burner was placed. If you placed the burner in the middle of the rod, the heat would start in the middle and extend outwards in either direction.

 When it comes time to do your sperm test, your doctor will give you a special cup or container. Masturbate and catch your ejaculate in the container. Make sure to put the lid on to avoid spills.If possible, do this in the clinic. If you need to, you may be able to take the container home with you. Ask your doctor to give you specific instructions about storing the container, and when to bring it back to the office.
 Some clinics may be able to provide you a special condom to wear during intercourse. This condom collects your semen for examination. Some men find it easier to ejaculate this way, and it may help you if you feel nervous at the doctor’s office. These may not always be available, however – ask your doctor about your options., Collecting a sperm sample can go wrong in a number of ways. Ask your doctor for specific details about how to collect an accurate sample. Follow these guidelines to the best of your ability:

Do not use lubricant, which can interfere with how your sperm move
Do not masturbate for at least a day before you collect your sample; on the other hand, abstain no more than 11 days before you collect your sample.
Make sure all of your ejaculate goes into the container. If you miss, wait a day and try again.

Each season, dig through closets and dressers to take a look at who needs what.
Have your kids try on each of their clothes to determine which fit and which do not.
Make a list of what each child has, as well as a list of what each child needs. Also follow this process for you and your spouse.
 Determine an overall budget and a budget per child. Kids who need more clothes should consume a larger part of your budget than kids who already have most of what they need.
 Make sure each child has one or two pairs of pajamas, several sets of nice clothing, and several sets of "play" clothes that can get a little dirty.
 Look for classic pieces like jeans, plain t-shirts, and standard dress clothes. Spend the majority of your family’s clothing budget on these basics.
 Neon orange polka dots might be in one season, but in a few years, the fad will likely be long gone. As a result, any clothing you bought will also be dated and embarrassing to wear, making it difficult to hand down. Get mileage out of your family’s clothes by limiting the amount of fads you adhere to.
 Designer jeans and shoes are largely unnecessary, no matter how much your teen argues otherwise.
 Your kids are important, but that does not mean you or your spouse should neglect your own wardrobes. Keep things reasonable and only buy what you really need, but don’t feel bad about caving in and purchasing a new pair of jeans or a nice blouse when you find yourself needing it.

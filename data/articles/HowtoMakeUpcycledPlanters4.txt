 This kind of material can rot and cause your plants to become sick. You should be able to remove these features with a utility knife or similar cutting utensil.


Rubber boots are the best kind to use for this upcycled planter. Anyone who has kids likely will have a pair of boots that are outgrown and can be upcycled.
 Some molds and fungi thrive in boots. These are likely mild strains, but even mild mold or fungus can be dangerous to a plant's roots. Use hot water and a mild soap to clean the boots inside and out, rinse them thoroughly, and let them air dry.
 If you're using children's boots, it may be the case that there are already designs on the outside of the boot you want to keep. Plain boots, however, can be decorated with a suitable spray paint.


You can even add designs to the base layer of spray paint after it dries. Use a paintbrush and regular paint to add your own flair to the boots.
 Old boots may already have holes in them. In this case, you may not need to add any. If you do need to add some, use a sturdy pair of shears to poke/cut these in the bottom.You can always check the drainage of boots by pouring water into them. If the water appears like it can easily flow out, your drainage is likely good enough.
 To prevent your boots from tipping over and losing soil or damaging your plants, you may want to put something heavy in the bottom of the boot. For example, a few rocks in the bottom could help flimsy boots stay upright.
 Although some plants may have special soil needs, most should be fine with a general potting soil. Add this to the boot, insert your plants, and place these upcycled boot planters around your house or garden.

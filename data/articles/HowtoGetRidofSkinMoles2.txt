 While many insurance plans will not cover cosmetic mole removal, there are other reasons that you might remove a mole. If your mole is bothering you, impairing your vision or functionality, or snagging on jewelry or clothing, your insurance company may cover removal., A dermatologist can usually remove a mole in one or two visits by simply cutting it off. Depending on the size and depth of the mole, your doctor may be able to "shave" your mole off so that it is flush with the skin, or may need to make a deeper cut and stitch the skin closed. If cancer is suspected, the mole will be sent to a lab for a biopsy.For most small moles, local anesthesia (numbing of the immediate area) is sufficient to prevent pain during removal.
If the mole grows back, see your doctor immediately, as this is a potential sign of cancer.
 There are dermatologists who treat moles with lasers, but this is not usually the first option. While lasers can destroy the cells of a mole, some people report that the pigmentation returns after treatment, often even darker than before., There are certain types of nevi or skin growths that are not moles, such as sun-induced patches of thick skin called keratosis, that can be removed by freezing and killing them. This is typically done with a cotton swab dipped in liquid nitrogen and takes only a minute or less.In cryotherapy, a residual blister or scab may appear at the site of the treatment, but this normally heals on its own.
See your doctor if there are signs of infection – redness, swelling, or drainage – or if the skin growth reappears after treatment.

 (This tutorial uses version 8.) This will be the free version. You can purchase the Pro Edition of Game Maker at a low price;
, The best way to start that is by creating sprites, which are basically images. You can use MS Paint or most any art program that you want (Game Maker comes with one also). This is the main part of creating your game, since it shows how much quality your game has. If you're not that good at drawing, you can always create your sprites by getting images from the Internet. If this is your first time creating a game, start simple and don't go overboard. In Club Penguin, the main characters are penguins, but you can do any characters that you want, whether they are animals or people.
 Now that that is done, we can start creating our objects. To have your characters move, you could program it so that they move when the player presses the arrow keys. Start this by creating an event. To have an object do what you want it to do, browse through the events, and then through the commands.
 Create rooms (which can be thought of as levels or menus) and load your objects into them. You can design backgrounds for them, also. Make sure that you test it a few times at every few changes that you make, so that you're not too confused later if something goes wrong.
 You can even keep it on your own computer on the desktop! Begin playing, and have a fun time!Â :)

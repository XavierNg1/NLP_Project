 Now you have to convert bit-length prefix to quad-dotted decimal representation. To do this follow below steps.

Write the the bit-prefix in below format.






If it's 27, then write it as 8 + 8 + 8 + 3 .
If it's 12, then write it as 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 .
Default is 32, which is 8 + 8 + 8 + 8.


Convert the corresponding bit according to the below table and represent in quad-dotted decimal format.






Let an IP address be 170.1.0.0/26 . Using above table, you can write:

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26
=
8
+
8

8
+
2


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
255
.
255
.
255
.
192


Now the IP address is 170.1.0.0 and subnet mask in quad-dotted decimal format is 255.255.255.192 .


Sub-net mask can be 0, 128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254 and 255.
Below table gives you the "Number of bits used for subnetting"(n) to their corresponding subnet mask.







For subnet mask 255 is default, so it'll not consider for subnet masking.
From the previous step, you got IP address = 170.1.0.0 and Sub-net mask = 255.255.255.192
Total bits = Tb = 8
Number of bits used for subnetting = n = 2
(as subnet mask = 192 and its corresponding "No. of bits used for Subnetting" is 2 from above table)







, Tb = m+n.


Number of bits left for host = m = Tb - n = 8 - 2 = 6

, Number of host per subnet = 2m - 2.


Number of subnets = 2n = 22 = 4
Value of last bit used for subnet masking = Δ = 2m = 26 = 64







,

The 4 subnets (as calculated in previous step) are






Each of them has 64 addresses.



Here the taken IP address is 170.1.0.0 . 170.1.0.0 comes in 170.1.0.0 - 170.1.0.63 subnet (see the previous step table). So 170.1.0.0 is network address and 170.1.0.63 is broadcast address for the taken IP address i.e. 170.1.0.0 .

 You can still find the perimeter of a compound rectangle as long as you have at least one full length or full width and at least three of the minor width or length measurements.For an “L”-shaped compound rectangle, use the formula P = L + W + l1 + l2 + w1 + w2

In this formula, P stands for “perimeter.” The uppercase L and W stand for the full lengths and widths of the entire compound shape. The lowercase ls and ws stand for the smaller lengths and widths in the compound shape.
Example: L = 14 centimeter (5.5 in), l1 = 5 centimeter (2.0 in), w1 = 4 centimeter (1.6 in), w2 = 6 centimeter (2.4 in); missing: W, l2

, In this example, the full length, L, will be equal to the sum of l1 and l2. Likewise, the full width, W, will be equal to the sum of w1 and w2. Using this knowledge, add and subtract the measurements you do have to find the two missing measurements.


Example: L = l1 + l2; W = w1 + w2

L = l1 + l2
14 = 5 + l2
14 – 5 = l2
9 = l2
W = w1 + w2
W = 4 + 6
W = 10



, Once you have subtracted to find your missing measurements, you can add all of your sides together to find the perimeter of the compound rectangle. Now, you’ll use the original perimeter formula.


P = L + W + l1 + l2 + w1 + w2 = 14 + 10 + 5 + 9 + 4 + 6 = 48 centimeter (18.9 in)

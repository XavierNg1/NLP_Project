 Your dealer will be able to inform you about the types of alarm systems that come standard on specific trucks. If you want to purchase an after-market alarm system, you should not hesitate because of extraneous issues, such as a fear of violating a manufacturer's warranty. Due to federal law, it is not legal to void a warranty due to the installation of an alarm system unless the manufacturer supplies the truck with an alarm for free.;
, One of the best ways to get information on alarms is directly from the police. They deal with auto theft on a daily basis and can inform you of why certain alarms work for frequently than others.
 There are several different types of alarms that work in their own unique ways. Independent alarms simply sound off a siren or horn when breached, while other more complex alarms interact with police to a great extent, even going so far as to give authorities GPS locations of the stolen vehicle.
 Radar Sensors can create a field around your truck, detecting any movement around the entire vehicle and sound an alarm in the event of any unwarranted activities. Audio Sensor alarms detect specific frequencies of breaking glass and sound a horn or alarm when detected, which saves valuable items inside your truck in the event of a smash and grab.
 Many alarm systems will have reviews on the internet. Make note of which companies have the most positive reviews, and which models of alarms have received the most praise.
 This is a crucial aspect of owning an alarm. Do not install the alarm yourself unless you are a qualified professional with extensive experience working with alarms and the electrical system of your truck. If installed incorrectly, your alarm could malfunction, either sounding off when there is no present danger, or worse, failing to sound when needed.
 Just as automotive insurance companies offer rate reductions for defensive driving courses, many offer reductions for the addition of an aftermarket alarm.

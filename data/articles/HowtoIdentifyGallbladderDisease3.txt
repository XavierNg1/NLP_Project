 If your symptoms match many of the ones above, you should definitely seek medical attention. If you are experiencing symptoms, if your symptoms are worsening, or if you develop new symptoms, see your doctor as soon as possible.


Some gallbladder problems, such as smaller gallstones, will not require invasive medical treatment.These can sometimes resolve on their own. However, a doctorâ€™s visit is needed to determine this.
 The ultrasound technician will check for gallstones, bile flow, and signs of tumors (which are rare).Most polyps found in the gallbladder during the ultrasound are very small and do not need removal. Your doctor may want to monitor smaller polyps through additional ultrasound examinations to ensure they do not grow. Larger polyps generally indicate a greater risk of gallbladder cancer.
Removal of gallbladder polyps is at the discretion of your doctor.
 Many gallbladder problems are resolved with the removal of large gallstones or the gallbladder itself (cholecystectomy).The body can function normally without the gallbladder, so do not be alarmed if your doctor recommends its removal.


Gallstones are almost never treated with medicine. It takes years to dissolve the stone with medicine, and the stones that can be treated effectively are so small that it almost never worth the bother.
Removal of the gallbladder sometimes have side effects, (such as loose stools) but often none at all.

 Once you're done soaking and lathering the doll's hair, rinse it completely. Once again, use lukewarm or cold water. Make sure you get all the product out. Letting shampoo or conditioner dry into hair can cause damage. If you used a product like fabric softener, it may take slightly longer to wash out.
 Once you're done rinsing the hair, pat the doll's hair dry. Use a clean, dry towel and soak up large blots of water using a gentle patting motion.








If the doll's hair does not come completely dry with patting, you might have to set the doll aside and let it air dry.
 After you've done some initial drying, brush the doll's hair out. If your doll has a lot of thick hair, it might be best to try and brush the hair out while it's still wet. Tangles might be easier to remove if they haven't dried into hair.









If you want to leave your doll's hair with a shine, spray on some leave in conditioner.

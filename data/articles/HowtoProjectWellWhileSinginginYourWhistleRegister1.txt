 Always keep your head held high and your shoulders relaxed down and slightly back. Hold your chest out firmly. Set your feet shoulder width apart and lean slightly forward onto the balls of your feet. Keep your stomach muscles tight but ready to expand when you breathe deeply., Resist the temptation to sway, bounce, or walk around. Keep your hands still and don’t fidget. Focus all of your energy on your breathing and your voice. Moving and fidgeting detract from your concentration. Plant your feet and let your arms hang loosely by your sides.
 Work on opening your throat as much as possible to let lots of air pass from your lungs out through your mouth. You can open up your throat by dropping your jaw and larynx. Push your tongue forward and widen the space between the back of your tongue and your throat., Singers often raise their chin for more power, but this actually causes damage over time. When you are about to increase your power, keep your chin level. This technique eliminates the strain on your vocal cords, while also adding power to your voice.As you work on higher notes and enter the whistle register, notice a natural tendency to lift your chin and actively work against that tendency. It takes practice to retrain yourself, but it increases your power.
 It’s tempting to force a lot of air through your throat at once, but this can damage your vocal cords. Work on developing a continuous airflow from the start of the note to the finish. Mastery of breath management is an important prerequisite for singing in the whistle register.Practice breathing deeply and slowly releasing the air. Let the air out as slowly as possible to increase your endurance.
Use this practice technique with a whistle note making it last as long as you can.

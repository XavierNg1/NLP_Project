 Autumn is most notable for the way the trees change color and shed their leaves. Form your color palette off the natural color palette by opting for colors associated with this process. Think reds, oranges, yellows, browns, and deep burgundy-violets.;
, While fashionable autumn colors usually stay within the same general palette, each year comes with its own list of colors that are considered especially stylish. For instance, in 2011, burnt olive, coral, burgundy, teal, and coffee were among the most fashionable choices. Research the season's "in" colors a few months before the start of autumn to get a good idea of what colors to look for.
 Deeper shades, like chocolate brown or burgundy, create a warm, “cozy” feeling ideal for the cooling weather. To maximize this effect, opt for colors generally associated with the warm side of the color spectrum, like reds, over colors found on the cool end, like blues.
 Darker, deeper colors work great for the fall, but they also create a heavier appearance. If you want a lighter, more feminine look, stick with brighter fall palette options like gold or coral.
 You do not need to stick with the traditional red and black “lumberjack” look. Flannel print is available in a wide variety of patterns, colors, and fabrics. This pattern is naturally associated with cooler weather, though, making fall the perfect time to start breaking out your flannel print pieces.
 Pastel shades tend to be associated with warmer seasons, especially spring. You can use a few pastel colors, but try to avoid too many in one outfit.

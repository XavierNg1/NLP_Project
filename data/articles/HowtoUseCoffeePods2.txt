 Depending on the type of pod you have, you may be able to just place it in a coffee mug and pour water over it. To do this, remove the pod from its packaging and drop it into your mug.
 Slowly pour boiling water into the mug. Stop pouring once you’re about half an inch from the top of the mug. Be careful not to burn yourself with the water.
 Allow the pod to soak in the water. If the pod floats to the top of the mug, use a spoon to hold it under the water. Stir the water occasionally. Make sure to pay attention to this process, as your cup of coffee won’t be right if the pod doesn’t steep properly., The amount of time you leave the pod in the water will determine how strong the coffee is. As a result, you should consider how strong you want your coffee before removing the pod.


Leaving the pod in for 2 to 3 minutes will give you a weak cup.
Leaving the pod in for 4 minutes will give you a normal cup of coffee.
Leaving the pod in for 5 to 6 minutes will give you a strong cup of coffee.
Discard the pod when you are done with it.

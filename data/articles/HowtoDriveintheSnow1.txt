 Clear the windshield, side windows, headlights, and rear brake lights of all snow and ice with an ice scraper and brush before you drive. Stop the car and clear the windows and lights as needed while driving during snowfall., Turn the air conditioning on and set it to the fresh air option to keep the inside window clear of condensation.
 This means you have to have your headlights on when driving during daylight hours too. This makes your vehicle more visible to other motorists while the snow is falling.
 Drive using the lower gears in a manual vehicle to increase your traction on the road. Do not use the cruise control option and do not attempt to pass other vehicles.Vehicles need traction in order for the brakes to work properly, which is why slower speeds, gentler turns, and stops are necessary to make traction remain possible.Reduce the vehicle’s speed to at least half the speed posted on as the speed limit. Be extremely cautious of how much traction your tires can achieve against the road as you drive.
 Leave at least 2 to 3 car lengths between your car and the one ahead of you. This is the most effective way to deter common rear end accidents.This will give you enough room to stop and lower the risk of sliding into the car in front of you when driving at a slow speed.
Driving at a speed over 25 mph (40 km/h) may require leaving more space between the vehicles.
 When you stop, don’t jerk the steering wheel. Instead, touch your brakes gently. Don’t lock brakes on ice either because it might result in losing the control and steering of your vehicle.Accelerate more gradually than you’re accustomed to. Don’t rev up to the speed limit like you’re used to when the roads are clear, get up to that speed slowly but surely.
Decelerate more gradually than you’re accustomed to. Anticipate your stops before you actually make them. Slow down to stops slower than usual.

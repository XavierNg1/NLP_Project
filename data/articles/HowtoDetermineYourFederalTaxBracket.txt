 In order to determine your taxable income, start by selecting the correct IRS 1040 form to file with. For example, there are forms 1040EZ and 1040A that rely on meeting certain conditions, like having under $100,000 in taxable income. See the IRS website for more information., Your adjusted gross income will be the amount you will make in the current year, minus any pre-tax adjustments to your income, like IRA or 401 K contributions. Check your pay stubs, last year's W-2 or last year's tax return to get a more accurate estimate for the money you're likely to make. Taxable income from the last year you file can be found on:


Line 43, if you filed Form 1040.
Line 27, if you filed Form 1040A.
Line 6, if you filed Form 1040EZ., If you plan to itemize your deductions, you may want to do a general estimate based on last year's return, if your expenses are similar. If you don't plan to itemize your deductions, determine your standard deduction amount based on official IRS standards.


Standard deduction amounts change from year to year, and you'll always need to double-check against the official IRS numbers.In tax year 2016, the standard deduction for:

Single or married filing separately was $6,300
Married or qualified widow(er)s was $12,600
Head of household was $9,300


You also need to determine your personal deduction threshold each year you file taxes, if necessary. The personal deduction threshold set in 2016 is currently $4050., Once you've subtracted your deductions from your adjusted gross income, the result is your taxable income. You will use this figure to determine your tax bracket.
 The IRS establishes different tax bracket depending on your filing status. Your filing status is where you indicate whether you are filing as a single person, married couple, or head of household. Figure out your filing status, then scroll down until you see the taxable income amount you calculated in the first section, and learn what percentage of that income will be taxed., Use the "Single" filing status if you are unmarried, divorced or legally separated as of the last day of the current tax year.

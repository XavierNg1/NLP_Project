 If your screen is scratched to the point where it impairs the visual presentation--but the actual LCD display is unharmed--then purchasing a new screen cover is practical. If the LCD display has been damaged (parts of the screen are black or rainbow-colored), however, your item is likely beyond repair and you will need to purchase a TV/phone/computer.
 You can usually find the specific model number on the back of a TV or phone, or the bottom of a laptop. You'll need this number to make sure you purchase the correct type of screen.


Make sure you have your manufacturer's name as well (e.g., Sony or Toshiba).
, Higher price doesn't always correlate with higher quality, so look through your results carefully before deciding on a screen replacement.


For a more focused search, go to Amazon or eBay and type the same thing in.
 You may find that you're better off buying a new item anyway--if the combination of their services and the screen's price ends up being as much as a new TV, for example, you should consider just purchasing the new TV.
, Most tech departments (e.g., Best Buy) will replace your screen for you, though they often charge a considerable fee--another reason to purchase a mid-range screen replacement rather than the most expensive one.


Replacing your own screen cover is not recommended.
 Your screen should now be safe from future scratches!

 The first thing you need to do when wrapping your foot is to get into a comfortable position. You can rest the affected foot on the opposite knee if that is comfortable. Make sure you have good access to your foot so you can stretch it and wrap it properly.Wrapping your foot can reduce the pain in your foot by keeping it stretched. It also helps minimize any stress and inflammation. There are night splints available at most medical supply stores, but you can often replicate these for much less money.
 Gently pull your toes up toward your head. You should feel a light stretch, but no serious pain. Place one end of the elastic bandage on the top of your foot. Keeping your foot flexed, wrap the elastic band around your foot. Then bring it around your ankle.The main goal of wrapping your foot is to keep the foot flexed with the toes pointing or pulled toward your head until you feel a stretch in the bottom of your foot. Remember this should only be a gentle stretch.
 After one wrap around your ankle, loop the elastic bandage back to your foot. Fold the bandage and slip the folded bandage between your big toe and first toe. Then pull the bandage back to the ankle. Continue wrapping around your ankle, tucking the end of the elastic bandage under the wrapped bandage when you are finished.Make sure you keep your foot flexed with toes pointed toward your head during the entire process.
You donâ€™t have to wrap tightly. The point of the elastic bandage is not to compress but to keep your foot flexed and the plantar fascia gently stretched.
Be careful when standing up or getting out of bed. Do this slowly.

 Remove the lid from an aluminum coffee can and rinse out the inside. The can will form the body or "shell" of the drum. You can remove the label and decorate the outside of the can if desired.;
, Cut a circle of felt about 2 inches (5 cm) bigger in diameter than the opening of the coffee can. Place the felt over the opening and secure it using rubber bands. This will form the head of the drum.
 An easy way to construct mallets for the coffee can drum is by sharpening the ends of 2 wooden dowels and then sticking them into 2 small rubber balls. Hold the dowels along their shafts and strike the drum head with the rubber balls.

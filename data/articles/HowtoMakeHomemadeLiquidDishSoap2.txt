 Add 1 ½ cups (353 ml) of water and ¼ cup (9 ml) of tightly packed, grated castile bar soap to a medium saucepan, and place on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the mixture to heat until the soap completely dissolves, which should take 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the stove.Stir the mixture as it’s heating to help the soap dissolve more quickly.
 Once the soap has dissolved completely and the mixture is off the heat, mix in ¼ cup (60 ml) of liquid castile soap, 2 ¼ teaspoons (10 g) of super washing soda, and ½ teaspoon (1.5 g) glycerin. Stir well until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.Washing soda is usually found in the laundry aisle of large grocery stores. If you can’t find it locally, you can order it from a variety of online stores.
 Leave the soap mixture in the pan, and let it sit for 24 hours. Stir it periodically during this period to get a feel for the consistency. The soap will thicken up over time so it’s okay if it’s a bit runny. If it seems too thin, though, you can warm the soap up, mix in additional washing soda, and let it set again.If you’re adding extra washing soda, start by mixing in ¾ teaspoon (3 g) and letting the soap sit again. If it’s still not thick enough, mix in the washing soda in ½ teaspoon increments (2 g) until it’s the right consistency.
If your soap has chunks or lumps, smooth it with a blender or an immersion blender.
 When the soap has reached your desired consistency, add 15 to 40 drops of your favorite essential oil. Stir well to ensure that the oil is blended throughout the soap for a fresh fragrance, and pour it into a soap dispenser for use beside the kitchen sink.You can use any essential oil that you like, but citrus oils, such as lemon, lime, and orange, are particularly effective in cutting grease. Juniper and lavender are also good options.

 Prior to cleaning, you should always unplug the coffee maker. This will ensure that you don't accidentally turn on the machine and heat the vinegar or water that is used for cleaning., Make sure that the funnel and pot are securely in place. Then, pour one quart (1 liter) of white vinegar into the top of the brewer. This is the same place that you normally pour water when brewing a pot of coffee., The vinegar will begin to slowly drip through the coffee funnel and into the pot. Once the vinegar has completely stopped dripping, you can empty the decanter into the sink., After running white vinegar through the machine to help clean it, you need to rinse out the vinegar using cold water. In order to do this, pour one quart (1 liter) of cold water into the back of the brewer. Allow the water to drip through the machine and into the pot.Repeat this process.
 Then, unscrew the spray head which is the area that the water drips through from the funnel into the pot. This can easily be unscrewed., Once you have removed the spray head, lift the entire coffee maker. Be sure to use one hand to support the base of the coffee maker and the other to steady the top of the machine. Turn the machine upside down and empty all liquid contents from the machine.


Make sure that the coffee pot is removed from the base and that the machine is unplugged prior to lifting.
Water will likely drip out the top of the machine from both the back and funnel areas.
 Once the water has stopped dripping, place the machine back onto the counter and reattach the spray head.
 Pour another quart (liter) of water through the machine. This will help continue to rinse the machine. Once the water no longer tastes of vinegar, you can stop rinsing out the machine with water.

 Sweep the area to be cleaned and treated free from dirt and debris, and make sure the surface is dry before application.
 Follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding how much to use, and spread it out over the stain. Soften the edge between the stain and the clean part of your driveway, so you don't have a glaring clean spot.
 Follow the manufacturer's direction to determine how long you let the product sit on the stain.
 Some products require rinsing, some just rinse away with rain and time. Use whichever method your product calls for. Stubborn stains may require additional applications of product, or even a different solution entirely.

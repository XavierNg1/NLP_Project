 The general standard for granting a pardon is that you must have demonstrated “exemplary behavior” since leaving custody. This means that, at the very least, you cannot be charged or convicted of any additional crimes since getting out of prison.Although the term exemplary is not explicitly defined, the language used on the official pardon certificate says that each applicant “has lived an honest and upright life, exhibited good moral character, and conducted himself as a law-abiding citizen.”, A pardon will not be considered for the first ten years following your discharge from probation or parole. You are eligible to obtain a Certificate of Rehabilitation within three to five years, but eligibility for a pardon does not begin until after ten years following your release.


For the 104 pardons granted in 2014, the average length of time from discharge until pardon was about 22 years.
 This is not a stated requirement for a pardon, but it is a very good idea. Pardons are very rarely granted, in comparison to the number of applications that are received, so you will want to demonstrate something that shows your exemplary character beyond just avoiding further criminal activity.


Some of the pardon certificates signed by the governor note that the applicants have served as volunteers at the local police or fire station, became active in civic organizations, or earned college degrees.

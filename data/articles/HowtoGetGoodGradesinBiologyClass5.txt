 The most basic foundation of biology is that all organisms are composed of some number of cells that are independent of each other, but function as a multicellular organism. The number of cells varies from single celled organisms to organisms with trillions of cells. Keep in mind that not all cells in an organism have to be identical to one another (e.g. brain cells and heart cells)., Cells function by moving molecules and energy back and forth. There are a number a molecules that are key to life as we know it. You should have an understanding of these biologically significant molecules and what they do. This will make understanding biology much easier.For example, ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the energy storage molecule. It allows cells to store energy and use it later.
 No organism lives forever. Instead, organisms reproduce one generation after another. Their genetic information is passed down through DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) to guide the development of their offspring. Traits that help an organism survive in its environment are favored and get reproduced more frequently, while other traits die off. This forms the basis for concepts such as inheritance and evolution, and is central to the biology field.

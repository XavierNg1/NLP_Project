Add details about what you learned and how you learned it. Adding dimension to your learning outcomes will convince your reader that you did, in fact, learn from the lab.Give specifics about how you learned that molecules will act in a particular environment, for example.
Describe how what you learned in the lab could be applied to a future experiment., Your teacher may have listed certain questions in the assignment that need to be answered.

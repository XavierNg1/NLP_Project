 As with most corporations, if you contact McDonald’s with feedback, questions, or concerns, it is possible (though certainly not guaranteed) that you will be sent coupons or other discount options.


A glowing account of your love for the Golden Arches, or a detailed complaint about a problem with a recent visit, may possibly score you a discount. Please don’t stoop to fabricating a complaint in an effort to get some McRib coupons, though.
You can contact McDonald’s via web form at http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/contact_us.html.
You can also call 800-244-6227 in the U.S.
Another option is to mail your feedback to McDonald’s Corporation, 2111 McDonald’s Dr., Oak Brook, IL 60523 (USA).
 Sometimes, the simplest, most direct option is the best. Try going into your local McDonald’s and asking them if they have any coupons or other special promotions available.


Try requesting to speak to the store manager in order to offer feedback, positive or negative. Again, while no guarantee, you may find yourself being offered coupons or other valuable deals.
Also again, please have the decency not to make up negative feedback in hopes of scoring a half-price Shamrock Shake.

 Place the mayo, white wine vinegar, garlic, ground pepper, spicy brown mustard, salt, sugar and horseradish sauce into the blender.
 Whiz in the blender for about one minute, or until the sauce achieves a smooth consistency. Alternatively, you can mix the sauce by hand using a whisk or wooden spoon, although using this method will produce a chunkier texture.
 The white barbecue sauce is now ready to use - it doesn't require any cooking. Alabamians love this sauce served over French fries, slathered over fried chicken or used as a scrumptious salad dressing.

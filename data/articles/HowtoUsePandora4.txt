 Pandora is very strict with their 6-skips rule. If you've skipped 6 songs in one hour, per station. You cannot skip or thumbs-down a song on the same playlist after you've reached your six-song limit.
 In addition to the 6-skips limit per hour, there is a 24 song skip limit every 24-hours. This limit is for all stations -- so if your skip 6 songs in an hour on 4 different stations you will not be able to skip another song until the next day.
 Make sure you have a reliable internet connection by navigating to another page. If your internet is working, but Pandora is not, try the following ideas:


Restart your web browser
Try a new web browser (ie. switch from Safari to FireFox)
Disable your pop-up protection.
Disable any adblocker software.

Clear your cache and cookies., Transmitting music wirelessly takes up a lot of data, so the biggest problem from mobile users is a slow connection. Connect your phone to wi-fi if possible, and make sure you have a strong cell connection you can't. Other troubleshooting solutions include:


Check the App Store/Google Play for Pandora updates by searching for the app and clicking on it.
Download the latest mobile software updates. Plug your phone into your computer to make sure it is up to date.
Delete the app and then re-install if from your app store.
 Make sure the volume on your phone or computer is turned up, then check the small volume slider above your song. Make sure it is not all the way to the left. Oftentimes, accidentally clicking on this volume slider mutes Pandora.


Click and drag the slider to the right to turn up the volume.

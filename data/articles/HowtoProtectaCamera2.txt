 Dust can get on your camera’s sensor no matter how much you avoid it.


Understand that cleaning an image sensor is a tedious task. You can add more to the dirt or ruin your sensor if cleaning is not done properly. Note that a new image sensor will cost you almost as much as a new camera. Follow these cleaning tips to avoid damaging the sensor.
 Mount and fasten lens as quickly as you can. Dust entry can be minimized with these techniques.
 Never provide a safe haven for dust.
 Keep away from dusty rooms or windy outdoor locations.
 Minimize the time you have to leave your camera without lens.
 Find waterproof gear for your camera, if you want to use it underwater or in some watery locations.  Waterproof casings allow you to take pictures while protecting your camera.
  Make sure the casing you have chosen provides good protection against salt spray. A heavy-duty Plexiglas housing is good if you are a serious underwater enthusiast.

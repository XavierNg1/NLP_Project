 If you aren't, get into one! You may want to play your favorite danceable music at a reasonably high volume.;
, Preferably ones you know well and can rely on. Clubbing is no fun alone.
 Ensure you have transport to and from. If you have a car, make sure it's fueled. If not organize to have a cab pick you up. Pick a designated driver.
 (Small but very important detail.)

, Girls, you want to look sexy but not trashy. Guys, look hip and cool.
 You will be dancing next to many people, so don't let bad body odor scare everyone away!

, It's always fun to dress up fancy, so experiment with your clothes and have fun! If you are a girl, wear shoes that are trendy but not uncomfortable. If you are a guy, avoid sandals. Remember, you'll be on your feet, tearing up that dance floor.
 If you are dancing a lot you may sweat much of it off. Apply a small amount of foundation and concealer if necessary, and put on a light blush and/or highlighter. On your eyes, apply eyeshadow, mascara and eyeliner. A smokey eye is very pretty and brings attention to your eyes, so it would be a good idea to try that out.
 You need to keep the energy level up. Hydrate with water. Fruit juice also works.
 Make sure you have your I.D.
 If you plan to disperse, decide at what time and where you will all regroup.
 Pace yourself and let the ice melt to dilute the alcohol in your drink. You don't want to fall on the dance floor or embarrass yourself from going over your limit. As the night wears on, get up and dance. If you are an awkward dancer, try to move to the rhythm. Don't be too vigorous and always be aware of your surroundings.
 Is it the music? If so, consider going to another club. If it's the company, don't club with them again. If you just don't like the whole atmosphere i.e. the dim lights, the smoke, the alcohol etc, clubbing is not for you, or you could just be in the wrong mood to fully enjoy the experience.

 Talk about your breastfeeding plans with your doctor or midwife before you give birth. They will be able to recommend books and other resources to help you learn proper breastfeeding procedures.Consider taking a class on the subject to prepare yourself.;
, Get a tutorial on breastfeeding from this lactation professional. Often they will sit with you for your first few feeding sessions to offer feedback and advice on proper and comfortable methods. This is an invaluable tool for new mothers.


You can even schedule appointments with a lactation consultant after you have your baby. However, keep in mind that these visits are not usually covered by insurance.
Another option is to look into community support groups for breastfeeding in your area.
 Sit comfortably and support your back with pillows or a cushion. Do not lean forward or bend over your baby; instead, hold the infant close to your body with their body facing yours and their head at the same level as your breast. With one hand, support your baby’s head. With the other hand, support and offer your breast by forming a “C” shape with your hand around, but not covering, the areola (the darker area around the nipple).You can put a pillow under the arm that is supporting the baby.
 Poor latching is a common cause of breastfeeding pain. When in your correct position, gently touch your nipple to your baby’s bottom lip to encourage them to open wide. You can also gently lower their chin to prompt them to open their mouth. Allow them to take your whole nipple and much of the areola in their mouth.When your baby is latched properly you shouldn’t get a pinching feeling on your nipple. Rather you should experience a slight pulling feeling on your breast.

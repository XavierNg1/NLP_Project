 See if it's anything you'd like. Try out music genres like dubstep, dance, pop, rap, and so on.;
, Listen to specific artists. Some artists, like I Fight Dragons or Owl City, are inspired by video games.
 Try listening to video game soundtracks. They can range from soft, melodic tunes to hard rock and roll. Good starting suggestions would be soundtracks from games like Metal Gear Solid, Sonic the Hedgehog, or Kingdom Hearts.
 Even fan music. YouTubers like Smooth McGroove, JT Machinima, The Warp Zone, and The Screen Team make great examples of geeky music.
 Try out themes of animes (or any TV show, really). Listen to parodies, or even write your own!

 The 80s was characterized by big hair.People with straight hair often got perms, which permanently curled their hair. However, hair can be temporarily made big with a comb, hairspray, and some patience if you tease your hair., A crimper is a special type of flat iron that crimps waves into your hair with high heat. Crimping can be somewhat time consuming, but it will give you a definite 80s flair, and it will make even the flattest hair much more voluminous. Curling your hair with a curling iron or curlers then tossing it with your fingers and applying hairspray can also be a good way to make your hair bigger., Though the mullet is most thought of as a men’s hairstyle (exemplified by iconic country singer Billy Ray Cyrus), in the 80s men and women wore their hair in mullets.


If you do not want to cut your hair into a mullet style, you can find a mullet wig at a party store. You may also be able to cut a long wig into a mullet style.
Be sure to tell everyone that your hairstyle is “business in the front” and “a party in the back.”

, Whether your hair is straight or curly, a side ponytail is a classic 80s hairstyle. Bigger is always better, so if you can curl or tease your hair before putting it into a side ponytail, it will look even more authentic.

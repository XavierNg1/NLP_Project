 Viscose rugs are fragile and can be discolored or destroyed very easily. If you own a viscose rug that is important to you personally, consider getting it professionally cleaned rather than doing it yourself. This will ensure that your rug won't be damaged.Professional carpet cleaners will have the chemicals and tools to clean your viscose carpet.
 Use a clean rag or paper towel and blot over the surface of the spill. The faster you're able to blot stains, the less time they will have to seep into the fibers of the carpet. Do not rub or agitate the stain, or you may push the liquid deeper into the carpet., When viscose rugs are exposed to dampness for a long period, they are easily destroyed. Avoid putting viscose rugs in places like the basement, bathroom, or outside, where they could be exposed to a lot of moisture.

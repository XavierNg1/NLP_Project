 You will need two simple ingredients: borax and sugar. Adult ants won't eat the solid poison, but they will take it back to the colony for the larva to eat., Pour the borax and sugar into a container and stir it with a spoon or fork until everything is combined. How much borax and sugar you use will depend on how bad your ant problem is. Be sure that you use the one part borax and three parts sugar ratio.


Make sure that you won't be using the container or utensil again for cooking or eating.
 If the ants are entering your house through the windows and doors, sprinkle the powder across the doorway and on the window ledge. The ants will pick up the powder and carry it back to the hive for the larva to eat. The borax in the powder will kill the larva.
 While you are trying to manage the ant problem, it might be a good idea to block off any other potential entry ways, such as doors and windows. This will prevent the ants from finding other ways into your home while you are trying to kill them.
 If you can see where the ants are coming from, then you can plug the hole up with some epoxy putty or other sealant. This will prevent the ants from coming back in. Do this after you have killed all of the ants, and not before.
 If you have anything left over, put it in a tightly-sealed container and label it. Make sure that you put it in a place where children and pets won't be able to reach. Borax is very toxic, even to humans and animals.

 Decide on the kind of content you intend to emphasize before you sit down to create or use a template--this will save you time later!


The sky is the limit for site potential, but try to make your site a unique reflection of you and your interests. Blogs, photo galleries, news sources, and instructional sites are all great starting points.
 Open an internet browser of your choice and search for free versions of WYSIWYG software; Wix, Weebly, and Jimdo are all excellent choices, but it's important that you pick an editor that suits your purposes. Programs like these often give you the ability to create entire templates from scratch; if you want to design your site's detailing from the ground up, this is how you do it.
 You will likely have to sign in with an email address and choose a password, so be sure to write both down. It's a good idea to choose an email address you actively use so that you don't miss updates.


Check your email for a confirmation note from the site of your choice; most sites such as these require you to confirm your email as active before allowing you access.
 Each WYSIWYG editor will have different criteria for beginners, so read through their terms and instructions if need be. Your main focus should be on creating your template; this will serve as the base for all your content.


If the editor you chose proves to be too advanced for your purposes, consider accessing their tutorials or simply using a different editor. You can always come back later!
Most WYSIWYG sites have a ton of free templates, so feel free to start with one of them and expand from there.
 If you don't want to build your site from the ground up, look for free template galleries; several open-source sites cater to this specific market, with Wix in particular providing premium-grade photography templates for free. , Once you've created your templates and customized the site to your liking, it's time to start adding content. Don't be afraid to make this site your own!

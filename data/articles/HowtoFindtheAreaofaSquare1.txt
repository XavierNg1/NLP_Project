 Let's say you're working with a square with a side length of 3 centimeter (1.2 in). Write it down.;
, Since all squares have equal length sides, you can just multiply the distance by itself. If the length of a side of a square is 3 centimeter (1.2 in), then you just have to square 3 centimeter (1.2 in) to find the area of a square. 3 centimeter (1.2 in) x 3 centimeter (1.2 in) = 9 cm2.
 You're done.


Squaring the side of a square is the same thing as multiplying the square's height times its base.

 It's no fun when you go to someone's house, and all they have is really hard pillows, but they look super-cute... yeah, it takes away the cuteness. Go to a fabric store, or collect some old (but not too old) shirts, blankets, bags, or anything that's soft and stylish.;
, Usually 1 and a half feet is really good(make sure it's even on all four sides). Note that the size you cut, will not be the size of the finished product (it will be smaller).
 Cut slits 6 inches (15.2Â cm) into both fabric pieces (towards the middle) about one inch apart, all the way around.
 Please DO NOT DO THIS ALL THE WAY AROUND YET! Leave one side un-tied.
 Continue tying the fringe until you reach the place where you started. You now have your throw pillow!

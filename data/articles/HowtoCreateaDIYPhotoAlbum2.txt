 Brown paper bags can be bought at either your local grocery store or at a craft store. For the pages, be sure to have at least 3-4 bags to use.
 Place them so that the side facing up alternates: one side opened, the next side closed., Form the folded bags into a book. Use a hole puncher to punch two holes into the folded paper book: one at the top left corner and one at the bottom left corner.


Thread ribbon into each of the holes and bring the ends together in the front of the album. Tie a bow out of the ribbon.
 Tape or glue the 4x6 photos into place. One photo should fit squarely on each page, front and back. A great way to arrange them is chronologically, but you can also get creative and place photos together that are similar in color.
 Use leftover wrapping paper or decorative scrapbook paper to add design to the covers. Place dots of glue on the corners of the paper and place firmly and smoothly against the covers.


Write on the front of the book with a colorful marker to use cursive penmanship as a way to name it.
Place another photo on the front cover to give a hint of what the album will be about and the kinds of photos it holds.

 Before you slice a mango, be aware that it has a large pit the shape of a giant almond in the center. Slice the mango as you would an apple, but take care to avoid the pit. Cut wedges into the mango that are no more than an inch thick.


Once you're done slicing, you should have several slices of mango with the skin still on, and a pit that still has some skin on it. Here's what to do next:

If you just want to eat the mango, pick up the slices by the skin and eat them. You can try to eat some of the looser skin around the pit, but don't eat the skin too close to the pit because it can be stubborn and will get stuck in your teeth worse than corn-on-the-cob.
If you want to peel the mango, you can pick up the slices by the skin and gently scoop them out with a spoon. If the pieces aren't ripe enough for that, use a knife.
 Though cubed mango is a bit more versatile, fresh sliced mango can spice up many ordinary meals, from desserts to main courses. Make the most of your sliced mango by adding it to the following foods:


Thai mango salad
Sweet and spicy chicken
Chicken with lime and cilantro
Beef teriyaki
Mango, corn, and black bean stew
Mango and pineapple pie

, To do this, cut the mango into thin slices and dry the pieces to get dried mango. For a sour tang, mix the pieces in a ziplock bag with li hing mui powder, or a small amount of citric acid.

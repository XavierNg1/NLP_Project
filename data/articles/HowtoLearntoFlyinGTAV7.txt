 By now you should have the hang of the basic controls, including pitch, roll, and yaw. This flight lesson will have you performing a vertical inside loop with the aircraft., Make sure you are level with the horizon at this time. Then, as soon as the loop meter appears above your Gold rating time, pull back on the left analog stick to increase your pitch., It is important that you pull back vertically and your stick doesn’t slip slightly sideways, otherwise you’ll roll into a spiral. Perform the second loop once its meter appears. This is quite similar to the first., You would end up upside down at the horizon if you were to complete the loop.

However, you will need to cancel the loop at the half-way point and perform the roll, and then level off. This may need some practicing if you aren’t used to aircraft controls, but that shouldn’t be the case if you’ve made it this far.
 This is a relatively tough lesson because of the final stunt, but hopefully by now you should have enough experience to nullify aircraft instability, allowing you to focus on the maneuvers more. A gold rating chance is higher if you can execute the loops fast and level off quickly.

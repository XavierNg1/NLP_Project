 Don’t create long, drawn-out sentences. Although some variation in sentence length keeps your writing interesting, sentences that are too long can confuse the reader.


Over long sentences keep the reader on edge, delaying meaning and creating more points than can be comprehended in one go.
Instead, keep sentences shorter. Only have one or two main ideas in each sentence.
For example an overly long sentence could read: "Learning to write better sentences can be a good way to make your writing crisper and snappier, without losing the central meaning of your sentence, and still including all the necessary details that support your thought.";
, Look at the long sentence above. How could it be rewritten into shorter, better sentences?


It has at least 3 main points, so you can divide it that way.
This could be a possible way to break that sentence up well. “Learning to write better sentences can be a good way to make your writing crisper and snappier. Additionally, you can do this without losing the central meaning of your sentence. All necessary details can still be included.”
You’ll need to add in transition words in places, such as “additionally,” to help the shorter sentences connect. Nonetheless, the shorter sentences help your reader grasp your meaning more easily.
 Use a single word in place of 2- and 3-word phrases if possible.


Like varying sentence length, varying word choice makes writing more interesting; however, choosing to use longer phrases makes the writing lengthier.
Look at this example: “It was not the same as eating pie with her.”
If you change the negative to a positive, the sentence becomes shorter: “It was different than eating pie with her.”
While 2 words might not seem like that much, they do add up over a long piece of writing.

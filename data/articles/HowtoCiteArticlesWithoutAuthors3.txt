 Once again, begin with the article title. Next, add the date:


‘Grapes for wine.’ (1987).
Note that APA uses sentence-case capitalization for its journal article titles, meaning you only capitalize the first word.
 Place the journal title in italics after the date, using title-case capitalization (capitalize important words, plus the first and last word). Place the volume next, followed by the issue number in parenthesis:


‘Grapes for wine.’ (1987). Wine for Life, 20(2),
Note the volume is in italics, while the issue isn’t.
 Finally, add the DOI or URL if you retrieved it online:


‘Grapes for wine.’ (1987). Wine for Life, 20(2), 22-44. doi:234324343.”

, All You Need to Know about Trees, 22-23.”

, For in-text citations, use a shortened form of the title in place of the author. At the end of the sentence, add the title in parenthesis with the year and page number:


“Grapes are the best for wine (‘Grapes,’ 1987, p. 23).”

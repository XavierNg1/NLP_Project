 Molly is seen wearing pink, orange, blue, any bright color. If you have a deep skin tone, avoid neon and bright colors at all costs. Normal cardigans and leather jackets will do.


Wear bright colors and floral patterns. Also, make sure you wear dresses, mini skirts, leggings and cardigans.;
, If you have tan skin, use some pretty dark eyeshadow. Use light blue eyeshadow for pale or neutral skin. It is also a good notion to wear lip gloss.
 Set up your makeup, put up pictures of you with your friends, and a shrine for that special someone in the nightstand drawer. Make your bathroom and room very girly.


Maybe even get a chandelier or some gems and crystals.
Get anything girly.

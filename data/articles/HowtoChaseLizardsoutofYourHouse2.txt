 Lizards go where they can find food - which, for them, means insects. If you have a big insect population in your house, lizards will start to gather there. Keeping your house clean is the best way to keep insects out. Make sure you sweep and vacuum regularly, and don't let dirty dishes and dusty clutter pile up too much.
 Along the same lines, having food crumbs and leftovers around the house can attract insects and lead to lizards coming inside. Clean up all leftover food and make sure your surfaces don't have crumbs sitting around.
 Take note of where in the house you have seen the lizard: which rooms, which corners, under what furniture. Moving the furniture and cleaning that area might help it seem less attractive to lizards.
 Cats like to eat lizards just like they love mice. Having a predator around will surely keep your lizard population manageable.
 Lizards might be getting in through cracks underneath your doors and alongside your windows. Make sure your house is completely sealed to keep them from coming in.


Patch holes in your home with hardware cloth to keep lizards out.
Use caulk and door seals to make it more difficult for critters to come in.
Have screens on your windows and make sure they close tightly.

 Several factors could cause your refrigerator to temporarily run continuously. If you live in a humid environment, just loaded the refrigerator, or recently adjusted its temperature, it might take a while for the refrigerator to cool completely. It could take 24 hours or possibly more for it to cool.
 If there is a build of debris on your condenser coils, they won't be able to efficiently dissipate heat, and the refrigerator will have to constantly cool. If the defroster is faulty, then the evaporator coils will frost over, and the refrigerator will work harder to keep cool.
 The door of your refrigerator has a seal that prevents cool air from leaking out. If the seal is faulty, your refrigerator will have to constantly cool itself. Use a piece of paper to check for breaks in the seal. Close the door on the piece of paper and pull it out. There should be resistance when pulling the paper out, and if there isn't, a faulty door seal may be your problem. Repeat the test along the whole seal.
 This part helps dissipate heat, and if it's too dirty, the refrigerator will have to work harder to stay cool. This cleaning should be done with the appliance turned off. You should clean rear-mounted coils once a year, and floor coils twice a year., This will require using a multimeter on several of the refrigerator's components. These components include: the condenser fan, the overload protector, and the compressor relay and motor. A fault in any one of these components can cause the refrigerator to cycle improperly.
 Use a multimeter to test the outlet voltage of the outlet that the refrigerator is plugged into. Do this only with the proper tools and safety measures. The voltage should test between 108 and 121 volts.

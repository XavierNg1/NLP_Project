 Drive to edge of the city or to any bodies of water like rivers or lakes that run through the game map, and look for a boat you want to steal.
 Boats operated by non-playable civilians will move around the water in a certain pattern, usually in circles. Take a moment to watch how the boat sails around to get to know its course of direction.
 Jump on the water and swim towards the area on the water where you think the boat will pass.


Keep in mind though that only main characters from GTA San Andreas and later versions of the game can swim (GTA 4, GTA 4: Episodes of Liberty City, and GTA 5), limiting this method to these versions of GTA. If you’re playing GTA versions prior to San Andreas, your character will drown once you jump into the water.
 Once the boat passes by right beside you, press the Y (Xbox), Triangle (PlayStation), or F (PC) button, and your character will jump onto the boat and board it, throwing whoever’s driving it out on to the water.
 Once you have control of the vehicle, press the Right Trigger (Xbox), L2 (PlayStation), or W (PC) button to accelerate and sail away from the dock.
 Cops will chase after you if you stole a boat while an officer is around. To lose the police, look at the mini map on the lower left corner of the screen to check the range of the police, marked by a large flashing circle, that’s chasing you. Just sail straight out of their range, and they should give up on chasing you, making the boat yours.

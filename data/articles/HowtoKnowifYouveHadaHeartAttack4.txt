 A heart attack is life-threatening and also can respond well to immediate and early treatment protocols. If you or a friend are in the ER with a potential heart attack you will receive immediate attention.
 An electrocardiogram is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. This will show the doctor how much muscle may be injured or if you are in the middle of having a heart attack. An injured muscle will not conduct electricity the way that an uninjured muscle will. The electrical activity from the heart is transmitted through electrodes placed on your chest and printed on paper for evaluation., When the heart muscle is injured during a heart attack there are specific chemicals released into the bloodstream. Troponin is one chemical that remains in the blood for up to two weeks - giving your doctor a reasonable method of diagnosing whether you recently had a heart attack which might have gone un-diagnosed., Your doctor may perform a cardiac catheterization to find out more information about the condition of your heart. During the procedure, a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and into your heart.It is often inserted through an artery in the groin area,and is a relatively risk-free procedure.During a cardiac catheterization, your doctor may:X-ray your heart using a contrast dye. This can help your doctor see if there are any narrow or blocked arteries.
Check the pressure in the chambers of your heart.
Take blood samples, which can be used to measure the oxygen content in your heart chambers.
Perform a biopsy.
Check your heart's ability to pump efficiently.
 In the weeks following a heart attack you may undergo a stress test to evaluate how the blood vessels in your heart respond to exercise. Youâ€™ll be on a treadmill and hooked up to an electrocardiogram machine which measures the electrical activity in the heart. This will help your doctor determine long-term treatment for your condition.

 To do so, navigate to https://www.facebook.com/ in your computer's browser.


If you aren't logged into Facebook, enter your email address (or phone number) and password before proceeding.
 It's near the top-right corner of the Facebook page, just right of the ? icon.
 This option is near the bottom of the drop-down menu.
 It's near the top of the list of options on the General page.


If you don't see this option, make sure you're viewing the General page by clicking General in the upper-left corner of the page.
 You'll do so in the text field to the right of the "Username" text.
 It's a blue button at the bottom of the Username section.


If this button is grey instead of blue, your typed-in username is already taken.
 As long as your password is correct, doing so will save your username and apply it to your Facebook URL.

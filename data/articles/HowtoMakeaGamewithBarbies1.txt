,, What time period will your Barbies be in? Medieval times? The present? The distant future? Where will your Barbies be? A city? A small town? A remote forest?

, Are they going to be famous? A superhero? Will they be dirt poor or filthy rich? Or will they just be average citizens?

, Will all of the Barbies live together? Will they live alone? Perhaps they each are married and/or live with kid(s).
 Will they just be living out daily life? Is it the first day of a new school for one of your Barbies? Maybe there's a great quest to go on, or a new villain to defeat.


While you do this, make a rough plan. Don't plan every detail, or it will become boring to play.
 If you have any furniture, whether it be homemade, for other dolls, or actual Barbie furniture, use it to set up the locations so that you know where each place is.


If you don't have any furniture, just imagine it. You could also use common objects from around the house.

 For a small cage cut off 3 to 5 50cm branches.;
,, The 10cm twig you cut off on step 2 will help you measure how much of the branch you have to cut off. Get someone to hold the twig to the branch while you cut up the pieces. Cut about 16-20 twigs for a small cage.
 The hole should be 2cm away from the ends of the twig.
 Take a look at the bridge and if you feel like it isn't big enough for your cage, cut up some more 10cm twigs.
 Do this to all twigs so they're all joined.
 Make sure you leave enough string so you can be able to tie it to the cage.
, The bird will need at least a day to get use to the bridge and then it will surely explore and play on it.

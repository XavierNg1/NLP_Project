 Place a small saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Try to use a stainless steel pan if you can, as opposed to an aluminum or unlined copper pan, which both can react badly with milk., Scoop in the 3 tablespoons (44.3 ml) of Nutella and add in ⅓ cup (78.8 ml) of milk. You can use any kind of milk you like, though whole milk will give you the creamiest flavor. You can also use a non-dairy milk like almond or soy milk if you prefer the taste or are allergic to dairy milk., Stir the milk and Nutella together using a spoon or whisk until the two ingredients are fully blended, about 5 minutes. The heat of the stove will help the Nutella to melt and blend with the milk., Once the Nutella and milk blend together, pour in the last cup of milk and turn the heat up to medium-high.If you want a less milky version, reduce the amount of milk you add to ¾ cup (177.4 ml).
Only turn the milk up to medium-high. Putting the milk on a higher heat will cause it to scald and form an annoying protein skin.
 After you pour in the extra milk, use your whisk or spoon to stir your ingredients continuously. It should only take a minute or so for the ingredients to mix. If you want your hot chocolate to be extra-frothy, whisk vigorously to produce bubbles.
 Once the hot chocolate has heated and mixed, pour or ladle the drink carefully into a mug. Garnish the hot chocolate if you wish with marshmallows and serve it while it’s still hot!

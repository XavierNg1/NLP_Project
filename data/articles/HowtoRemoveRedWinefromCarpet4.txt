 Add a generous squirt of soap to the peroxide and stir to combine. The exact amount you need will depend on the size of your stain, but you shouldn't need much more than a half cup (118 milliliters) or so for any stain.










Note: Hydrogen peroxide is a mild bleaching agent, so this method is best for light-colored fabrics.If you're worried about discoloring your fabric, try putting a small amount of the solution on part of the carpet that can't be seen. If the carpet lightens or you notice dye transfer when you sop up the peroxide with a paper towel, avoid this method.Lower concentrations of peroxide (like 3%) shouldn't affect most carpets., Soak the corner of a clean rag in your peroxide solution. Dab the stain gently, allowing the mixture to seep into the carpet fibers. Repeat as needed until you've applied the solution to the entire stain. As always, don't rub â€” blot.









When you're done, let the mixture sit for a few minutes. This allows it to penetrate the deeper fibers and reach deep stains.
 Fill a clean spray bottle with cold water, then add a few drops of standard dish soap. Screw on the cap and shake to combine. Give the entire stain a light spritzing. Blot with a dry towel when you are done.









If you don't have a spray bottle, you can repeat the blotting technique above with a fresh towel.
 By now, the stain should be looking better. However, if you stop, you'll be left with a soapy, sticky residue from the cleaning solution. Soak a clean rag in room-temperature water (no soap), then blot the carpet to loosen up the cleaning materials. Finish by blotting with a dry towel.

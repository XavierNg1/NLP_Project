 If you don’t want to replace your head unit, you can simply add a Bluetooth receiver to it. You can buy one from your local computer and electronics store or from the Internet starting at $25.
 Receivers are very easy to connect; all you need is a 3.5 mm audio cable with two male ends (just like the ones at the end of your ordinary ear/headphones), which should already come with the receiver package. Just plug one end of the cable to the Bluetooth receiver and connect the other to your car radio’s 3.5 mm audio jack port and you’re good to go.


Note that your car head unit should have the feature to play audio contents using the 3.5 mm audio input port, otherwise you won’t be able to use the receiver.
 Press the Power button on the receiver to switch it on and your mobile device should be able to detect and connect to it. You can start playing music from your MP3 players or even accept phone calls.

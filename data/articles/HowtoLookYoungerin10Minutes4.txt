 Dressing yourself in the morning is often a hasty part of everyone’s daily routine—however, minor alterations to the way you dress yourself can have a significant effect on how old you look.Try wearing outfits with a slimmer, more fitted look.


Avoid clothing that looks too baggy or neutral—try wearing clothes with more color, especially a color that highlights your flatters your complexion or matches your eyes.
When changing your outfit, try different things. See which clothes make you feel best; you’ll feel better and look more confident if you dress in a way that feels natural to you.
 When someone stands with a slumped posture or keeps their eyes downcast, they often appear older than they are. A confident, erect posture will help you look and feel younger. Better posture will also have a long-term benefit: standing up straight and not slumping in your shoulders and pelvis will keep your joints strong and help prevent arthritis.Practice good posture:


stand with your feet shoulder-width apart,
inclined your weight backwards (towards your heels),
square your shoulders to keep your chest open; avoid hunching forward.
 If you don’t already wear a cologne or perfume, it can be a great way to draw positive attention to yourself and be perceived as more attractive and youthful. Experiment with a variety of scents—in general, floral or rose-scented perfumes and colognes are reminiscent of old age.Avoid these, and instead try a more fruity (or earth-toned), vibrant scent.
 Confidence connotes vitality and other youthful characteristics—try to act confidently and move with assertion. In addition to making your body appear younger through better posture and quicker movements, smiling more will help you look more appealing, engaging, and younger.

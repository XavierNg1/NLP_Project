 Aerobic exercise works your heart and lungs, and could be as simple as walking, pushing your wheelchair or light swimming. Strength training usually includes the use of small weights or resistance bands to improve your muscle strength and bone density.
 People with spinal problems, nerve problems or an inability to use limbs will find the added buoyancy of the water to be helpful. Try to find a class that can help you to lead the exercises or exercise with a helper and a water belt.
 Common sports leagues include basketball, tennis, track and field, football, boccia, soccer and swimming. This form of exercise allows you to help your cardio fitness and also to fit in as part of your team.
 Health and fitness are only achieved when you are leading an active life, so make this part of your long-term goals. If you commute by walking or wheelchair use or you clean your own home, these are exercise as well, so give yourself credit for increasing the activity in your life.
 People who have disabilities do not want to suffer from muscle tension from overwork. Start with 10 minutes per day and work up to 30 minutes or more.

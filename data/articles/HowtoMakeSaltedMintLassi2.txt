 Place in a dry heavy skillet. Heat over medium heat. Toss or shake often to prevent burning. After 1 to 2 minutes, remove from the heat.
 Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the toasted cumin seeds.
 When it turns a pale green color, it's ready to serve.
 Add ice to the glass first. Garnish with the remaining toasted cumin seeds.

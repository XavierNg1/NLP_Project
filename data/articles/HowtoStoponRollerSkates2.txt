 Although you most likely skate with your feet about shoulder width, to make this stopping technique most effective you must widen your stance. As you do this, it is helpful to bend the knees a little, as well. Don’t spread your legs so wide that it feels like a strain, just make them wider than they normally would be during skating., Slowly angle your feet so that your toes are pointing toward the center. The natural tendency of your feet may be to close the gap between them when you point your toes, but you want to make sure you keep a wide stance for now. You want to make sure not to point them too sharply inward or you may end up falling. Angle them just enough that you can tell they are pointed in.Pointing your toes inward makes the wheels roll at a slight angle which creates more friction than if they were pointing straight forward. This is where the stopping power comes from.
 Pointing your toes inward will already start to slow you down, but coming to a full stop, especially if you need to stop quickly, requires you to bring the feet closer together. Going from a wide stance to a very tight stance may make you feel a little wobbly, so go slow and keep the knees slightly bent rather than straight and rigid.
 Once your feet are close and still pointing inward, adjust so that the front wheels are just barely touching. Allowing the wheels to rub together adds just enough friction to slow you down all the way to a stop. Again, you don’t want to let them slam together and rub so hard that you stop immediately as this will likely result in you losing balance and falling forward.

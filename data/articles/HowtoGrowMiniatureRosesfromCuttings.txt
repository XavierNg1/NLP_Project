 Not all forms of miniature roses will take as cuttings, and unfortunately there is no foolproof list of which can be grown in this manner and which cannot. It depends on the soil, the climate, and the rose in question. So be prepared for some successes and some disappointments -- but do keep trying.;
, Do this just after the flower has faded, and be sure that the stem has a minimum of three to four leaves.
 Do this by cutting just above the leaf closest to the dead flower.
 Remove any excess dead leaves from the stem, ensure that at least three leaves remain on the stem. Dip the cutting in some honey; this helps protect the cutting from rotting, dying, or going moldy.
 Gently pat into place and keep well-watered as it strikes. But make sure that the compost is not wet, as over-watering can kill the cutting; keep the cutting in moist compost.

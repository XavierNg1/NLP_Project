 Where you buy your rod will greatly determine the quality and value you get for your rod. While it is tempting to shop for the best deal, make sure you are visiting a specialty sporting goods store where they will have a wide selection of fishing rods. A smaller store will allow you to have a greater rapport with a salesperson or specialist if you have questions.


Be careful of buying your rod online. Unless you have tried it out in the store first, it will be difficult to find the best fishing rod for you by shopping online. You will be unable to feel the rod in your hand or examine the quality if you have only viewed it online.
Don't be afraid of asking for help. If you visit a quality sporting goods store, the salespeople will likely have experience with the products. They can help you find the perfect fit if you explain your needs and desired specifications.
 If you are a beginner and planning of fishing less frequently, consider buying a less expensive rod. If you are more seasoned, consider investing in something that will last longer.


Spinning rods are also ideal for beginners, as they are easier to use than casting rods.
 If you are traveling to fish, it may be wise to buy a fishing rod that breaks down into several pieces. If you have a boat or will be fishing nearby, you may only need to purchase a rod that remains in one piece. , In fishing, you are either using live bait, referred to as casting, or lures. A casting fisherman may want a more sensitive rod in order to be able to feel each small movement in the water. A lure fisherman may prefer a stiffer rod to be able to manipulate the rod and imitate the movement of the prey. Decide which technique you would like to use when choosing a rod.

 The factors that could play into your decision might be anything from how fast or well the ball is bowled, to the length and rules of the match being played. Shorter matches usually make for more attacking shots as batsman have less opportunity to score runs. Longer test matches that can go for up to five days tend result in more defensive plays.;
, Front foot shots are most often used to play a ball that is delivered between ankle and thigh height. Back foot shots are better for balls that are between the thigh and head. Once you identify the height which the ball will likely arrive, you can shift your weight to the front or back leg to play the corresponding shots.
 Watching the progress of the ball is important, as it will help you to determine when and where to hit it.
 There are several ways to be called out in cricket. When batting keep these rules in mind in determining how aggressive to be with your shots.


Prevent the ball from hitting the wicket.
Avoid being hit in the legs by the ball in front of the wicket. This may result in the batsman being out by leg before wicket.
Avoid giving catches to any fielders on the field.
Avoid edging the ball to the wicket-keeper.
 It takes a great deal of skill and practice to be a great batsman. Be patient and wait for the right shot to play.

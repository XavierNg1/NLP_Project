 Yin Yoga is a gentle style of yoga that focuses on stretching the connective tissue around the joints (specifically the knees, pelvis, sacrum, and spine). Yin Yoga is considered “passive,” meaning that poses are typically seated or supine (on your back), and they are held for 3-5 minutes., Yin Yoga involves holding poses for 3-5 minutes, which is likely to cause some discomfort. If you experience discomfort, try not to immediately exit the pose. Instead, try to sit with it for at least one minute. You can lengthen your time with each pose as you continue to practice., Sit on a yoga mat (or blanket) and allow your knees to fall to each side. Bring the soles of your feet together. Gently bend forward, allowing your back to round. Rest your forehead either on the arches of your feet or on the palms of your hands (with your elbows on your feet). In this posture, focus on deepening your breath.
 Now swing your legs around to one side and come to lay flat on your stomach. Place your forearms on the ground in front of you and arch your back, lifting your chest off of the ground. Engage your upper back, pulling your shoulder blades together, while letting your lower body relax., Release sphinx pose and push yourself up to all fours. Then push yourself all the way back to a seated position. Straddle your legs wide, and begin to gently lean your upper body forward. You can rest on your elbows, stacked yoga blocks, or a bolster pillow.
 Finish the practice by laying flat on your back in savasana (or corpse pose). Allow yourself to breathe freely, and come into a deep relaxation. Stay here for as long as time will allow.

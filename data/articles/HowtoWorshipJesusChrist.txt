, It is important to find the perfect church that you belong to. Not one size fits all. You might not even have a church around that you can feel comfortable in. Should this be the case, be patient and keep looking. Hebrews 10:25 reads "Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the spirit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching." So be patient--with all the churches in the world. If you are patient, it's a guarantee that you will find the one right for you.
 Many religions have books that they refer to. The Bible is the main sacred text of Christianity. Studying the Bible and other such books can expand your knowledge of God, and in doing so you have more knowledge about how to do good works for Him and worship Him.
 Christianity is one of the most popular religions in the world. As stated above, we can worship Christ and God in spreading the Good News about Him.


Be careful in how you share the gospel. People might think that you are imposing your beliefs on them--and even scarier, in some cases you just might be. As Saint Francis of Assisi said, "Preach the Gospel at all times, and when necessary, use words." The best way to spread the Word is by acting as a Christian. Be kind to others when they are mean to you etc. You'll be less likely to run into difficult situations this way.
 His teachings are Christ's Gifts to all His disciples.
, Baptism is a public announcement that you are putting away the 'old man' and putting on 'the new'. It is a public profession of faith. Some churches have people baptized when they are infants, others have public baptism when you are older, and still others have private baptism for older people.
 They are Christ's Gifts to us.

 This pizza is served cold and makes an excellent appetizer or finger food. It makes use of store-bought crescent rolls for the crust. It takes 20 minutes to prepare and 10 minutes to cook. The yield is 48 bite-sized squares.
 Use 2 non-stick baking sheets. Open the 2 packages of crescent rolls. Stretch the dough and flatten it out so that it forms one rectangular shape. Be sure to pinch the seams together. Bake for about 10 minutes.


It’s ready when the crust has become golden brown.
Set the just-baked crust aside and let it cool for about 30 minutes while you prepare the rest of the dish.
 Remove the cream cheese from the refrigerator and allow it to sit out for several minutes. This will soften it and make it easier to work with. Once softened, place the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl and add the Ranch-style dressing mix.


Stir vigorously until they are fully mixed together.
Spoon the mixture over the cooled crusts in a thin layer.
 Finely chop the vegetables so that they are relatively small. Arrange them over the cream cheese sauce and sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese on top. Place in the refrigerator for approximately 1 hour.


When you’re ready to serve them, take them out of the refrigerator and cut them into 48 bite-size squares.
Serve immediately as appetizers or finger food.

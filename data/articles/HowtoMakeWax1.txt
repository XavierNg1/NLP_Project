 Tallow wax is usually made from beef suet, the fat located next to the cow's kidneys and liver. Suet is mostly clean of gristle and other animal bits.









You can buy an animal fat other than beef suet, but the process might be messier, and it could smell.
The process of making wax from suet is time-consuming, so you may want to make a lot at once. Five pounds of fat makes a good amount of wax; buy more if you need more wax, or cut it down if you don't want that much.;
, The suet will be melted down, and that process is much faster when you start with fat that is ground, rather than melted whole or in large chunks.

Ask the butcher to grind the fat for you if you are unable to buy it ground.
You can grind the fat at home in a grinder or a food processor. Grind it as fine as possible, since smaller bits of fat melt the fastest.

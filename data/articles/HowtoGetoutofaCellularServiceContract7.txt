 Sometimes it just pays to fork over the ETF, and be done with the aggravation. If you’ve made up your mind that this is the route you want to take, find out the exact amount you owe by contacting the carrier directly.
 Notify the carrier of your decision. You may have to do this by phone, so a terribly distraught customer service representative can try to convince you to ease his or her pain by staying with the company. Maybe they’ll offer you an incentive to stay, like a phone upgrade even if you’re not due for one. If an incentive doesn’t do it for you, find out how the ETF will be paid, cancel, and bid the carrier farewell.
 You’re probably planning on moving to a new carrier, and taking advantage of one of their phone offers (especially since trying to convert your current phone to a new carrier’s system can be a hassle, at best). If that’s the case, think about selling your phone as a way of offsetting some of the ETF you had to pay. Companies like Gazelle.com and Glyde.com handle these types of transactions.

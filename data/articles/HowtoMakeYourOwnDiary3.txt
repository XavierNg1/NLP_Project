 Start any diary entry by writing out the date. This can help you keep track of how often you write in it, and it can be fun to look back at a diary later to see what you wrote during a certain time period.


Include the day of the week, the month, the day, and the year. You can even write down the exact time during the day, or the location you’re in while you’re writing if you want to include more detail.
You can also give the heading of each entry a title, or a doodle unique to the day or nature of your entry.
 Decide on how you’d like to write each entry in your diary. You can make the format more formal or casual, depending on your preference.


You can choose to start every diary entry with the classic “Dear Diary…” as if you are addressing it to another person in the form of the diary. Or, you can set your own prompts to talk about each day, like “Today I saw…,” “Today I felt…,” or “Today I was grateful for…”
Add a visual element to the content of your entries if you like. Tape or glue photos, concert tickets, or anything else that can lie flat on the page and relate to the day or events that you write about.
You also are not required to have any special format to stick to for your diary entries. Let whatever you’re feeling or whatever comes to mind inspire the way you write in your diary each day.
 Commit to filling up your diary with regular entries to make it a consistent practice. This can be a good thing to do if you want to focus on using a diary as a tool to vent, de-stress, analyze, or practice gratitude.


Set reminders for yourself wherever you will see or check them the most, be it a physical calendar, a virtual calendar or reminders on your phone or computer, or a simple post-it note around the house.
Set a goal of writing an entry every day, even if it’s only a sentence or two. Set aside a time, like first thing in the morning or right before bed, that’s easiest for you to sit down and write.

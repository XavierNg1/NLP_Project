 In order to do this, take the time to make a list of the tasks that are performed regularly when using email as a communication tool. Some common tasks may include the ability to attach images and documents with ease, embed images in the body of the email, easy creation and arrangement of folders and the ability for the client to send and receive emails from multiple addresses. You may also need a client that will deliver mail from a POP3 or IMAP service while still retaining copies that can be directly accessed via the Internet.;
, The first item on the list will be the most frequently used feature, while the last item will be the feature that is used once in a while. Creating a priority list makes it possible to begin evaluating various clients and quickly eliminate any provider that does not currently include those features that are the most important to you.
 While a given email system may look very good at first glance, getting some idea of the level of support you can expect in the event of a user issue is very important. Ideally, any client you consider will provide multiple ways of contacting a service and support team, such as by telephone, instant message or online chat.
 1 approach is to prepare a spreadsheet that makes it easy to quickly indicate which of the options offer all the features necessary to manage the tasks on your list. Chances are you will find that at least a couple of the clients provide all the features, while others may not currently support 1 or 2 of the tasks you have in mind.
 Since the exact processes involved in using those features may vary, this is your chance to determine which email client is the most user-friendly overall. The goal is to identify the top candidate that has all the bells and whistles you desire while making it easy to use those bells and whistles

 Pick through berries, cherries, and other fruits that you bring inside. Any damaged fruit should be discarded outdoors, since you could bring fruit fly eggs in from the grocery store or farmer's market. Wash your fresh fruit carefully with water and dry it completely before storing.
 Any small container with a teaspoon of cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons of water, and a drop of two of dish soap will attract and drown fruit flies. This will help keep the population down. Rinse out the bowl and fill it with fresh mixture every day during fruit fly season.
 Fruit flies enjoy outdoor food sources as well. Covering entrances to your home with screens will help prevent them from coming into your kitchen. This is especially important if you have fruit trees in your yard.
 If you have fruit trees, pick fruit when it's ready rather than leaving it to rot on the branch or beneath the tree. Pick up or rake away a glut of fruit that has fallen to the ground beneath the tree, to discourage fruit fly infestation.


You can also slip an exclusion bag over the branches of the tree that are fruiting. The bag should allow light to continue to reach the fruit and air to circulate without allowing the fruit flies access to the fruit. Such bags can usually be obtained from places that supply organic growers.
Purchase organic fruit fly sprays from a garden center or organic growing supplier. Such sprays will need to be reapplied regularly, due to their organic nature but this is the best non-toxic approach to growing healthy fruit.
 Fruit flies are deterred by the smell of certain essential oils that are pleasing to humans. The oils won't kill the flies, but they will keep flies from accumulating. Fill a spray bottle with a cup of water and five to ten drops of lemongrass, eucalyptus or peppermint essential oil. Spritz areas of the kitchen that tend to attract fruit flies, like near the sink and trash can.

 Take the sauerkraut out of the jar. Transfer it to a strainer, and rinse it under cool water. Allow any excess liquid to drain away, then set the sauerkraut aside.

This soup will be a little more tart than the typical kielbasa and cabbage soup.
You can make this soup using kielbasa instead of spareribs. Cut the kielbasa into slices.
 Hold off on the sauerkraut and sugar for right now. If you can't find any prepared beef broth, you can make your own by dissolving 2 large bouillon cubes in 4 cups (950 milliliters) of hot water.

For best flavor, use wild forest mushrooms.
If you are using kielbasa, add it in now.
 Bring the soup to a boil over medium to medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low. Simmer the soup, uncovered, for 1 hour and 30 minutes., If you used whole, dried mushrooms, take them out of the pot, cut them into strips, then add them back in. If they are already sliced, you don't need to do this., Pour the sugar into a separate saucepan. Heat it over medium heat until it starts to caramelize. This will help sweeten the soup and take away some of the tartness.If you don't want to do this, you can skip this step., Give the soup a stir, then let it return to a simmer. Cover the pot with a lid, and let the soup cook for 30 minutes., Take the ribs out of the pot with a pair of tongs. Pull the meat off of the bones using two forks. Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces and return them to the soup. Discard the bones.If you are using kielbasa instead, skip this step.
 Once your have the meat back in the soup, it is ready to serve! Ladle it out into bowls and serve it hot.

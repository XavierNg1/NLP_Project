 Few people can prepare elegant remarks when they've scribbled a speech onto a dinner napkin. Bring an index card or a piece of paper containing an outline of what you'd like to say. Alternatively, you can prepare an outline on your tablet or smartphone.
 While most present at the dinner may know you, not everyone will. Also, explain your relationship to the bride and groom in your introduction.
 Let the audience know that you are pleased to have been asked to make a speech.
 For example, do not provide inappropriate details from the bachelor party while the bride is present. Make sure that your remarks are appropriate for all wedding guests to hear.
 Provide a funny story about how the bride and groom met or a quote from the bride and groom's favorite song.
 A memorable quote about the beauty of marriage is always a good choice for an ending to your speech. You can use a variety of resources both online and in the bookstore to find an appropriate quote.

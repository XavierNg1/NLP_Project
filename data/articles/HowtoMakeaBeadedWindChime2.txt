 Discard the outer part with the metal ring, and keep the smooth, inner part. You can use a plastic embroidery hoop or a wooden one. If you use a wooden embroidery hoop, you can paint it any color you wish.
 You can leave wooden embroidery hoops plain for a rustic effect, or you can paint them with acrylic paint. Painting plastic hoops is not recommended because the paint is more likely to chip off.


If you will be using this wind chime outside, spray the hoop with a clear, acrylic sealer once the paint has dried.
 You can have as many or as few chimes as you want. They can all be the same length, or they can be different lengths. The best type of string to use for this would be nylon beading thread or fishing line.
 You can use small bells, metal findings, keys, or anything that will make a sound when clinked together. Some people like to use vintage spoons!

, Be sure to slip the first couple of beads through both the string and the tail end. This will keep everything looking neat, and prevent the tail end of the knot from sticking out. Leave a few inches/centimeters at the end of each string empty.
 Wrap the string around the hoop a few times tightly, so that the last bead bumps up against the bottom edge. Tie the tail end to the string in a tight, double knot, then feed it back down through the beads.
 You will be using this to hang your wind chime, so choose something sturdy. Fishing line or twine would work well, but ordinary thread or yarn won't.
 Wrap the string around the hoop a few times, then tie it to itself. While the beaded strings are hanging down, these strings should be hanging up. Try to space these as evenly as you can.
 Gather the loose ends of your strings together, and check that the tension is even. Tie them together into a single knot, then slip them over a hook. Use the hook to hang your wind chime.

, In other words, choose the general topic potential signers would associate with your petition. For example, if you want to bring to justice someone who abused a dog, select "Helping Animals". If you want a fast food company to treat its workers better, select "Corporate", etc.
 The title is the first thing potential signers will see when the petition is shared on Facebook or via email, so it needs to be compelling. A compelling title will give insight into what you are trying to accomplish, ideally conveys a sense of urgency, and it must be a call to action. For example, "Fire Meadowlark School Principal for Hitting Student Yesterday" or "Stop the Danville town Fox Hunt".
 This should be the name of the person(s) in authority to make the change happen. It could also be a corporation or governing body. For example, if you want to get the school principal fired, you should enter the the name of their boss, the School Superintendent.
 A few sentences is normally enough. Make a compelling argument (without being too wordy) as to why someone should sign your petition. Provide a basic fact or two to back up your assertion that your desired change is reasonable.
 This is not required, but is highly recommended. Why? Because Care2 employs a team of experienced campaigners that can help edit your petition, get you press coverage (if you want it), and promote it to the Care2 community. It's easiest for them to contact you via phone.
 This will create your petition, and make it live (on the following page you can edit it more, hide it, etc.). You're done!

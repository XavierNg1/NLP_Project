 You can cut the cheese board you intend to wood burn. In order to do so, you’ll need an untreated hardwood plank, a jigsaw, and a powerful sander, among other items. You’ll start by drawing the shape of your cheese board onto the plank, avoiding any knots in the wood.After carefully cutting the board out with a jigsaw, sand all edges until smooth, ideally with an 80 grit material at first, and again with 220 extra fine grit.
 You may wish to purchase a plain cheese board and wood burn it with whatever design you wish. One factor to be aware of is the size and weight of your board. Think about things like counter space and most common uses of the board to help make your decision.Cheese boards can be found online and in kitchen supplies stores.
 Another factor you may wish to consider, especially since you’ll be adding a design of your own with a wood burner, it the pattern made by wood itself. Natural board will also have natural grain that is often visible in the board’s surface.Some manufactured cheese boards will show the wood’s end grain. These are also ideal if you intend to do lots of cutting on your board. Whatever the manufacturing method, make sure the design of the wood itself will work without whatever design you attempt to add yourself.

, The source of power can be a normal socket/power adapter, a powered FireWire port (for 3G and earlier iPods), or your computer's high-powered USB 2.0 port.You can try to fix the iPod without power first, if wished, but if the fix doesn't work, it's an indicator that your iPod also needs a recharge.
 Then, turn it off again.
 Do this until the screen resets itself. Then release the buttons.
 Your iPod is now rebooting and in a short while will return to the main menu screen. Your iPod is now reset!

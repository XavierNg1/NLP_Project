If you have not yet had your billboard built, choose a heavily-traveled location.
Billboards that are viewable from highways are most likely to be noticed by drivers.
Billboards closer to the ground are more likely to be noticed than billboards that are higher up, as drivers are focused on objects that are at windshield height.
Billboards that are on the right side of the driver's view are more likely to be seen than those on the left side of the driver's view. This is because drivers tend to pay attention to merging traffic, which often comes from the right side.
Locating your billboard in an attractive location will attract the most buyers, which will increase the price you can charge.;

Put a notice on your billboard that its' advertising space is for sale.
Include your contact information on the notice.



Focus on organizations that are located near the billboard.
Include organizations who already advertise on other billboards if your billboard would provide a better solution. For example, if your billboard is visible to drivers near a highway exit that leads to a restaurant, the restaurant could benefit from using that space instead of a billboard that is in a less-traveled area.
Offer a better deal to organizations than their current billboard advertiser provides.



If you have multiple billboards, offer a discount to organizations that are interested in advertising in multiple locations.



Perform an Internet search for billboard websites. Some of them match buyers with sellers.



If you have more than 1 offer, choose the offer that has the highest price and the longest lease period. If no such combination is offered, choose the offer that most closely matches this scenario.



Have an attorney that is familiar with advertising law write up a contract.
Make sure the contract specifies the length and price of the lease.
Ensure that you and all other parties sign the contract.

 The pronunciation here is "tah mow KHree iss-tee on-ud." Literally, this means "my heart is in in you," but the actual meaning is similar to "you are very dear to my heart." There are two difficult pronunciations here:


"Chroí" is probably the hardest word to pronounce. You want to use a guttural h/ch sound from your throat that doesn't exist in English. It's basically the same sound used in a few common Hebrew words like "Chanukah."
"Istigh" sounds roughly like "iss-tee" or "ish-tig" depending on the regional accent. Use a hard s (as in "sass") or an sh sound (as in "shoot"), not a soft s/z sound (as in "glaze")., This is pronounced "Moe KHoosh-leh." "Mo" is easy — it rhymes with "blow." "Chuisle" is a little harder. You need to use a guttural h/ch sound (as in "Chanukah") to start the word. The "oosh" part rhymes with "push." The "le" at the end uses the short e sound (as in "red").


Literally, this means "my pulse." It's a common expression taken from the original phrase "A chuisle mo chroí" ("pulse of my heart").
 This is pronounced "Iss too moe raow-uh." "Rogha" is the most difficult word here. The first syllable rhymes with "plow," not "blow." The gh combination makes a w sound (as in "wet"). Note also that "is" is pronounced with a hard s sound as mentioned above.


Literally, "rogha" means "choice" or "favorite." It can also mean "flower," which gives this phrase a flattering double meaning.
 This phrase is pronounced "Iss even lum ____," where the blank is the object or idea that you love. This phrase is used for when you love something, but you're not romantically in love with it. For example, if you really like your grandmother's pasta, you might say "Is aoibhinn liom pasta."


Note that this phrase is identical to "Is aoibhinn liom tú" from the section above except that you're substituting a different word for tú ("you").

 If you purchase gas or other items from a specific chain of gas stations, a gas credit card may help you save some money. Look at your spending habits and determine if you prefer a certain gas station chain. For example, if you have a BP station close to your home that you regularly use, a BP gas card may help you save some money.Like a retail store credit card, a gas credit card is issued by an oil company to encourage people to shop at their gas stations.
Generally, store specific cards can only be used at the corresponding gas station. In addition, if you can use the card elsewhere, those purchases often do not qualify for any of the rewards.
 Once you determine where you want to get a card, you need to decide on what card to get. Some gas stations offer multiple gas credit cards with different rewards programs, terms, and interest rates. Before you apply, research each card and pick the one that will benefit you the most.For example, many gas stations offer business and personal credit cards, each with different rewards systems and perks. If you are a small business owner, a business card may offer you more rewards than an individual card.
 After you have narrowed down what card you are applying for, go online and complete the credit card application process. You will need to fill in some personal information, including things like your address and financial information. Like a retail store credit card, you will likely get an instant notification if you are approved. If not, it can take a few weeks before you receive confirmation.


Once you are approved, you will likely receive your new card in 10 to 14 business days. After you receive it, you will need to go online to activate it or call a phone number on the card.

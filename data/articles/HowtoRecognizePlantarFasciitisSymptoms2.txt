 Being an inflammatory disorder; the plantar fascia ligaments can be inflamed when are exposed to continuous or severe stress, stress can cause minor injury to result in a kind of inflammation that make light pain to be felt under the heel, but repeated stress and continued shocks on the ligaments can actually make them weaker that can be irritated, persistent irritation would increase the risk of straining the ligaments and can easily cause tiny tearing to them, considered as a common heel problem; many people can get plantar fasciitis, if you are one of the people who have to stand for prolonged times on your feet, you may have higher risks than others.
 The disease is more common in middle aged populations in the range between 40 to 60 years but somehow younger people can also experience it like with athletes, who are at higher risks of making sudden wrong moves.


Foot twist or wrong landing that can hurt their plantar fascia ligaments in a way or another, in addition; runners can have this disorder in great chances especially if they run on rigid surfaces like asphalt.
These rigid surfaces create greater resistance power that come up to the runner’s feet, and can easily absorbed by their ligaments, muscles or tendons to be hurt badly if safety precautions weren’t followed correctly.
 Another condition that can help in developing plantar fasciitis could be like foot over pronation; a condition describes when the person’s foot roll inward in an unnatural way that can lead to lose of the normal arch of the foot.


Overpronated persons will depend more on their big toe and the second to push their foot off the ground in a trail to stabilize their body, that would make big stress on and irritation of their muscles and ligaments, including the Achilles tendon and as in this case; the plantar fascia.
 Obesity can also be a reason in developing plantar fasciitis disorder, over weighted persons are at risk to have it when their extra body weight is always loaded on the feet, that can cause continuous pressure and stress on the plantar fascia ligaments with every foot and heel joint move.
 The incorrect choice of your shoes can play a role in putting you at risks of developing the disease or not, shoes that don’t give the required support and protection to your feet, heel and ligaments can easily stress and irritate the plantar ligaments leading to plantar fasciitis.

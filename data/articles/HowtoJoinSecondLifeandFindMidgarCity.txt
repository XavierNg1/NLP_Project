,, These connection-clients are also referred to as "viewers." The official viewer is Viewer 2.0. Alternatively, there are a number of third-party viewers that one can use to connect with, some of which provide more functionality than the official client.
 You will start off at a Help or Orientation Island -- which is essentially a tutorial for newbies to help learn how to navigate and make use of the features Second Life (SL) offers. This isn't a requirement, however. Note, however, that while on this Island, you won't be able to search for other areas on the main grid (for whatever reason).
 There will be another button on the Map display that reads "Go Home." Click it, and you should be taken to the main grid.
 Open your Map display back up again and type in "Midgar" into your search bar and click "Search." Our sim should pop up on your map.
 Welcome to Midgar. Please read the rules and the necessary information to get started in our community. Enjoy!

 Pipeline and Sunset Beach are located on the North Shore, Lanikai and Kailua Beach are located on the east side, Sandy's Beach is located on the south side, Makaha Beach on the west side, and Ala Moana and Waikiki Beach are located on the southwest side.

Along with parking lots, pavilions and other accessible needs may be available. Magic Island is a huge beach park attached to Ala Moana Beach and has a gorgeous view of Diamond Head., Don't put the idea of "trying" to find a spot in your head. Walking and enjoying the scenery and environment is one of the most delightful ways of appreciating a beach in Hawaii. Even a popular beach, such as Kailua, has "pockets" to tuck away in., Similar to birds migrating South during the winter, many people travel to Hawaii to get away from the cold. Winter in Hawaii is also surf season, as this is when the biggest waves of the year appear. On the weekends and state holidays, many locals spend their time off from work at the beach., If you're a person that just wants to enjoy the view and to "get away from it all", there are some beautiful spots around the island where you won't find surfers. Kualoa Regional Park, located in the northeast section of the island, always has calm waves rolling in.

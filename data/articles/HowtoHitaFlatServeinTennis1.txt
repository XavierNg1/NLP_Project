 Create a V with your thumb and forefinger. Place your hand on the racquet so that this V is at 11 o’clock, or one o’clock for left-handed players.To simplify it, think about holding your racquet as you would a hammer. This is called the continental grip , which is the grip you want to utilize for a flat serve. Practice maintaining this grip while keeping your hand loose and relaxed.


In the continental grip, the racquet is at a neutral angle to the ground. In other words, it is perpendicular to the ground when you hold your arm in front of you.The continental grip is valuable for its versatility. You can use it for other types of serves and volleys as well.;
, In a match, you will be standing at the baseline, the line farthest from the net.Right handed players should keep their right foot back, parallel to the baseline. The left foot should be forward, near the baseline and pointing to the right net post. Left handers will be standing in this stance, simply reversed. Once you have your feet in the correct stance, bounce a few times. Get loose and comfortable in this position.


The stance for the flat serve is just like the stance for all other serves— you can’t make it obvious what serve you are preparing for, or your opponent would know exactly what was coming their way!

, By picturing a strong, successful serve, you can help to decrease anxiety. By decreasing your anxiety, you also decrease the likelihood of making little, nervous mistakes. Take deep, calming breaths. Don’t just visualize the image of the serve— imagine the force of the serve and the sound of the ball hitting the racquet. Walk yourself through your serve in your head multiple times. This visualization is a helpful tool in building your confidence and preparing yourself for a great serve.

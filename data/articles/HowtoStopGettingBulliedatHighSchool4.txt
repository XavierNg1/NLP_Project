 Remember that everyone in school has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, free from bullying, harassment, discrimination, and violence, so as to facilitate and harness the learning process. , Encourage them to visit areas in school that are not regularly monitored by staff. Get everyone that is being targeted and go tell the principal. Enlisting the help from other students is a good way of changing the culture of the school to relinquish bullying behavior.
 If your school doesnâ€™t have one, start one. Get involved and reach out to school leaders. Start by working together with parents and school staff to implementing policies and procedures against harassment and discrimination.

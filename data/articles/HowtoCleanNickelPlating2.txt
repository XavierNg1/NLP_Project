 When your nickel plating isnâ€™t dirty enough to warrant harsher cleaning methods, apply a non-abrasive metal polish. Chrome polish works well on nickel plating. Apply a small amount of the polish to the plating, then wipe the surface in circular motions as you did while cleaning.Alternatively, you can try this step after using other cleaning methods in order to make your nickel plating shine.
 Find a non-abrasive metal cleaner at the store. Chrome cleaner works well on nickel plating. Apply the cleaner directly to the stained areas, particularly the green discolorations that build up on nickel with ease. Let it sit for a minute.WD40, which penetrates oil, can also be used.
Oven cleaners are another option and are useful for removing grease.
You may wish to test this method on a small spot not readily visible. If the plating is especially thin, the steel wool or scrubber will cause damage.
 After applying the bottled cleaner, try using a cloth first spread it over the plating. You can also use steel wool or a soft scouring pad on stubborn stains and discolorations. Use small, circular motions to work in the cleaner. Be as gentle as possible to avoid causing scratches to the metal.

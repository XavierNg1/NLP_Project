 Nintendog Money runs a lot faster considering all that water, food, shampoo, and toys you have to buy. In the first place, never head to the main shopping center on the 'Go Out - Shopping' menu. Instead of spending money, spend time. Take a walk to the discount shop. For the money you spent at the main store, you can buy a lot more merchandise and maybe even a toy! If you're lazy, just stop by the discount shop when you're around.;
, When you head to the public parks for disc competitions practices, there's a special way to work. Have five sessions. First, throw the disc ten times. Place in box and do other things (praise, other toys, rest, etc.). Second time, throw it five times, and break. Third time, three times then break. Fourth and fifth, make it really good because you can only throw it once per time. This causes your dog to want to take less rests when you're having a cram disc session. Also, hit up the dog parks!

, Before beginning, to help your dog understand the arrow, guide your dog with a run one-lap around the field. Then, you can start. Pay attention to each obstacle until you receive an excellent. As soon as you've gotten an excellent three times per obstacle, run the entire course once. Run three laps around the field then go.
 When you enough money, upgrade your house, and live with two dogs around. It gets less lonely and it'll be more walks, more toys, more prizes for you! It might costs a little more, but it all works out in the end.
 Take your dog for walks at the times you do everyday. Feed your dog at the times you usually do. If more than one dog lives around, switch attention between them. Find toys you can all play with (e.g. jump rope, keyboard, etc.).
 Let your dog wear a different accessory everyday.

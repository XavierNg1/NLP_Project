 These include areas in the affected states which receive very little rainfall, particularly Arizona and California.
 Infections occur when people inhale spores that become airborne after disturbing contaminated soil. If you’re in a high-risk area, stay away from work zones that involve construction, excavation, and agriculture.This also includes domestic labor. If you’re living in an endemic region, you should consult a doctor before doing significant yardwork, gardening, construction projects, or other sorts of digging in your yard or on your property.
If you cannot avoid working in contaminated soil, go to the doctor immediately to get their prevention recommendations. It’s likely that they’ll encourage you to wear a special mask and/or take a preventative antifungal medication to reduce your risk of infection.
 If you live in an affected area, consider keeping your windows closed and using an air filter to ensure that the dust and dirt outside your door doesn’t invade your living space., Winds will kick up dust that contains the pesky fungal spores, so be sure that you find shelter that has closed windows.
 Wear this or a miner’s mask in areas that have recently suffered a natural disaster. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes and dust storms, can also disturb contaminated soil. This can cause the spores to become airborne. Use a respirator to avoid breathing in these spores.Normal paper masks or bandanas will not offer protection against Coccidioides since the spores are microscopic. In order to be effective, you need a respirator that will completely seal around your face and prevent particles 2-4 micrometers in size from passing through., Use soap and water to clean any wounds that may have been exposed to dirt or dust. This can help stop an infection from developing.

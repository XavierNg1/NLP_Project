Butterfly (BF). A simple but yet effective move. The steps are, Jump > dash > slash > block.



 


Slashshot (SS). First shooting move. Steps are, Jump > dash > slash (hold) > switch to weapon > shoot > switch back to sword.






Wall Cancel. A quick way to scale walls. Steps: run at wall, Jump on wall from distance> flip off wall> Slash > dash back on wall> Jump off wall once you hit it > repeat from slash flip onwards.

Double butterfly (DBF). This is just 2 slashes per jump instead of 1. Steps are, Jump > slash > block > dash > slash > block. (First slash as you jump, Second slash at the top coming down.)
Triple butterfly (TBF). Hardest one of the butterfly moves, not needed to be good, but can be useful. Steps are, Jump > x3 (First slash as you jump, Second slash at the top, Third slash before you touch the ground.)






Reload shot (RS. Faster than slashshot by a few milliseconds but that can often mean the difference between life and death. Steps: Jump>Slash (hold)> switch to a gun > Shoot >reload >Switch back to sword *note: reload and switch should be within the same second.*






Insta. Flip > Block > Jump > Bf (Note: Any k styler reading this who has more please click edit and add on to this) Fun and annoying. (Edit: By slashing the enemy in the air it renders him in a frozen animation till he touches the ground, thus being a good move for maps like stairway when you can insta flip, slash or bf him in the air while can not wall cancel hes way back up).






Juggle. Flip > Block > Jump > Bf/dbf/tbf > repeat (Note: You should slash your opponent while he/she is going up. This cancels his/her going up and puts him to the ground before they get a chance to react and safefall. Don't expect a level 50 to fall for insta though, because some people have reactions fast enough to safefall.)






Meteor. Flip > Block >Jump > Dbf> Flip > Block, dbf/tbf. (Have fun learning this one).

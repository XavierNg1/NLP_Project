 You don't need any extensions installed to be able to find the XPath information of website elements when you're using Chrome.
 This will appear on the right side of the window.
 You'll find this in the top-left corner of the website inspector panel. The button looks like a box with a mouse cursor pointing at it.
 You'll see the elements of the site highlight as you move your cursor over them.
 When you click an element with the inspector, the relevant code will highlight automatically in the inspector panel on the right side of the window. Right-click the highlighted code.
 This will copy the element's XPath information to your clipboard.


Note that this just copies the minimal XPath information. Firebug for Firefox can give you the full XPath information.
 You can paste your copied XPath information like you would any copied information by right-clicking in a text field and selecting "Paste."

 For recent and especially light scars, you should begin with creams proven to reduce the appearance of scars. Flat scars less than two years old are the best candidates for these creams.Pick a product containing healing ingredients such as quercetin, petrolatum, and vitamin C.Equally as important is minimizing a scar’s exposure to sunlight. Scar tissue does not react to sunlight the same way as normal tissue, so exposing a fresh scar to sunlight can permanently darken a scar, making it more apparent., There are various makeups available on the market that can temporarily hide a scar. Choose a proper color to match your skin tone and test the makeup or cream on your skin to see if you need to blend any colors for the desired effect.









Matching your skin tone can be a challenge for someone who isn’t familiar with the process. Try asking a consultant at a department or specialty store’s beauty counter for tips.
Learning how to apply concealer can also take some practice. Follow the steps outlined at Apply Concealer to learn how.
 For deeper scars or instances when you need longer-lasting concealment than regular makeup may provide, you can look into specialty scar-camouflaging kits that contain a mixture of adhesive creams and powders.









These kits form a paste that you can use to cover up a scar and can last much longer than regular makeup. You can often find these kits sold at any beauty supply shop, drugstore, or salon.
 Some thin, skin-tone specific concealing tapes are on the market as well. These products are best used by cutting the adhesive to match the general shape of your scar so that it blends in with the rest of your skin.

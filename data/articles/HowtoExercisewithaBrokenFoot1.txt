 An arm bike is a cardiovascular exercise machine that looks like a stationary bike, but the pedals are for your hands instead of for your feet. Arm bikes come in a variety of styles, from ones that you can place on a tabletop or desk, to arm bikes that include a seat and a variety of resistance levels.To use an arm bike, sit down, put your hands in the pedals, and move your arms back and forth to turn the pedals.;
, While you cannot do roundhouse kicks or other kickboxing moves with a broken leg, you can still punch. Punching the air, or shadowboxing, is a great cardiovascular workout.


To shadowbox, sit in a sturdy chair and clench your fists. Then, start punching the air in front of you. Continue to throw punches for around 30 minutes or for as long as you can. You can even divide your shadowboxing workouts into three 10 minute segments throughout the day.
Include various types of punches in your workout. For example, you can throw punches straight ahead of you called jabs, bend your arm in the shape of an "L" and throw a hook punch, or come up from below and deliver an uppercut., If you have a broken foot, then you may have been instructed to use crutches. You can walk on your crutches using a three-point method, which is when you place the crutches about six to 12 inches (30.5Â cm) in front of you and then use your good foot to step into that position.Use your hands to support the weight of your body. Do not support your body weight with your armpits.
Do not put any more than light pressure on your broken foot.
Try walking around in your home for a few minutes per hour. You might also consider going around the block a couple of times per day when you start feeling stronger.

 Diarrhea can be a major sign of trouble for a cat’s digestive tract. If your cat has diarrhea, it might be time to check out feline probiotics. This can be an easy way to solve a huge digestive problem for your cat.Recurrent diarrhea can be massively uncomfortable for you cat, so giving it probiotics is a great first step in fixing the issue.
Remember that probiotics can alter the bacterial makeup in your cat’s digestive tract, which can cause an upset tummy and more diarrhea. However, this should only last for a few days while your cat adjust to the probiotics.If giving probiotics to your cat doesn’t seem to work and the diarrhea persists after several weeks of probiotic treatment, consider ending the treatment. Consult your veterinarian for further advice at this point.
 Probiotics boost the immune system’s ability to respond to invading disease cells. If your cat seems to be getting sick often, or feeling lethargic and under the weather regularly, you might want to consider giving the kitty some regular probiotics to help.Bowel/intestine health is strongly connected to the health of the rest of the body. Ensuring that your cat has enough good bacteria in its body will help your kitty fight off infections in other areas as well.
 Probiotics help prevent future digestive issues in cats, which is why they are recommended for daily use by all cats, regardless of age or health condition. You can consider giving your cat (especially an adult cat) daily probiotics as a way to help prevent anything going wrong with your kitty’s digestive system in the future.Kittens typically don’t need probiotics unless they have a preexisting digestive issue. But this can be a good preventative measure for most adult and senior cats.

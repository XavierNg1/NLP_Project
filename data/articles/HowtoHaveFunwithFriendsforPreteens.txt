 This is the most basic activity, but sharing stuff with your friends can be quite fun.


Talk about anything you feel like talking about.;
, Get any device that can play music, plug it into a speaker and jam.


If you have one, a color changing light would work as a fake disco ball.
Turn of all the lights for more fun.
Don't put the music up too loud or people will complain.
Only do this step when no one is sleeping or can hear you.
 Find a game you both like and play it.


Make sure to take turns.
If your friend suggests a game, get it and see how you like it.
 Here's how you play:


Get any device that can text.
One person is the riddle maker (hider).
One person is the guesser (seeker).
The riddle maker hides.
Then the riddle maker texts the guesser that he is ready.
While the guesser is looking for the riddle maker, the riddle maker texts riddles to the guesser so they can find them.
If the riddle maker is found, then it is the other person's turn to be the riddle maker.
If you have a group of people do the same thing, but have the hiders send group texts.
If you have a group and you are found, then the person who finds you first is the riddle maker.
 Playing tag is fun and it will also give you exercise.


Play any type of tag: regular, freeze, etc.



If you have pedicure stuff, take turns giving each other pedicures.
 This does sound little kiddish, but it can actually be fun.


Find your favorite comic, book, T.V show, etc. and pretend to be the characters in them.
You could also be spies and spy on someone, be vets and take care of animals, etc.
 It does not matter what kind (E.g. how to, funny, etc.)


If you want, show it to other friends.
Post it on YouTube.



If you have a trampoline, bounce on it.
If you have an old play set, just swing on the swings gently.
Take a run or walk.
Draw with chalk.
Play hopscotch.
Jump with jump ropes.
Roll around in the grass.
Get muddy.
 That's what's most important.

 The trick simply moves your phone’s times a few hours ahead so you can get the free lives, then back (this is important), before you actually start playing.
 It’s easier to go one day or one month forward, as it’s simpler to change days or months as opposed to moving the hour counter. In this example we’ve gone one day forward.
 You’ll see you have full lives. Don’t start playing just yet. Go back to Settings > General > Date & Time and fix the time. It’s easiest to set time to “Set automatically” as it will use your carrier to determine the correct time and automatically adjust.

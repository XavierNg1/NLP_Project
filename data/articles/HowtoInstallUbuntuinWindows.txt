 You'll be installing wubi for Ubuntu 9.10 (Code named Karmic Koala).;
, Run wubi and configure your Ubuntu Installation .ie you can specify the location where you want to install Ubuntu, allocate space for Ubuntu and also choose a Ubuntu flavour ( such as Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu Netbook Remix, Kubuntu Remix, Xubuntu etc). Also provide the language you want to use on your Ubuntu desktop, and a username and password for the Ubuntu system . After doing so click install .
 These installation are usually around 700 MB and they will be automatically downloaded and verified. It might take longer, if your bandwidth is low.
 When the download is finished Wubi will ask you to reboot. You could also manually reboot later if you were in the middle of something .
 Ubuntu will install everything according to the settings you made earlier and the installation may last for about 10-15 minutes. You don't have to do anything here but just wait. When everything is done, it will reboot again.

 Learning a foreign language is hard, so you really need to be engaged in the lesson and see how previous concepts are clicking into place.;
, This really helps some people. Try to take notes on meanings of words, word origins, verb conjugations, or whatever you need to hang the concept from!. Treasure your Spanish notebook; you'll be using it more than you think.
 Be very careful that you study well, because you may think you know it when you have your notebook in front of you, but on test day you may go blank. Write words a number of times until you know them by heart.
 Sit at a table and take out your class notes. Practice together. Say the words out loud. You can even design quizzes to check how you've mastered things.
 Do activities out of the workbook or textbook. This will increase your knowledge on the subject and add creativity to your answers, something all teachers appreciate.
 This will show people how smart you are and allow you to improve with practice.
 you may think that your teacher won't notice it, but they will. If you happen to get an answer right, congratulate yourself. If you get it wrong, there's a good chance that you need to study some more. Write down the answer ten times, or until you memorize it.
 Chances are, kids will blow off the summer. One hour a day of studying will prevent you from forgetting the important stuff.

 If your dog is small enough, consider keeping it in a carrier with its pups. This will help keep it calm and prevent it from getting combative with any other pets. If your dog is too big for a carrier, keep it on a leash. Keep the puppies in a box, bin, or carrier for their protection and cover it with a blanket to keep them calm.A carrier may also make it easier to transport your dog and pups to the veterinarian.
Because the mother dog will be protective of her puppies, she may need to be removed during the check-up while the vet is handling the pups. If you can, have another adult attend the visit with you who can sit with your dog.
 During the visit, you should bring treats in order to reward your dog for good behavior. This will help you manage the mother’s behavior while she is in a particularly stressful situation. The veterinarian will also likely give the dog some treats during the checkup.


You may also want to bring along one of your dog’s favorite toys to play with.
 When you take the dogs to the veterinarian, try to limit the number of distractions your mother and pups encounter. If you have children, leave them at home. They may excite your mother dog or the cause the pups to become agitated. It may also be best to schedule a time to go to the veterinarian when it will not be too busy. A weekday morning or afternoon might be the ideal time to take the new mother and her pups to the vet.It is important to keep the pups calm. Once they begin to cry, the mother will become anxious and agitated.
Because it may be nearly impossible to avoid distractions, it may be easier to ask your veterinarian to make a house call.

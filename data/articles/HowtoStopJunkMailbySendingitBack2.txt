 If you’ve tried sending your junk mail back via a “Return to Sender” message, and it still keeps turning up in your mailbox, you may need to take a more direct approach to get it to stop. That means you’ll need to open the junk mail, so you can sort through the items in each envelope.If you get a lot of junk mail, opening up the envelopes can be an annoying process. You may want to collect it on a weekly basis and open it all in one sitting instead of doing it each day.
 When it comes to junk mail such as credit card offers and charity donation requests, the companies usually include a return envelope with pre-paid postage, so you can return the credit application, charity donation, or other requested item. After you’ve opened the mail, set aside all of the return envelopes, so you can correspond with the company without paying for postage., Even if you’ve sent previous correspondence back “Return to Sender,” your name still might not come off the company’s mailing list. Making a written request that you stop receiving the mail may be necessary to put an end to the correspondence.Be polite but firm in the note. Don’t resort to foul or abusive language.
If you’re not sure what to write, try something simple like “Please remove me from your mailing list. I do not wish to receive any future offers/solicitations, etc.”
Make sure to include your name and mailing address on the note because your contact information will not be on the pre-paid return envelope.
 Because you’re using the pre-paid envelope, there’s no need to add any postage to the note. You can drop it in any mailbox or leave it for your mail carrier to pick up when he makes the next delivery.

 Heat over medium heat. Do not boil; this is just enough to warm the liquid constituents.
 Add the melted chocolate, cocoa powder, eggs and salt. Blend for 1/2 a minute to a minute, to combine well.


If the eggs cook, sieve out any cooked bits. Try not to have any of the warmed ingredients too hot.
 Add the bread slices and soak for a minute or two.


The thicker the slices, the longer the soaking needs to be.
 Add the soaked bread slices. Cook for 2 minutes on one side, then flip over and cook the other side. Continue until all slices are cooked.


Slices can be kept warm on a plate in the oven.
 Put the bread onto the serving plates, drizzle over with additional melted chocolate and dust with either icing/confectioners sugar or some more cocoa powder.


Whipped cream is also a nice extra.
 Add some ripe berries that are in season for a delicious extra.

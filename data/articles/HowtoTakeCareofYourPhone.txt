 A case that is too bulky isn't always safer, so try to find a military grade one, as they are usually extremely protective and not really bulky. Some other good brands are Case Mate and Spigen Inc.;
, The best one is the Invisible Shield. This protector can be bought at Radio Shack. Many phones do come with a screen protector, but those tend to only protect from scratches and not shattering, so buying is a better option.
 (Optional) It will give your phone a padded place to sit while not in use, and stand if you are watching something.
 Just don't put it at the edge of the item. If it is charging, refrain from putting it on surfaces that could potentially catch fire or get too hot. Put it in a wide open space so it stays cool.
 But if you're about to sit, take it out and put it on your lap. A front pocket would be better though, as if you are walking, someone could steal it easier from behind than in front where you can see them, and this way you don't have to worry about moving when going to sit down. You can also carry it in a purse or a backpack.

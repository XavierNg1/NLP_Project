 Go to Iron Island. You can do so by passing the bridge (after you beat your rival) and going down until you see a dock of boats and a Sailor there. Talk to the Sailor and he will take you there by boat.;
, Try to pick up items because they are helpful. After exploring a bit, you should meet Riley, he will talk to you about exploring together. When he asks you, select Yes, you will then travel with him.
 Defeat them and Riley should thank you by giving you an egg.


The egg will hatch into a Riolu. Evolve the Riolu into Lucario and you have one!

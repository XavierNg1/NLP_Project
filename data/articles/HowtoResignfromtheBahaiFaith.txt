 Decide what it is about the religion, which has made you decide to leave.;
, If you do still believe in God, then learn about as many religions as possible, and decide which one fits your spiritual needs and views.
 When you announce your decision to withdraw from the religion, the Local Spiritual Assembly will probably want to talk with you about your decision. This is a community which no doubt cares about you, so meaningful communications regarding your decision would be important to both parties. Be frank and honest in consulting with them so that together, both you and the Assembly may understand each others' thoughts, feelings, and actions, and so that any options which you may have overlooked, or misunderstandings that may have existed on either side may be effectively reviewed.



The NSA will take you off the rolls and mailing list. You can be off the mailing list without withdrawing from the Faith, if you like. NSA may list you as "address unknown", which means you are not part of a local community and no one contacts you.

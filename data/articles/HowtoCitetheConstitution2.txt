 Just like in APA style, you need to create a sentence where you need a citation. You can cite the U.S. Constitution as a reference for making a legal argument, for example, when creating an opinion paper.


For instance, you can use the same example from above: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.
Another example is the following sentence: The U.S. Constitution notes that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

, Unlike APA, the in-text citation always comes at the end of the sentence, before the period and after the quotation mark. However, like APA, you can leave off "US Const." in the citation if you use it in the sentence.Start with an open parenthesis, then add "US Const." Follow that with the amendment, section, article, and/or clause and a close parenthesis. Use Roman numerals for amendments and Arabic numerals for sections.
The example would look like this sentence: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion (US Const. amend. I).
The second example would look this way: The U.S. Constitution notes that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" (amend. I).
 Like APA, the MLA end reference is fairly similar to the in-text citation. However, unlike APA, you'll spell out more of the reference at the end than you do in the in-text citation. Also, you'll usually use more capitalization and italicize "U.S. Constitution."The end-text citation will look like this example: U.S. Constitution. Amend. I

, If the amendment has been appealed or you want to place emphasis on the year it was enacted, you can add a date. Simply add it after the amendment or section with a short description before it, such as "repealed 1933."

 Making your shorts permanently dirty will give your cut-offs an edgy, devil-may-care appeal to them. To give the shorts a yellowed or faded look, you can stain them with mud or coffee grounds. Try one of these four methods:


Mud water method: To get the mud water, put some loose clumps of dirt in a bucket, fill the bucket with water, slosh it around, and pour the water off into another bucket big enough to hold your shorts folded up. Donâ€™t just mix dirt and water together; the dirt will settle out. Keep checking on the shorts until they are stained enough. Remember, the shorts will be a lighter color when they are dry.
Coffee ground method: This method will last longer. In a bucket, use about two cups of coffee grounds and enough water to turn them into a liquid. The more water you add, the lighter the stain will be. Place the jeans in a bucket and let them sit overnight.
Running over method: A "quick and dirty" way is to place the cutoffs on muddy ground and drive over them a few times with a car.
Motor oil method: While working on your car or bicycle, or in your garden, wipe your hands on the shorts. Stains from dirty motor oil or from the bicycle chain are practically impossible to wash out.
 If you're trying to go for a natural, authentic look, it doesn't hurt to have it dry in the open air.

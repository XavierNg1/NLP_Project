This isn't something you can just pickup and 'wing'. Bleaching hair has many risks and dangers associated with it. You'll want to minimise these so make sure you get professional quality products made especially for this task. Quality shows with bleach. Many can tell a box blonde from a professional blonde, it's all aesthetic..


If your hair is darker *darker than a medium brown - black* you will need to use 30 vol. or 40 vol. peroxide, 40 isn't recommended especially on the scalp, but if you're going for an ombre or a balayage look 40 is good for getting a nice degree of lift in a short period of time.
If your hair is lighter than light brown use 20 vol.or 30 vol.
You will get away with 10 volume if you're naturally light blonde.;

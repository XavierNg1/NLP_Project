 Opt for a yellow concealer to apply over your eyelids. Yellow concealer can help make your eyes pop and make the eyeshadow more apparent. Add a thin layer of concealer to your eyelids before applying yellow eyeshadow., In general, smearing yellow eye shadow across your eyelids is not necessarily the best way to use yellow. This can look sloppy and a bit too dramatic. Instead of applying yellow to your full lids, apply it strategically in a few key places. It will look bold when use to frame and highlight your eyes.You can add yellow near the rounder portions of your eyelid. Yellow on the side of your eyes, paired with a neutral color, can make for a dramatic look.
Try adding yellow to your lower lid. This can help brighten your eyes and add a little flare to neutral makeup.
Frame your eyes with yellow. Add lines of yellow eye shadow around your eye to add a nice yellow frame.
 As you only want to add touches of yellow around your eyes, pair yellow with neutral colors. Blend the yellow that's highlighting your eyes with neutral shades such as brown or gray. This can keep your look bold without being overly dramatic.For example, if you're adding yellow the corners of your eye, use black eyeliner or eye shadow to frame your eye.
If you're using yellow to outline your eyes, color the main lids with something like brown or black.
 Think about the time of day when applying yellow. Very bright yellow may stand out a lot during the night time. This may be too bold, to the point it looks gaudy. If you're wearing yellow eyeshadow for a nighttime look, opt for darker shades like mustard yellows over bright neon colors or sunny yellows.

 Be nice every time they try to provoke you. It'll soon bore them.
 Just close your eyes and don't move, apart from breathing. Make a snoring sound if wished, but only if you're good at it. Keep "sleeping" until the sibling leaves.
 Eventually he or she will leave you alone. There may be a complaint put in to mom or dad though.

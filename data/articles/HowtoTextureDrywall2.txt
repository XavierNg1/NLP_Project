 You can find hopper guns at most hardware stores, or online. If you plan on doing a lot of drywall texturing, you may find it more cost effective to purchase one of your own. If this is a one time project, consider renting your hopper gun.


Attach the hopper gun to an air compressor and load the hopper with your mixed drywall compound.Read the manufacturer's instructions before operating the hopper gun.Only fill the hopper up about halfway to keep it from getting too heavy., The air pressure needs to be high enough to spray the compound from the gun, but not so high that you can't control the spray.The gun should also have an adjustable aperture, or mouth. Adjust this opening to your liking. A wider opening will create bigger blobs, and a smaller one will create a finer texture., Before you spray your entire room, do a few test sprays on some scrap cardboard or drywall. Make any final adjustments to the pressure and aperture.Write down the settings you used in case you want to make the same effect again., Cover your wall in a continuous, sweeping motion. Don't pause when spraying as this will cause build up on your wall. Spray with a light touch for best results.You can spray in vertical or horizontal lines, or even in a random pattern. How you decide to spray is up to you, just keep in mind you're aiming for a uniform application.If you feel some of the texture is too thin, you can make another pass. However, be careful not to spray too much. It can be difficult to match up the textures when doing touch-ups., Your texture isn't complete until you paint it. Before you paint your drywall, add another coat of primer. Once the primer dries, add one or two coats of paint to finish the job.Let the drywall texture dry completely before painting.

 While you can test out Speedify for up to one gigabyte of downloaded data for free, you'll need to pay a monthly (or annual) fee to continue using Speedify after this.


As of February 2017, the monthly cost for an unlimited subscription to Speedify is $8.99, while the yearly cost for the same subscription is $49.99.
 As long as you've plugged in and installed your USB Wi-Fi adapter, you should be able to click Connect on a second wireless network without having to disconnect from the one to which you're currently connected.
 You can download the Speedify setup file from here.
 You'll need to click either Mac or PC on this page. After doing so, your download should commence automatically.


MacOS Sierra doesn't allow for more than one wireless connection at a time. If you're using a Mac, you'll need to download a third-party Wi-Fi manager to continue with this method., This should be in your default "Downloads" folder (e.g., your desktop or documents folders).


You may have to allow Speedify access to your computer before you can continue.
 Speedify will automatically update itself before you can use it. Once it's done updating, it should open to the full Speedify program.
 This is in the middle of the app's screen. After doing so, Speedify will automatically review and combine your internet connections.


If you want to upgrade your Speedify account at any time, you will need to click the Upgrade button at the bottom of the app window. You may need to disable the Speedify switch first.
Upgrading your Speedify account means you'll need to create an account with Speedify. You can do this from within the app.

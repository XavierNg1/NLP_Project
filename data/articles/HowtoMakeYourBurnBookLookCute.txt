 Think about what you would like to change and what you would like to keep.;
, Paste the pictures into a fresh scrapbook. Make one page for every girl you don't like. You can write captions around them with gel pens or Sharpie pens.
 Cut out pictures & words from magazines and paste them on the front cover. Write some stuff like, "Only the strong survive."

,, Take some at school, too. Keep pasting the photographs into the book, but hide the book, and never bring it to school! This step goes on until you are tired of the book. A burn book isn't something you make in a week. It's sort of a day-to-day process.

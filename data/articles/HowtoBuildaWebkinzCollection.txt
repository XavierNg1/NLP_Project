 Some people only collect them online, a few only in real life, though the majority of people do both. Would you buy a Webkinz without the code at a much lower price or not? You decide!;
, Good. Several stores sell new Webkinz. Use the store locator on Webkinz to find out which near you sell them, though keep in mind that it's a bit outdated. Get to know the stores near you.
 Pets can go as low as 25 cents, depending on the store. The few downsides: Pets aren't guaranteed, newer pets will likely be nowhere to be found, and don't expect pristine condition! However, prices are cheap, and this is the best place to find older, retired, or rare pets.
 Beware of scams ,always buy from reliable sites, and know the normal price of which pet you're buying so you don't get ripped off.
 Codes also come in some trading card packs. Please, if you buy plushes only for their code, donate them to a thrift shop or give to a charity! One man's trash is another man's treasure.

 Items with unfinished leather will have a rough-looking surface. You’ll find leather like this most commonly on items that generally have some wear and tear, such as construction boots, horse saddles, and baseball gloves., Pour a quarter-sized amount of saddle soap onto a clean, damp cloth. After you’ve worked up a good lather of soap on the surface of the leather, flush it clean with water. As per usual, avoid oversaturating the leather with water.








If you notice the leather becoming waterlogged, take a short break and let it air dry for a little while to prevent damage., Your cloth might not be enough to clear crevices or bust up severe dirtiness. Be sure to use a very soft bristle brush, like one made from nylon, to protect damage to the surface of the leather.








To prevent accidentally damaging the leather, before using a brush, first test it out on an inconspicuous spot of the leather first., Dampen a clean, lint-free cloth in water. Wring out excess moisture then use this cloth to wipe away any remaining soap or dirtiness. Be thorough! Leftover soap will dry out and harm the surface of your leather.
 Unfinished leather has a tendency to take on water a little more easily than finished leather. Because of this, you should give unfinished pieces at least eight hours to dry, or an overnight period.
 Pour a leather preservative, such as mink oil, onto the dried item. Using the remaining unused cloth, work a generous amount of oil onto the object, especially into any cracks and areas that look worn. The item is now ready to use.

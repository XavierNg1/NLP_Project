 Some conditions and diseases can have a great effect on someoneâ€™s ability to gain, lose, or maintain a healthy weight. Your doctor may want to test for certain conditions if you're struggling with unwanted weight gain, or are struggling to gain weight.Hyperthyroidism is a condition that can speed up your metabolism because it causes your thyroid gland to produce an excess amount of the hormone thyroxine. This may cause you to be unable to gain weight. If you're having weight issues, you doctor may want to do a blood test to check your thyroid level.
Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a relatively common condition that can cause weight loss due to excessive diarrhea and gastrointestinal problems, resulting in weight loss or the inability to maintain weight. Your doctor may want to test for IBS if you're having issues with your weight in conjunction with other symptoms of IBS.
 Be sure to tell your doctor about any regular use of medications, as this may contribute to unintentional weight loss. Certain medications may also cause you to gain weight.Migraine medications, heart medications, antidepressants, and diabetes medications can all affect weight. Let your doctor know if you're taking any of these types of meds.
Also, talk to your doctor about any non-prescription medications or supplements you take. If you're taking some kind of vitamin or over-the-counter pill, it could interact with prescription medication. This may contribute to weight issues.
 Your doctor will want to know about your family medical history to determine if any hereditary factors exist that could affect your weight. Share any and all information relative to weight.

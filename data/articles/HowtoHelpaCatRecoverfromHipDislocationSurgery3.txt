 Your veterinarian will doubtlessly send you home with various prescribed medications: likely one or two painkillers to keep your cat from suffering, and an antibiotic to prevent infection. Follow the vet’s directions and the directions written on the packaging concerning how many pills you should give your cat, and how often they should be administered.If you run out of a certain medication but feel that your cat would benefit from more (e.g. a painkiller), contact the vet’s office about a refill.
 It’s normal for your cat’s skin surrounding its sutures to be reddened (and even bleed lightly) for the first couple of days following the surgery. However, if the area stays red for longer than two or three days, or if you see a scab forming by the sutures, you should contact your veterinarian. Also contact your vet if you notice any other concerning symptoms in the area operated on, including:Swelling or bruising
Fluid discharge or an unpleasant odor

, Your cat may be anxious or upset following the surgery. Especially if your cat is sequestered, make sure to spend time with it. Pet or stroke your cat and speak to it in a soothing voice. Spend time in the room your cat is in, even if they are in a cage. This will help your cat feel less anxious and more comfortable., If your cat had any pins installed in its hip (in order to help the hip heal correctly) during the hip displacement surgery, you will need to schedule a follow-up appointment. During this appointment, the vet will surgically remove the pins. Plan to have the follow-up appointment and surgery three or four weeks after the initial surgery.If the cat’s hip did not have pins inserted, there may be no need for a follow-up appointment.
As always, check with your veterinarian to see if they recommend a follow-up.

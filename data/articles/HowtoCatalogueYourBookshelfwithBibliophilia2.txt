 Locate the app on your mobile device. The app icon has a black background with the big letter B on it. Tap on it.


You will be brought to your main bookshelf, with all your books neatly displayed. You can swipe up and down to go through them.
 If you have a new book you want to add to your bookshelf, tap the “Add” button on the upper right corner. You will be presented with three options: Manually, Scan Barcode, and Search Online Databases.
 Your mobile device’s camera will be loaded. This method works best if you have the book on hand and you can clearly see and scan its barcode.
 Point your camera to the barcode on the book you want to add. Focus it properly so that the app can read and capture the barcode, then take a picture.
 Once the app captures the barcode, it will read it and add its details to the book form containing all the book’s data for your review.


You can make some edits on this form before saving it. Tap on the field you want to edit, then make your change. Tap “Done” to save and go back to the book form.
 When you’re done, tap “Save” on the upper right corner. The book is now added to your main bookshelf.

 Your family may be startled if they see you up late and it could result in punishment or, worse, they may think you’re a burglar and call the police. Letting people know that you want to stay up late can benefit you as they may wake you up if you’ve fallen asleep past your alarm or in front of the television.
 You will be tired after an all nighter so be sure to schedule a nap in to get back some of the lost sleep. Take about a 20-minute nap to help you recover and be sure not to take it too close to bedtime or you’ll repeat the cycle. You don’t want to nap too long so set an alarm clock as you still want to be able to fall asleep at your regular time.
 Staying up all night uses up a lot of energy. Eat a healthy meal with fruit, vegetables, and protein like fish and chicken. This is especially needed if you have been up all night eating junk food or a lot of carbs.


You should have a substantial breakfast that has a combination of protein, fats, and carbohydrates such as a cheese and egg sandwich.A great dinner to help your immune system recover after going without any sleep is a rice bowl consisting of colourful vegetables, protein-rich quinoa, tofu, and a creamy dressing., You have created a sleep deficit from missing an entire night of sleep so you’ll need more hours than you normally get to make up for it. Make sure that your schedule allows you to get an extra hour or two to get your body back into its normal sleep routine.


Make sure you get enough sleep the night before an all-nighter too. Your chances of staying up all night after not getting enough sleep the night before greatly decrease. You will need a lot of energy to keep you up all night so get at least your normal amount of sleep the night before.

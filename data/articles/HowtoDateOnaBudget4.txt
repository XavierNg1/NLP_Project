 Walking is both free and flexible. You can go for a walk in the park or try touring part of your city. If you live in an area with a downtown, historic site, boardwalk, or similar attraction, tour the area with your date. It’s a great way to get to know each other because you’ll be able to talk to each other.If you both really enjoy nature, try hiking.
See if your city or town has brochures or a local website that highlights its best features. Even the smallest of towns have something that makes them special.If you’ve been dating for a while, spice up your walk by using your phones to take vacation-style photos of each other at various sites around town.
If you live in an area with frozen-over lakes, try ice skating instead.
 Picnics are the classic budget date. You don’t have splurge on a fancy blanket and basket. Instead, use what you have to create a great meal outside. You can use a regular blanket, or look for a picnic table at your local park. Pack a lunch or choose something cheap from the premade section of the grocery store. Sometimes even fast food outside can be a fun date., Snuggling up together and looking at the stars can be a romantic way to spend the evening. Download a stargazing app, such as SkyView, and try to find the stars in your part of the sky. If you have a telescope, bring it with you. If not, enjoy the opportunity to make up stories about what you might be seeing.Bring hot cocoa for warmth and extra fun.
 If either of you has access to a pool, lake, beach, or pond, plan a date on the water. While swimming is a terrific way to enjoy time together, you can also enjoy food, drinks, paddling, fishing, and other related water activities. Even if you’re only able to feed a few ducks, it’ll still be a fun experience.


Check for ponds at local parks.

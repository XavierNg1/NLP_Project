 Though it can be tempting to lie to avoid tough questions, typically the truth always comes out. Tell them what they want to know and avoid lies of omission. If you feel uncomfortable with a certain topic, tell them you don’t want to talk about that., Discussing your dating history does not mean that you need to discuss how your ex’s silvery blonde hair glistened in the moonlight. Mention key aspects of your relationship like length, important events, and why things ended and keep it at that., Your new partner might share some secrets about their past that might be tough for you to hear. However, be open minded with them and avoid judging them on their past. We all make mistakes, but if you can see that they’ve grown, give them the benefit of the doubt.For instance, if they tell you that they cheated a few years back, you might want to give them a chance. However, if they have cheated on everyone they’ve dated, this is a red flag.
 Discussing the number of sexual partners you’ve had or sexual experiences in general can be tricky. You want to be honest with your partner, but being too honest can spark jealousy. Keep talk of your sexual past to a minimum.However, if you have an STD, you should disclose this before having sex with anyone.

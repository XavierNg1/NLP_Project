 To figure out if the problem is related to the food, you should keep a record of your cat’s food and eating habits for a day or two. This can give you a complete view of their foods so you can figure out what is causing the gas.Make sure not to change anything for a day or two so you can try to get an accurate idea of the causes.;
, A food that is lower in fiber may be more digestible for your cat. Foods high in fiber that can’t be digested may linger in the digestive tract and ferment, which can cause gas. Foods that contain high amounts of wheat, corn, and soybeans can cause gas.Don’t change your cat’s food suddenly. This could cause digestive problems and make the flatulence worse. Instead, start slowly mixing the new food with the old and phase out the old food while giving the cat more new food.
Talk to your vet about a good low fiber food that may help your cat.
 Eating too much may cause gas in your cat. To help fix this problem, feed your cat small portions of food. This can ensure your cat gets food, but not too much, which can sit in the digestive tract and cause gas.If you reduce the portions, feed your cat more often throughout the day so they get the same amount of food.

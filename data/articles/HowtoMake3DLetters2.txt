 You will need a ruler, a hobby knife, markers or pens, and a sheet of paper or cardstock. You may also use other types of paper. Just make sure that the paper is thick enough to hold a shape (unlike tissue paper) and easily folded (unlike thick cardboard).
 Start by folding the paper in half widthwise. Then, make two additional creases by folding each half the same way but towards the opposite direction of the original crease. For example, if you folded the first crease down, you would fold both of the new creases up.The folded paper should look similar to two steps on a staircase.
 The letters can be any style you choose, as long as they are thick. Additionally, make sure that each letter's top and bottom edge lines up with the creases. If they are letters that don't typically have straight top and bottom edges, like C or O, cut them off slightly. Decorate the letters with markers or pens., Use a ruler to make the lines go completely across the quarter page above them.Try to make these lines thin using a pencil or a pen instead of a marker. You don't need them to be visible on the final letters.
 Use the hobby knife to make the cuts. Cut the entire outline for each letter, starting with the straight lines above and work your way around the sides of the letter.Make sure not to cut the bottom or top edges of the letters. You may cut out the center white space of certain letters (like R) or leave them in.
 Fold the sheet into a box with the letters as the front side, the strips above them as the top, the quarter you originally drew them on as the bottom, and the quarter the strips were cut from as the back. The top and bottom quarters can be folded under the box and secured with either tape or glue.

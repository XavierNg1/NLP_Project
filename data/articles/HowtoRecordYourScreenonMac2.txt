, The installer for Jing is drag-and-drop. Simply drag the application into your Applications folder, then launch.
 When running, Jing will appear like a "sun" in the top right of your monitor. Alternately, you can choose to install it into the menu bar. Mousing over the sun will bring up the menus.


Shown is the Capture option. There is also a History option, which keeps a log of your captures, and a More button, which gives you access to the settings.

 This will let you select the area for either screen capture or record.


From the menu that appears below the selected area, click one of the 4 buttons shown:

Capture an Image
Capture a Video (shown)
Redo Selection (let's you redraw the selection area)
Cancel (closes the window)



, A countdown timer will appear, with a yellow-framed "filmstrip" outlining the area that will be recorded.
 The yellow square button on the bottom left is the Stop button. When you are finished recording, click that. You will be shown the video window ready for you to review.


The 4 buttons on the bottom function as follows:

Share to Screencast.com. This lets you share your video or screen capture files with anybody by saving the file to a service called—you guessed it—Screencast. You can share this link with anybody for review.

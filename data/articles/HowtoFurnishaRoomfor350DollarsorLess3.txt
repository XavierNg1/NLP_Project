 If you are on a small budget, it is important to use neutral colors on the walls and on the floors. Start by purchasing one gallon of paint. Do not choose a gloss paint because it will give off a shine. Instead, purchase an eggshell finish.
 You can choose a comforter with a neutral color that complements the wall color. Some comforters have a pattern or some other complementary colors woven into the pattern. If you have hardwood floors, you can purchase a rug in a neutral complementary color.
 In order to get that wow factor, add a punch on color by adding a few decorative items, like a bed throw, a few pillows that have the same color.


For example, if you choose to paint the walls a beige color, then a complimentary pop of color could be cobalt blue or bright orange, any bright color will add a burst of color to the room that will make it pop.
 If you can cut out a square or a circle, you can make four simple bed pillows for under $30.00. Also, you can purchase picture frames at the dollar store as well as spray paint, and make 4 elegant picture frames for under $10.00.

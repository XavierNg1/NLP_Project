 If washing your towels with vinegar and baking soda does not work, then you can also try soaking your towels in Oxiclean and hot water. To get started, add 2/3 of a cup of Oxiclean to a large bucket.


Wear gloves to protect your hands as well.
 Start adding very hot water to the bucket. If the water from your tap is not very hot, then you can add some boiling water to the bucket. Swish the Oxiclean into the water by gentle tilting the bucket back and forth as you add the water. Just be careful not to tip the bucket or slosh the water over the sides.
 After you have filled the bucket about halfway with hot water, start adding your towels to the bucket. Make sure that each of the towels is fully immersed in the water.


Leave the towels in the bucket and let them soak for about 48 hours.
 After you have finished soaking the towels, take them out of the tub and wring them out. Then put them right into the washing machine and run them on the hottest setting with detergent and fabric softener.


You can also add Oxiclean to the washing machine when you wash your towels., After the wash cycle has finished, put the towels into the dryer right away. Dry them on high heat until they are completely dry. Your towels should be like new after this treatment.


If your towels still smell like mildew after this treatment, then you may need to replace them.

, You might want to be close to schools, shopping, restaurants, and your workplace. Your price range is based on how many people on your family. So is you have four people in your family you can afford a bigger house than 1 person on their own. You will have a choice of a furnished house or a non furnished house. If you click the furnished house it will cost more and you might get ugly furniture. If you go with non furnished you will save money and you will have to furnish the other rooms (except the kitchen and bathroom, but if you are up for the challenge you can redo those rooms). You might want to get a car or bike. If you buy a car you will have to buy a parking place, if you buy a bike you will have to buy a bike rack. Or you can just take the taxi.
 When you create your Sims, let's say you made a girl and her name is Kathy, Kathy will have a lifetime wish based on her traits. Let's say you chose Kathy's lifetime wish to be a Super Star Athlete. That means you can go to the stadium and get her that job, or you can get her a part time job at the grocery store, the bookstore, the day spa, or the mausoleum.
 Meet people at work, the gym (in Kathy's case), and everywhere you go. This way you might meet a special someone.
 This way you might get married! If you break up, it probably was not meant to be! In that case keep looking, or if you want to be single that's fine, it's your life.
 If you don't want to have kids that is fine. If you are single find someone you can have kids with, or adopt. Adopting a kid is free and you get choose age, and gender. You don't get to choose race though. If you are married you can adopt, or you could do it the natural way.

, Apply a rich hand cream, then apply cuticle oil to the cuticles and all around the edges of your nails. Give the moisturizer and the oil a few minutes to sink in.
 Soak your hands in warm soapy water for five minutes-- this will help your nails to absorb the cuticle oil.


Soak one hand at a time if you want the other one free to drink your coffee or flip through a magazine!

, Buff your nails using a nail buffer -- this will ensure that they are completely dry, which will help the polish to stick better.
 Use a cuticle stick to push back your cuticles. This will make your nails appear longer and your manicure look neater.


You should never cut your cuticles -- they are necessary to protect your nails from infection.
You can also use the cuticle stick to clean out any dirt from around and under your nails.

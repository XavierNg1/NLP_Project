 It is extremely important that you are always present when your dog is interacting with kids. This is especially crucial when your dog is meeting new children. You can never predict how your dog will react in a given situation, making it absolutely necessary that you supervise all interactions between your dog and children.
 It is important that your dog it sitting and staying when you introduce them to a child. This is a reminder to your dog that they are subordinate to you and are under your command. Do not allow children to approach your dog unless they are in sit and stay., Tell the child to close their hand and slowly approach your dog. Then allow your dog time to sniff the childâ€™s hand. If this goes well, tell the child they can gently pet your dog on their chest or their back. Do not allow the child to pet your dog on the top of its head, as some dogs will find this uncomfortable., Allowing a child to engage in rough play with your dog can encourage aggression. Rough play increases the risk of your dog biting or attacking the child. If your dog and the child appear to be engaging in any type of rough play, such as your dog using their mouth to play, immediately remove your dog from the situation., If your dog begins to bark, acts agitated or scared, or engages in aggressive behavior, then it is your responsibility to immediately remove the dog from the situation. These behaviors are all signs your dog is not yet ready to interact with kids.

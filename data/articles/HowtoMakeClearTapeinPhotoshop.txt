, If your layers panel isn't visible, go to Windows and click on layers, or press F7.
 Make a selection in the new layer; the size of the selection doesn't really matter, but if it's big, it's easier to work on and you can always make it smaller or bigger as needed in your projects. Press CTRL+T to remove the selection.
 You can choose your own color; in this tutorial we are using a light gray.
 Use this to create jagged edges on the end of the tape.Once you've finished, press backspace or hit delete so that the selection will be removed; do this on the other side too.
 This step is optional but it gives a more realistic look to it. Slide the transparency on the layer about 25%. Add a drop shadow to give the tape some depth.
 These options will keep the transparency on your tape.

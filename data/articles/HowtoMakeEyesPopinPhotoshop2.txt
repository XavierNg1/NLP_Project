 This will help prevent you from making a mistake on the original image. Select the Background Layer, then click ‘Layer Menu’ and click ‘Duplicate Layer’. Rename the Layer in the dialog box that appears, or just click OK and the duplicate layer with be labelled as Background copy. To easily tell what you are working on, rename the layer to something like “Eyes”.
 Use the ‘magnify’ tool to zoom in on one of the eyes.
 The Dodge tool will help the eyes stand out, but subtly lightening the selection.
 Before you use the tool at all, you need to adjust the settings on the small dialogue box that shows up. You'll want to set the brush to cover only the iris (the colored part of the eye). Adjust the brush hardness to 10%, the ‘range’ to ‘midtones’, and the exposure to 20%.
 Slowly work around the eye, clicking on the colored part of the iris with your cursor to use the dodge tool. Avoid the pupils (the black part that dilates or contracts depending on the light). Notice that the dodge tool lightens the eyes.
 The ‘burn’ tool is used to subtly darken the edges of objects. Right-click the Dodge button in the ‘Tools’ panel. A window will open that displays three more options. This time, select Burn. The symbol for the button changes into a hand.
 Change the brush size. Again, the brush size will depend on the size of the eye. Set the brush hardness to 10%, the ‘brush range’ to ‘shadows’, and the exposure to 15%.
 Click around the perimeter of the pupil and the iris to slightly darken and enhance their appearance. The brush will make the adjustments that you set automatically.
 Repeat the aforementioned process on the second eye, making sure that the two match up. Take time to zoom out occasionally, to make sure that the changes you are making to the image aren’t too drastic.

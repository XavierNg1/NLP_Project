 Look through your clothes and think about which outfits look best on you. Think about what colors you get complimented while wearing and what shirts you’d wear on a date. Make sure to stay away from busy patterns, white, bright colors, and clothing with words or big logos.When in doubt, wear a dark, solid color.Don’t wear anything too low-cut.
Go with opaque fabrics.;
, Big earrings, watches, bracelets, necklaces, scarves, or other accessories will just distract from your face and smile. If you want to wear accessories, it’s better to choose small, simple ones that don’t immediately demand attention.Go with a thin gold or silver necklace chain with a small pendant instead of a chunky colorful necklace with a thicker chain.
Make sure to wear a watch that’s appropriate for your wrist size and isn’t too flashy.
 Have your makeup look as clump-free and natural as possible. Be conservative with the amount you use or else it might appear “cakey.” Keep in mind that you want a subtle enhancement, not anything too extreme.Stick to just one light coat of brown mascara to give your eyes a subtle enhancement.
Stay away from extremely bright or dark lipsticks.
 Hold off on making any major changes to your appearance, such as switching to a new acne cream or dyeing your hair an exciting new color. While you might love these changes, there’s also a chance that they won’t end up looking the way you expected or wanted., Try not to get too stressed about looking amazing. If you just lost your front tooth or you have a couple fly away hairs you can’t quite secure, it’s okay. In the future, you’ll want to look back on the picture you take and see what you really looked like at this age. A couple of endearing imperfections aren’t going to ruin that.

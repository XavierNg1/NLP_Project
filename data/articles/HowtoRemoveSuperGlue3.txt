 If your lips have stuck together with super glue, it's no laughing matter.
 Dip your lips in the water and immerse as much as possible of the lips. Allow the lips to soak for one or two minutes.
 Push the saliva against your lips from the inside.









The saliva should help moisten and soften the glue from the inside of your mouth while the warm water works from the outside.
 Wait until all sides are thoroughly moistened before attempting this, and do not pull! Doing so could cause more damage to your lips.









Work your lips from side to side while keeping them submerged in the warm water. Ideally, they should gradually peel apart from one another.
 Your saliva will eventually remove any remaining stuck adhesive but do not swallow it. Instead, discard any detached adhesive.









Don't worry about swallowing liquid adhesive since the glue should solidify once it comes into contact with your saliva.
The remaining adhesive should lift away within one or two days.

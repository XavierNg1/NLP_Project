 Go en pointe in fifth position, keeping both hands on the barre but not leaning onto it.;
, However, you're going to have to look very weird while doing so. Plie your legs, but not your feet. Keep your feet in the same position while bending your legs.
 Switch your feet like you do during a changement (jump from fifth to other fifth, or switching feet in jump). Land in the same position as you started, while en pointe and your legs in plie.



Once you get really good at it, turn around so that you are facing away from the barre and try this time. Now, you can't lean on anything, so it makes it harder.
Once you get good at that, try going into center. It is even more important that you are supervised during this step. Go slowly.

 When you're done sleeping on your air mattress and want to stow it for storage, unscrew the air hole cover. If your mattress has a simple air hole, it will immediately begin to deflate. However, more complicated models may require slightly more action on your part. If your mattress doesn't immediately start deflating, try one of the following tips:Look for an air-release switch to flip
Turn an air-release mechanism on the valve to let air escape
Unscrew the valve itself from its housing

, As air drains from your mattress, it will eventually settle into a mostly-deflated state. To get all of the air out, start to fold or roll the mattress starting from the end opposite the air hole and moving towards it. This will ensure that the mattress takes up a minimum of space when it's completely deflated.


To force absolutely all of the air out of the mattress, try making small, tight folds or rolls like you might do to force toothpaste out of its tube.
 If you'd like to speed up the deflating process, try using a vacuum to quickly pull air out of the mattress. You can use an ordinary home vacuum, a shop vacuum, or any other machine that can create a suction for this purpose. Simply open the air hole, wait for air to begin leaving the mattress, and hold the vacuum hose or nozzle over the hole to speed up the deflation.

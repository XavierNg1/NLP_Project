, Depending on whether you have two children or pairs, stand each child or pair at opposite sides at the same end of the table.
 It's most fun to have it at the end of the table and then the ball is allowed to fall over the edge of the table end. Or, it can be placed somewhere earlier on the table and marked by a something unbreakable (such as a rubber duck) or by a line (such as a piece of yarn or a ribbon; tape it down). Ensure that the passage on either side of the table is clear of obstructions, so that the children do not hurt themselves while hurrying and blowing the ping pong ball along.
 As soon as the ball reaches its "end of race" point, the child or team should be awarded with a point. Decide how many races there will be to choose the winner. For instance, if you say there will be 5 races, then the child or team who reaches 3 points first is the overall winner of the ping pong races.
 Players can blow with their mouths but they are not allowed to touch the ping pong ball with their hand, chin, elbow or any other part of their body. As soon as a ball falls off the table (except when it reaches the end), the turn is lost and the other side can have a turn. You can add a variation and let the children blow with straws but the straws must not touch the ping pong ball or they're disqualified.

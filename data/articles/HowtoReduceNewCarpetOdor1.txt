 Ventilation is the best means to get rid of a new carpet smell. Masking the odors or using removers only does so much, as it simply takes time and airflow to get rid of the scent.Open any windows and doors you can. If you have doors or windows with screens, keep them open as often as possible.;
, If you have items like a heater or air conditioner in your home, keep them on. This will increase air ventilation. This can help eliminate the new carpet smell quicker.However, if you pay for your own utilities, be careful about running the air conditioner. You can run up an electric bill fast by having the air conditioner running too often.
 If you don't have an air conditioner, use fans. Fans can promote air circulation and help reduce the smell of new carpeting. Place any fans you have in the room with the carpeting and turn them on.If possible, also keep windows and doors open in the room with new carpeting.
Place the fans so that they are facing out towards the windows. This will help to push out the odor and keep the air circulating.
 It takes time for the new carpeting smell to fade. You can speed up that time frame, however, with proper ventilation. Try to keep the room with the new carpet ventilated for at least 72 hours. This should get rid of some of the smell.Remember to open all of the windows and doors. This will help to promote a cross breeze.

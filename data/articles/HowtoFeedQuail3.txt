 Chicks need plenty of protein, which is found in the starter feeds. The starter feeds also offer other nutrients and vitamins that enable the chicks to grow into healthy, fully-grown quail.Use long, straight troughs for brooding chicks. Transition to circular feeders after the chicks are 2 weeks old. Use a smaller bowl for water.
Chicks can eat fine crumble until they are 6 to 8 weeks old. A coarser texture, or pellets, are better for older quail.
When raising chicks, teach them how to drink by dipping their beaks into the bowl/dish. If they have their mother hen with them, this is not much of a worry as she will show them how to drink.
 The best feed for quails is a game bird feed that has at least 20 percent protein or more. Quail feed is expected to have plenty of protein to enable them to have a balanced diet for them to grow into great, healthy pets.


If you are planning on using the quail for their meat, you do not need to give them a developer feed. Give them a finisher feed instead.
If you are going to use your quail for breeding or laying eggs, slowly transition them to the new diet before they hit 10 weeks of age., Layer-pellets provide enough calcium for your quails to lay strong, healthy eggs. Make sure to grind the pellets up a bit if you find the quails quite big for them. This is especially important if you buy chicken pellets, as these are bigger than the quail layer-pellets. Just make sure you don't grind them up into a powder.
 Clean the water bowl one to three times a week and refill once a day. The bowls will tend to get dirty, as the quails will often stand in them, spill dirt/bedding in them and do all-sorts!

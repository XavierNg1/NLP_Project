 When you know someone well, you learn their quirks: how well they like their burgers cooked, what they’re allergic to, that they can’t stand the texture of artichokes or hearts of palm. When you can actually order for someone, you show your love by actively paying attention to their likes and dislikes and communicating that you want to treat them well.
 For a lot of animal lovers, the best way to show your love for them is to acknowledge their pet. By bringing something for Fido, you let them know that you can see how important he is to them and for that reason, he’s important enough to you to include on your gift list.
 Maybe it’s old school to give cds or mixtapes in the age of internet streaming services, but that just makes it more fun. Make a list of songs that are special to the two of you or that make you think of them. Go the extra mile: take a Sharpie and decorate the cd with fun and quirky art., Schedule a couples’ massage. Relax in a sauna. Spend a day at the spa with your Valentine, and they're sure to come away feeling seriously loved.
 This gesture is classic, but that just makes it a clearer statement. If you know what their favorite flowers are, that’s great, but for many people, the gesture alone says it all.

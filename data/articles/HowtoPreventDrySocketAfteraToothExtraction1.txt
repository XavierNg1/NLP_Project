 The way the tooth extraction is performed has a big impact on whether or not dry sockets occur.Educate yourself on the procedure and talk to your surgeon about what to expect. Make sure you are provided with the information you need to ensure everything goes smoothly. You can expect the following preventative treatments from your surgeon:


Your oral surgeon will provide you with mouthwashes and gels designed to help the socket heal properly.
The surgeon will also dress your wound with antiseptic solutions and gauze to protect it when the surgery is over.;
, Certain prescription and over-the-counter medications can inhibit blood clotting, which can prevent the protective scab from forming over your empty sockets.


Oral contraceptives put women at greater risk of developing dry sockets.
If you are a woman taking oral contraceptives, it can help to schedule the extraction to take place during days 23 to 28 of your cycle, when your estrogen levels are low., Consider using a nicotine patch or other substitute for a few days, since inhaling smoke can greatly increase your chances for getting dry sockets.

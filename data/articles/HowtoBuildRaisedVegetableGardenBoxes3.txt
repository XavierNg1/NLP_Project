 Think about the size and height that you want the garden bed to be and then buy the amount of garden brick that you find appropriate for that size. You can buy more later if you need it, so don't overbuy.
 Level the ground where you plan to put the bed.
 Lay out the first layer of the garden bricks, adjusting for size and making sure that the bricks fit snugly. Then, move to the next layer and the next until the wall is at the height you desire. Stagger the bricks in a way that looks good to you.
 Add a thick liner or a heavy duty weed liner to the inside of the box. Leave extra material coming up over the edge. The extra will be trimmed away later.
 Fill the box with high quality soil and fertilizers if you want them. Leave extra space at the top (roughly 2").
 Enjoy your new garden beds!

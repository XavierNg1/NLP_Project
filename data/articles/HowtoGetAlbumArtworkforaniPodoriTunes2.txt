 An excellent source is Wikipedia.Wikipedia has an article on almost every album, and they include a picture of said albums. Click on the artwork for a larger image and drag the image to your desktop or right click and copy the image. (If you cannot find your the artwork on Wikipedia try doing an image search with a search engine such as Google Images.) Always use the full sized image, even if google says it's the same size. If you do not use the full sized image, the image will be blurry.)

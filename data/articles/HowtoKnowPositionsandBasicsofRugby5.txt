 The scrum-half of the team the penalty was not called on puts the ball in the scrum once it is in formation. Once the ball is put in, the hookers from both sides use their feet to try to hook the ball back for their team to get possession of the ball. Once it reaches the eight-man, the scrum-half or eight-man may pick up the ball and resume play. However, if the ball goes out of bounds, a line out occurs.
 The pods vary in size (there may be only one or multiple) and the offensive team chooses how many they wish to do; the defensive team has to match. During a line out, the hooker (or whoever throws the ball) calls the play and the specific pod, comprised of two lifters and a jumper, will jump up to try to knock the ball down to their teamâ€™s side. Once the ball is knocked down, the game resumes as normal.

 You can insert a link to a document or location on your computer or server into any cell in your spreadsheet.
 This will open a new window that allows you to create a link in your spreadsheet.
 This option allows you to link to any location or document on your computer (or server).


In Excel 2011 for OS X, click "Document" and then click "Select" to browse for a file on your computer.
 The quickest way to link to a specific file or folder is to use the file browser to navigate to the one you want. You can link to a folder so that the folder opens when clicked, or select a specific file for the link to open.


You can switch between views to see recent files, as well as change the folder you're currently looking at.
 You can enter the address for the file or folder instead of navigating to it with the browser. This can be especially useful for entering locations on another server.


To find the actual address for a local file or folder, open your Explorer window and navigate to the folder. Click the folder path at the top of the Explorer window to reveal the address, which you can then copy and paste.
To link to a location on a server, paste the address for the folder or location that will be accessible to the reader.
 By default, the link will display the full address to the linked file or folder. You can change this by changing the text in the "Text to display" field.
 You'll see your link appear in the cell you had selected. Clicking it will open the file or folder that you specified.


Users of your spreadsheet will need to have access to the linked file from the same file location as used in your link. It may be more helpful to embed the file rather than linking to it if you will be sending the file to another user.

 To begin the heels-to-heaven exercise, you want to lie on your back on the floor. Make sure your shoulder blades are tucked down your back and your spine is long and flat against the floor., From the floor, lift your legs straight up with your feet flexed, stopping when your legs are perpendicular to the floor. You may want to adjust slightly so that your back remains flat on the floor., To do the heels-to-heaven exercise, all you need to do is pulse your rear up and down so that you're lifting your heels towards the ceiling. Rest your arms along your sides with your palms on the floor for stability.Heels to heaven works best as a timed exercise rather than doing a certain number of reps. Set a timer for 30 to 60 seconds and do as many pulses as you can with good form.
 If you want to make the heels-to-heaven exercise a little more challenging, try to move no more than one or two inches with each pulse. The smaller pulses engage your deep abdominal muscles to control the movement., Crunching or twisting as you pulse requires a little more coordination, but turns the heels-to-heaven exercise into one that will work your entire core. To twist, bend your arms at the elbows and bring one elbow to the opposite knee with each pulse.You also can do crunches. Focus on lifting your head and the back of your shoulders up toward the ceiling with each pulse, engaging your entire core.

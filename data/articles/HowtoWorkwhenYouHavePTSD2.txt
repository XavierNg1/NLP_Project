 Working potentially exposes you to a variety of triggers. Seeing your therapist on a regular basis can help to keep your anxiety and symptoms at bay. Your therapist can also give you ideas as to what to do when you may feel a panic attack coming on.


Working also puts extra stress on you, which can exacerbate your symptoms. Continuing to see your therapist can be the calm and support you need to keep your PTSD under control., Keeping track of your medication is a must, particularly when your schedule becomes busy. You may be more prone to forgetting since you have a lot going on with work. However, your symptoms could return or become even worse if you forget to take it.


Set timers throughout the day to remind yourself to take your medication. You can also ask friends or relatives to call or otherwise remind you.Remember that medication alone will not cure you, but it can help stabilize you so that you can participate more fully in therapy.
 A healthy lifestyle doesnâ€™t cure PTSD, but it does make you feel better. Getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and exercising can lower your stress and anxiety levels. Having an overall lower level of stress can make handling your work responsibilities easier.


Reducing or eliminating your caffeine can help calm your anxiety. Steer clear of nicotine, as well, which can also increase your anxiety levels., People with PTSD are already under enough pressure. Their stress levels can sky rocket when work is added to that. Finding a way to relax and balance yourself is imperative.


Meditating, practicing yoga, massage, or deep breathing can help you keep calm. Practice your chosen method daily to keep your anxiety down and symptoms under control.

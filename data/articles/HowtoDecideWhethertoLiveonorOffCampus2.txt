 Look for signs of damage (flooding, cracks), make sure you understand any renting policies, have the correct lease (everything landlord said is on it), know about traffic and transportation options, and make sure the locks work. Make sure you're on the same page with your roommates about your housing situation, and that you're all looking forward to living together.
 If you're not sure about an apartment or about an individual you might be living with, ask yourself why. This place will be your home, so you want to be comfortable and safe. Make sure you're choosing the right option for that, all constraints considered.
 When you find the option that has what you need, in your budget, that is close to campus as possible, go for it!

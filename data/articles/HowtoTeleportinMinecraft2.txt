 Minecraft PE does not support a teleport command, so you'll need to use an editor app to move your player location. You can't use this for multiplayer. If you're using an iPhone or iPad, you'll need to be jailbroken in order to do this. The most popular apps that can move your player location are:Android - PocketInvEditor
iOS (Jailbreak only) - iMCPEdit

, When you first launch the editor, a list of your saved worlds will be displayed. Tap the world that you want to move your player location for.
 You'll be asked to enter in the coordinates that you want to move to.
 There are three coordinates: X, Y, and Z. "X" is a location east or west of the spawn point. "Z" is the location north or south of the spawn point. "Y" is the elevation above the bedrock. Y:63 is sea level.
 The location will be applied to your saved game and take effect when you start Minecraft PE again and select it.

 It's the bright red one in Taurus.
 This is the core of the Hyades star cluster. Aldebaran and Epsilon are at the tips of the V, and Gamma is at the bottom. All five of these stars are visible with the naked eye.
 It's the one between Epsilon and Gamma. The one between Gamma and Aldebaran is Theta. You don't want Theta.
 Hundreds of other stars should appear in the vicinity. This is the Hyades star cluster. It can be pretty confusing, but keep looking at Delta and you'll be OK. Using a telescope is good because it's easier to focus on one spot.
 T Tauri is embedded in a nebula (NGC 1555) called Hind's variable nebula, so look for the star in a fuzzy patch.
 This nebula, catalogued as NGC 1554, is near to T Tauri, both physically and in the sky. However, since it's first observation (by Otto Wilhelm von Struve), it has disappeared, earning it the name Struve's lost nebula. Perhaps it's disappeared, perhaps it never existed. We'll probably never know.

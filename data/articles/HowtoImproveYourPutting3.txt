 It is important that your putter is the appropriate length for you so you can have your hands in the optimal spot on the putter. Place your hands on the meat of the putter grip then adjust the height of the putter to match. Length of the putter is important for a sound setup and for your hand-eye coordination. , The loft, the angle of the club face, lifts the ball from the depression it makes on the green and gives the ball a backspin. Adjust the loft of your club so it comes at the ball straight on. The lie angle, the angle between the center shaft and the ground, can negatively affect a golfer’s set up and stroke. Keep the lie angle where your natural set up is so you don’t mess up your stroke. , If the club is too light it will make it swerve during the follow through. Add more weight to your club if you notice a jerky motion and difficulty controlling the club. Use a lighter head weight for faster greens and heavier weights for slower greens. If you tend to miss putts in a certain side of the putter, add weight to that side.
 Although there are many different ways to grip the club, when putting keep your grip large. This will keep your wrists from breaking and the putter from being manipulated. Having a large grip will keep the swing in your shoulders, giving you more control.

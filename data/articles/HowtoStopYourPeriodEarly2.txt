 Heat encourages the "fluids" to leave your body faster. Apply a heat pack to your abdominal area.
 This will help reduce the pain of cramps, and it encourages your body to literally 'get things moving'. You might prefer to do this in the comfort and privacy of your own bathroom or bedroom.
 Orgasmic contractions will push the fluids out of your body faster, helping you get through your period more quickly. Make sure both you and your partner are okay with the possibility of things getting a little messy first. Lay a towel down under you or have sex in the shower to minimize mess and clean-up.

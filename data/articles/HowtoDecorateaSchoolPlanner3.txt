 To bedazzle your school planner, you will need: a selection of sequins and gemstones and some very sticky glue!

, Before you touch the glue, you should decide what kind of pattern you want the sequins and gemstones to make on the surface of your planner.


Do you want a heart? A flower? Polka dots? Be imaginative!
Lay all the sparkly bits out in the pattern you want to make first, then all you'll need to do is glue them in place.
 One by one, lift up the sequins and gemstones and carefully apply a little glue to the backs, then stick them back into the correct position.


Firmly press each sequin into place for a second or two, to ensure that they stick properly.
Continue gluing and pressing all the way around your patter until the design is complete.
 If you like, you can add even more sparkle to your planner by using some glitter glue to fill in around the design.


You could also use a metallic gold or silver pen to write your name and grade/year at the top.
Leave the glue to dry for several hours (or overnight) before using the planner.

 In the event you want to keep the phone handy you can add a mesh component along the side of the case that will keep your phone ready but still secured within the purse.
 Pick up heavy-duty mesh material in a complimentary color to your purse. You want to make sure the material will hold your phone steadily in place and not rip or loosen during use.


Consider purchasing a thin fabric border to run along the top of the mesh once it’s secured. So you don’t have cut mesh jutting along the top of the purse, sew a border along the top for a finished look.
 Cut the material to run along the length of the small purse and almost to the top.


Cut the fabric border to fit the mesh piece, lengthwise.
 Use a sewing machine to ensure a tight stitch.
 Hold the bag down as you pull and then pin mesh into place on the other side of the bag.


Sew the other end of the mesh fabric.
 You can hand stich this or could even use fabric glue to secure in place.

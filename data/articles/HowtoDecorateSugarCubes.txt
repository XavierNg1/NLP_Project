 Some ideas include:


For a tea party, draw teacups, teapots, and teabag designs
For Christmas, draw Santas, reindeer, and holly
For Easter, draw Easter eggs, bunnies, and crosses
For a birthday, draw a cake, candles, and gifts with bows
For a cocktail party, draw cocktail glasses, cherry garnishes, and cocktail shakers
For a special year birthday, draw the age on the sugar cubes
For a wedding or Valentine's Day, draw hearts and kisses; for a wedding use bells, lilies, and rings as well
For a spring party, draw bees, flowers, and ladybugs.;
, If using more than one colour, make several bowls of different colors of icing by adding food dye.
 If you already have one, use that.
 This will make it easy to wipe off any drips of icing sugar.
 Following the designs you've planned, pipe the shape onto the sugar cube. It's delicate and tiny work, so be seated somewhere comfortable in good lighting and prepare for this to take some time.


You can pipe a design onto just one side, or perhaps onto more. If doing all 6 sides, this will be very time-consuming and fiddly, and you'll need to allow some sides to dry before turning it right over.
 If you want more than just the icing, add the decorative elements before the icing dries. Some things that you might like to add include dragees, sprinkles, and edible glitter.
 Arrange on a serving plate, making sure to show the designs to their best advantage.

 Iron your fabric to remove any wrinkles and creases. Wrinkled fabric will cause jaggedness even if you cut a straight line.









If you're using a fabric like linen or cotton, using spray starch will give your fabric a bit more body and make it easier to cut., If you have a cutting mat, use the lines on it to help ensure that the ruler is straight.









If you're cutting fabric that has a definite pattern or direction, make sure your ruler is aligned with the pattern. Depending on the fabric, this may mean you need to slant your line rather than cut a perfectly vertical line that skews the pattern.
You must use a metal ruler for this step! Plastic rulers will melt once you apply heat.
 If you have a fabric-covered ironing board, pin the fabric to the ironing board to keep it in place. Otherwise, you can just hold it securely with your hand.
 Applying gentle pressure, move the iron back and forth over the fold you just created. The ruler will help you press a perfectly straight crease.
 Place the ruler alongside one edge of the fold to help keep your scissors or rotary cutter steady. Cut slowly along the fold.

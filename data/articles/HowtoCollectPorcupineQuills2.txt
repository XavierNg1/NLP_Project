 You will need a few things for this method.


Some kind of body padding or armor
Safety goggles
Thick gloves
Plastic container (the kind you'd use for snacks--make sure it is big enough for the quills to fit)
An already-dead porcupine (look, for example, for roadkill)
Shovel

, If it smells, don't use it. The smell gets into the quills, rendering them horrible for any use. But if it's fresh roadkill, for instance (you hit it or you just saw it hit, or it's clearly not smelly or attracting flies), go for it.
 You can do this on site or at home.


Act like you're petting the porcupine from head to tail. Nothing should try to stick you if you rub it right. Then, while petting it, grasp a group of quills between your fingers and pull at the same angle you were petting. They will pop out. Get all the quills from the animal, and store them away somewhere in your backpack.
If you want to collect the quills at home, just worry about skinning the porcupine on site. Put the skin, quills and all, in a shopping bag. Put that in a second bag and that in a third bag. Tie it all up. Dispose of the rest of the carcass as described below, carry the skin home, and use the methods in the first option to get the quills at home.
 Dig a hole and bury the porcupine near some plants, or if it was roadkill, toss it off the roadside into the forest for scavengers to eat. This returns its nutrients to the environment.


If you're interested in eating the porcupine (not a common food, but it is edible), skin the animal and bag up the skin. Dress the animal and place the meat in the remaining two bags--like with the skin but only two. Discard the leftovers into the woods for scavengers. Take the quills out of the skin at home as described above, and put the meat in the freezer while you do this--and only do it before you cook the meat; the skin will spoil so you must do it now.

 The longer you wear braces, the more your teeth are pulled into alignment. When this happens, your teeth shift, which causes the wires used in your braces to shift as well. The closer your teeth get to one another, the more extra wire you will end up with along the back of your braces. The excess wire can cause irritation and discomfort. If it is just a small amount of wire sticking through, you can use orthodontic wax to help ease the discomfort until you can get it repaired. Dry off the area with a cotton ball or q-tip. Then, roll a pea sized amount of wax between your finger and apply it to the irritating wire in the back your mouth.You may also want to consider using cotton balls in this area of our mouth. It may be slightly more cumbersome, but it will work until you can get some wax or see your orthodontist., If the wire is longer than is comfortable and cannot be covered with wax, you need to move the wire. Try bending the wires back with your fingers. If the wire is too small, try using a pencil eraser to move the point away from the area that it is irritating.Make sure you don't move it to a place where it will irritate another area of your mouth. Also make sure you don't bend it to the point that you pop off one of your brackets. This will cause you to need additional repairs when you get to the orthodontist office.
 When you have a particularly annoying wire in the back of your mouth, putting wax on it and bending it back might not be the best method to fix it. If the wire is too long to apply wax to and too strong to bend, take a pair of sharp fingernail clippers or wire clippers and cut off the wire as close to the end as you can without damaging the bracket.Make sure you catch whatever wire you cut off. You don't want to swallow it or poke yourself with the leftover wire. To catch the wire, place a tissue or cloth under your mouth to catch it as you cut it off.If you don't cut it all the way off, you may need to use orthodontic wax on the back.

 Even though symptom guidelines are a pretty good indicator of how you will react to a medication, observe your body’s actual response to what you’re putting into your body.


For example, Benadryl makes some people sleepy, but leaves other people feeling unnaturally wired.
 Although these decongestants make it easier for you to breathe, they are also light stimulants that might keep you awake, if breathing clearly.
 It’s good to know what the difference between “non-drowsy,” “nighttime” and “daytime” really is.


“Non-drowsy” medication simply means that there are no ingredients that are meant to induce sleep. This does not, however, mean that the medication is specially formulated to keep you awake or prevent you from getting drowsy. Don’t assume that non-drowsy formulas will leave you unaffected: for example many such formulas include pseudoephedrine.
“Nighttime” or “PM” medication has compounds that are intended to make you sleepy. Be careful about mixing or doubling up on your medications; if your “nighttime” medications already treats fevers or pain, don’t add extra drugs on top of them to target those symptoms.
“Daytime” or “AM” medication may be synonymous with “non-drowsy” formulas, or may have caffeine in them to increase alertness. Read the packaging carefully to see what you’re getting. Don’t assume that “daytime” medications are merely formulas that aren’t specifically designed to make you drowsy; if you take one before bedtime, it may well keep you awake.
 Furthermore, the alcohol used in such medications may dehydrate you as you sleep, actually setting your body back in terms of its healing process.


Some nighttime medications can become habitual; prolonged reliance on these products to get to sleep can disturb healthy sleeping habits.

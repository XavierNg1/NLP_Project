 Be sure to only use a comb on curly or natural hair. A brush can damage the hair cuticle and will make curls frizzier and less defined. The best tool to use for curly hair is a wide-toothed comb. , Never comb curly hair when it's dry. You may have noticed that curly hair becomes frizzy when it's brushed or combed when dry. Make sure to only comb curly hair after showering. , Curly hair is drier than straight hair, so it needs all the moisture it can get. Products meant specifically for curly hair deliver this moisture to curly hair for more defined curls. You also may try applying argan oil or another kind of oil at the tips of curly hair. The tips of your hair are the driest part of your hair, and need special attention.
 Just like with straight hair, you want to start brushing near the tips of the hair and work your way up. Curly hair is especially prone to tangling, so it’s important to not start from the roots. If you encounter tangles, do not yank the comb through them. Even if it untangles the knot, using too much force can mess up the pattern of the curl and make curly hair look frizzier.
 Once you have worked your way up to the roots, brush a couple strokes down from the roots to the tips of the hair shaft. Because the hair is wet, you won’t distribute as much healthy oil from the scalp as you would if it were dry, but it is still an important step in making curly hair healthy.

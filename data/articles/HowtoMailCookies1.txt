 If you want your cookies to stay fresh in the mail, then you should avoid sending soft, buttery, or moist cookies, because their moisture will make them more likely to deteriorate. Instead, opt for cookies that are drier and more crisp, such as shortbreads, sugar cookies, biscotti, or crisp gingerbread cookies. Here are some other types of cookies that you can send:Cookies that have a slightly chewy texture, like chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, snickerdoodle, and white chocolate-cranberry cookies.
Macaroons and Pignoli. Though these cookies are more chewy and moist, their textures actually improve after a few days.;
, If you bake the cookies on a Saturday afternoon, then they won't ship until Monday, which means you've wasted almost two full days of cookie freshness. Try baking the cookies the morning of the day you're going to send them, or at least the night before.If you want to consider a faster shipping method, you can also choose to express-ship the cookies through UPS or FedEx, or to send them as Priority or Express mail through your local post office.
If you're mailing them over the holidays, make sure you send them enough days in advance that they get to their recipient before the holiday and don't end up waiting in a warehouse because the mail will be closed for a day or two during the holiday season.
 Once you've baked your cookies, you should let them cool for a while to get rid of any additional heat or moisture and to let them harden a bit. If you package them immediately after you take them out of the oven, you'll be packing them in with the moisture and heat, which will make them spoil faster. But once they've cooled, you should package them as quickly as you can to maximize their freshness.

 Perhaps the easiest way to find someone to take over your lease is to go through a company that matches people with leases. For a fee, these companies will help buyers and sellers connect and act as a go-between which can assist in the process and vet potential buyers and sellers.Search online for car lease swap companies and look for customer testimonies and companies with positive feedback.Weigh up the costs of the fees with the value of the service being provided. If you need to find a buyer quite quickly, it could be worth it.
Some lease swapping websites will enable you to search by make, model, and year.
 An alternative to employing a lease swapping company is to list the lease online yourself, and deal with any interest you get from the advert. If you opt for this approach, you will have to do more of the work to find a buyer and negotiate a deal, but you will avoid the costs of employing someone else to do it. There will be listing and registration fees, so be sure you shop around to find the best deal with a reputable company.


The fees will vary but you should expect to pay around $200 to register with the listing site and place your listing.
There will be optional extra costs that will boost the visibility and presence of your advert., The classified section of your local paper is a good place for an ad seeking potential drivers to assume your lease or take over your loan. Run an advert with a photograph of the vehicle, mileage, general condition, amount of monthly payment, and term remaining on the lease.


You can also use social media websites. If you use Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, or any other social media site, post an ad on it.
Be sure to include a photograph and the amount of the monthly payments, as well as the remaining term of the lease.
Talk to friends, family, and co-workers. Let friends, family, and co-workers know that you are looking for someone to take over your loan or lease.

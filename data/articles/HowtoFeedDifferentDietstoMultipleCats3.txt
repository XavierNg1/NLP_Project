 If your cats are used to free-feeding, start getting them used to scheduled feedings with four or five daily meals. Divide their daily recommended portion accordingly to avoid overfeeding.For example, divide one full day’s food portion by four if you’re feeding it four meals, so each meal consists of one-fourth its daily need.
The amount of food a cat needs to eat per day depends on its age, size, and overall health. If you haven’t already, work with your cats’ vet to come up with a meal plan appropriate for each cat., After two or three days, eliminate one of the scheduled feedings. Be sure to adjust meals’ portion sizes accordingly so your cats get their recommended daily value. Eventually, wean them down to two to three meals per day.For best results, schedule mealtimes at consistent times each day.
 You might have difficulty keeping consistently scheduled mealtimes for multiple cats due to work or being out of town. There are electronic feeders available that release food at certain times of day or only to a cat with a corresponding microchip.You can find an electronic feeder online or at your local pet supply store.

 After the Affordable Care Act became law, states had the choice to expand Medicaid coverage to provide coverage for more residents, or leave coverage rules the same. Whether or not your state expanded Medicaid can have an effect on eligibility requirements for coverage.

If your state did choose to expand Medicaid, you can qualify based on your household size and income. To determine whether you qualify based on your income and household size, see https://www.healthcare.gov/qualifying-for-lower-costs-chart.
If your state did not expand the Medicaid program, you will need to meet your state’s existing eligibility requirements for Medicaid. Typically, to apply for Medicaid under the old rules, your income must be below 100% of the poverty level. Currently, this would mean that for one person, annual income must be below $11,670 to qualify. For a family of four, the income cutoff is $23,850. , To determine whether you are eligible for Medicaid, you can fill out the same application that you would fill out to get insurance under the Affordable Care Act. You can apply for Medicaid at any time, regardless of any “open enrollment periods.”

, Although you can apply for Medicaid coverage through filling out a marketplace application, you can also apply directly through your state.


State applications will vary depending on the state, so it is likely easier to fill out a marketplace application.
To fill out a state application, visit https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/eligibility and select your state from the dropdown menu.
 If you are eligible for Medicaid, you can be enrolled through the marketplace or through your state agency. After enrollment, you will receive a Medicaid card in the mail: you will use this card when receiving medical care or filling prescriptions. If you have any questions about your coverage, you should contact your state Medicaid agency.

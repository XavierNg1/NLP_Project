, Have everyone sit in a circle around the fire. They can bring their chairs, sit on rocks or sit on blankets to give them added comfort.
 Go around the circle and ask each person what song each person would like to sing. Some good choices might be:


House of the Rising Sun. It’s hard to say what exactly makes “House of the Rising Sun” such a perfect fit for the campfire, but it might have something to do with that incredible folk rock arrangement. It’s a great song that most everybody knows, is easy to sing, and creates a "feel good" atmosphere.

Don’t Stop Believing. Most everyone knows it and you can’t help but sing along. It’s the ultimate bonding song.

California Dreamin’. This song has the perfect feel and beat to listen to while chatting around the campfire. It’ll sound just right mixed with the crackling of the fire.

She Lit a Fire. A great song; just perfect for camping.
, Hand these printed lyrics out when no one knows the words to the songs.
 Ask if anyone knows how to play the guitar, bongos or harmonica. Introduce these instruments into the songs gradually. You can also make your own musical instruments with keys, bottles, twigs and rocks gathered at the campsite.
 Continue going around the circle until everyone has a chance to sing a verse. Once everyone sings one verse, everyone can sing the remaining verses of the song together., Start out with slow songs and gradually build up intensity and enthusiasm with songs using more energy.
 They can also tap their feet on the ground or do any other activity that makes an interesting sound.

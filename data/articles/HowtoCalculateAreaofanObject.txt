 If you're not working with a simple easily-identifiable shape, like a circle or a trapezoid, then you may be working with a shape that is made up of several other shapes. You have to recognize what those are so you can break the larger object down into a series of smaller objects.


In this case, this object is composed of the following shapes: a triangle, a trapezoid, a rectangle, a square, and a semi-circle (half of a circle).;
, These formulas will allow you to use the given measurements of each shape to find their areas. Here are the formulas for finding the area of each shape:


Area of a Square = side2 = a2


Area of a Rectangle = width x height = w x h

Area of a Trapezoid = /2 = /2

Area of a Triangle = base x height x 1/2 = (b x h)/2

Area of a Semi-Circle = (π x radius2)/2 = (π x r2)/2

, Once you write down the formulas, write down the dimensions of each shape so you can plug them in. Here are the dimensions of each shape:


Square: a = 2.5 in
Rectangle = w = 4.5 in, h = 2.5 in
Trapezoid = a = 3 in, b = 5 in, h = 5 in
Triangle = b = 3 in, h = 2.5 in
Semi-Circle = r = 1.5 in

, Finding the area of each shape will lead you to find the area of each part of the shape; once you've found the area of each shape using the formula and measurements you were given, all you have to do is add up each area to find the area of the entire object. When calculating area, you have to remember to state the area in square units. The area of the entire object is 44.78 in2. Here's how you get it:


Find the area of each shape:

Area of Square = 2.5 in2 = 6.25 in2

Rectangle = 4.5 in x 2.5 in = 11.25 in2

Trapezoid = /2 = 20 in2

Triangle = 3 in x 2.5 in x 1/2 = 3.75 in2

Semi-Circle = 1.5 in2 x π x 1/2 = 3.53 in2



Add the areas of each shape together:

Area of Object = Area of Square + Area of Rectangle + Area of Trapezoid + Area of Semi-Circle
Area of Object = 6.25 in2 + 11.25 in2 + 20 in2 + 3.75 in2 + 3.53 in2

Area of Object = 44.78 in2




, The surface area is the total area of an object's faces and curved surfaces. Every three dimensional object has a surface area; the volume is the amount of space taken up by the object. Here are the formulas for finding the surface area of a variety of objects:



Surface area of a square = 6 x side2 = 6s2


Surface area of a cone = π x radius x side + π x radius2 = π x r x s + πr2


Surface area of a sphere = 4 x π x radius2 = 4πr2


Surface area of a cylinder = 2 x π x radius2 + 2 x π x radius x height = 2πr2 + 2πrh

Surface area of a square-based pyramid = side of base2 + 2 x side of base x h = b2 + 2bh

, Here they are:


Cube = side = 3.5 in
Cone = r = 2 in, h = 4 in
Sphere = r = 3 in
Cylinder = r = 2 in, h = 3.5 in
Square-Based Pyramid = b = 2 in, h = 4 in

, Now, all you have to do is plug the dimensions of each shape into the formula for finding the surface area of each shape and you're all done. Here's how you do it:


Surface area of the cube = 6 x 3.52 = 73.5 in2

Surface area of the cone = π(2 x 4) + π x 22 = 37.7 in2

Surface are of the sphere = 4 x π x 32 = 113.09 in2

Surface are of the cylinder = 2π x 22 + 2π(2 x 3.5) = 69.1 in2

Surface area of the square-based pyramid = 22 + 2(2 x 4) = 20 in2

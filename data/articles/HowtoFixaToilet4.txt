 If there isn't enough water coming into the bowl to thoroughly clean it out, it probably means that not enough water is getting into the tank in the first place. Find the floating arm and try bending it up slightly to allow more water to fill into the tank.


Be careful not to raise it too far past the overflow tube, or the tank will run constantly.
 After shutting off the water and flushing the tank, check to make sure the valve isn't closing too soon, shutting off more water from getting into the bowl. If it is, adjust the rod arm or the chain.


There should be three or four different height settings to allow the assembly to customize to your toilet. Try different settings until enough water flows into the toilet.
 These will often become clogged with mildew or rust because it's a difficult area of the toilet to clean. Take a toilet brush with toilet cleaner to the underside of the rim to make sure enough water can get through the ports.


To see if they're clogged without sticking your head in the toilet, use a small mirror and check them out in the reflection.
You can also use a wire hanger to clean the ports out if there's anything lodged in there you can't get out with a brush.
 Generally, a pipe connects them. Look at the base of the tank and check the nuts to see if they need tightening, replacing, or new washers.


If part of the tank or bowl is cracked or leaking, this may result in a weak flush or other problems and you may need to replace the toilet completely.

 As a general rule, garden-based tropical flowers will require sun, a rich, well-drained soil and protection over the winter months.Many tropical plants will also require regular feedings and a thick mulch. They will need to be watered when the soil is dry to the touch.
However, it's also important to be aware of the exact requirements for each species of tropical flower. Some plants, such as caladiums, will require full or partial shade. Others such as canna and bougainvillea will want to be in sun. Banana plants need to be sheltered from strong winds.
 Gardeners have a choice in terms of what to do with tropical garden plants over the colder months. Some treat tropical plants as annuals and let them die back in the winter months to replant again the following year. Others overwinter tropical plants indoors.


Plants such as begonia and orchids will want light and heat, so a heated conservatory attached to your home is ideal.
Other plants, such as hibiscus, bougainvilla and varieties of citrus, will tolerate cooler conditions - such as a greenhouse that does not fall below freezing.
 Plants growing from tubers or bulbs (such as caladium or canna) can be lifted and overwintered indoors for planting outside again in spring. One option is to lift the entire plant and repot in compost-filled container in a warmer location.


Alternately, you can clean the tubers or bulbs off and store in cool, dry and dark conditions such as inside a paper bag with a handful of peat moss.
The bulbs should not be allowed to dry out completely or they will become wrinkled or shriveled. However, it's also important to avoid mold and rot.

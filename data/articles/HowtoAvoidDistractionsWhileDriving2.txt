 Because food spills are major sources of distraction while driving, try to avoid eating in the car, especially messy foods. Instead, eat before you get in the car, or eat once you have reached your destination.Make sure to place drinks, like coffee, water, and sodas, in secure drink holders while driving to avoid spills.
 Cellphones are also a major source of distraction for drivers. Either place your cellphone on silent, turn it off, or place it out of reach in your purse or the glove compartment. Additionally, look into your phoneâ€™s safety settings. See if you can create a message that will automatically respond to incoming texts and calls while you drive.Some phones have features that turn off text and call functions while the GPS is on.
 Do this if there is an emergency and you need to take a call. If you have to eat while driving, make sure to pull over to eat as well. Additionally, if you need to attend to children and pets while driving, then pull over.If you are on the highway or a busy street, make sure to exit before pulling over. Then make your way to a street that is less busy.

 Eating high-glycemic foods such as white bread, white potatoes, and chips is linked to acne breakouts. Try to eat low-glycemic alternatives such as multi grain bread, beans, and vegetables. A low-glycemic diet may prevent you from getting acne.Talk to your doctor before you eliminate foods for your diet.
 Once you have washed and moisturized your face, keep your hands away from your face throughout the day.When you touch your face, you are transferring bacteria and oil from your hands to your face which can lead to breakouts. Also, be careful of items that touch your face such as sunglasses, telephone, hats, and helmets. Clean these items regularly.
 The makeup and hair products you use can cause spots as well. Look for products that say "non-comedogenic," "water-based," "alcohol-free" and "oil-free." These words indicate that these products will not clog your pores.Carefully apply any hair styling products so that they do not get on your face.

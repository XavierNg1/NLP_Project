 During or after the Veneration, people need to sit and relax and, so, order enough chairs and if needed tables too. Get some workers get working in arranging the chairs and tables in a comfy position. Get a canopy too if its daylight and if you can afford for it. If not, just arrange the tables and chairs under a shed or tree or a roofed shed.
 For giving out the prasad or offerings, order plates (plastic or steel would do),spoons, cups and bowls. Plastic spoons, forks and cups are disposable thereby allowing for the easy disposable of used catering items.
 Also, order bottles of water or a dispenser for the guests fulfillment. Get some juice packets from a local store or prepare your own.
 Place order for canopies to prevent sunlight, cold, rain or different weather changes from disturbing the guests.
 Order sweets from a nice confectionery store. Sweets can also be made in the house or home-made. This requires special training as the guests expect perfectly prepared food and sweets. Make yourself prepared and equipped with cookbooks and other sources to prepare a perfect and delicious sweet.

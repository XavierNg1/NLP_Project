 Do this by pressing its Power button.


The location of the Power button varies depending on your printer’s model. If you’re unsure, refer to the printer’s user manual.
If the printer does not turn on even after pressing the Power button, ensure that it is connected to a power source by plugging its power cable to a wall outlet.;
, When purchasing a printer, it comes with two cables: the power cable and the USB cable. Get the cable with the square-type connector.
 Look for a square hole at the side of your Macbook Pro. Insert the USB cable of the printer to this hole.
 Once a connection has been established, your printer should appear on the screen menu. If your printer does not appear on the screen menu, you should find and install the proper driver for the printer, but usually, the Macbook Pro does not have to install any software from the printer if it is your first time connecting them.


To install the driver, just put in the CD driver (which usually comes with the printer) in your CD ROM to initiate installation. You can also install the driver by connecting to the Internet and look for the printer manufacturer.
To know the name and model of the printer, please check the printer’s box or at the side of the printer.
 You can check if the printer is ready to print by checking the “Printing Sheet” when printing or through the “Print & Fax Preferences.”


If your printer name is on the list displayed on the Printing Sheet, then you are ready to print. If not, proceed to the next step to add your printer.
The Printing Sheet is the printer menu used to check if your printer is detected and available.
 If your printer isn’t showing up in the list displayed on the Printing Sheet, click “Add Printer” on the same menu. A list of available printers will show up.


Click on the printer you want to add then click “Add.” You can now print with that printer.

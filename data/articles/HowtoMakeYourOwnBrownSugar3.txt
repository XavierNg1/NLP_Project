 Put the brown sugar in an airtight container in your pantry. You can store the brown sugar at room temperature indefinitely, but it may harden over time as it dries out./images/thumb/f/f8/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg

If you don't have an airtight storage container, you can keep the brown sugar in a plastic food storage bag with a zipper.
 If you need to soften brown sugar quickly, put the lump of brown sugar into a microwave-safe bowl. Moisten a paper towel with water and lay it over the brown sugar. Microwave the brown sugar for 15 to 20 seconds and check to see if it's softened. If not, microwave it for another 15 to 20 seconds.If the brown sugar is so hard that it's hard to divide the lump into a bowl, add a few teaspoons of water to the sugar before you microwave it.
 You can also soften brown sugar by storing it with a piece of fresh bread for a few days. The moisture from the bread softens the sugar. Just be sure you remember to toss out the bread before too long because it will dry out./images/thumb/6/6d/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg

You could also place a slice or two of apple in the container to keep the brown sugar soft.

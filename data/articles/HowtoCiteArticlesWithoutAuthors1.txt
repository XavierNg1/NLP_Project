 Follow that with the title of the journal in italics:


‘Grapes for Wine.’ Wine for Life

Note the period after the title.;
, Add a period in between the two, followed by the date of publication in parenthesis:


‘Grapes for Wine.’ Wine for Life 20.2 (1987):
Note the citation has a colon after the date.
 Finally, add the medium, such as “print” or “web.” If it is published online, use the date you accessed it as well:


‘Grapes for Wine.’ Wine for Life 20.2 (1987): 22-44. Web. 20 Jan. 2002.
 For a newspaper article, the theory is the same:


‘Trees in Deserts.’ All You Need to Know about Trees 25 Mar. 2005: 22-23. Print.”

, Use the title for alphabetizing purposes on your reference page.
 For an in-text citation, use a shortened form of the title if it is long or the whole title if it’s short. Place the title (in quotes) at the end of the sentence in parenthesis. Also include the page number where you found the information:


“Smaller grapes make more flavorful wines (‘Grapes for Wine’ 23).”

 If the dial was bumped, it could have made it too warm for the refrigerator to turn on. It's important to check both the refrigerator and the freezer temperature settings, because the refrigerator gets its cold from the freezer. A problem with the freezer setting will affect the refrigerator as well.


It should be set between 37 and 40º F (3-4ºC) for the refrigerator and between 0-5ºF (-15 to -18ºC) for the freezer.
 Check the space between the walls and the appliance. There should be a 3-inch (76.2 mm) gap around the sides of the appliance and at least a 1-inch (25.4 mm) gap at the top. This provides airflow needed for the machine to function., This part helps dissipate heat that could make the appliance act funny. This cleaning should be done with the appliance turned off. You should clean rear-mounted coils once a year, and floor coils twice a year., Unplug the refrigerator for 2 hours and then plug it back in. If it starts running "normally" again, the compressor is overheating and it should be checked by a repair technician. Use a multimeter to test each component for continuity. These include the temperature control, the evaporator fan, the defrost timer, the overload protector and the compressor motor.


You may have to consult your owner's manual for the locations of the components. If a part does not have continuity, it is faulty and will need to be replaced.

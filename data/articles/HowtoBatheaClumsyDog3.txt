 If your dog is very clumsy and you don’t want to deal with bath time yourself, you can take your dog to the groomer and pay for them to bathe your dog. If you can afford it, this is a great way to minimize the hassle of bathing a clumsy dog while still ensuring that your dog gets bathed regularly.Of course, this might not be an option for everyone. Remember that you will have to pay the groomer to bathe your dog for you.
 You might consider having your dog professionally bathed at your veterinarian’s office if your dog is especially clumsy and difficult to handle. Again, this is an option you will be required to pay for, so you should consider your financial situation before you decide on this course of action.This option might be especially helpful for you if your dog is unreasonably hard to handle during bath time.
 Sometimes you just need an extra set of hands to help you while you bathe your clumsy dog. If you have a friend present, they can help steady your dog, help minimize the mess, and help your dog feel more secure during the entire process.


This should be a trusted friend that your dog is already comfortable around. Otherwise, your dog will be made more nervous by the stranger and it may act even more clumsily than usual.

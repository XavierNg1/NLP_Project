 When someone has a good hand, they tend to try to look as calm and passive as possible. This may come naturally due to lack of stress to bluff, or a player may try to put on a show to demonstrate their feigned lack of interest in their hand.Some intentionally passive gestures may include big sighs, slumping in their chairs, saying things like "I guess I'll bet." or shaking their head.
Often, if a player is making a point to show lack of interest in their hand, it is because they have something they want you to be into.
 A player who bets conservatively or seems unhappy to have to bet is likely holding a strong hand. In order to make their hand seem weaker, they will try to seem unsure about whether they should bet.This is a particularly good tell for someone who is generally an aggressive better. A sudden change to a more reserved betting pattern likely indicates a strong hand.
 While stress indicators in the eyes are easy for an experienced player to control, smiling from the eyes often is not. An experienced player knows better than to smile when they get a good hand, but their eyes will often narrow somewhat. The best indicator of this is seeing crows feet suddenly appear around their eyes.Even if your opponent has their eyes covered, watch how the skin folds in the area around their eyes. The sudden emergence of fine lines may indicate that they are sincerely excited for their hand.

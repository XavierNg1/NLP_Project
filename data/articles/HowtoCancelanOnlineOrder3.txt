 Sometimes the box will be left at your shipping location, so you will not have a choice to refuse the package.
 Look for instructions on how to return the merchandise.
 Enclose the return request in your package.
 Request a receipt so that you can prove that you shipped the box.


It is a good idea to get a delivery signature and a tracking number when making returns.
The shipping costs to receive the goods and send them back are usually the responsibility of the buyer. Check the returns section of your packing slip to see if the company offers free returns. If they do, ensure you drop the package off at the location they use for free return shipping, such as FedEx or UPS.

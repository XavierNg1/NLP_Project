 Heat the pan on the stove over medium to medium-high heat.


The butter should be completely melted. If using cooking oil instead of butter, wait until the oil becomes glossier and easier to maneuver around the pan.
Note that nonstick cooking spray will not work with this method.
 Gently crack each egg on the counter or on the side of your pan and break it directly into the hot oil or butter.


Cook one egg at a time to prevent the whites from running together.
Drop the eggs carefully so that the yolks do not break.
 Let the eggs cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the egg whites have completely set on the bottom and are mostly set on the top.


The egg yolk will still be liquidy.
 Carefully use a spoon to remove some of the hot butter or oil from the pan. Drizzle this hot butter or oil over the top of the egg and let the egg cook for an additional 1 minute or so.


The egg yolk of each egg will be partially set, but not completely solid.
 Gently slide the egg out of the frying pan with a spatula and transfer to a serving plate. Enjoy immediately.

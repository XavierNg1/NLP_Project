 Trigonometric concepts are all related. It is best practice to keep all of your notes in one place so that you can refer back to earlier notes. Designate a specific notebook or binder to your trigonometry studies.You can also keep practice problems in this book.
 Avoid using your class time to socialize or catch up on homework for another class. When you are in trigonometry class, you should be zeroed in on the lecture and practice problems. Write down any notes that the instructor puts on the board or otherwise indicates as important.
 Volunteer to solve problems at the board or share your answers to a practice problem. Ask questions if you don’t understand something. Keep communication as open and fluid as your instructor will allow. This will facilitate you learning and enjoying trigonometry.


If your instructor prefers to lecture mostly uninterrupted, you can save your questions for after class. Remember it is the instructor’s job to help you learn trigonometry, so don’t be shy.
 Complete any homework assigned. Homework problems are good indicators of test questions. Make sure that you understand each problem. If no homework is assigned, work problems from your book that reflect the concepts covered in the most recent lecture.

 Most of the snakes with higher scores will be found there. The map on the lower right of the screen will help guide you there.
 Just follow them. Most of the time smaller snakes will run into the side leaving points for you to collect. Because the snake you are following is a larger snake most likely others will crowd round hoping to get a chance to attack. The snake you are following won't live long and once it dies you'll be there to pick up the scraps. Also, target the smaller snakes when you aren't a large one., When a snake at a higher level dies, there will most likely be chaos. Other snakes will speed up and ram into each other.

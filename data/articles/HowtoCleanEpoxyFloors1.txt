 The best way to maintain your epoxy floor is to run a soft dust mop over it once a week. This removes dirt and dust gently, which prevents scratches and protects your floor.For floors with an anti-slip aggregate coating--such as aluminum oxide--a soft bristle push broom may be more effective than a standard dust mop.;
, If you have visible construction joints or saw cuts, you should use a vacuum to clean these out. For best results, use your vacuum attachment hose with a crevice tool. Vacuum these joints about once per month.If you do not have a vacuum, you can try to clean any joints/cuts with a stiff bristle broom.
 Oil, chemicals, or even just water left to sit for too long can damage your epoxy floors. Clean any spills as soon as you see them using a soft towel or cloth. You can use a gentle cleanser--such as Windex--if a spill is sticky or leaves a film.

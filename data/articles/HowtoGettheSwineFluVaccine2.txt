 Headache, malaise, dizziness, headache, fever, and muscle pain. Two people had more severe reactions, with a much longer spell of nausea, muscle pain and malaise that lasted several days. There were reports of tingling lips or tongue, difficulty breathing, hives, and skin rashes. Thirty six people had serious adverse effects, including anaphylaxis and febrile convulsions; one woman in her 80s died in Quebec. Rare side-effects are temporary bleeding disorders and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), a potentially fatal condition involving the system. There is the possibility that immune stimulation by vaccines or any other cause might worsen pre-existing heart disease. A possible case of dystonia has been reported; a woman noted flu-like symptoms starting ten days after influenza vaccination, followed by difficulties with movement and speech. This disorder is extremely rare, since over the past eighteen years there have been only 5 cases that might have been associated with influenza vaccinations. According to the CDC, due to the very low numbers of cases, the disorder is poorly-understood and there is no evidence either for or against it being caused by the vaccinations The Dystonia Medical Research Foundation have stated that it is unlikely that the symptoms in this case are actually dystonia and say that there has "never been a validated case of dystonia resulting from a flu shot".

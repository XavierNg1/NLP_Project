 How to present your fish is up to you, so follow your own instincts. For bite-sized pieces, slice your fillets up into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces.But if you’d rather serve your fillets whole, go right ahead and skip this step., First, in one shallow dish, combine the flour, paprika, thyme, and half a teaspoon of your pepper. Then break your egg in a second shallow dish and whisk in the buttermilk until they’re evenly mixed. Finally, pour your ground quinoa into a third dish., With each piece of fish, dredge in the flour mixture first until all sides are covered. Give it a shake to get rid of the excess. Then dunk it into the egg mix. Next, dredge it through the quinoa, adding pressure as you do so to ensure the quinoa sticks to it. Place it on your baking sheet once finished.

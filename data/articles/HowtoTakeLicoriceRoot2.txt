 Store-bought herbal teas, especially those blended to help soothe cold symptoms, often include licorice root. While other ingredients, such as echinacea and goldenseal also help disinfect and heal a sore or irritated throat, licorice root and slippery elm are some of the best herbs for this particular purpose., Aside from soothing your throat, tea with licorice root can help treat other symptoms of a cold or upper respiratory infection as well. Licorice acts as an expectorant, and can help your body expel the extra phlegm it produces when you have a cold.Licorice root may also help reduce inflammation in your bronchial tubes, helping you breathe more clearly.
 You can make your own tea using only licorice root for a more potent cold treatment, or to provide effects similar to that of taking a “whole” licorice root supplement for adrenal support. Use half an ounce of dried licorice root for every cup of water. Bring the mixture to a bowl and then simmer for 10 minutes.Allow the tea to rest in the pan for five minutes with the heat off.
Slices of dried root and chopped root are available at herb stores and online. The best way to measure dried or chopped root is by weight.
Include a cinnamon stick and few slices of ginger if you’re making tea to treat a sore throat or a cough.
Children under 50 pounds (23 kg) should not be given licorice root tea.
For children over 50 pounds (23 kg), provide ⅓ cup up to three times a day.
As an adult, limit yourself to two cups per day.

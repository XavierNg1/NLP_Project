 Does this bird just mope around or is it tweeting happily? A healthy bird looks wide awake and moves around. A bird that looks strangely sleepy is definitely way too ill to be taken home and will cost lots of money to help cure.;
, If you haven't yet seen the bird eat, make sure you do. This is important because birds generally eat quite a lot. It's best to look around and choose the bird that seems to have the best appetite. This may include waiting for several minutes to examine the birds.
 If you select a bird that has not yet been fully weaned then this could lead to many health risks when bringing it home. And if you cannot determine the age then just make sure the bird has all its feathers. This is an important role in the health of the bird.
 Especially the birds. If the bird cages are unclean, smelly, and don't have enough/appropriate food and lining on the bottom, then most likely all the birds are sick.
 Is there any fluids or discharge dripping from them? Does it have trouble fully opening it's eyes? These are definite signs that the bird is not healthy. Inspect how clean the feathers are. Dirty feathers mean that the bird probably can't preen itself.
 The birds shouldn't be making any odd noises while breathing, so be sure to ask the salespeople about the breathing.
 Let it perch on your finger and stroke it gently. If it reacts well, then you're in luck!

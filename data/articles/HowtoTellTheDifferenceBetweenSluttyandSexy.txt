 Revealing clothing includes: micro mini skirts, very short shorts, low cut tops, backless tops, long skirts with thigh high slits and crop tops. Not wearing any of these together is suggested. Pop stars and film stars are frequently seen in sexy revealing outfits though so only follow this rule if you think it is relevant.;
, If you said "hot" then you may need to change your outfit. There is a subtle difference between beautiful and hot that many people can detect which, ultimately, influences the perception of "trashy" and "sexy."

, So if you skip the drama and quit acting spoiled and mean you shouldn't have problems with cute booty jeans and a cute top. You can be proud to be a slut if you wish. It's only other people who are defining your actions as slutty. Many people who bandy around the term slut have a very narrow minded, misogynistic definition of the term.
 Dressing in a trashy manner often sends messages of insecurity and actually displays a lack of self confidence. Remember this when dressing yourself, if you think it's relevant.

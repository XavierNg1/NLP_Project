 Don't go too expensive, you really don't need to, just make sure it's good and durable and your feet are comfortable. A running Shoe that you can forget you are wearing because of comfort is a good shoe. Get a water bottle or something you can keep on you easily to drink water.;
, Small Goals first. Not "I wanna run a marathon". That's all good and well buddy, but start with "I'm gonna run a mile first". It's best if you pick a spot that is a moderate distance at first. You want to push your self and make sure you give your body a good challenge as you run to and from the spot.
 Hydrate, make a play list on your Music player that will be good to run too, think positive thoughts, and eat a light but high energy giving meal, and warm up those muscles then stretch them. We don't want to pull something do we? 

, Just get out and do it! Run to that point! Don't stop, the more you push your self the better you will be. If you get tired and slow down. It's OK! As long as you try to keep going as fast as you have energy for, you will be working on your run, just don't stop!

, Ignore it! Seriously its no big deal and will go away if you just keep running, how long it takes will depend on the person, but it eventually goes away with practice and pushing your self past it.
 This is important as you do not want to dehydrate, sip your water, don't down half the bottle.
 Jog a bit in a circle or a short distance as you slow down after you are done, stand up and keep your head up and back straight to help your lungs to expand. Stand tall good friend, you just ran farther then you have before! 

, Keep at it and increase your distance as you feel the run get easier to do. "I my self went from being able to only run a block to being able to run 8 miles (13 km) nonstop." Just repeat the above steps and increase your distance every so often and you will make your self a better runner.

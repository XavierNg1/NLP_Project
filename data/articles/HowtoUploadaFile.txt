 There are many websites designed for this purpose and no one is best for all users and all files. In deciding which one to use consider:


What type of files will they accept. For example, most sites don't allow porn, while others specialize in it.
Almost all have maximum file sizes.
Do they have enough bandwidth?
How much do they charge for the service? Most are free, but watch out for advertising.
How long will they keep uploaded files?
Is their privacy policy acceptable?;

 Whether you are struggling to strike up the nerve to ask a guy for his number or you missed your window of opportunity to do so, consider asking a mutual friend for his number. When you contact the guy, tell him where you met and who gave you his number.If your friend asks you to explain why you would like the number, don’t be alarmed—it is normal for people to be protective of their own or their friend’s privacy. Provide your friend with a reasonable explanation, such as “I think he is cute,” “I want to get to know him better,” “he left before I could ask him myself,” or “I need it to invite him to a party.”

, Sometimes, it is necessary to create opportunities to exchange numbers with a cute guy. Potential opportunities include:


Asking him to study. After you express interest in reviewing for a test or exam with him, ask to exchange numbers so you can plan a study session.Making plans. Casually invite him to hang out with a group of friends or ask if he would be interested in doing an activity that just the two of you enjoy. If he expresses interest in spending more time with you, whether in a group setting or one-on-one, ask to exchange numbers so you can text or call him to hang out., If the opportunity arises for you to have access to his phone, take advantage of it. Ask to use his phone to make an call or send a text. When he gives you his phone, ring or text yourself. Save his contract information in your phone.You could also ask to use his phone to help locate your “lost” phone. As you search for your phone, have him dial your number or text you. Once you find your cell, you can save his contact information.
Never steal someone’s phone. Always ask for permission.

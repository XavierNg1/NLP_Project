 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you’ve logged out of your previous session, you will need to log in again. Enter your Facebook account and password on the fields provided then tap on “Log in.”


You will be taken to the News Feed.
 From the header toolbar, tap on the icon of three horizontal bars to bring out a menu. Swipe up to see the bottom of the menu, and tap on “News Feed Settings” from here.
 The list of friends you have on Facebook will be displayed.
 By default, you are following all of your friends, that’s why you can see their posts on your News Feed. If you don’t want to see posts from a particular friend, tap on the “Following” button beside his name. You’ve now unfollowed him and you won’t see any more posts from him. Don’t worry, you’re still friends on Facebook.

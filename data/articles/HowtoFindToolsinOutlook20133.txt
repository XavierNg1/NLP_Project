 If you can't get used to finding what you need in Outlooks various tabs, you can download and install a Classic Menu plugin that adds the old menus back to Outlook and your other Office programs. The plugin isn't free, but has a trial period so you can decide if you like it.


You can get the plugin from addintools.com.
 Download the trial and follow the prompts to install it. You will need to close any open Office programs.
 Once the plugin is installed, you can start up Outlook or any other Office program and click the Menus tab. All of your familiar menus will be found along the top of the tab.

 Ninjas don't always dress like Hollywood ninjas, though. Loose dark slacks and shirt, dull-earthy colors such as charcoal gray, hooded and belted. Be prepared for inquiring looks when walking down the hall, if you so choose this form of clothing.;
, Speak softly, but with intensity and depth. Nod at remarks. Chuckle at insults, and say "Ah so!" -- not "So?"

, Use concealment behind stuff (like lockers, trash cans, etc.) and observe people. This will increase your level of slyness.
 If you can walk/run through crowds as if an empty hall, you will naturally start walking more sly, and this helps you walk more silently, thus helping you be unnoticed.
 If you don't feel the ninja, the ninja can't feel you.
 Have your friends do this process with you so you guys can help each other and challenge each other.
 Oh, and start to build your perspective of a ninja.
 In doing this, your ninja skills and the respect your peers have for a true ninja will grow.
 (NOTE:Don't bring this to school, or you will be severely punished.)

, Any person who can do this will be able to escape many adversaries. Also don't do this near teachers.
 If you work at being a ninja for a few weeks and see how things go, then it will not be too late to try something else.

 As a rule of thumb: the darker the chocolate, the healthier it is. This is because dark chocolate contains a higher percentage of cocoa, which is where the health benefits of chocolate come from. Further, a higher percentage of cocoa means less of the unhealthy ingredients that are often included in low-cocoa chocolate bars.Look for a dark chocolate that is at least 70% cocoa. Chocolate with this percentage of cocoa is usually considered bitter-sweet.
The higher the percentage of cocoa, the more bitter the chocolate will be.
You can also purchase 100% cocoa nibs, though they are especially bitter and not usually eaten on their own.;
, Chocolate bars with a lower percentage of cocoa often include larger amounts of unhealthy ingredients. Milk and refined sugar are the most common, while some chocolate candies also include high-fructose corn syrup.In general, avoid eating chocolate candy bars with long lists of ingredients.
 Cocoa is often extensively processed in order to reduce the bitter flavor it yields in its raw form. Unfortunately, this processing also removes the flavanols. In short, different types of processing, including fermentation, alkalizing, and roasting all reduce the health benefits offered by cocoa.Note that most commercial chocolates are heavily processed. Even many dark chocolate bars are made with cocoa that has been highly processed, and will not offer as many health benefits as bars made with raw cocoa.
Often, local, artisan chocolate makers are the best place to find the healthiest chocolate.
If you’re at the store, opt for an organic, fair-trade dark chocolate.
 The good news: it’s true that eating chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa can bolster your vascular health. The bad news: it’s not healthy to eat the sort of chocolate foods that contains a lot of sugar and fat, including milk chocolate and most chocolate foods generally.As a rule of thumb, keep portions of chocolate to a few small bites.

 During ignition and cooking, always remain with a barbecue. If you need to leave it, have a guest watch over it in your absence. A barbecue should never be left unattended; fat may catch on fire and spark outwards, a child might wander over and touch the hot elements or the food may burn.
 The right tools are barbecue tools. They have longer handles, longer tongs or tines and they enable you to move the food about with the least potential for harm to either yourself or the food by ensuring better grip and dexterity. Don't be stingy on this; the results of owning good barbecue tools will definitely outweigh any costs.

 Prepare and organise everything you'll need for it the night before. This includes clothes, documents, food and meeting preparation. This will prevent you rushing to get everything ready in the morning.;
, However, don't just put it right by your bed where you can just turn over and hit the snooze button when it goes off. Leave it on the other side of the room so that when it goes off, you'll have to get up to turn it off.
 Even if you think you can be in work on time if you wake up half an hour before you're due in, chances are your first attempt at toast will burn, your shower will break on you and your train will be cancelled. It's better to be safe than sorry so leave plenty of time for unforeseen circumstances.
 If you knew in advance that your bus or train was going to be delayed, but you overslept anyway, get a cab. The expense will be worth it when you don't lose your job for being late again.
 A good healthy breakfast in particular will help energize you, making you complete the journey to work faster and more efficiently.
 There's no point ordering a cab if you keep it waiting. There's also no point in knowing when your train leaves if you're not there and waiting when it pulls into the station. Sometimes trains leave a couple of minutes earlier than scheduled, so it's worth being on the platform early.
 Hopefully, it'll be a habit that helps you retain your job.

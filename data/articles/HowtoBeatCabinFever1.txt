 When it's just too cold to go outdoors, make the inside of your house into a playground! Use couch cushions to make a “wrestle room;” outline an obstacle course using chairs, tables, and other household items; or use foam basketballs or footballs to simulate sports games inside. Getting your body moving is lots of fun and never fails to perk up your mood., Try a new craft such as creating a family scrapbook. Get everybody involved by picking out favorite family pictures. Create a special category page for each one. Write your favorite stories or memories, and then add some colorful stamps or stickers.
 Pick out favorite recipes from magazines, newspapers or books, Write down family favorites. Type them onto cards or cut them out and paste them into a scrapbook. Let other members of the households pick out some of their favorites and take a day to create the recipes. Create a warm and delicious smelling kitchen on a cold windy day.
 Gather some of your favorite board games, play charades or even your own version of win, lose or draw. Plant candy or trinkets around the house as prizes. Create a few teams and play games. Serve everybody's favorite snack and beverage.
 When all else fails, simply put on some funky tunes and shake it off. Dance those cabin fever blues away. You can even put together a “Banishing Cabin Fever” playlist with all your favorite songs to dance to, and save it for a gloomy, snowy day.

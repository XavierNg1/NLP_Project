 You'll find this tab in all versions of Excel since 2007, for both Windows and Mac.
 This will switch all formula cells to display the formulas instead of the results.


If you're using a Mac, click "Show" and then "Show Formulas."
You cannot show both the formula and the result in the same cell at the same time.
 Once your formulas are appearing in their cells, you can print your spreadsheet and they will be printed instead of the results.


You'll find the Print option in the Home tab or File menu, or you can press Ctrl+P (Windows) or âŒ˜ Command+P (Mac).
 Clicking the "Show Formulas" button again will switch your spreadsheet back to showing the formula results in each cell.

 For the sauteed ramps, you’ll need ½ pound (227 g) of ramps. To prepare them for cooking, use a sharp knife to cut off the roots. Next, run the ramps under cool water at the sink to remove any dirt or debris.To ensure that the ramps are dry, it’s a good idea to place them in a colander or sieve after you rinse them. Shake them well to remove any excess moisture.;
, When the ramps are trimmed and cleaned, use the knife to separate the white bulbs from the green leaves. Leave the bulbs in tact, but cut the leaves in half or thirds horizontally.If any of the leaves appear tough or overly large, discard them. They are usually too chewy even after sauteing.
If you notice any translucent skins, which are similar to those that you find on green onions or scallions, peel them away and discard.
 Place a nonstick skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of extra virgin olive oil, and allow it to heat until it begins to shimmer, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.If you prefer, you can substitute butter for the olive oil.
 When the oil is hot, add the white bulbs to the skillet. Allow them to cook for 2 minutes, or until they become translucent.Be sure to stir the bulbs occasionally to ensure that they cook evenly.
 Once the bulbs are translucent, add the ramp leaves to the skillet. Let them cook with the bulbs for another 2 minutes, or until the leaves begin to wilt.As with the bulbs, stir the leaves periodically as you saute them to ensure that they cook evenly.
 When the ramp bulbs and leaves are finished cooking, stir in some salt and pepper to taste to season them. Place them in a serving bowl, and serve as a side with your favorite main course.If you prefer, you can add other seasonings to the ramp, such as chili powder or cumin.
The sauteed ramps also make a delicious topping for sandwiches and pizza.

 The NON-FICTION are stories those that really happened with people who really existed. It is the same with the setting, occurrences. Every detail has been investigated properly, with reliable data and information. In short, it really happened. It's like being a detective, reporter, journalist or a blogger. Next, the Fiction. These are stories that are often created by the author with no sources and no evidence of existence. And lastly, the Half-Fictions. Half-Fictions are crime stories about something that really happened, but the characters (mostly the conversations) and the procedures regarding how the crime was committed is not really based on a definite source but simply just a theory. But I will just teach to you how to write Non-Fiction and Half-Fiction stories (For this is the title of this article).;
, First, choose a crime, make sure it is popular or significant.
 The killer, the victims, the concerned ones and resolvers. Gather every little bit data if you want your story to be more fascinating.
 (If you do this on your computer you can easily print it out as needed.).
, So make sure your title is appropriate with your theme.
(This is also called an outline.)

, The name(s) of the Protagonist(s) and Antagonist(s) must be real. You can add/edit names of some supporting characters but this is not recommended.
 Don't just work on it for a day. Write about it for a couple of days or even weeks for your mind to be always afresh.

 You should try not to fight ice, fairy, and other similar dragon-type Pokémon. Since Axew is a dragon-type Pokémon, it is generally weak against the latter Pokémon. It will take twice the damage it would normally get from other types.;
, You'll want to battle fire, grass, water, and electric types, for example. Axew is not immune to a particular type of Pokémon but will hold much better against these types.
 In the game, Axew evolves into Fraxure starting at level 38. There are no stones you can use to force Axew’s evolution. Your only way to make it evolve is by allowing it to gain experience through Pokémon battles.

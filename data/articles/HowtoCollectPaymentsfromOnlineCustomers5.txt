Â This module can be incorporated into your online website. Your customer can directly pay you on the website itself.


Agencies will charge for this service. Of late, the integration fees has vanished and only thing they charge are the transaction cost on percentage basis.
PayPal also provides this service. PayPal may be safer and convenient, of course the percentage charge may be slightly higher than the other agencies though. Do your homework before choosing the best agency for incorporating into your website.

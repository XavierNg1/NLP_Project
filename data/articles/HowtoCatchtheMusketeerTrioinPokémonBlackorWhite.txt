 To stand a chance of catching these Pokémon, you will need :


Pokémon of lv.50 or higher, with at least one knowing False Swipe. False Swipe can be obtained from Professor Juniper, as long as you have seen at least 30 Pokemon.
Several Revives, Potions and Ultra Balls, all of which can be obtained from any Pokémon Center
50-100 Dusk and Timer Balls for each Legendary. Both can be obtained from Opelucid Cities Poke-mart.
The HM's Strength and Fly.;
, Before you can catch Terrakion or Virizion, you'll need to capture Cobalion. To catch him, on Route 7, near Chargestone Cave, surf to Mistralton Cave.
 When at the top, an old man will explain the legend behind Cobalion. Walk on, and you will see Cobalion. Walk up to him and speak to him to battle him.
 If you catch him, great! If you defeat him, great! If he defeats you, it doesn't matter, you'll see him again soon. Now the other two will appear.
 It would be easier to Fly to the Pokémon League, then head into the cave at the top. Take a left once inside.
 Go in, and you will find Terrakion. Fight him.
 Even if you made Terrakion and Cobalion faint, you can capture Virizion. To do this, go to Pinwheel Forest.
 Well done! You've seen them!

, When trying to catch them, whittle down their health with any type, just not four time effective moves as they will usually kill before you can get the health bar down to yellow. Once the health is in yellow, use false swipe to get down to one health. Once their health is at one, use forty Dusk Balls, as they have max effectiveness, until turn 41ish, when Timer Balls gain a better chance.

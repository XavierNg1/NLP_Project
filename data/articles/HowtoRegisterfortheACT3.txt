 If you miss the regular registration periods, you can register for standby testing. You must have a standby ticket before the test date to be allowed into the testing center. This does not guarantee you a seat, but you need a ticket to have any chance to take the test that day.The standby request period ends about a week before the test date.
There will be extra fees for standby registration.
 You must choose a specific testing center when you register as a standby test taker. Choosing one of the larger testing locations will give you a better chance of being admitted, as it is more likely to have room for you.
 Testing spots are given on a first-come first-serve basis, so you should get there early to ensure that test materials, seats, and staff are available. You might not be admitted otherwise. Arriving early, however, increases your chance at a spot.If you are not admitted to the test center, the ACT will refund the fees paid for your standby registration.

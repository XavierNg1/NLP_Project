 What are you using to connect? What kind of computer are you using? Are you using a phone or mp3 player (such as an iPod Touch)? Research your device and look at specific instructions.


What to do for most computers. The vast majority of laptops nowadays come with built in Wifi adapters. In most cases, these will connect to networks automatically, or open a window and prompt you to select a network from a list.
Macbooks. If you have a Macbook, or any other type of Mac (with Wifi capabilities), then there should be a Wifi icon in the top right hand corner of your desktop. Click that and a list of networks will come up.
Windows. On a Windows computer, the Windows wireless client will automatically show up. If it doesn't, search for a free one online. The trial version of the T-Mobile network client is excellent, and if your trial runs out, you can simply re-download it on another computer and transfer it via flash drive.;
, For any other type of device (or an OS such as Linux), read any available manuals, or search for things online or on YouTube.

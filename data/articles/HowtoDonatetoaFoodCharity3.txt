 There are many ways you can choose to donate money. You can simply make a one-time gift, or you can choose to automatically donate from your bank account monthly. It’s also possible to donate money in someone else's memory or honor. This can be a lovely gift or way of preserving someone’s memory.
 You may want to set a goal of how much money you want to donate. You can ask friends or family to match the amount you’re giving, or to simply contribute if they’re moved to.You can ask your local charity if they have something specific they are seeking funding for. For example, if they need $500 to fund their summer lunch program for kids, you could set a personal goal of raising $500.
 Unlike donating food, money can be donated worldwide. You may want to donate to a local charity, or to one that provides food in a foreign country.Do some research before choosing a charity. Sometimes people are dismayed to find out that the $50 they donated didn’t turn into $50 worth of food, but rather to helping pay a staff member’s salary. If it’s important to you that you are donating to a volunteer-run organization, check for that before donating.
If there is something specific that you want your money to go to, ask someone at the charity if that is possible.
 If you’re donating to a local food charity, you can likely stop in during business hours and write a check. However, most larger charities are setup to receive monetary donations online., If the charity is registered as a non-profit organization, your donation is tax-deductible. Save your receipt to be able to write this donation off at the end of the year when you do your taxes.

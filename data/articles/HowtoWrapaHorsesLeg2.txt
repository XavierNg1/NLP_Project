 Choose a strong bandage, such as a quilt bandage or a polo bandage with Velcro. Make sure it’s clean.


Stretchy bandaging can be helpful, but make sure that you don’t pull it too tight as you wrap.
 You should always apply at least 1” of clean padding before wrapping the leg with a bandage.Make sure the padding is applied in even, smooth layers. Wrinkles can cause pressure points that can cause injury., Wrap clockwise on the right legs and counterclockwise on the left legs.


Don’t wrap the bandage too tightly. This can cause pressure points or injury to your horse’s tendons.
Don’t wrap the bandage too loosely. Loose bandages may fall off or cause your horse to get tangled up.
Don’t place the bandage over joints., Start by wrapping the leg top to bottom. Then wrap up the leg, covering the first bandages.Overlap each wrap of the bandage by about half., Exert just enough pull to stretch the fabric to half its maximum extended length.


Check your bandaging a few times as you wrap. You should be able to get two fingers under the bottom of the bandage and one under the top.Don’t leave any lumps or ridges underneath the bandage.
 An adhesive bandage can be helpful if dirt or debris tends to get underneath. You can also use bandage pins.Secure the wrap with masking tape or duct tape if needed. This can be helpful for bandages that will stay on for a while, such as standing or shipping bandages.
 Wait at least 15 minutes after bandaging the leg before doing the following:


Leaving the horse in the stall.
Riding.
Grazing.

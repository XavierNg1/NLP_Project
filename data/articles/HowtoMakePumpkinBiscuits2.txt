 Lightly coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray or butter and set it aside.
 Stir everything together briskly until they are evenly combined. If you'd like a hint of flavor, you can add 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as well.
 You can do this using two knives or a pastry blender. Do not over-mix, or your biscuits will be tough instead of light and fluffy.
 If you are using canned pumpkin, make sure that you are using the plain, unsweetened kind. Do not use the "pumpkin pie" kind; it has too many added ingredients which may affect the recipe.
 Don't worry about kneading it just yet; you will be doing that in the next step.
 Add some flour to the surface of the dough to prevent it from sticking to your fingers. Do not over-knead the dough or your biscuits won't be as fluffy.
 If you need to, use extra flour to prevent sticking. You can also roll the dough out instead using a rolling pin., If you don't have a cookie cutter like that, you can use a 2-inch (5.08 centimeters) wide glass instead. When you run out of dough to cut, ball it up and pat it out again into another 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) thick sheet. Keep cutting, balling, and patting the dough until you've used it all up.
 Make sure that they are at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart so that they don't smoosh together when baking. If you don't have enough room on your baking sheet, set the biscuits aside. You can bake them in a separate batch.
 If you have any leftover biscuits, you can bake them now.
 They go great with melted butter, honey, or pumpkin butter!

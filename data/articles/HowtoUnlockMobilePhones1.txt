 If you meet your carrier's requirements, you may be able to unlock your phone for free.
 The requirements for unlocking vary from carrier to carrier, but generally you will need to have been with them for a set amount of time (usually at least 3-6 months), and the phone will need to have been completely paid off.

You may be charged an early termination fee if you haven't paid off the phone's full cost yet.
 You will either be given your unlock code over the phone, or it will be emailed to you., You will need to have the SIM card from your new carrier inserted in order to receive the prompt to enter your code.

The location of the SIM card slot varies, but it is usually behind the battery or in a tray along the side of the phone. You may need a small paperclip to eject the tray.
 When you power your phone on with the new SIM card, you will be prompted for your unlock code. Make sure to enter the code correctly, as entering the incorrect code too many times may lock you out of your phone.

Make sure that you are within the coverage area of your new service when unlocking the device.

 The amount of vinegar that you need will depend on how big your shower head is. You need just enough vinegar to cover the end of the shower head where the water sprays out.








You can use any plastic bag, but a storage bag is more likely to be leak-proof.
Clean your shower head once a month to keep your water flowing well and to prevent mildew.
 Make sure that your shower head is submerged in the vinegar. If you need to, remove the bag and add more vinegar to cover the spray area.
 Place your rubber band above the shower head so that the bag stays in place while allowing the shower head to fully soak in the vinegar.








If you donâ€™t have a rubber band, you can tie off your bag with anything that will hold it in place.
 Let your shower head soak in the vinegar overnight. In the morning, pour the vinegar down the drain and throw away or recycle the bag.
 Turn on your shower and make sure that the shower head is spraying at full capacity. Wait a minute before getting in the shower to ensure that the vinegar is fully washed away.

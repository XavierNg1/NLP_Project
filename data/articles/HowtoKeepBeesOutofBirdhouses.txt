 The sensible thing is for the bees to be first eliminated by dusting with Permethrin powder propelled at high pressure.  ;
, Once the removal is done, and the bees have died off safely, take down the box, and either clean it with boiling water or some solvents. , It's a good idea to leave the insides exposed to the sun for a while.,, If possible, paint the inside of the box with an oil-based paint so the odour masks the bee scent., Before returning the box, ensure that you cut a second large hole in the back of the box so there is less chance that the bees can control the air flow inside the box. This will not affect birds or possums, but it will certainly make the box less appealing to bees., If you do want to put the box back, ensure that you have removed all trace of the previous infestation.

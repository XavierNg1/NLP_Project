 To start, cross the left lace over the right lace. Wrap this left lace around the right lace and pull tight to complete a basic starting knot.;
, Bend the left lace in half, forming a loop, and pinch the bottom of the loop together with your fingers. Repeat the same thing with the right lace and hold that loop secure with your other hand.


Hold the two loops side by side for the moment.
Quickly gauge the approximate size of each loop. They do not need to be perfectly even, but the two loops or “bunny ears” should be roughly equal in size.
 Fold the left loop over and around the right loop, and then gently pull it through the hole that forms between the two loops. Do not tighten yet.
 Bend the right loop forward so that it crosses under the left loop and the entire knot structure. Feed this loop through the same middle hole that you just fed the left loop through.


This can be done simultaneously with or immediately after taking care of the left loop. Note, however, that the left loop will need to be folded over before you begin working with this right loop. Otherwise, the middle hole you need to push the right loop through will not be created yet.
After pulling the right loop through the center hole, the two lace loops should be about the same size again.
 Pull the right loop to the right and the left loop to the left to tighten the knot. Use even pressure on both laces to form an even, tidy bow.


As long as you apply enough pressure and tighten the knots thoroughly, they should not come undone, even with slippery leather laces.
You might have to push the knot together a little as you tighten it.

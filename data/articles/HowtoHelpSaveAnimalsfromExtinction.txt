 More people means more ideas, more fun, and more help.;
, Think about everything-and by everything, even the dumb ideas. Then go through the ideas and weed out the not-so-good plans and tack upon some really great ideas.
 Remember, a truly polished plan has been revised and rewritten dozens of times.


Be sure there are no loopholes.
Be sure it makes sense. For example, storming the Royal Castle in England and holding the Queen hostage is not a good plan.
 If you decided to write a letter to the President, then you'd want to back it up with facts, right?

, If you need more help with your plan, then look below. If not, then move on to Part 3.
 A thousand voices are more powerful than just one.
 Be sure to appear knowledgeable and respectful if you're writing to someone important.
 Hand out booklets about your cause. Put up notices on your local bulletin board. Hold fundraisers and raffles. Make sure everybody knows about the tigers in Bengal!

, Explain your cause in detail and have a place where people can donate money.
, Try selling things for the money.
 Hold a fundraiser for one or more endangered species of animal. Call the money in to a zoo, whichever one is closest to you. This will make the conservationists interested, and they will probably want to have a meeting with you, during which you can plan more operations to help endangered animals.
 This step will vary depending on what your plan is.



You may need to try again with a different plan.
 There are many who want to save endangered animals, but few who can actually achieve that. People will take you seriously if you keep up a constant campaign.

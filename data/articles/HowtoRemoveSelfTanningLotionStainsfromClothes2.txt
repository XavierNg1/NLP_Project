 If your stain is still visible, you will want to use a more potent cleaner than just water. Use a small bowl and pour equal amounts of dishwashing liquid and water. You only will need a small amount, though the amount also depends on the size of the stain. You can also use a commercial stain remover. Make sure that you can use this remover with whatever fabric you are treating.
 This will help to prevent the stain from spreading to the back of the garment. Make sure to do this if your stain is fresh. If you have already eliminated most of the stain by this point, it may not be necessary.
 Take your fingertip and dip it into the detergent solution. Gently massage the solution into the stain. Make sure to use the pad of your finger, and to not press too hard. Work the solution into the garment using circular motions. Don’t use your fingernail to scratch at the garment. This could make the stain set and also damage the fibers of the material.
 Take cool water and rinse the detergent solution off the stain. You should notice that the stain is gone or is lighter than before you began treating it. Stop rinsing once the detergent has come off the shirt.
 Keep going through the process of dabbing the solution on the shirt until the stain is gone or until you’ve reached a point where the stain is not improving. , After you have removed the stain, put your garment in the washing machine and launder as usual. If the stain hasn’t been fully removed, don’t put the garment in the dryer: let it air dry instead.

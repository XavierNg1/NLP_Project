 For this method, your number should include decimals. For example, 4.8125 pounds or 0.25 pounds.
 This number tells you how many whole pounds you have.


If you have 4.8125 pounds, 4 is left of the decimal point, so you'll underline the 4.
If you have a bigger number, as with 17.5 pounds, underline all of the digits before the decimal point. In this case, you'd underline 17.
If the number to the left of the decimal is zero, as with 0.25 pounds, your final answer will only include ounces. You can say "zero pounds" if you want, but it's implied if you just list the ounces.
 This should include all of the numbers that you didn't underline in the last step. In other words, it's all the numbers to the right of the decimal point.


For 4.8125 pounds, the tenths are 0.8125.
For 17.5 pounds, the tenths are 0.5.
For 0.25 pounds, the tenths are 0.25

, First, you need to know that there are 16 ounces in every pound. So your equation will be 16 times the total tenths of a pound, which is the number you identified in the previous step., If the answer has decimal places, you can round it to the nearest whole number. Generally, you round down if the decimal is .4 or lower, and round up if the decimal is .5 or higher.16 x 0.8125 pounds = 13 ounces
16 x 0.437 pounds = 6.992 ounces. We can round that to 7 ounces, because 0.9 is higher than 0.5, so we round up.
16 x 0.7 pounds = 11.2 ounces. We can round 11.2 to 11 ounces, because 0.2 is lower than 0.4, so we round down.
 Generally, the larger measure is listed first, so you'll say pounds first, and then the ounces.


4.8125 pounds becomes 4 pounds, 13 ounces.
17.5 pounds becomes 17 pounds, 8 ounces.
0.25 pounds becomes 4 ounces.

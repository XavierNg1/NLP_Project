 You can make a shortcut to a website using any of your web browsers, including Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.
 You can create a shortcut for any part of any website, but sites that require logins will still require you to log in when you use the shortcut.
 This will reveal the entire address as well as the site's icon.
 You'll see the icon and the site address drag with your mouse cursor. Make sure to click and drag the icon, not the address itself.
 This will create a shortcut to the website. The shortcut will have teh same name as the website's title.
 This will open the website in your default web browser.

 Many essential oils have overlapping therapeutic uses. If one is not working for you, try another that’s designated for the same purpose but might have slightly different active ingredients.For instance, if you’ve been using bergamot oil to lift your mood and alleviate depression, you might try using camomile instead.
Keep in mind that the quality of your essential oil might also play a role in its effectiveness, so you might just want to try a different brand. The plant content, production process, and packaging can all affect quality. In general, quality products will list the scientific name and origin of the plant, include a statement of purity, and not be offered at a significantly discounted price., If topical solutions are not having the desired effect(s), try an inhalation patch instead to see if it makes a difference. If you are having adverse side-effects from a particular delivery method, switch to one that will minimize them.
 You can do this either by altering the amount of essential oil used or the duration of your exposure to it.


For instance, if you’re using a topical application with a 1% concentration of essential oil, you might consider increasing the concentration to 3% if the lower dose is having no effect.
If you’re using a steam bath to inhale oil vapors, you might consider switching to a diffuser or inhalation patch that will release those vapors more slowly over a longer period of time.

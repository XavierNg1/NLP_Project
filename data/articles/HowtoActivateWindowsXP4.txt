 Windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft, and it is highly recommended that you switch to a more recent version of Windows. This will ensure that you have access to the latest security patches. Windows XP won't be getting any more updates.
 If you don't want to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, you may still want to consider purchasing a valid key. There are many key resellers available online. If you have purchased Windows XP in the past but can't find your key, Microsoft may be able to retrieve it for you if you contact customer support., If you have a Windows XP key that won't work, contact Microsoft before bypassing the activation. There's a good chance that the support rep will be able to get your key working and your computer activated.
 This will open the Registry Editor, which will allow you to bypass Windows XP activation. This is only recommended as a last resort option. You won't be able to use Windows Update if your copy of Windows isn't activated.
 Use the tree on the left side of the Registry Editor to open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE → SOFTWARE → Microsoft → Windows NT → CurrentVersion (or "Current Version") → WPAEvents.
 This will open a new window.

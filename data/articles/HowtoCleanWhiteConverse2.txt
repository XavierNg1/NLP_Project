 Usually, scrubbing scuff marks with a sponge soaked with soapy water will do the trick.

Use a mild soap, such as hand soap or a liquid dish detergent with no added fragrances or chemicals. Mix a few drops into a cup of warm water and stir until bubbles form on the surface.
When scrubbing the scuff mark, rub the shoe with your sponge using firm, circular motions.
 Spray a little WD-40 directly on the scuff marks and buff the marks away with a sponge or rag.

Among other things, WD-40 is often used to extract moisture and clean off dirt and residue from a range of surfaces. Only use it on the rubber part of the shoe, however, and not the canvas. As an oil-based product, WD-40 can leave stains on material like canvas.
 Soak a cotton ball or cotton pad in a little acetone nail polish remover and scrub the scuff marks with the remover until cleaned.

Vigorously rub the mark with the nail polish remover to get rid of it. The scuff mark should fade in appearance almost instantly.
An acetone-based nail polish remover works best.
 Dilute a small amount of bleach with water. Dunk a clean toothbrush into this bleach mixture and use it to scrub out the scuff marks.

Bleach is a known whitener, but it is also a harsh chemical. As such, you should only use just as much as you need to avoid damaging your shoes. You should also only use it on the rubber portion of the shoe and not on the canvas part.
 Apply the toothpaste directly to the scuff mark and scrub at it with a toothbrush.

A toothpaste with baking soda in it is preferable to any other. Baking soda has additional benefits as a cleanser, and as a mild abrasive, it can strip away the stain causing the scuff mark.
If you cannot find a baking soda toothpaste, though, another toothpaste with a whitening agent in it can also work.
 Cut a lemon in half and directly apply the cut side of one half to the scuff marks on your shoe. Scrub vigorously to remove the mark.

Lemon juice is often used as a natural alternative to bleach.
Leave the lemon juice on the scuff mark for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing it off with cool, plain water.
If you do not have whole lemons, you could also scrub the spot with a little lemon juice and a toothbrush or rag.
 Rub petroleum jelly on the scuff mark. Let it sit for five minutes before wiping it away with a damp rag.

Petroleum jelly can cling to the dirty particles of scuffed up material and lift away the debris.
Keep the petroleum jelly on the rubber portion of the shoe and avoid the canvas part, if possible. The oil in petroleum jelly can sometimes leave a light stain of its own on fabric.
 Apply the rubbing alcohol to the scuff marks with a cotton ball or cotton pad. Scrub well, and clean any remaining alcohol off with a damp rag when done.

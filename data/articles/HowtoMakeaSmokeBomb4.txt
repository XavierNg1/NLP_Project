 You can purchase these at any drugstore. They contain ammonium nitrate, which can be used to make a smoke bomb. Remove the water bag inside.


Wear gloves when you handle the granules. Ammonium Nitrate is not incredibly toxic if you happen to ingest any, but try not too. If it gets on your skin, wipe it off, and take a shower as soon as you can. Always wash your hands a couple times after you are finished.
, Stir until the granules have just dissolved. If you add too much water, you will end up with bombs that don't smoke.
 Make sure you use an older one. Brand new newspapers have a waxy film that prevents them from lighting properly.
, Put each one into the water, and swish them around, submerging each one into the liquid for about 30 seconds.
 Do this gently, as the sheets will tear easily.
 Driveway surfaces are fine to use as a drying space. If you are in a shady windy area, lay the newspaper sheets out and put rocks/weights on the four corners of each sheet to prevent them from flying away. You can tell when they are ready when they and can be lifted off of the pavement easily.
 Secure them with a string in the middle. Do not tie them too tight.


You can cut up the newspaper sheets, rip them in half, or leave them whole before rolling them up. You choose. Experiment with different lengths and widths.
 There is nothing like the jolt of energy you get when your smoke bomb produces thick plumes of white smoke.


If you don't get your bombs to work the first time, don't be discouraged. Try again using less water.

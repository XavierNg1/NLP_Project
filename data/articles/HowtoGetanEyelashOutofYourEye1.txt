 This is the easiest and fastest method of removing an eyelash. Splashing your eyes with water can cause the eyelash to simply be rinsed out with the water. Mineral and bottled water is ideal as it's more sterile than tap water. You can use tap water if you don't have mineral or bottled available.


Cup your hands, catch some water in them, and splash into open eyes. It is okay to blink when the water touches your eye. Repeat several times if necessary until the eyelash is gone.;
, This is another, slightly gentler way to rinse out the eyelash using water. Use mineral or bottled water if you have it.


Pour water into a large bowl. Slowly lower your face, with open eyes, into the water until the liquid touches your eyes. If you feel the urge to blink when your eyes touch the water, do so. All that matters is that the liquid touches your eye.
The eyelash should then wash out into the bowl. Repeat several times if necessary until the eyelash is gone.
 Saline, like mineral water, is more sterile than tap water and safer for the eye.Take an eyedropper and fill it with saline solution. While keeping your eyes open, pour a few drops directly into the open eye. Hopefully, the eyelash washes right out. Repeat if necessary.
Many saline solutions come in small bottles with a squirt head. If this is the case, you don't have to use an eyedropper. Simply lift the bottle and pour a few drops into your eye. Blink and if necessary, repeat several times until the eyelash is washed out.

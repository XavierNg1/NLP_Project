 If you can't find a small bowl, you can use a cup or teacup instead.
 You will need 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 2 teaspoons rice flour, and 3 tablespoons of plain yogurt.


If you can't find rice flour, try garbanzo flour or finely-ground oats.If you don't have yogurt, try using some milk, cream, or sour cream.If you decide to use milk or cream, start with 1 tablespoon and add more until you get a paste-like consistency.
 You want to end up with a paste-like consistency. If the mask is too thin and watery, add more flour. If the mask is too dry, add more yogurt.
 Turmeric powder is often used in dying fabric. It won't stain your skin, but it may stain your clothes. To keep this from happening, consider draping a towel across your shoulders and securing it with a clip.
 Dip your fingers into the mask, and spread it across your face. Try to avoid your lips, eyes, and eyebrows. Some of the ingredients in this mask are also used in hair removal.
 You may want to lie down or sit in a chair with your head tilted back so that the mask doesn't slide off your face.
 Lean over a sink, and splash your face with warm water. Gently massage your skin with your fingers until the mask is rinsed off. If there is any residue, you may need to use some face wash as well.
 The cool water will help seal and tighten the pores.

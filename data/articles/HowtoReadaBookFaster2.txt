 If you have trouble sitting still and concentrating on what you're reading, make notes or write down a brief outline. Write down any questions you might have about the content before you start reading.Writing things down can be especially helpful if you find yourself reading the same few sentences over and over again without being able to continue.
Reading aloud or whispering can help you pay greater attention to your book.
You can also move your fingers along with the text to help keep your place in the book and guide you along.
 This is your chance to think about something other than what you're reading. Move around, get a snack, watch a little television or whatever helps you mentally pause.


Set a time limit in advance and limit the number of rest breaks you take during a given period of time.
Doing something physical can re-energize you and make it easier to return to reading., In order to truly focus on concentrating, you need to do it a little every day. After a few days, you should notice some small improvements in your reading.Find a time of day that works best for you to read and try to read a little each day at that time. Soon, it will become a habit.
Don't try to remember every single detail when you're reading (for pleasure or for school). You'll become overwhelmed, which will make it difficult to continue.

 One way to see velvet is to use a light directly on your fish. The light will help you see the shimmer of gold or rust that this disease can produce on the scales. Your fish will exhibit other symptoms, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and rubbing or scratching himself against walls or items in the aquarium. He may also have clamped fins.This parasite can be prevented by adding aquarium salt and water conditioner to your tank on a regular basis.You need to add 1 teaspoon of aquarium salt for 2 1/2 gallons of water. You also need a drop of water conditioner per gallon, though always read the instructions that come with your water conditioner., This medication is the most effective against velvet because it has two agents in it that work against the disease. Add 12 drops per gallon of water.You can also use a medication called "Maracide".Continue treating until the fish doesn't exhibit symptoms anymore.
 You should still isolate the affected fish, but you should treat the original tank as well. This disease is very contagious.To isolate affect fish, you need to move them to a separate tank with clean water. You need to provide treatment to both tanks.

 Prepare the bib, cloths, high chair table, etc., as always.;
, This bath sheet should be labeled "Feeding Time". Lay the towel under your child's eating space, whether it is the high chair, the table or anywhere else. Adjust it to cover as widely as possible around the child. When the child drops food, it will fall on the bath sheet, rather than on the floor, collecting splats, crumbs, and all.
 If only dry matter has dropped onto it, you can hold the towel in a stork bundle until you get outside and shake the crumbs into the garden. If wet goo has landed on it, spin it through the next wash to remove the mess.
 It helps to be able to rotate them between dirty and washed. About three on hand usually does the job nicely. This also lets you dry the towels by air rather than having to crank up the dryer just for a towel every time.

 The TOD deed enables you to maintain full control of your property while you’re alive, but transfer it to your relative of choice when you die without going through probate.


As of 2015, 22 states and the District of Columbia offer TOD deeds, including Colorado, Illinois, Ohio and Virginia. Check with your county recorder’s office to learn if this option is available to you. If your reason for transferring your house to a family member is to avoid probate, a TOD deed may be a better solution for you because it allows you to maintain control of your house while you’re alive., A TOD deed looks like any other deed, but includes a statement that it doesn’t take effect until the owner’s death. Each state has particular requirements, so you might consider consulting a real estate attorney if you’re not confident in your ability to work through those requirements on your own.
 Check your state’s law to ensure you don’t need other witnesses. The family member to whom you’re transferring your property does not need to be present.
 After you’ve signed it, you must record it yourself at your county recorder’s office. Otherwise, no one will know it exists and it may never take effect.


You may change your mind at any time and make another deed. You retain all title and ownership in your property until you die.
Any mortgages or other liens on your property transfer automatically with a TOD deed. Like a quitclaim deed, you’re merely bequeathing your ownership interest in the property, whatever that may be.
When you die, your chosen family member may need to present an affidavit and death certificate to take control of the property, but it’s still a quicker and easier process than going through probate.

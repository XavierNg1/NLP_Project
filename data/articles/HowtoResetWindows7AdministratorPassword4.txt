 The Windows 7 Setup DVD is the disc you used to install Windows 7 (or the Windows install disc that came with your computer). You also may have burned a Setup DVD on an earlier date using the Windows USB/DVD tool.If you created a Windows 7 Setup flash drive at a previous time, you can use that in place of a DVD. If you don’t have either, you can borrow one or the other from a friend.
 When you see “Press any key to boot from CD or DVD" (or "Press F12 to select a boot device"), follow the on-screen instructions.
 Windows thinks it will be installing a brand new operating system, but you’ll really just be temporarily changing the name of a program called Sticky Keys.
 This will open the command prompt, where you’ll type the following commands:


Type copy d:\windows\system32\sethc.exe d:\ and then press ↵ Enter. If Windows is not installed on the D: drive, use the drive letter where Windows is located (such as E: or F:). You’ll know if it’s the wrong drive if you see the message “The system cannot find the specified path.”
Type copy /y d:\windows\system32\cmd.exe d:\windows\system32\sethc.exe and press ↵ Enter. Again, if Windows is not installed on the D: drive, use the proper drive letter.
Type exit then press ↵ Enter.
 This will ensure that your computer doesn’t try to boot from the DVD or flash drive.
 Usually this action will launch the program Sticky Keys, but this time it will launch the command prompt. Type the following commands:


Type net user Administrator PASSWORD and press ↵ Enter. Replace “PASSWORD” with a new password for the Administrator account.
Type copy /y d:\sethc.exe d:\windows\system32\sethc.exe and press ↵ Enter. Replace d: with a different drive letter if necessary. This will rename the Sticky Keys program we modified earlier.
Type exit and then press ↵ Enter.
 You can now log in with the Administrator account.

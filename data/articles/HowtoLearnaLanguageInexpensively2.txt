 Learning a language is about both grammar and vocabulary. One tried and true method for learning vocabulary is using flashcards, available at any office supply store for a few dollars.


The glossary of your language book, or a basic dictionary or phrasebook, can provide the content for these flashcards. Write a word on one side and definition on the other. Use these to quiz yourself.
When you learn a word well enough that you get it every time, remove it from the stack and create a new pile. Review these every month or so, just to make sure you don't forget them., If paper flash cards are too much of a hassle, there are number of free phone apps and computer programs that basically do the same thing, quizzing you on words and sentences.


Duolingo and Memrise have a game-like feel that many people find appealing.Anki works just like flashcards, but automatically reduces the frequency of words as you show consistent mastery of them., A language dictionary or translation app like Google Translate or wordreference.com can also come in handy when trying to learn vocabulary. In your studies, when you come across a word you don't recognize, make sure to look it up!If you're using paper flashcards, you might make a flashcard to add to your stack after you look up a new word.
 If you are having trouble remembering words, try to pair mental images with the words, based on what they sound like.For example, the German word for poison is "gift." Poison obviously doesn't make a very good gift, but you could imagine a bottle of poison with a skull and crossbones on the label, tied up in red gift bow.
The Italian word for horse is "cavalo." This sounds a lot like "follow," so you might imagine a horse following you around your home as you get ready for work. This might seem time consuming, but once you come up with a mental picture that works, you'll be able to remember words quickly and easily.
The more vivid and interesting the image, the more likely you are to remember it.

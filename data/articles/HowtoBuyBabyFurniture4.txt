 When picking baby furniture, choose pieces that are made of quality materials and are built to last. While this is important for safety, it is also important if you plan to use the furniture for another child or to pass it to someone else., There are many pieces of baby furniture you can buy that your child can continue to use at various stages of their lives. By thinking long-term, youâ€™ll save yourself money and the trouble of purchasing new furniture later.

Buy a crib that converts into a toddler bed.
Purchase a changing table that can double as a dresser or bookshelf.
Find a dresser or chest of drawers that will be big enough to accommodate your child as a young adult., If you're planning to use some of your baby furniture for several years, pick items that will be just as appealing in five or ten years. When doing this, consider color, style, and finish.

Avoid adventurous styles. Instead, consider traditional furniture styles that have stood the test of time.
Focus on relatively neutral colors like white, grey, or stained wood. For example, while a bright pink dresser may seem cool for your baby girl, it may not work when your child is in elementary school.

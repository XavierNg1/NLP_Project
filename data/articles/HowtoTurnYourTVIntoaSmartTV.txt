 Most modern televisions come with HDMI ports: this is the easiest way to connect. But if yours is so old that you don't find a HDMI port on it, then look for a VGA port, and an audio port. Without a HDMI port, you will need both a VGA port as well as an audio port to turn your TV into a smart TV.;
, These days, you can even use a smart phone or a tablet PC. The goal is to look for a system that you can use to connect to the Internet.


Remember, your old TV doesn't have its own OS and web browser. It doesn't have the ability to connect to the Internet. Your old desktop or tablet PC will serve this function.
If you don't have a spare device sitting around, and you don't want to spend a lot of money buying a new computer, you can always buy a cheap tablet PC with HDMI output.
 If your computer or smart phone has HDMI output, connect the device to your TV using a standard HDMI cable. Note that for smaller devices, you may need to use a mini or micro HDMI adapter.


If your system does not have HDMI output, then you need a VGA monitor cable and an audio cable to connect to your TV. The VGA cable is to provide video output, and the audio cable is to provide sound output. The HDMI cable is capable of provide both sound and image output, so you need only one cable for this to work.
 Use the full-screen mode for best results. Your old TV has just become a smart TV!

, If it supports that, then you can buy devices such as Chrome Cast, Apple TV and many others.
 This will allow you to stream movies and surf the internet. This will take your old television experience to new level. All you have to do is connect device with TV by USB or HDMI cable and then you are all set to do the things which you can do with a smart TV.

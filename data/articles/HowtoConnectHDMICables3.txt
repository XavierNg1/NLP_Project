 An HDMI port resembles a thin, wide slot with a slightly tapered base. In addition to most Xbox 360s, all PlayStation 3s, PlayStation 4s, Wii Us, and Xbox Ones support HDMI by default. The Wii does not support HDMI, and the original model of Xbox 360 does not either.

If you don't see an HDMI port on the back of your console, it doesn't support HDMI.
Consoles like the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox don't support HDMI.
 The HDMI slot will typically be in the back of the console, on either the left side or the right side.
 It will fit into the HDMI slot on the back of your TV, though sometimes the HDMI slot faces parallel to the TV screen rather than away from it.

Make a note of the HDMI slot's input number while you're doing this.
 If your TV only has one HDMI input, simply switch to that input's number; otherwise, you will need to find the HDMI input that your console is connected to.


The HDMI slot on your TV will typically have a number beside it; that number the the input number for HDMI.
In most cases, you'll press Input on the remote to bring up the Input menu, then use the remote's arrows to navigate to the HDMI input number (e.g., "Input 3" or "HDMI 2").
If you can't find the input, turn on your console and switch through inputs until you see the console's screen.
 Most consoles will automatically detect the HDMI cable and attempt to configure the best settings, but you may need to go into the Video settings on your console and select "HDMI" as the input if you have multiple different cables.


If HDMI is the only input available, your console will select it by default.
You may be taken through a short setup process when you start the console up with HDMI for the first time.

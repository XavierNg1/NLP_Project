 How humans perceive color, and how we define it. While science can define and measure light down to the nanometer, what our eyes perceive is a complex mix of not just the hue, but the saturation and the lightness of the color as well. This is further complicated by how we perceive the same color against different backgrounds

Consider this simple example to illustrate color perception:





Do you see a bluish-green, a blue, a creamy yellow, a bright yellow, and a bright green?
Now look at the actual colors. There are only 3:





What we see is about where we see it influencing the actual values. To make things even more interesting, some people’s color perception is so different that we term this as“color blindness,” though it’s simply an imbalance in color perception.
 Any given color can be said to have three dimensions: hue, saturation, and lightness.


Hue refers to a color's position on the color wheel, yellow, orange, red, etc., plus all the intermediate colors such as red-orange and orange-yellow. Some examples: Pink's hue is magenta or red (or something between). Brown's hue is orange, because brown is dark orange.

Saturation is what gives you rich, bright colors, like those in the rainbow or on the color wheel. Pale colors (tints), dark colors (shades), and muted colors (tones) are less saturated.

Lightness indicates how close a color is to white or black, regardless of the color. If you took a B&W photo of your colors, this tells us which ones would be lighter or darker.

For example, bright yellow is a relatively light color. It’s lightness can be increased even more by adding white to make pale yellow.
Bright blue is naturally dark, low on the lightness scale, but dark blue is even lower.

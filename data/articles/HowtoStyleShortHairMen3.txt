 Place a dab of pomade in the palm of your hand, then rub your hands together until the product warms up. Evenly distribute it over hair, working it in from end to root.








Pomades work well for this type of style, but if you don't have pomade, you could try using any product that adds a moderate amount of texture to your hair.
 Draw a part on either the left or right side of your head using a standard comb.









The part should be positioned to the far edge of the crown.
 Using your fingers, arrange the hair at the top of your head into place. Draw the hair upward, back, and slightly off to the side in the direction opposite your part.









Work with the hair starting at the top side of your part. Continue arranging it in this manner until you reach the opposite side of the crown, at a point roughly mirroring the placement of your part.
 Use your palms to flatten the hair at the sides and back of your head while simultaneously directing the hair backward.









Start with the hair at the sides of your head and next to your face. Push it back, then continue moving your hands back to help guide the rest of the sides backward, too.
When you reach the back of the hair, direct it downward so that it flows naturally with the sides.
 Allow the hair to dry naturally instead of using a hair dryer.


If you used a strong enough hair product, the style should remain secure without additional work. Check on it periodically as it dries, however, and touch up any wayward locks while they're still damp.

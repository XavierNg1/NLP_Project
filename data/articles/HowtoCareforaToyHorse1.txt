 It can be a soft toy, a Schleich model or a Breyer model.;
, Some Breyer horses come with stables, but it's more fun to build your own. You can use old cardboard boxes or plastic containers.Building stables out of popsicle sticks and wooden boxes is an option too. You can decorate these however you want but make sure they're what you want for your toy.
 You can buy plastic fences and trees from craft shops. Another option is to use cardboard and make it into a fence.
 You may have a doll to ride your horse, but if you have a large stuffed toy you can 'ride' it yourself by sticking it between your legs. If your doll is riding it, then it is a good idea to build a mini arena.Breyer and Schleich also sell realistic riders and caretakers for their animals. You could also make a riding timetable if you have more than one horse.
 Fold ( to a size that fits your horse) and tape a plastic sack.
 This may sound gross but its more realistic. Pieces of brown paper scrunched up into balls would do perfectly.
 Three pieces of cardboard joined together to make three walls with two right angles would be excellent.
 Once again, cardboard will do the trick. Put 'bedding' (yellow wool cut into pieces) in the bedding room. Put 'hay' in the hay room. Hay can be darker yellow than straw. For feed and tack, see below.

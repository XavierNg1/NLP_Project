 If possible you can get the frames in the markets/shops, but you can also use an old frame (e.g. the frames of those photographs, which you're no longer using). Then, wipe down the frame with some cleaner and water.;
, Place the CD on the cardboard and trace around it. Put it wherever you want on the board, visualizing the end result. Cut out the rectangle you just drew. Cut on the inside of the line, you want this to be a tight fit.
 Now we have a plain piece of cardboard, and a dingy frame, let's do something about that. Go to a well ventilated area (in this case, an the alley out back) and paint the stuff. Light coats on the cardboard please? It's porous, so you don't want to soak it. Normal spray paint sets in about 15 minutes, so take your time.
 Now that your stuff is dry, it's time to set it up. If you have any little items you want in the frame aside from the CD, place it where you want it. You can glue it if you want to, but keep in mind, this makes it a tad more permanent. Since we used corrugated cardboard, the finished product has a little puff to it. Most items will stay where you put them, it's more of a personal preference.
 Now that the whole thing is set up, simply put it together. The hole we cut earlier holds the jewel case all on it's own. If you look at the case, it has a lip on the edges. Simply pop it in the hole. It holds itself in place! Just like a regular picture frame, fasten it back together, bending the tabs/staples back down. Use the pliers to make sure it's fastened tight.
 All that's left to do is just hang it up like a normal picture. The CD can change the balance on the frame, but just adjust it accordingly.

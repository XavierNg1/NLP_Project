 Running with your dog is a great way for you and your dog to get your daily exercise. Gradually increase the intensity and duration of the run over a few weeks. And be consistent; this means a daily, and not just a weekly, exercise routine. This will enable your dog (and you) to gradually build up its stamina.Before and after running, always warm up and cool down with a five-minute walk.
Dogs tend to run in bursts, so let your dog sniff around, take a bathroom break, and absorb the scenery while you run together.
Always run with your dog on a leash.
 Biking with your dog is a more serious and rigorous activity than running. Work up to biking by first running with your dog on a leash. Your dog will need to know the come, sit, and stay commands very well in order for you to bike with your dog.If your dog tends to chase squirrels or skateboards, then you may need to buy a special leash that attaches to your bike, like the Springer. If your dog pulls away, these devices absorb most of the force of sudden tugs.
 Exploring a new hiking trail will engage your dog’s body, as well as its mind. The new sights and sounds will provide mental stimulation, while the trail will provide physical stimulation. Choose a hiking trail that is appropriate for your dog’s stamina and skills.For more active breeds, choose a trail that requires climbing, like hills and inclines.
For breeds that are less active, choose a trail that is short (in duration) and flat.

 The first step to memorizing something is to read it as many times as possible. Read the quote once through completely to get a feel for its overall logic and meaning. Then slowly reread it word by word and, once every few words, take a moment to see the sentence written out in your mind’s eye., Softly say the quote out loud to yourself, and listen to each sentence’s rhythm. Try exaggerating the stressed syllables in each sentence, so the quote becomes a bit like a song.For example, say out loud, “so the QUOTE be-COMES a BIT like a SONG." Rhythm can help you remember a quote, but just keep in mind you won’t want to recite your quote in singsong fashion once you’ve memorized it.
 If you start by memorizing the quote’s key words, like nouns and important adjectives, you can fill in the conjunctions and prepositions intuitively. Try to internalize how each key word logically proceeds to the next.

For example, consider the Bertrand Russell quote, “The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.” Work on remembering how one key word leads to the next: whole problem -> world -> fools and fanatics -> certain -> wiser people -> doubts.
 If a quote includes any unfamiliar words, look up their definitions. As you read each clause, try to understand how each of the quote’s parts relate to one another. If you’re trying to remember a quote with an unfamiliar vocabulary or syntax, like a poem or Shakespeare passage, take the time to find out how its language works.Try asking an English teacher for help understanding a quote’s meaning or looking online for an interpretation.

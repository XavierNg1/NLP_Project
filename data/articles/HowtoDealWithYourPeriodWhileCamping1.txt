 While women's menstrual flows vary, select the most streamlined products that will work for you. You'll save space packing and generate a smaller volume of trash.Consider using non-applicator tampons. Non-applicator tampons take up far less storage space. Instead of a bulky applicator, the only extra waste involved is a small cellophane wrapper. Practice using this style of tampon prior to your trip so you feel confident using them.Recognize that if you're backpacking, you'll need to pack carefully and consider leaving an item or two of your usual gear at home to make room for sanitary supplies.Use unscented, unbleached products both to deter wildlife and to keep yourself healthy. Toxic shock syndrome and other infections can occur when chemicals used in manufacturing alter your body's natural pH.;
, Place unused tampons or pads in one storage bag. Stow used items and toilet paper in smaller bags, then consolidate into one larger "trash" bag. Freezer bags are especially good for this purpose as they are manufactured from thicker, more durable plastic.


Store used materials away from food when possible, but remember that these items are now "scented." Scientists have determined that myths about bears being especially attracted to menstrual blood are false. You need not worry that bears will be more interested in your used sanitary items than in any other scented item you might be carrying.That said, it's a good idea to hang used products with or alongside food in a bear bag or use a bear canister. Double-bagging your waste in plastic will help you maintain good hygiene.If you dislike using disposable zippered plastic bags, consider investing in a dry-bag such as those used by cloth-diapering parents. These washable lined bags function similarly to a zippered plastic bag.
 Never bury your used products or place them in composting toilets. Store your waste and carry it home with you if proper trash receptacles are not available.

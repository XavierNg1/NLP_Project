 Have the methods above left you unsatisfied by the preciseness of your folds? Try following the steps in this section, which should give you folds that are as close to exact as you can reasonably hope to be. You'll need a measuring tool (like a ruler) and a calculator or some scratch paper for this method. Start by measuring the length of the side you want to make folds in.
 Doing this will give you the width of each of your thirds.









For instance, if you're using a standard 8 1/2 × 11 inch piece of paper and you want to divide it into thirds along the 11 inch side, simply divide 11 by 3. 11/3 = 3 2/3 or 3.667. This means the folds should be 3 2/3 inches apart.
 Using your measuring tool, mark the spot that is the distance you determined above from the edge of the paper. Again, you should be measuring along the side of the paper that you plan to fold.









In our example above with the 8 1/2 × 11 inch paper, we would measure 3 2/3 inches along the 11 inch (27.9 cm) side and mark this distance.
 Make a fold through your marking that is perpendicular to both edges of the paper. This is one of your third folds. The second is easy — just tuck the other edge of paper under so that it is snug against the inside of the first crease (exactly as in the sections above.)

 Orthokeratology is a non-surgical procedure that uses specially designed contact lenses to reshape the eye and its curvature over time. This involves wearing specialized contacts at night while you sleep that work to change the shape of your eye. Then, in the daytime, you don’t have to wear any contact lenses.This is a temporary procedure – meaning if you discontinue your use of the overnight lenses, you will lose any vision benefits you might have gained while undergoing treatment.
 This type of treatment is great for people who have an active lifestyle, for those who are irritated by traditional contact lens use (like excessive dry eye), or for those may not want to deal with the hassle of regular daytime contact and glasses wearing.This is a particularly good option for people with low to moderate amounts of nearsightedness.
However, if you have significant problems with your eyesight – like corneal diseases, lazy eye, or irregularly shaped corneas – this may not be the best course of treatment for you.
 Make an appointment with your optometrist to discuss the benefits of orthokeratology and determine if this might be a good fit with your situation. Talk about your dry eye problems and all of the related factors so that you can make the best decision for you.
 For a more permanent solution to dry eyes from contacts, you might want to consider getting corrective laser eye surgery. This process uses laser technology to permanently improve your vision. After you are done healing from the surgery, you shouldn’t require glasses or contacts at all, which means your dry eyes won’t be bothered as much.Laser eye surgery can be quite costly (usually in the thousands of dollars) and often isn’t covered by insurance companies, as it is usually considered an elective procedure.

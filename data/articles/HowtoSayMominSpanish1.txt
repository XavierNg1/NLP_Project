 The closest equivalent in Spanish to "mom" is probably "mamá". Follow the steps in this section to pronounce this word. You'll want to start with a "mah" sound. This nearly rhymes with the English word "raw.";
, Now, say a slightly different "mah" sound (still rhymes with "raw"). This time, put an accent on the syllable. This means basically to say it a little more forcefully, a little longer, and at a little higher pitch.If the first syllable was a "mah," this one is a "MAH."


Having trouble with the idea of putting accent on a certain syllable? Use an English example. For instance, if you get angry and say "enough!", the second syllable ("nuff") is accented. You would say "ee-NUFF", but never "EE-nuff." "Mamá" is similar.
 The whole word "mamá" is pronounced "mah-MAH." Again, be sure to stress the second syllable. This will naturally make the first syllable a little quicker and inconsequential — many Spanish speakers use a pronunciation that's closer to "muh-MAH" or "m-MAH."


If you use this word in a sentence, use the article "la" for "la mamá." For instance: "La otra mamá es mejor." ("The other mom is better.")
"Mamá" is somewhat informal, but it's not crude or derogatory in any way. It's the sort of thing you'd hear a child saying to his or her mother (even if the child is an adult).
 This word is pronounced very similarly to "mamá." The only difference is in the accent: here, the first syllable is stressed ("MAH-mah"). Unfortunately, "mama" means "breast." Most people will know what you mean if you make this mistake, but it's still nice to be able to avoid the embarrassment.

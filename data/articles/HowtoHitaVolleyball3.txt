 Make a fist with your nondominant hand, and wrap your dominant hand around it. You should end up with both thumbs next to each other side by side. Stretch your arms out and away from your body creating a sort of platform with your forearms. You should stand with your legs spread apart and your knees bent., The bump is typically the first type of hit after the ball comes over the net to your team’s side. To execute a bump, you should let the ball make contact with your forearms and hands rather than swinging them back to hit the ball. This will give you more control when hitting.









If the ball comes down above the waist you can bump the ball to a teammate with your forearms and fists.
If the ball comes down below the waist, you’ll need to do a dig. You can dig by bending your legs and sometimes waist to bump the ball and save it from hitting the court.
 You should continue moving your arms towards the person you are passing to after you make contact with the ball. This will make sure the ball has the desired trajectory after hitting it.

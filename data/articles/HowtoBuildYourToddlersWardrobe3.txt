 In order to maintain a cute, fashionable, and realistic toddler wardrobe, you need pieces that can work together in different contexts. Select clothing that can mix and match, and avoid items that will only work in a specific outfit. Additionally, look for items that could be worn across seasons.Look across what your toddler already has and identify patterns.
For example, does your child wear a lot of blue, or a lot of stripes? Select items that will work with blue and/or stripes.
 You’ll never be able to pick out fashionable looks for your toddler if their drawers and closet are a mess. Make an effort to keep their wardrobe organized so that choosing an outfit is simple and efficient.Use plastic bins inside of drawers.
Install shelves in the closet.
Use hanging storage behind doors.
 In order for you to make a stylist, capsule wardrobe work, you must wash your toddler’s clothes regularly. For example, if you have established a strong set of items that can get you through one week, you must be sure to wash, dry, and fold your kid’s laundry weekly.Choose a laundry day (such as Sunday).
Pre-treat spills to reduce stains.
Fold clothes right away to reduce wrinkling and clutter.

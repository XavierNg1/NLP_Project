 Take a longer sheet of green construction paper and fold it in half lengthwise (often called hot-dog style). At the side with the closed edge, make parallel cuts towards the side with the open edge but stop about 1.5" from the edge. Vary the width of the space between cuts, with most being close together and a few being thicker (these will form the grass vs stems).


If doing this project with very young kids, you can pre-mark the paper where it should be cut with a 1" horizontal border along the open edge and evenly spaced 1" thick lines for them to cut.;
, From the uncut base, roll the paper into a circle or tube-like shape and tape or glue it together.
 Draw flowers onto different colored construction paper. Then, cut the flowers out. You can also add decorative centers by gluing on puff balls, buttons, or other items at the center of the flower.


You can also make more realistic flowers to go on this base if you want to.
 Using glue or tape, attach the flowers to the thicker strips that you left on the base (the stems).
 You can put your flowers in a bean-filled pot if you want to make them look more realistic and complete. You can also turn them into a bouquet by building a handle from rolled paper.

 Keeping softer objects (clothes, sleeping bag, camp towel, etc.) near your body will create a cushion between your body and the harder things you may have packed. Since a sleeping bag is both bulky and soft, that should be put in first, near the bottom and close to the small of your back. Packing bulky objects near the bottom of the pack will also improve your balance with the pack, since a heavy object high in the pack will raise your center of gravity, making you less well-balanced.
 Keeping your water bladder near your back will make it easier to extend your tube out of the backpack, thus make drinking easier., These items should not be as bulky and may include things such as: a cooking kit, stove, dining fly, pots (which should be placed around the middle even though they're bulky, since a hard pot against your back is obviously not comfortable), and water filters.
 These are are the things that are light or delicate, things that may need to accessed immediately in an emergency, or things that may be pulled in and out often. They may include: first aid kits (which may still be placed near the top of the middle section of the backpack), flashlight, maps, camera, and toilet paper, as well as rain gear for both you and your backpack.

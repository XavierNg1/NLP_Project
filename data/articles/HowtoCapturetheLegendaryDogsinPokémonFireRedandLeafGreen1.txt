 In order to keep you from running into the dogs when you are too weak to fight them, the Legendary Dogs will not enter the game until you have progressed near the end of the game. You will only be able to capture one dog per, and that depends on the Pokémon you started with:



Squirtle starters can capture lightning dog Raikou.

Bulbasaur starters can capture fire dog Entei.

Charmander starters can capture water dog Suicune.;
, The final bosses of the game, the Elite Four, must be conquered in order to reveal the Legendary Dogs. You can only fight the Elite Four after collecting every gym badge.


You will need several Pokémon around Level 50 to beat the Elite Four, and these Pokémon should be strong enough to capture the dogs too.
The Elite 4 covers a wide variety of Pokémon, and each of the 4 trainers has a specialty you need to counter:

Lorelei uses Ice and Water Pokémon. Counter with Fire, Fighting, Grass, and Electric Pokémon.

Bruno uses Fighting and Rock Pokémon. Counter with Flying, Psychic, Fighting, Steel, Grass, and Water Pokémon.

Agatha uses Poison Pokémon. Counter with Psychic and Ground Pokémon.

Lance uses Dragon Pokémon. Counter with Electric, Dragon, and Ice Pokémon.
 After you have caught or trained 60 unique Pokémon, Professor Oak will grant you the National Pokédex. Once you have this and the Elite Four are eliminated you will be able to find the dogs.


You must return to Professor Oak's house at the beginning of the game to get your national Pokédex., Unlike other Legendary Pokémon, the dogs do not appear in one set place and wait for you to find them. Every single time you enter a building, start a battle, or change regions the dog's location on the map will change, making them incredibly difficult to find. There are, however, some tricks to reveal them.

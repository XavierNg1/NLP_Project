 You need to ensure nothing prohibits taking post-dated listings. A good place to start is reviewing real estate license training manuals for your state such as (state name) Real Estate Principles, Practices & Law. Check also if it is legal to contact a seller about a future listing - even though the seller is currently in a contract to sell with another broker.


Post-dated listings are those where a client signs a listing agreement with a new real estate broker before their contract with another broker officially ends. The agreement is dated for the day after the current contract ends.
Check the National Association of REALTORSÂ® Code of Ethics. Courts have used the NAR Code as a standard for ruling on cases dealing with taking post-dated listings.;
, It is not worth the effort to obtain a new listing if any other real estate broker has the right to collect a commission from a canceled or expired listing. If this is the case, try to have this clause removed or find another real estate company to work for.
 Contact the sellers you find with an about-to-expire listing. Ask them about their intent to sell their property after the listing expires if the property does not sell before. Disclose immediately the following:


You are a licensed real estate salesperson with (your name and company name).
Tell the seller on the call, "I actually do not have a buyer but am wondering about something else. I viewed your property and saw it is going to fall off the market soon. After that happens, I was wondering if you had considered listing your home for sale with a different agent at that time?"

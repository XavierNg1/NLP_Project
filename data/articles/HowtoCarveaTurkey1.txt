 To check that the turkey is cooked, pull away a leg. If the juices run clear, then it's cooked. It'll be easiest if the legs are placed away from you.;
, The juices will spread within the turkey, making the meat evenly moist.


This also gives you time to prepare last-minute dishes. Tenting with foil will help keep the bird warm and is also recommended to help keep the meat firmer and juicier.
 The key to a good carving knife is its sharpness; also, it should have a blade long enough to carve the breast into neat slices, meaning that it should extend about 5 cm (2") beyond the meat on both sides to allow for the sawing action.


Do not use serrated knives or a chopper. It can also help to have a large carving fork to hold the turkey in place.

If using a carving fork, it should be short, with curved prongs. This type of fork will hold the turkey firmly without damaging the meat, giving you total control over the carving and slicing.


Some people like to use two knives. They will use the carving knife for slicing the turkey into thin strips and a cook's knife to divide the bird into joints.
 This is important because it will help the carved meat to retain its heat for longer. You'll be eating this thing for the next six hours, so it's best to be prepared (do you have your sweatpants ready, too?).


Remove any trussing string and foil before carving at this stage.

 Once you are comfortable with the movement, you can add some speed to the ocho cortado. You can add a quick-quick-slow acceleration to the cortado itself. When you are performing the cortado, move to the cadence of “quick-quick-slow” in your head. You can also add the quick-quick-slow acceleration to the last three steps of the basic tango. Applying the quick-quick-slow acceleration to both movements will add some extra intensity to the ocho cortado.If you are dancing in a competition or at a club, you might want to say the “quick-quick-slow” cadence in your head. However, while you are practicing, it may improve your timing to say it out loud.
 Because it begins and ends in the basic position, the lead can choose to perform multiple ocho cortados. A series of cortados can help the lead control the pace of the tango. You can also alternate between full ochos and ocho cortados., As the lead, you can place your cut foot in different locations to cut the ocho. For instance, when you make the cut, you can place your right foot outside your partner’s left foot and slide it back to cross. You can also cut an ocho on the outside of your partner’s right foot or the inside of their left.

 When you create your profile, do not hide your prosthesis. You can write about it in your profile or have a picture that highlights your prosthesis. Regardless of how you do it, be honest about your prosthetic device and try not to hide anything.Disclosing this information on your dating profile may make the conversation about your prosthesis much easier during a date.
 If you do not feel comfortable about leading with your prosthesis on a dating profile, wait until you feel okay discussing it. You can mention your prosthesis while messaging potential dates or bring it up during a date. This might be a good option if you want to avoid any fetishes around your prosthesis, or people who are just curious about it., When putting together your profile, be flexible about how you disclose your prosthetic device. You may find that being upfront works in certain instances or meets your needs better than waiting until later to talk about it. However, you may also find that the opposite is true and wait to reveal your prosthesis. Ultimately, you may want to try out both methods and see which works best for you., You should also explore your options by using multiple dating sites. You may find that your experience varies from website to website. Create profiles on sites like OkCupid, as well as websites designed specifically for disabled people, like Dating4Disabled and Whispers4u. Ultimately, you may find that one service meets your needs better than the others or that you appreciate the options that a variety of dating profiles offers.

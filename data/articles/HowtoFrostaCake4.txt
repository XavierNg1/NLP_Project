 Remove your cake with the crumb coating from the fridge, and add a dollop of room-temperature frosting to the top center with your offset spatula. You could also choose to pipe a layer of frosting on with your smooth cake piping tip if you want.

Frost the top of the cake working from the center out. Then, add a layer to the sides of the cake as well.
Donâ€™t worry about this first layer of frosting being perfectly smooth. Try to keep it as level as possible though, smoothing out any ridges that might arise.
 Leave your cake uncovered on the counter for 15-20 minutes until the frosting is dry to the touch. If you need to, you can leave it to set for longer., Take a paper towel or a piece of wax paper and place it on the top of your cake. Use your fingers to smooth the frosting, using the paper as a barrier. Move the paper to the sides and repeat the process to smooth the edges of the cake as well.

For a completely smooth cake, use wax paper. If you would like a small pattern to show through, use a paper towel with the ridge-side down.
Only place the paper and smooth it with your fingers a single time. Lifting and replacing the paper on the same section of cake will expose the wet underlayer, and just smear the frosting.

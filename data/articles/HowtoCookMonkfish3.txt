Preheat your grill to a medium temperature.
Brush olive oil onto the surface of the meat, and season it with salt and pepper.
Place the fish on the grill surface, and allow it to cook for approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Use a meat spatula to flip the tails, and allow the other side to cook another 5 to 6 minutes.

 Set up a target such as a ball cart at an opposite back corner of the court from where you’re standing. Practice serving the ball to the target. Count how many balls hit the target or land in the ball cart., A basketball hoop is a good partner for practicing techniques such as passing, setting and serving.


Pass or set the ball towards the hoop. Stand at the foul line, or about 15 feet (5 m) away. Toss the ball into the air and pass or set the ball towards the hoop. Try making a basket with your passes.Serve the volleyball at the hoop. Start at the foul line, or about 15 feet (5 m) away. Aim for the square on the backboard. Try hitting the square 10 times in a row., When you don’t have a partner, you can still use a solid, smooth wall as an imaginary partner. Use the wall by passing the ball towards the wall. Hit the ball when it rebounds to you., If you are able to practice on a volleyball court with a net and a partner, always practice like you’re playing in a game. For example, if you are working on passing the ball, have your partner send the ball over the net to you. If you are practicing spiking the ball, do so over the net., There are many combinations of drills that integrate serving, passing, setting and other skills. Search online for suggestions, or talk with your coach or trainer to learn more drills.

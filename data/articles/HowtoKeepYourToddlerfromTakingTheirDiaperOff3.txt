 As odd as it might sound, being able to remove their own diaper is actually a good thing because the child will need to remove the diaper when they are potty-training.


The real issue is controlling when and where the diaper is removed. However, this is something that parents can teach their child.
Not only does it prevent messy or embarrassing moments, but teaching the child when to remove their diaper encourages self-esteem and builds on their self-help skills.
 Just as it is with teaching a child how to do other things, teaching them when it is alright to remove their diaper is going to take time and patience. They may not always get their timing right, but they should not be scolded for their misjudgment.


Instead, the parent should just go over the guidelines they have set for when the toddler is allowed to remove their diaper on their own.
 The specific guidelines for when the toddler can remove their diaper will vary from one family to another and may also depend on the age of the toddler. However, a safe way to start is to simply teach the toddler to ask if they can remove their diaper.


If the toddler is not speaking in full sentences yet, they can be taught to point at their diaper area and say “off” or even to simply tug at the waistband of the diaper.

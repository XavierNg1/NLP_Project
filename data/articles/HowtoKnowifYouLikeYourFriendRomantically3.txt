 Now you know that you'd enjoy/not enjoy being intimate (even if it's not really intimate) with that person, it's time to visualize. This one is fun, too!

, Flowers, dressy clothing, beautiful meals, on a lake, on a boat, music, winter, autumn/fall, spring, summer - whatever you want - have it!

, Any and all answers are OK. Is your talk:


Superficial, light and funny?
Deep, strong and intense?
Lovey-dovey, mushy and all about love?
Trivial and a little stupid?
Meaningful and continuous?

, What does it sound like? Strong? Impatient? Soft? Seductive? Light? Brave? Again, any answer is fine!

, Is it like yours? Or different?

, How do you feel? Are you satisfied? Let down? Angry? Or happy?

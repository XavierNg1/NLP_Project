 Press Cmd + Opt + Esc on your keyboard to summon the Force Quit window. Hold Cmd + Opt on your keyboard and click the icon of the app you want to close. Select "Force Quit" from the menu that appears.;
, Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete on your keyboard. In the screen that appears, select "Task Manager." This will summon the Task Manager window, which details the programs that are currently running on your PC. In the Applications tab, click on the programs you want to close and click "End Task."


If a prompt pops up, just click "End Task" again to quit the program.
You may be able to do this normally by heading to the program and closing it in its respective menu, but closing the program in Task Manager will let you close more than one program, so it is quicker.

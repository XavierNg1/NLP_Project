 Use earbud headphones that have a cord color that will blend into hair or clothes. White Apple brand earbuds usually stand out more than a darker pair. You can also get a wireless pair that can connect to your phone or MP3 player through Bluetooth to eliminate wires altogether.;
, Wear a shirt or sweatshirt with enough space to hide the cord of your earbuds. Place your phone or MP3 player in a large pocket of your pants or sweatshirt, then run your earbud cord from that pocket up the inside of the shirt or sweatshirt so that the earpieces come out by your neck.


Put the hood up on your sweatshirt and/or wrap the earbud cords behind your ears to make them less obvious.
You can even cut a couple small holes in your sweatshirt pocket or hood to help conceal your earbud cord even better., Choose a hat that covers your ears to help hide the earbuds. If you don’t have a hat, try covering earbuds with your hair if it’s long, or pretend to casually lean on one hand to conceal an ear and listen through that ear only.


You can even get hats and ear warmers with special pockets built in to hold earbuds or small speakers inside!

, Make sure to keep your music volume as low as possible so that others around you don’t hear it and catch you. A good level is one at which you can still hear your phone ring or someone call your name., If you’re in a class or a working environment that allows you to take notes on a computer or tablet, you can run your earbuds through your clothes in the same way as with a phone or MP3 player, but cover where they connect to your computer with something like a scarf or jacket.


Minimize whatever music player you’re using or keep it in the background of your screen behind your notes.
 Make sure you can multitask and pay attention to your surroundings at the same time as listening to music. Don’t get caught because you can’t answer a question in class or because you space out when you’re supposed to be interacting with people.

 Track your time to make sure that your speech isn't too long-winded.
 One appropriate choice would be to deliver your speech between dinner courses.
 Also, speak loudly so that everyone in the audience can understand the words that you've worked so hard to prepare.
 A speech that sounds flat and robotic isn't enjoyable and doesn't sound heartfelt.

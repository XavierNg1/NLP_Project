 Your farmables need to be protected from being stolen. So world lock a world and block the white door. It's recommended that you use house entrances so that if you ever die, you can go back easily even when there are people on the white door. Another way is to buy a signal jammer and place it in your world. It should have

A lot of space to plant your farmables
A break area
A storage space

, Go to a vend or trade world and buy the farmable(s) you want. It's up to you what you want to farm. I suggest using Venus Guytrap or Blackrock because you can farm them everyday and drop lots of gems. If you choose to farm Pinball Bumpers or Chandeliers (Chand) then I suggest having another farmable you could mine while waiting for those to grow., Go to your world's break area and place the farmables. Once it's all filled, start breaking your farmables. Remember that after each batch you have to get the gems and seeds or else it will only drop gems and you'll end up losing your farmables. Keep breaking until all of your farmables are gone and all you have are the seeds., Select the seeds and plant them in the space you made to plant them. It's okay if you didn't get 50+ seeds from mining all that. The good thing about farmables are that they drop lots of gems and lots of seeds so it's unlikely that you'll run out of it., The key to getting lots of gems is to repeat the process as often as you can. You'll notice that you'll need to break a lot more of the farmables you bought but don't skip a day of breaking your farmables. If it's too much, hire workers and pay them a world lock for breaking a certain amount of farmables. Another solution is to sell a bit of it but not too much. Who knows? Maybe the person who buys them was just like you!

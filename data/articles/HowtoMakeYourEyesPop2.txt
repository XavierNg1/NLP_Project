 A "popped" look can be easily achieved with gemstone colors like purples and blues. Even greens can look amazing.


Make sure you have separate brushes for your different colors.
 Using short but even strokes, cover your upper lid from the inside corner to just before the outside edge. The shadow should extend up to the crease at the top of your eye.









Again, be gentle with the shadow â€” subtlety is best here.
 Using a darker shade, apply shadow to the outside edge of your eyelid. Blend it into the first color up along the crease of your eye.
 Using a much lighter shade (even a white shadow or liner), lighten the inside corner of your eye along the upper lid. Curl around to the eye to reach the bottom lid.

 Memory wire is a special type of wire that keeps its "ring" shape. There are lots of different sizes of memory wire, ranging from ring to bracelet to necklace size. You want to get the smallest size, which is the ring size. Anything larger will slide off the base of your wine glass.


Look for something that is between ¾ and 1-inch (1.91 and 2.54-centimeter) wide.;
, Do not use your good jewelry wire cutters. They are too delicate for this task, and the memory wire could dull the blades down.
 Use a pair of round nose pliers to pinch the end of your memory wire. Twist the pliers upwards, against the curve of the memory wire, until you have a small loop. Pull the pliers out and set them aside., You can add one big bead or a bunch of small beads. You can also do a combination of the two: a big bead with small beads to either side of it. Be sure to leave about ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) at the end of the wire so that you can make another loop.
 Use a pair of needle nose pliers to open up a jump ring. Pull the ends of the jump ring past each other rather than away from each other. Slip the jump ring through the loop at the top of your charm, then close the jump ring. After this, you can slide the jump ring onto the memory wire.You can use a charm just by itself or with some small beads to either side of it.
If the ends of the jump ring aren't touching, you can pinch the jump ring to push them towards each other until they touch.
Some charms may already have a jump ring attached to the top loop. If you have a charm like this, simply slip it onto the memory wire.
 Like before, use your round nose pliers to pinch the end of the memory wire. Twist the memory wire against the curve of the memory wire, then slide them out.
 To attach the charm, simply pull the ring apart slightly, and push it onto the stem of your wine glass. The memory wire will naturally keep its shape, so you do not need to use the loops you made to close the ring.

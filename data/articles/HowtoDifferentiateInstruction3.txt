 Students will feel a greater investment in their education if they have some control over the content and evaluation of their learning. This is also a great strategy for differentiation in the classroom since it gives students some of the responsibility for setting their individual agenda.A good way to promote shared ownership in the classroom is to have students help set their own learning goals and offer input on the rubrics you use to evaluate them.
Another way is to provide students with open-ended activities and projects that allow the most room for pursuing individual creativity, initiative, and passions.
 Offer more than one prompt for each assignment and allow students to pursue to the one that speaks to them most. Be sure to include at least one option that provides full, in-depth instructions for students who prefer established criteria and at least one that is more open-ended for students who’d like to pursue their own visions.It’s also good to provide options that appeal to various types of learners. For instance, visual learners might prefer creating a graphic representation of a story while word learners may favor a traditional book report.
 Tapping into students’ established interests can accelerate the learning process and lead to greater information retention. Taking interest surveys that ask individuals to communicate their favorite subjects, activities, and hobbies is a great way to know that you’re appealing to the things that already excite their attention.When teaching math, for example, use word problems that connect students to real world experiences, like adding up football scores or understanding ratios through slices of cake.
Assign writing exercises that ask students to connect course material to with their personal lives, challenges, and/or hobbies.
When doing group work, consider grouping students by shared interests, so that they form immediate connections.

 Knowing how you will be measured once you are on the job is important information during an interview.
 Without asking for specifics, you could say something like "where do you see this department in 5 years?"

, If your potential supervisor is involved in the interview, it is appropriate to ask about how he or she manages.


Explain how you respond to that sort of management. For example, if your interviewer says she is not a micromanager as long as the work gets done, say that you work best independently. If she says she prefers working as a team, tell her you enjoy receiving and offering feedback during the course of a project.
 Some companies may require a typing or computer test or request a writing sample. Be open and accommodating.

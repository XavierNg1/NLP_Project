 Watch the clock tick as the time goes by. Determine if the clock’s hands need any adjustment. The clock’s hands should not touch. You will know that the clock’s hands need adjusted if they catch on each other as they rotate around the clock., Gently remove the faceplate of the clock to make any adjustments to the hands. The faceplate should pop right off.This step is not necessary if the clock does not have a faceplate.
 If the hands of the clock do touch, gently bend them away from each other. Be sure not to bend them too far. Just bend them enough so that they are not touching when passing each other.

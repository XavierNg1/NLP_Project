 This information might be given to you. If it isn’t, you can find the length of one side if you know the length of the polygon’s apothem or radius. The apothem is the distance between the center of the polygon to the midpoint of any side, and the radius is the distance between the center of the polygon and any vertex.

To find a side length given the apothem, use the formula x=2Atan(180n){\displaystyle x=2A{\text{tan}}({\frac {180}{n}})}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the side length and A{\displaystyle A} equals the apothem.To find the side length given the radius, use the formula x=2rsin(180n){\displaystyle x=2r{\text{sin}}({\frac {180}{n}})}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the side length and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius.For example, if the radius of a hexagon is 5 cm, to find the side length, you would calculate:x=2(5)sin(1806){\displaystyle x=2(5){\text{sin}}({\frac {180}{6}})}x=2(5)sin(30){\displaystyle x=2(5){\text{sin}}(30)}x=2(5)(.5){\displaystyle x=2(5)(.5)}x=5{\displaystyle x=5}


, The formula is P=nx{\displaystyle P=nx}, where n{\displaystyle n} is the number of sides the polygon has, and x{\displaystyle x} is the length of one side., Multiply these two values to find the perimeter of the polygon.

For example, if a regular hexagon has a side length of 5 cm, you would calculate P=(6)(5)=30{\displaystyle P=(6)(5)=30}. So, the perimeter of the hexagon is 30 cm.

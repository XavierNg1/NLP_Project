 You need to beat all cups in 50cc, 100cc, 150cc and Mirror Mode, and obtain at least 1 star in each of the cups. In Mario Kart 7, you should complete these cups in 1st or if lucky, 2nd place overall in order to collect the Golden Wheels. Alternatively, you can collect 15,000 coins, however the other method also gives you a star next to your name!


If you get all 40 points you WILL get either 2 or 3 stars.
If you get around 35-40 points, you will get 1 or 2 stars, but no guarantees.;
, You will need 100 MK7 streetpasses. If you live in a city, great! Streetpass all day as you go shopping. If not, just wait until you get a chance to go to the city, then start streetpassing. Medium sized rural towns should give 1-2 streetpasses daily if you are downtown all day. Alternatively, you can collect 10,000 coins.
 You will need to play A LOT of online to unlock this. You will need a VR of 10,000 or higher to unlock this. If you don't have online access, you will need 20,000 coins to unlock this.

 Wake up one to two hours earlier than the bus arrives in order to be fully prepared. Eat a healthy breakfast and if you have time, take a quick cold shower to assist in fully waking you up.
 After you are prepared for your first day, head out five minutes early to your bus stop and/or school. This will ensure your arrival safely just in case of traffic or any other incidents that may delay your arrival.
 On the first week, the teachers won't mind if you are slightly tardy.If you can't find them, a teacher or administrator will gladly help.
 If you create good first impressions with both teachers and fellow students, then this will assist in having an easy and great year.

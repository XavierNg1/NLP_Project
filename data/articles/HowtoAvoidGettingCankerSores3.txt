 Most canker sores will go away on their own, but if you would like to speed up the healing process you can try gargling with salt water or a baking soda rinse. Add one tablespoon of sea salt or baking soda to four ounces of warm water. Gargle with it twice a day to try to clean out and heal the canker sore.Do not swallow the mouth rinse, as this can lead to illness. Gargle by swishing it around in your mouth for 10 – 15 seconds and then spit it out.
 You can also try placing wet tea bags over the canker sores to help them heal. You may use herbal tea bags by steeping them in water and then letting them cool. Then, place them over the canker sore or hold them against the canker sore with your tongue., There are numbing mouth gels for canker sores that you can find at your local drugstore. They may be helpful if you want to numb the pain and be able to eat or chew without irritation.Follow the label instructions on the numbing gel when applying the mouth gel and do not apply too much of the product. The mouth gel should be safe for oral use and safe to swallow.
 If you notice the canker sore does not heal on its own after two to three weeks, you may want to see your doctor or your dentist. You should also see a doctor if the canker sore spreads to other areas of your mouth and become very large, or if you develop a high fever while having canker sores.You should also see your doctor if the canker sores are very painful despite the use of numbing gel or over-the-counter pain medication.

Other foods can help prevent infant constipation, including prunes, pears, oatmeal, and barley cereal.Talk to your doctor about when is the best time to introduce solids and which solids your baby should be eating.

, Low activity levels can lead to constipation. Infants often need assistance if you think they are not getting enough exercise., Grasp the baby's lower feet and gently move the baby's legs in a bicycling motion if the infant is not yet crawling. Bringing the infantâ€™s legs up and down can help the intestines work.
 These can help encourage the baby to roll over or crawl more frequently, increasing the baby's activity level. Your presence on the floor can also help the baby in moving around more, following you.
 A gentle belly massage can help ease constipation. Place your hand across the baby's stomach, three finger widths below the navel. Apply gentle pressure.

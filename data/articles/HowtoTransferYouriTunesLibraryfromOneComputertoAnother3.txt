 iTunes Match costs an annual fee. The service stores all of your music files through iCloud, including files that you added to your library from CDs or sources other than the iTunes store. This is a very useful service if you have a lot of music that you didn’t purchase from iTunes.


To sign up for iTunes Match, click the Store menu in iTunes and select “Turn On iTunes Match”. You will be asked to enter your Apple ID and password, and you will then be taken to the ordering page.
iTunes Match will only upload songs that it cannot find matches for in the iTunes library. If a match is found, then that iTunes file takes the place of the file that you would have uploaded. This makes the uploading process quicker than uploading your entire library, and can result in higher-quality versions of your songs (it can also result in lower-quality versions if your original was super high-quality).
 Once it is finished matching the songs on your library to the songs available in iTunes, the remaining songs will be uploaded to iCloud. You can store up to 25,000 songs, along with all of the songs that were matched.


If you have a lot of songs that can't be matched, the upload process can take a significant amount of time. This is also heavily dependent on your internet connection speed.
 Once all of your music is matched and uploaded, you will see an iCloud icon next to each song. The songs will be streamed by default from now on, but you can also download them by clicking on the iCloud icon next to the song.


You can access your iTunes Match on your iPhone by opening Settings, selecting Music, and then toggling on the iTunes Match slider.
The iTunes that you are using to access your songs will need to be authorized for your Apple ID.

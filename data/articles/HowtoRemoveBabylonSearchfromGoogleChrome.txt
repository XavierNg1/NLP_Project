 Look for Google Chrome on your computer and open it. The web browser will load.;
, Click on the button with three horizontal bars on the upper right corner of the browser. This will bring down the main menu. Scroll down and click “Settings.” The Settings page will load in a new tab.


You can also go directly to this page by entering “chrome://settings/” on the address bar.
 You will see the current default search engine being used by the omnibox.
 A small window will appear where you can view the list of search engines you can use for the omnibox.


The first section of the small window is for the Default search engines. This contains the more popular search engines, namely Google, Yahoo!, and Bing.
The second section of the small window is for the Other search engines. This contains all the other sites that can be used as a search engine. Almost any website with a search bar or function can be put here. Some sites here may not be search engines for the Internet, but just for their specific websites. Babylon Search will appear here.
 Scroll through the list of search engines and look for Babylon. The search engines are sorted alphabetically, so it should be easy to find it.
 Hover over the search engine. A “Make Default” button and an X icon will appear beside it. Click the X icon to delete Babylon Search from the list.


You will no longer be able to use it as a search engine for Google Chrome once it has been deleted.

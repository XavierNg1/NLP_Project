 The iPhone’s silent mode turns off the phone's sound for calls and notifications and causes the phone to vibrate instead. Silent mode is a fast and convenient way to (mostly) silence your phone. Note: an alarm set through the iPhone Clock app will ignore silent mode and go off at the appointed time. Alarms set with other apps may not.;
, This switch (also called a "Mute" switch) is located on the upper left side of the phone. Flipping the switch "down" (to silent) will cause the phone to vibrate and will reveal an orange stripe beneath the switch itself.The switch’s “up” position means the phone's sounds are "on"
If you enter into silent mode when your iPhone’s display is on, you will see a “Ringer Silent” notification on your screen.
 To make your phone truly silent, you can stop it from vibrating while in silent mode by going to Settings > Sounds. Find the “Vibrate on Silent” toggle and change it to white (off).This setting will not prevent your screen from lighting up when notifications or calls come in.
 If you're still hearing your keyboard keys make noise you can silence these in "Settings" > "Sounds". Slide the toggle next to “Keyboard Clicks” from green (on) to white (off).
 Your phone makes a noise when it shuts down regardless of whether it is in silent mode or not. To turn this sound off navigate to "Settings" > "Sounds" and find "Lock Sounds" at the bottom of the menu. Move the toggle from green (on) to white (off) to silence all lock sounds.

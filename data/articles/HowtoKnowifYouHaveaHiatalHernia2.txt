 There are two kinds of hiatal hernia â€“ sliding and paraesophageal (which literally translates to next to the esophagus).


Sliding hiatal hernia is the most common form. This occurs when your stomach and a portion of your esophagus merge or join together and slide up through your chest via the hiatus.
You should be more alarmed and concerned if you develop paraesophageal hiatal hernia. In this instance, your stomach and esophagus will stay in place but a portion of your stomach squeezes next to your esophagus causing strangulation and in worst cases poor blood circulation.
 People who are 60 years old or older have a 60% chance of developing paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Those who are 48 years old and above are at risk of developing a sliding hernia. As you age, your muscles tend to lose their elasticity, putting you at risk of developing a hernia because your muscles are not holding your internal organs in their proper places.
 Women are more prone to getting hiatal hernias because of certain physical changes that occurs in their bodies, particularly if they gain a considerable amount of weight when they are pregnant. Their growing baby can actual cause the out pouching of the diaphragm, resulting in a hiatal hernia.


A woman is more at risk if her growing baby is very heavy (3 kilos over the usual weight is cause for concern) or if she develops gestational diabetes while she is pregnant.
 Obese people have a higher amount of visceral fat (fat inside the abdominal cavity that sticks to the digestive system organs). This increases the amount of pressure within the abdominal cavity and can cause a hernia to occur.

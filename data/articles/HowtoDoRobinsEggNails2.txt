 Glitter nail polish comes in a variety of shades and sizes. You can go for bigger chunks of glitter or smaller chunks. For an robin's egg look, slightly bigger glitter chunks may work better., After your base coat has dried, simply paint over it with your glitter polish. Use slow, steady motions to avoid smearing your nails.








If you do not have enough glitter after one coat of polish, add another to add more speckles to your nails.
 If you want, you can add a clear topcoat on top of your nails. This helps protect your nails. It can help your nail polish remain chip and damage free. If you do decide to add a topcoat, make sure the glitter nail polish has dried completely first.

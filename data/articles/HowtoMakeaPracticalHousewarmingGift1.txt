 For a first time home owner, the basics such as screwdrivers, extension cords and tape measures are a great idea. However, if this is the homeowner’s second, third or even fourth home, you may want to stuff the gift with items that may be specific to either the new area or home (for instance, moving from a large home to a condo).;
, In addition to the practical, find at least one item that may have function, but also is unique and/or speaks to the individual homeowner’s taste. For example, if the homeowners have a fondness for all things British, include a Union Jack hand towel in the jar or Royal Family coasters.


Gift cards to home improvement or bed and bath stores are also a good idea and add a special touch.
 The idea is to give a gift that has thought and function but not to provide all the tools they need. For instance, instead of the value-pack of nails opt for a smaller pack. If the homeowner needs more, he or she can get them--the idea is to offer something to get the homeowner started.

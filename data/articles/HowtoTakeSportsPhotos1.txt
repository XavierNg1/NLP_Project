 Shooting sports photos requires a more versatile camera than still frame or simpler photography. DSLR cameras present clearer images through the viewfinder than other digital cameras. They have a wider range of settings that are designed with professional or skilled photographers in mind.Expect to pay at least $500 or so for an average quality camera. Higher quality cameras and lenses can run you multiple thousands of dollars.;
, The particular lens that you choose is about personal preference. Choose a prime lens for a sharper zoom, which gives you clearer images even when the lighting is not great. Pick a zoom lens for greater range flexibility if the things you’re shooting will be constantly moving closer or further from you.One drawback to a prime lens is that it’s distance range is lower, so you have to move around a lot more to get good shots.
One drawback to a zooms lens is that as you adjust the zoom length, you may lose the sharpness of the image.
 Whenever you are shooting outside, carry your equipment in a bag to make it easy to transport and keep it safe in case of rain. A fanny pack works well for extra film, batteries, or small lenses. A shoulder bag or backpack can carry your camera and larger lenses.Also look for hoods or covers that allow you to keep shooting in the rain without ruining your camera.

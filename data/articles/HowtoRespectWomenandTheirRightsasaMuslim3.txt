 She has chosen to spend time with you, and with your children (if you have any). Thank her for any cooking, cleaning, and child care she does.


Housework is not only for women. Talk with your wife about how the chores should be divided so that neither one of you is overwhelmed.
If she chooses to stay at home, recognize that she puts a lot of effort into keeping the household running smoothly. If she works, then she is delivering money to the table.
 Her opinion matters. She will not disobey you if the two of you can figure out a decision that makes both of you happy.
 Donâ€™t pressure her to do things she is hesitant about or not ready for. Set aside time to talk with her about what she is and isn't willing to do, and don't try to negotiate if she says she is not comfortable with something.
 Bring her lunch, rub her back, give her gifts, offer to handle the household while she does something to relax after a long day, or do whatever you find helps her feel appreciated.

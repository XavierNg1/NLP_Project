 When removing waterproof mascara, it is important to use the right materials in order to remove all of the product and to prevent the eye area from becoming irritated.


You can also use hypoallergenic baby wipes, or a clean, damp face cloth.
 This should be the side where you’ve applied the mascara.









Once the cotton ball is underneath your lashes, apply gentle pressure so that the underside of your lashes are pressed against the cotton ball.
Always remove the mascara carefully and gently. If you rub too hard, you will end up pulling out some of your eyelashes and irritating the skin around your eyes. You also risk getting product in your eyes, which could lead to an eye infection.
 Doing this allows the makeup remover to start dissolving the mascara.
 Minimize tugging by always “wiping” your lashes in the same direction.
 If you still have quite a bit of mascara on your lashes or if your mascara is being stubborn about coming off, continue to gently wipe the undersides of your lashes with the cotton ball.
 Dip a Q-Tip into the makeup remover and use it to gently “scrub” the roots of your lashes to get out any remaining mascara.
 Now that your eyes are makeup free, use a gentle face cleanser to remove any last traces of makeup and any oily residue that may be left behind by your makeup remover.









Be sure to rinse your face well with plenty of lukewarm water.
 After washing, make sure to apply an eye-cream or all-over facial moisturizer, as makeup remover can dry out your skin.

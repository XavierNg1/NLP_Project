 This may seem like a major commitment, but if you want your new gray hair to look good this is the way to do it. You want to give your hair time to grow its way out of whatever previous color you were using for as long as possible. Otherwise it’s going to be much harder for the bleach to lift your hair to an even color all the way around. If you don’t currently dye your hair, you can skip this step.;
, You can have this done at your local hair salon. Using bleach is really hard on your hair. This is a preemptive measure to ensure that your hair doesn’t get as dry and damaged, or at least less than it would have been otherwise. Deep conditioning can help reduce breakage. , This will allow the natural oils in your hair to build up, which can help you protect your scalp from the irritation that the bleach may cause.
 Even with all these steps, be mentally prepared that you will have to cut off some broken or damaged hair after using the bleach. You may lose a little bit of length in the process, but it won’t be extremely drastic. Still, you don’t want to be surprised when it happens. Make sure your hair is at a length that you would be comfortable losing some.

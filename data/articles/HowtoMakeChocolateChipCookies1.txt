 The coarseness of the sugar granules will help break the butter down, so be sure to do this first. Then add the eggs and vanilla and mix again until completely combined.
 Pour a cup of the dry ingredients, stir, and repeat until the dry and wet ingredients are totally combined. Fold the chocolate chips in until fully incorporated. At this point you should have a moderately thick cookie dough.










Do not over-stir the dough. While the dry ingredients should be added gradually, donâ€™t do so little at a time that your dough turns to brick. Aim for adding the dry ingredients in four or five batches.
 Leave at least an inch of space between the cookies because they'll spread out when they bake. You can usually fit 12 cookies on a full-sized cookie sheet at a time.
 Do not over bake; if you do the cookies will be dark brown and burnt. Remove the pan from the oven and let the cookies rest on the pan for 10 minutes. This will cook the cookie thoroughly while they will remain chewy.
 Using a spatula, lift cookies off and place onto wax paper, a plate, or a cooling rack.
 Eat when hot and steamy or cooled and slightly crisp. If you like you can pipe a small swirl of icing or whipping cream on top and add some sprinkles to make it look fancy.

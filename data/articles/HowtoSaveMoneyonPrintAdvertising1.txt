 If you can provide a daily or weekly giveaway that always corresponds to announcing your business, website and product names, then it is likely to raise awareness and sales for your business.;
, Mention any contests or special deals that are available if the person mentions the advertisement (ad). Ask for the ad to be run for 1 to 2 weeks before the event.
 If you are a charity or you have already paid for some advertising, ask the newspaper or magazine to include your business name, a short pitch and a website in the classified section.
 Online printers, like VistaPrint, offer discounts and, occasionally, a number of free products if you list their name at the bottom of your print advertising. This is especially feasible for business cards, flyers and coupons.


If you are a non-profit, contract with a business. They should pay for, or help pay for, your print advertising, and their name should be included on all the ads as the sponsor. This increases the goodwill for the business and lowers print ad costs for the non-profit.
 Using your personal contacts, rather than employees, to post printed advertising around town can save you money. Give these people a discount and ask them to keep referral cards in their wallet.


Using referral cards can help you to do affiliate marketing. Every time a referral card is produced, with someone's name on the back, you can give them a percentage of sales, such as 10 percent. Send out monthly checks and they are likely to continue.

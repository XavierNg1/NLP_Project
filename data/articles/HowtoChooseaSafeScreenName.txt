 Having a screen name such as "I Hate Sally" or "I Beat Up Joe" obviously will get some people angry. Names with political or religious agendas attached to them will rub a lot of people up the wrong way too––avoid using them. Remember too, that what might be funny or ironic where you live might be disparaging or even unkind somewhere else in the world; you are interacting with people from all over the world, so be worldly wise.
 Come up with a first or a last name totally unrelated to you. Add only your first or your last name to the stage name but not both. Or, don't even do that––add together two totally unrelated names you like the sound of together. Everyone will know you by your stage-name style screen name! For example: Adelaide Anders or Martha Smith.
 Combine the name of a favorite pet or object with a surname or other name. For example, Woofie Bugbear; Trixie Paws; Reptilian Greg; Ovalbowl Harry; PurpleCrayonMarsha.

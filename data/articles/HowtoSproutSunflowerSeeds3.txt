 Either method will work for germinating sunflowers for planting, but you can also use the traditional plant germinating method that follows. Sunflowers are notoriously difficult to get to grow straight in their final location and are a favorite snack for birds. Sprouting them before planting might improve your chances of keeping them alive.
 Mist several paper towels in water with a bit of plant food mixed in. The towels should be wet but not soaked and difficult to handle., Place a couple of seeds in the towel with space between them and fold the paper towel up so that they are covered.
 Give the paper towel a few more drops of water and place it in a resealable plastic bag (such as a Zip-loc bag). Seal it most of the way, with just a small, ~1" gap at the center.
 Set the bag in the sunlight and give the seeds time to germinate.
 Plant when they have sprouted, making sure to place them in soil with a pH between 6.5 and 7. Sunflowers need full sunlight to grow. Consider planting them along a fence or your house, or behind some sturdy trees, to shield them from the wind.


Keep in mind that sunflowers planted in pots will not grow as big as sunflowers planted in the ground.
Sunflowers are draught-tolerant, but you should ensure they get plenty of water while they establish their roots. They can also survive in wet, humid weather, but you will need to make sure they are planted in well-draining soil, like a sand or loam mixture.

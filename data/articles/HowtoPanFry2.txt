 The oil should come halfway up the sides of the pan. Canola, vegetable, sunflower, and light olive oil work well for this type of frying., Have the battered food ready for when the oil is hot. You can check if the oil is hot enough by sticking a wooden spoon into the oil. The oil will bubble around the spoon when it is ready.
 Make sure that every piece has plenty of room. You do not want to crowd the food, or it will not fry properly. The food should sizzle as it touches the oil.If it does not, the oil is not hot enough. Wait to add the other pieces.
 Use tongs if possible. Forks can be used to flip, but they are not ideal. You only want to flip once to ensure that the batter cooks correctly. Flipping too often or too soon can cause the batter to fall off., Once you have removed your food, place them on a paper towel. You can use tongs or a slotted spatula. The paper towel will soak up excess oil, giving you a crispier batter.The meats should rest for a moment to finish cooking. Serve immediately.

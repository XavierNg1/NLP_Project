 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Spread a little vegetable oil in a 9-inch (23-cm) cast-iron skillet, so the cornbread won't stick.Set the skillet aside while you make the cornbread batter.
 Get out a large mixing bowl and pour in 2⁄3 cup (157 ml) of vegetable oil. Measure out 1 cup (230 g) of sour cream and add it along with 2 large lightly beaten eggs. Grate 1 medium yellow onion and add it to the bowl. You should also open and add 1 15-ounce (418 g) can of creamed corn. Whisk all of the wet ingredients until they're combined.Ensure that you're using creamed corn, not sweet kernel corn.
 In a separate bowl, place 1 1⁄2 cups (180 g) of yellow cornmeal. Add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. Whisk the dry ingredients, so the baking powder and salt are distributed in the flour., Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a rubber spatula to stir them together. The flour should be incorporated, but the batter will be a little lumpy.Avoid stirring too much, since this could make the cornbread tough.
 Scrape the batter into the prepared skillet and smooth the top with the spatula. Sprinkle 1 cup (100 g) of grated cheddar cheese over the cornbread.You could also use your favorite hard or melting cheese.
 Put the skillet in the oven and bake it for 45 minutes. It should turn golden brown. If you stick a tester into it, the tester should come out clean (without batter sticking to it).Let the cornbread cool for 20 minutes on a wire rack before you serve it.

 Place several ice cubes in a resealable plastic bag and lay it on top of the gum wad. Alternatively, spraying the gum at close range with compressed air from a computer duster, or placing a piece of dry ice on the gum can also freeze it quickly.








Freezing gum is most successful when the gum has just gotten into the carpet and is not ground deeply into the carpet fibers.
Be sure the gum is frozen solid and not just cold before moving on to the next steps.;
, Gently lift the gum up off of the carpet fibers with a scraping motion. Allow it to crack and break into fragments and remove as much as possible. Rub ice over stubborn areas that won't lift off and repeat as necessary.
 Dip a rag into a soapy solution containing a small amount of white vinegar and gently rub the spot where the gum was to finish the cleaning process. Blot dry with a thick towel and don't walk on the area until it is completely dry.

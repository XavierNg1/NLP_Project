 Reset the oven’s computer by switching the circuit breaker that controls the oven to "off" for five minutes. The circuit breaker might be in your garage or on the outside of your house.


The best way to determine which switch powers your kitchen is through trial and error. Leave the kitchen light on and test each switch, one by one.
Leave the switch off for a few moments and switch it back to “on.”
You’ll know that the oven reset because the oven time will blink “12:00.”Many houses or apartments will label circuit breakers to avoid this process.;
, If the oven is still locked, press the self-cleaning button again to start the cycle. Let it go for 30 seconds, and then cancel the self-cleaning cycle. Test the door lock lever again.


It is important to note that you must wait for the oven to cool after running the self cleaning function.
 Program a short self-cleaning cycle of one to two hours. Let the oven cool and try it again. If you are still not having any luck and have waited an ample amount of time (one-three hours), it’s time to cut power off the oven.
 Go back to the circuit breaker that controls the oven and switch it off. Go back to the oven and test if the lock works briefly. Now move the oven out from against the wall gently. Follow the power supply that attaches to the wall and unplug the power.Unplug the oven if you plan to unlock the oven door manually.

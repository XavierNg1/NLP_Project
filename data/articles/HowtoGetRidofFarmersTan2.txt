 This is the safer and healthier alternative to tanning using UV rays. When choosing a self-tanning product, start with a lighter color with an added moisturizer to help blend in awkward tan lines. It may be tempting to match the self-tanner to your tanned skin areas, but that would not be wise. If you apply deep tanning colors to your untanned skin, it will create an orange-y, splotchy mess with streaks on your ankles and feet which are hard areas to tan.Moisturizing self-tanners are easier to spread and blend in.
Gradual self tanners take about one week to work, but they will look the most natural.
 Spray tan specialists use an airbrush to gently apply fake tan to blend in your skin tones and offer you an opportunity to get specific areas tanned in a semi-private atmosphere. These types of tans can last about two weeks and should fade away at the same rate as your natural tan.Paying for a specialist to give you a spray tan can be costly. Consider the cost before going out to get one.
This is a good option if you don't feel confident in applying your own fake tan.
 Tanning beds can be a nice choice for convenience and total privacy. Tanning beds will also create a consistent, full coverage tan even if you have several skin tones going on. The more pale areas should be more effected by the tanning bed UV rays and after a few trips to the tanning saloon, they should catch up to your darker skin.In a tanning bed, you can control which areas of your skin are exposed to UV rays and for how long. This will allow you to match the tone of your skin more accurately.
Beware of the damage caused by tanning beds. Tanning beds emit the same UV rays as the sun that can lead to skin damage and cancer.

 Also, secure electrical chords to the floor or place them behind furniture to prevent your baby from pulling, swinging, and tripping on them. Secure chords to the floor and sides of the furniture with electrical tape.Secure lamps and other objects that contain chords to the furniture they are sitting on top of with electrical tape or weights.
Place tall lamps that can topple over easily behind furniture.
 Place them on the top level of a shelf or in a high cabinet. Place sharp objects or objects that contain sharp pieces up high in a cabinet, as well. Make sure the shelves you place these objects on are sturdy.Because household cleaners emit toxic vapors, it is also recommended that you place these up high and away from your baby.
 As a general rule of thumb, any object that fits inside a cardboard toilet paper roll should be removed and placed in a secure area. Also, make sure your baby’s toys do not contain beads, eyes, ribbons, buttons and other small pieces that your baby can pull off and choke on.Toys and objects that also have long chords and/or strings, or that are heavy should be removed and secured.
Remove larger objects that contain small pieces that your baby can pull off and choke on as well. Place them up high or in a cabinet with a safety latch.
 Pad the sharp corners and edges of furniture and structures, like fireplaces, with edge guards. You can purchase rubber or plastic edge guards online or from a department store like Babies R’ Us, Target, Sears, or Wal-Mart.Because babies can pull on them, do not place table cloths or place mats on tables and side tables.
 Your child is not too young to understand the word no. Therefore, while supervising your baby, make sure to use verbal cues to indicate which actions and objects are off limits. The more you reinforce this, the sooner and better your baby will understand which behaviors are appropriate and inappropriate.Use verbal cues like “no,” “that’s not yours,” and/or “no touching."

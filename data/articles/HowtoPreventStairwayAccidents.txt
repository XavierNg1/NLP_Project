 Research building code standards and any other legal requirements for stairwell designs. By following certain codes, you can avoid being responsible in the event that someone is injured falling down the stairs.;
, Don't pile items anywhere near a stairway.
 Make sure that the paint does not wear out.
 This will add a grip to them and help prevent accidents. Again, ensure that the treads are secure and not loose.
 Select rails that are curved and smooth so that clothing and bag straps don't get caught on them causing stairwell injuries. Check that the handrails are not unsteady or detached from the wall.
 If there is an odd step at the bottom of the stairwell or narrow steps, let people know. Post signage at that top and bottom of the stairwell that explains the oddity. Make sure that these signs are posted in a very visible spot. If you do have the means, get the oddity fixed. In some places having a sign may work against you if someone does have an accident. Find out what the law is in your area., Install light switches at the top and bottom of the stairway for both safety and convenience. Check periodically that the bulbs are all working.
 Make sure that none of the steps are loose or rotting. If you have carpeting on the stairway, ensure that there are no pulls or openings that would cause someone to trip. Be proactive about correcting accident-causing issues.
 Don't put cloth or carpet down at the top of stairs. Someone may trip and fall down the stairs and hurt themselves badly. Just dry the area. If you need to mark the area with a wet floor sign, make sure the sign is visible but not obstructing the path. Another option would be to treat the floor with a non-slippery coating.

 The ancient Greek philosophers are usually credited with first inventing the idea of atoms, but the idea had currency from a lot of other common observations, such as noticing that adding salt to water makes all the water salty.;
, A very large number called Avogadro's number is how many atoms are required to make 12 grams of carbon. To give an idea of how big this number is, a thousand has three zeroes, a million has six zeroes, a billion has nine but Avogadro's number has 23 zeroes!

, The simplest atom is hydrogen, which consists of a single proton in the nucleus and a single orbiting electron.
 If an atom has six protons, it will behave as carbon. Protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged.
 Atoms which do not have an equal number of electrons and protons are known as ions. Atoms can have too many electrons, in which case they are negatively charged, or too few and they will be positively charged., They "balance" the charge in a nucleus and are not involved in Chemistry directly. An atom with more neutrons will tend to have a higher boiling point for instance, but otherwise will undergo exactly the same chemical reactions.
 Everything you have ever touched, breathed or seen has been made of atoms.

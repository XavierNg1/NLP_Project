 Tell the person with whom you've been having an affair why you are ending it. Remember that this should be the last intimate conversation you have with this person. Say everything you want to say, and allow the other person to speak as well.


Don't allow the conversation to go on for too long. As with any breakup, the longer it's drawn out, the more confusing and upsetting it becomes.
Make it clear that you don't plan on communicating further, unless you know each other from work and must communicate in a professional setting.
 Hopefully the person with whom you're breaking up will take it well, but you should be prepared for him or her to be extremely sad or angry that you're breaking things off. Stay strong, and just walk away if necessary.
 It's normal to feel sadness, and you may want to reach out for comfort, but you risk reigniting the affair if you ask to have another conversation.


Help yourself out by erasing the person from your email chat list and social media sites. Delete the person's contact information from your phone.
If you have to see the person at work, keep things professional at all times. Avoid one-on-one conversations, and don't go to lunch together.

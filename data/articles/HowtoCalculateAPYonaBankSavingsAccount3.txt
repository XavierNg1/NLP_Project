 While the calculations for APY are not too difficult, you can simplify the job even more by using an APY calculator online. Many banks or other websites offer this simple service. Run a search for “APY calculator,” and you should find what you want. The calculation is standard, so you will want to choose one that has a style and presentation that you can read easily.Be careful to read the calculator site carefully. Some offer to help you calculate APY, while others offer to calculate your savings after you enter the APY. Either is fine, as long as you know what you are using. This article focuses on calculating the APY itself.
 The first box of the online calculator will usually ask you to enter the bank’s interest rate. Usually, you will be prompted to enter the figure as a percentage, rather than a decimal.For example, if the calculator asks you to enter a percentage (%), you will enter the number 1 for a 1% interest rate. If you were asked for a decimal, then you would have to convert it to 0.01.
 You may be asked to enter the number of times that the interest is compounded. In that case, you enter a number. Alternatively, you may be asked for a compounding frequency, with options like “Daily,” “Monthly,” or “Quarterly.” Read the choices carefully and select the correct one.For example, if you are working with a bank that compounds interest quarterly, then you would either enter the number 4, for 4 times a year, or the word “quarterly.” You will have to read the instructions on the website to make the correct choice.
 When you press that, the equivalent APY should appear.

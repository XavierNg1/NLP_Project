 Write in front of them every day while making sure they can't see the pages. One day, leave your diary in an obvious place (ex: your desk). While you're gone, your friends will most likely peek in it and see your secrets. After a minute or so, return to grab your diary, and quickly walk away.
 When he/she discovers it, he/she will most likely read it. The next time you see your friend, worriedly ask if he/she knows where your diary is.
 Entrust your friend with your diary without telling him/her not to read it. While you're gone, he/she will most likely take a peek.

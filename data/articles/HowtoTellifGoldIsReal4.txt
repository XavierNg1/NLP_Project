 A jeweler can normally do this for you for free if you don’t have your own scale. You will need the weight in grams.


It’s helpful if the vial has millimeter markings on the side, since that will make it easier for you to read the measurements for this test.
It doesn’t matter how much water you use as long as you don’t fill the vial to the top, since the water level will rise once you immerse the gold in it.
It’s also important to note the exact amount of the water level before and after immersion.
 Take note of the new water level and calculate the difference between those two numbers in milliliters., A result close to 19 g/ml indicates either real gold, or a material with a density similar to gold. Here is an example calculation:

Your gold item weighs 38 g and it displaces 2 milliliters of water. Using the formula of /, your result would be 19 g/ml, which is very close to the density of gold.
Bear in mind that different gold purity will have a different g/ml ratio:

14K – 12.9 to 14.6 g/ml
18K yellow – 15.2 to 15.9 g/ml
18K white – 14.7 to 16.9 g/ml
22K – 17.7 to 17.8 g/ml

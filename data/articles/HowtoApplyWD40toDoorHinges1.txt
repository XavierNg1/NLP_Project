 Like any other aerosol spray, WD-40 distributes its contents as a kind of cone-shaped cloud. With the smart straw in place, however, you’ll be able to emit WD-40 in a thin precision stream. This is ideal for applying WD-40 to a door hinge.The smart straw is a long red tube that, in its undeployed state, remains snug against the WD-40 cannister.
If your WD-40 comes with a smart straw, snap it into place by pulling up on the gray base of the red tube. This base is located near the top of the WD-40 canister.;
, With the WD-40 smart straw in place, position the canister so that the end of the tube is about one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge to which you wish to apply WD-40. If you’re using a WD-40 canister that doesn’t have a smart straw, identify the location of the actuator orifice (the place from which the WD-40 issues) and aim it toward the door hinge. The actuator orifice should be one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge you wish to apply WD-40 to., Once you’ve positioned the smart straw or actuator orifice appropriately, you’re ready to apply the WD-40 to the door hinge. WD-40 canisters emit their contents quite quickly, so do not hold the actuator down for prolonged periods. Instead, press down on the actuator using your index finger, then release it quickly. WD-40 will leave the canister. Apply the WD-40 in quick bursts, moving from the top of the door hinge to the bottom., Clean the door hinge off. Applying WD-40 to your door hinges will cause them to attract dust and turn black.After applying WD-40 to the door hinge, wipe it clean by dipping a microfiber cloth in some hot, soapy water. Wring it out, then wipe the door hinge with the cloth. To prevent rust, wipe the hinge down with a dry microfiber cloth.

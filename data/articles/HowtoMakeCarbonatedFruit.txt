 Peel the skin off the apples and discard. Place all cut fruit in a plastic bottle with a pop off top bottle. The pop off top acts as a safety valve.;
, Only about 2 grams is needed, or a piece about half the size of a thumb. There is no harm in putting in too little dry ice - you will simply end up with only slightly fizzy fruit. We are looking for only a little bit of pressure (approximately 30 psi) and so there is no need to add a big hunk of dry ice. The dry ice in the picture below (roughly 5 square inches or 30 square centimeters) was enough for the plastic bottle of fruit.
 Watch as it turns into its gaseous phase. Most of the dry ice will sublimate in an hour and fully pressurize the plastic bottle. Wrap the bottle in a towel to prevent injury if it explodes. Then place in the refrigerator for the night before opening.
 Pour the fruit out of the bottle and it's ready to eat! It loses its fizz quickly, so make sure you serve it in the first 15 minutes after opening. Carbonated fruit tastes like regular fruit, but it tingles on your tongue. It's a totally unique experience to eat, and makes you burp if you have done it right.

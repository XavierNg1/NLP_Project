 If a few pages in your book have come loose, not to worry. Open your book to the spot where you’d like to insert the loose page.


If the book doesn’t stay open on its own, make sure to weigh down the pages with a paperweight. This way the book won’t start closing before you’re done inserting the loose page.;
, Place a thin line of archival glue along the vertical edge of the page to which you’d like to adhere your loose page. The glue should be as close to the binding as you can get it. Make sure you’re using an archival glue, which should be acid free.Do not glue multiple loose pages onto one another as this will not be stable over time.
You can purchase archival glues from craft stores or an archival supplier., Carefully place the page back into place, taking care to align the edges of your loose page with the edges of adjacent pages.


To prevent any glue from oozing out, you can put a piece of wax paper along the page to soak up any escaping glue. This way your pages won’t glue together., To ensure the page lays flat within the book while it’s drying, weigh down the book with another heavier book., While archival glue will dry within a few hours, it’s best practice to leave the book for at least 24 hours to set.

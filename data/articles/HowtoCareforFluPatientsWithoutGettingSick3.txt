 This is why it is important to keep space between you and an infected person, and to have them cover all coughs and sneezes with a tissue to prevent germ transmission.
 The virus can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours. This is why cleaning and disinfecting shared surfaces is so important, as well as having separate linens, towels, and eating utensils.
 Before they even realize they are sick with the flu, they could be inadvertently passing the infection onto others.


The flu virus is contagious one day before the onset of symptoms, and up to seven days following the onset of symptoms.
This is one of the many reasons why it is always important to wash your hands thoroughly â€” not just when someone is sick or during flu season, but always.
Getting enough sleep every night, staying hydrated, and eating healthy are all ways to keep your body and immune system healthy so you will be less likely to catch the flu from someone.

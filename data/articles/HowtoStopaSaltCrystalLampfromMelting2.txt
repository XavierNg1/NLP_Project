 Though you may be worried about wiping down or cleaning your lamp with any moisture, you can easily do this without melting your lamp. Use a damp cloth or sponge, making sure to squeeze out as much water as possible. Wipe away any dust or other debris. Pat dry.Turn the lamp back on afterwards. The heat will evaporate any moisture.
Don’t submerge the lamp in water. Also don’t use any cleaning products on the lamp.
 If you have problems with your lamp starting to melt, try leaving it on all the time. The heat will help evaporate any moisture collected on the lamp, which can help slow the melting and dripping process.If you don't want to keep it on, place a plastic bag or some other protection over it to reduce the moisture.
 If you cannot get the lamp to stop melting, then place it on top of something to protect your furniture. This may be a coaster, saucer, plastic placemat, or something else that will stop the moisture from ruining your furniture.

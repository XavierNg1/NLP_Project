 If you often become frazzled, try printing out this list and taping it on the wall near the crib or wherever you keep the baby.Check if the baby is fed and dry.
Feed the baby slowly and burp them often.
Rock the baby gently, or take a walk.
Let the baby feel movement: drive them in the car, push them in a stroller, put them in a wind-up baby swing, or put them on top of the dishwasher or clothes washer/dryer. These can be soothing.
Try another activity: singing, dancing, massage, reading in a funny voice, making silly faces, and other things.
Use trial and error to figure out what calms the baby most, and do those things.
 Notice how you are feeling, without trying to change it.

Take a few deep breaths. Notice signs of stress in your body: increased heart rate, muscle tension, furrowed brows, et cetera. Just pay attention for a few seconds.
Allow yourself to be stressed. It's frustrating when a baby won't stop crying. You're allowed to be upset.
 It is normal to be stressed about a baby that won't stop crying. Anyone would be frustrated in this situation.

Remind yourself that the crying is not a reflection of your parenting ability. All babies do this.
Remind yourself that the baby is not doing this on purpose. They aren't a "bad" baby, because all babies cry a lot. They aren't trying to irritate you; they're expressing a need the only way they are able.
Remember that it's okay to be upset.
 Put the baby in a safe place, like a crib, and walk away. It's okay to leave them alone for a little while so you can regain your composure.Try doing a relaxation exercise, or something else that calms you.
To release anger, play sports, scream into a pillow, or hit a soft object like a pillow, couch, or bed.
Check on the baby every 5-10 minutes.Call a loved one and ask if they can come over.

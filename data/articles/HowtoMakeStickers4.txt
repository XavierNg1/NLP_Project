 For stickers, you can pull off and restick, buy some repositionable glue, which can be found at craft stores and online. After designing and cutting your stickers, brush some of the repositionable glue on the back of your sticker. Let them completely dry. Then stick and peel and stick again!







, Draw pictures, shapes, or words onto printable mailing labels. These can be purchased at office supply stores. Cut around the shape, then peel the label off. Place the sticker on wax paper if you don't want to use it right then.
 Draw your design on any paper, or cut pictures from magazines. After the sticker has been cut to the shape you want, place double back tape on the back of the sticker. Cut the tape down so it doesn't go over the sides of the sticker. Place on wax paper until you are ready to use the sticker.
 Draw your designs on the shiny side of the contact paper using sharpies. Cut out the stickers around your designs. Peel off the paper backing and stick to whatever surface you choose.








Contact paper stickers are translucent. They are good to use on colored construction paper.
 If you want to make a lot of stickers and you're willing to spend a little more money ($15 - $20), you can buy a sticker maker machine from a craft store or the Internet. Place your sticker (a drawing, a photo, even a ribbon) into the sticker maker and then pull it through the machine. Some have a crank and you just crank it through, or some you stick it in one side and pull it out the other, and it will apply the adhesive for you. When the stickers run through, they're ready to use: just peel and stick.

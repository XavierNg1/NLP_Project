 The best approach is to fence your garden. Put cages around the plants and cover the berries with netting.;
,


Plant squash around the perimeter of your garden. Skunks enjoy squash but most won't walk on the squash leaves to get to the vegetable because the plant leaves contain tiny hairs that irritate the skin and feet of skunks.
 The leaves have pointy sharp hairs that break off and produce a liquid when disturbed. The combination of the 2 creates painful burning and stinging.


Consider planting Fritillaria imperialis, or Crown Imperial, to get rid of skunks. The Crown Imperial is a flower-producing plant. The flowers have an unpleasant odor to skunks, rodents and many people.
 Most skunks have a keen sense of smell. The mothballs may not only keep skunks out of your garden, but they may keep them out of your yard altogether.
 The reason why a skunk may be in your garden is the bugs, worms and other insect population common in gardens. Keep the bugs under control to discourage skunks.
 Rotten food in general harbors insects.
 You can use traps that catch the animals so you can relocate them to better locations that are far away from your garden and home.


Be sure your traps are tubular in shape and narrow. This serves 2 purposes: it keeps the skunks calm in the dark and prevents them from raising their tails to spray.
Bait the traps with bacon, cat food, berries, peanut butter or other items that skunks like to eat.
Place the traps in the garden or in the travel paths to the garden.
 Foxes are a skunk's natural enemy. This should discourage skunks from visiting.

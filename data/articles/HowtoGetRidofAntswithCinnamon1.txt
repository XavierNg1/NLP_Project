 The simplest method of using cinnamon is just to grab what you have in the cupboard. Add a dash or two where you see the ants entering the house. The cinnamon is so strong that it disrupts the trails the ants are trying to make, and they'll stop coming in that way., Instead of just sprinkling it, you can also use cinnamon to make a line that ants won't cross. If you see them in certain areas, try using a cotton swab to make a line across that area. Rub it in the cinnamon and spread it in a single, thin line., If you want to go a step further with your cinnamon, try using essential oil instead of the powdered stuff. It tends to be more potent. You can simply dip a cotton swab in it and then rub the oil along the areas where you've seen ants.Some other essential oils may also repel ants. The easiest way to spread essential around your home is by making a solution with water. Then you just spray it around your home in areas where you've been seeing ants.Start with a 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of water and a 1/4 cup of vodka (60 milliliters). The vodka helps keep the solution mixed together well. However, if you don't have it, substitute extra water (another 1/4 cup) for the vodka, and shake well before each use.
Add essential oils. Try adding 20-25 drops of cinnamon oil. Shake well.
Try other essential oils. You'll need 15 drops of tea tree oil, 15 drops of peppermint oil, and 7 drops of citrus oil (such orange, lemon, or lime). You can substitute 3 drops of clove in place of the citrus. Shake thoroughly.
However, if you want to use it in food areas, replace the tea tree oil with more peppermint oil.
 Another less messy option is using cinnamon sticks instead of the powder. Lay them out next to entrances you've seen. In fact, you can place sticks around anywhere you've seen ants. You can find cinnamon sticks in the bagged spice section of the grocery store.

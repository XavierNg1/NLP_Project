The degree of staining differ from one person to another because no diet is the same.
In general, try to consume foods and liquids that are lighter in color, as they are less likely to cause any discoloration.
 When you inhale cigarette smoke, you are coating your teeth with tar and nicotine. Nicotine is the ingredient in cigarettes that is responsible for the yellow-brown stains on your teeth.


Naturally, nicotine is colorless, but once it comes into contact with oxygen, it turns to an ugly yellow stain on your teeth. This discoloration is hard to remove, even with the use of dental instruments.
Since false teeth are more porous than natural teeth, they get cigarette stains pretty easily.
Also steer clear of marijuana. Marijuana produces a greenish, circular band stains.
 Brown to black stains on your false teeth are characteristic of tea or coffee stains. Tea and coffee particles are absorbed into the pores of false teeth and cause stains.

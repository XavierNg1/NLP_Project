 Both the vampire and the vampire-slayer characters should discuss the "fight" and "kill" scenes in advance to make it appear more realistic, and to ensure that nobody gets hurt.
 One of the most effective ways of killing a vampire (or any creature really) is decapitation. After cutting off the head, you then stuff the mouth full of garlic.Since you won't be cutting anyone's actual head off during role-playing, having the garlic around is a good way to demonstrate that you can kill vampires.
 Driving a wooden stake into a vampire (sometimes, but not always, through its heart) is a traditional method to kill vampires.You can decide if there is something special about the stake you are using, such as if it came from a certain kind of tree, or has been blessed by a priest. Just be careful you don't actually stab the other person.
 For role-playing or fancy dress, simply find a little bottle and pour in some water. Perhaps for added effect, add in a bit of glitter to give it a "special" effect. Not all vampires are killed by holy water, merely repelled, so you'll want to know how your vampire player will react., If you are portraying a vampire hunter, or vampire killer, you can carry other objects with you that won't kill a vampire, but can slow it down These include:Holy objects, like a cross or Bible. Vampires are evil creatures, so the generally reject sacred items. These do not have to be exclusively Christian, so symbols from Judaism, Islam, and other faiths can work.
Small grainy items like salt or sand. Traditionally, vampires will obsessively count objects they come across, so something small that you can drop in large amounts can delay your foe.

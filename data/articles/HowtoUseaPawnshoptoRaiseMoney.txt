 Looking around the garage and picking up something that hasn't been used for years and is covered in dust or grease will only make the pawnbroker's job more difficult. If it looks like you don't care about or value the item, the pawnbroker certainly won't place much value on it, either.;
, By having a certain amount in mind, it helps the pawnbroker get you the amount you need. Saying to the pawnbroker, "I need to get as much as I can," is not very helpful. It is better to say, "I need $44.53 to cover my utility bill."

, Some pawnbrokers no longer take guns, VHS tapes, VCRs or car stereos. Ask about the terms & conditions, and the contract period for holding the goods.
 TVs without remote controls, tool sets missing pieces, video cameras without cords and chargers are far less valuable than complete items.
 No reputable pawnbroker will accept an item without proper identification.
 The pawnbroker has to take in items cheaply so they can turn around and sell them at a bargain price and still make money. Sometimes the amount offered can be boosted a little, particularly if the item is easy to resell.
 Some pawnbrokers charge a fee for lost tickets.
, Don't wait until the last minute to redeem items you cherish. Invariably, things happen at the last minute that may cause you to lose your items. Traffic, job responsibilities, illness, transportation problems, any unforeseen difficulty may cause you to be late. The pawnbroker has to sell items that are not redeemed on time.

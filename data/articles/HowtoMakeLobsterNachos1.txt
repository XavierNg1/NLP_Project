 Place your saucepan on the stovetop and set the burner to low heat. Add butter to the pan. When the butter has melted completely, add the milk to the pan. Whisk your flour into this mixture a little bit at a time. Whisk consistently while adding the flour., Pour the cheese into the saucepan little by little, whisking as you do so until no cheese remains. Continue to whisk the mixture until it thickens and the cheese is fully melted. Season this to taste with salt and pepper and remove the cheese from the heat., Pour out your chips onto a serving plate. Use a wooden spoon, ladle, or similar kitchen implement to transfer your cheese onto the chips. If you prefer a lighter nacho, use a moderate amount of cheese mixture. For richer nachos, use all the cheese.

You may want to save a little cheese for later. After topping your chips and cheese mixture with ingredients, another layer of cheese can improve creaminess., On top of the tortilla chips and cheese, spread the chives, tomatoes, corn, beans, radishes, avocado, and lobster meat. If you enjoy spicy nachos, drizzle some hot sauce over the ingredients. Scoop up ingredients with tortilla chips and enjoy this dish by hand or with a fork.

If you have saved some cheese mixture, after you have topped the chips, drizzle the remaining cheese on the topping ingredients.

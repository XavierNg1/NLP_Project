 Before you decide on a particular orthodontist, you will want to set up an initial consultation with the doctor. Many orthodontists will offer a free, complimentary exam and you will not be charged for this initial consultation., You will want to make sure you ask all the necessary questions during your initial consultation with the orthodontist. Some important questions to ask the orthodontist include:From what accredited dental school did you graduate?
Where did you complete your Orthodontic Residency program?
What is the cost of the treatment plan?
How long will the treatment plan take?
What kind of post-treatment follow up is necessary?
Do you have patients I could contact for references?
Are you board certified by the American Board of Orthodontics?

, The office itself should be clean, modern, and well-lit. You should also consider how staff treated you before, during, and after the visit. Pay particular attention to the orthodontist's patient skills, and whether you felt like the orthodontist was prioritizing your care or rushing through your visit., You will want to consider whether or not the orthodontist is using newer technology and techniques, or whether their approach to orthodontics seems rooted in the past. Opt for an orthodontist who is using the most up to date technologies and treatments., It never hurts to get a second opinion when choosing an orthodontist and deciding on a treatment plan. If you are not happy with your first consultation, consider an evaluation by another orthodontist. You can then compare pricing and treatment plans before making a final choice., Sometimes patients will feel pressured to make a quick decision. This is unnecessary unless you are dealing with an orthodontic emergency. Take your time deciding on an orthodontist.

 Traveling can be an excellent excuse to try salsa, tango, swing, the waltz, or even hip-hop dancing. Head to a club to get your workout while socializing or pick a restaurant that offers a dance floor and live music to burn calories and have fun at the same time.
 Just by packing your running shoes you can combine sightseeing with working out. Jog through the parks, along picturesque waterways, or up and down past shops and restaurants to get your workout done, while exploring the city or even picking out where to go for dinner.
 Traveling can offer plenty of opportunities to try a local zumba, belly dancing, boot camp, yoga, or other specialty class at a workout studio, supporting local businesses and helping you fit your workout into your travel schedule.
 In many cities, public workout facilities allow visitor passes by the day or week for a very reasonable fee, giving you access to pools, tracks, basketball or tennis courts, and even instructor-led classes.

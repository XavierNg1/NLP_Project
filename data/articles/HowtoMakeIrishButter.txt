Shake the cream until it reaches an oatmeal consistency state. This can take a while, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The idea is to agitate the cream so the fat globules destabilize, creating fat clumps.
Strain the semi solid Irish cream through cheesecloth to separate the butterfat liquid from the whey, the currently clumpy cream.
Use the buttermilk for cooking, baking or drinking.
Knead the whey, which should now have a light yellow color. This will further thicken the whey to transform it into butter and release more water. As you knead it, the yellow color will become brighter.
Add salt to taste as you are kneading the butter, if you wish for salted Irish butter. Other ingredients can be added here as well such as garlic and herbs.
The Irish butter is done when it is soft and smooth and not releasing any more water.;

Start the mixer on slow. As the cream thickens, change the speed of the mixer to medium.
Up the speed to medium high as the cream begins to resemble thick strings when you lift the whisk. The Irish cream will become whipped cream with soft peaks.
Continue mixing on medium high and the whipped cream will thicken. As it mixes, the Irish cream will get crumbly and have a light yellow color.
Continue mixing to create Irish butter. Clumps of butter will form while separating from the liquid, or buttermilk.
Set the mixer to low speed.
Drain the buttermilk as it collects in the mixing bowl and use it for cooking, baking or drinking.
Continue mixing after draining the buttermilk to help release more water.
Knead the Irish butter until it is smooth and soft. This will also help release any extra liquid.
Add salt if desired or other ingredients such as garlic and herbs. Mix well.

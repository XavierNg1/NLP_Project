 Hopefully you will get your first members from the friends you ask. But some friends probably don’t want to join. For those that don’t, try not to take it personally. It’s most likely that they just have different interests than you do. Most kids also have a lot of homework and extracurriculars, and it’s often hard to add anything else.
 If you don’t think your group has enough people in it already, make some posters. Explain what your group will be doing, when and where it will be meeting, and how to contact you for more information., If you’re still needing members, ask if you can have a moment in class or in church to talk to people about your group. It’s a great way to get to a lot of people at the same time, and then they can easily come up to you afterward and let you know they are interested.

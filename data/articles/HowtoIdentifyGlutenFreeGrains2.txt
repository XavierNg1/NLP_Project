 Most packages of food will have a label that identifies them as gluten-free if the manufacturer is certain that the item does not contain gluten.


When buying flour, pasta, crackers, breads, and other grain products, selecting only products that have a specific “gluten-free” label will ensure that you do not accidentally purchase a grain with gluten.
 If a grain product does not have a specific “gluten-free” label, you may still be able to safely consume it if you read the ingredient list carefully and find no evidence of gluten or gluten contamination.


Gluten is found in many grains and has multiple names. If a product contains any amount of a grain that contains gluten, do not buy or eat the product to be on the safe side.
Do not purchase products that contain ingredients such as enriched flour, self-rising flour, phosphated or bromated flour, white or plain flour, or malt, as these contain gluten unless specifically labeled otherwise.
 Some products may have a sentence near the ingredient list that names potential allergens, such as peanuts, eggs, or milk. Do not buy a product if it names wheat or gluten under the warning, even if a grain with gluten is not listed among the ingredients.


In some cases, a warning label may state that the food may have been processed in a facility that processes products with gluten. Gluten contamination may be enough to cause illness in the case of true gluten sensitivity or allergy and should be avoided.

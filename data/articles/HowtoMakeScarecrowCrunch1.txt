 You will need to microwave the ingredients and butter together so find a bowl that will hold all your ingredients.;
, You will still need to add the other ingredients later so make sure the bowl does not run over. Set bowl aside.
 Be sure you watch the butter carefully as it may splatter or even scorch.


Microwave butter for approximately 30 seconds, check the butter and stir. The butter may not be completely melted, but stirring it may break it down.
Place butter back in the microwave if the butter is still lumpy after the first 30 seconds in the microwave.
 Stir using a rubber spatula. Be careful not to crush cereal or allow the mixture to become too mushy.
 Check and mix cereal every two minutes.

 Take the soot-stained fabric outdoors and gently shake off any excess soot. Be careful not to shake too vigorously so that you don’t make the stain bigger or spread the soot around any more than is necessary.If you shake the fabric too vigorously, you also risk grinding the soot into the fabric – ultimately making it harder to clean.;
, For fabrics stained with soot, try rinsing them with cold water to remove the stain. Turn the fabric inside out and run it under cool water to get as much of the soot out as possible.Try not to spread the stain further or grind the soot into the fabric with your hands. Try to let the cold water do its job and avoid touching the soot during the process.
 If you have soot stains on fabric materials like clothing, you can try soaking them overnight in laundry detergent. Fill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of laundry detergent and submerge the items. Let the fabric soak for at least six hours.If the soot-stained items can be bleached without being ruined, add a few drops of bleach to the detergent/water mixture.
 Use the hottest possible setting on your laundry machine to wash the soot-stained fabric. Use bleach (or color safe bleach, if the fabric requires it) when you run the washing machine.Make sure that you have done all you can to minimize the soot stain before you actually wash the fabric. Using several methods together will be much more effective at removing the stain than just attempting one method.
Don’t put the fabric in the dryer until you have checked to make sure the soot stain was completely removed. Otherwise, this could permanently set the stain in the fabric.

 Make a layer that covers the majority of the grill’s lower grate. Make another smaller layer on top of the foundation. Pile the briquettes until they reach about two inches from the bottom of the upper grate. The main thing is that the briquettes are touching so they keep each other hot.There’s not an exact amount of charcoal that is perfect. Experiment with different sized piles of charcoal to find what you like the most.
 Hold the bottle of lighter fluid about 6-12 inches (15-30.5 cm) from the pile of charcoal. Squeeze the bottle to squirt the fluid. Move the bottle in a back and forth motion to distribute it. Cover all sides of the mound until they are wet.Don't empty the whole bottle onto the pile. Only use enough to cover the mound.
 For the most effective lighting, let the lighter fluid penetrate into the briquettes. If you light the fluid too soon, it will simply burn off of the outside of the briquettes. Be careful not to get the fluid on anything but the charcoal., When the lighter fluid has soaked in for a while, grab the bottle again and squirt more fluid onto the charcoal. Cover all sides of the mound just as you did before. Set the bottle of lighter fluid away from the grill. Wipe your hands off to make sure no fluid got on them., Grab a long lighter or a box of matches. Light the mound of charcoal in two or three places around the outer edges of the mound. Lighter fluid catches fire quickly, so be careful to keep your hands away from the fire.If the entire mound catches fire quickly, there’s no need to light it in more than one spot. Only light extra spots if the fire is spreading across the mound slowly.

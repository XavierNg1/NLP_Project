Sound effects may, also, be appropriate between about 11 to 18 months of age... the attention span may be low, so you will need to turn the page and make new sounds for the animal, car, truck or whatever and point at the picture.;
, Show them how to do these games and always say the color (and later emphasize the shape that the child has in each hand). Say obvious colors often, such as when the toddler puts a hand(s) on a painted wall or bangs a solid color toy on your chair arm, or table ("orange, orange, orange,..." with each hit). Or, with one color in each of his/her hands, you say "red, red, blue, red, blue, blue, red,..." on each strike of the surface with the toy -- using soft, (perhaps chew-able) and unbreakable objects. Always do and say lots of examples for them, such as:


"Sorting" by each solid color and "naming/describing", size or by shape, at different times (11 to 18 months of age, may also play sorting and arranging with all kinds of single colors of soft shapes, 'floaties and teething toys),
"Arranging blocks in lines", or to form a shape, square or circle later,
"Nesting" (plastic bowls, boxes one inside another, for a size concept for example),
"Grouping" (grouping can imply numeracy, always count one, two, three),
"Classifying" for instance by examples say:


Size: "small, bigger, really big", or "short, tall, the tallest one"

Kinds: "sweet, sour, so bitter!", or "cold, warm, too hot!" -- (not dangerously hot),

Uses: for very young say: "Toy, play," or "Not a toy, No play," or "Do not bang it"; "Don't hit or drop it", etc.
, "Wow! I see... one... two... three dinosaurs on the floor now! Now if I put another one there -- I'll have, what? -- four!"

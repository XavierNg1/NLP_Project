 Nitrous oxide is now the largest ozone-depleting substance released by human activities (as well as a potent greenhouse gas),and it is produced in the internal combustion that powers most cars. In the U.S., about 5% of all nitrous oxide pollution comes from vehicles.To reduce the amount of nitrogen oxide your car produces, consider:


Car pooling
Public transport
Walking
Biking
Driving a hybrid or electric car

, Nitrous oxide is also produced when manure decomposes, making poultry, beef, and dairy farms large producers of the gas., The further your food or other goods have to travel to reach you, the more nitrous oxide will be produced by the engines that bring them to you. Buying local is not only a great way to find the freshest produce; it will also protect the ozone layer.

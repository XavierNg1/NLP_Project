 Summer's over, but the school can be great too.
 You don't want to be hungry throughout the day.
 Everyone needs to eat lunch, or they will be hungry later. Be sure to look at the school lunch menu for the day before deciding on ordering school lunch, though, to make sure that you'll be eating something you like!

, This is an optional step, but showering is helpful for looking nice and having good hygiene. Try washing your hair, face, etc.
 Be sure that your outfit looks nice and professional (for instance, wear your favorite dress). It is also important to make sure that your clothing follows school dress code.
 This is an optional step, but it is very essential. Brushing your teeth is an important part of taking care of your health.
 Curl it, straighten it or leave it natural. You can put it up in a cute ponytail, bun or braid. Spend your time on your hair to make sure it looks great for school.
 You can wear makeup, but don't overdo it. Put on some face lotion and body mist. Try concealer under your eyes and on any blemishes, pressed powder, a thin coat of mascara, eyebrow serum to keep your brows in place all day, and some lip balm.
 If you don't have everything, the teacher might get you, and that is not a good thing.
 Tell yourself that it's going to be a good day. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy; you are more likely to have a good day if you tell yourself that you will.
 This is the first day of a great learning journey.

 There are endless programs that will help you merge your files easily and for free, but you shouldn't have to leave the first page to find one that works for you. Reputable, commonly used sites include:


PDF Joiner

, As usual, do not trust any site that asks for personal information other than, at most, an email address. If the site feels unsafe, with multiple pop-ups, weird ads, or requests for personal information, leave and find another one. There are enough legitimate options online that you shouldn't use a site you don't trust.
 You can choose the order later. Use the "Browse," "Select Files," "Upload," etc. button to find all the PDFs that you want to merge into one document. With many sites, you can just click and drag the PDF into the window as well.
 Your files should now be arranged in a list, with options to "Move Up" or "Move Down" individual files. Put them in the order you want.
 Choose the resolution you'll need for your new PDF file. Print-ready is the highest quality, Office-ready is in the middle, and Web-ready will create the smallest file size.


Not all PDF joining websites allow you to pick the quality of your final PDF.
 All sites are different, but they should be easy to figure out. Once you have your pages in the right order, click "Create," "Merge," "Join," "Save PDF," or whatever other similar button rests next to your files. You'll be asked where to save your newly merged PDF.


If you can't find the new file, be sure to check your Downloads folder.

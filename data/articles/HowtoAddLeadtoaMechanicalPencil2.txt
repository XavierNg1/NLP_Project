 Find where the two halves of your pen screw together and twist them loose. Once the pen is opened, locate the lead dispenser inside. Pull it free from the lead holder., First, hold the top half of the pencil upside down, so the opening to the lead holder is facing up. Then feed the lead into the hole for the lead holder, one piece at a time. Remember to only load the recommended number of pieces, which will probably only be a couple due to the limited space., Fit the lead dispenser mechanism back into place. Screw the pen’s two halves back together. Give the pen’s pencil action a couple clicks to make sure it is operating smoothly.

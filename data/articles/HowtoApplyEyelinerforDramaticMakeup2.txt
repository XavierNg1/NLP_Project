 Although this look is a smudged, smoky look, you still don’t want it smearing all over your eyelid. A primer will prevent the eyeliner from smudging or creasing, and it will create a smooth base for the eyeliner. Squeeze a tiny amount of primer onto the back of your hand. Dip your finger into the product, dab it onto your eyelid, and blend it in completely.
 This should hit at the outer corner of your eye, extending from underneath your eye out at the angle of your bottom waterline. This might sound (and look!) a bit crazy, but it will allow you to create a sultry, smudged line on the top of your eyelid with a clean, crisp bottom border. Apply the tape to both eyes, making sure that they’re symmetrical.








Because you’re using sticky tape on your face, it’s best to do this look before you apply your foundation.
 You should apply this directly to your top lash line with a small eyeliner brush. Because this look requires blending, powder is the best option. Begin applying the product in small strokes, slowly working your way from the middle of the lid to the inner and outer corners. The line should be thin at the inner corner of the eye, and thicker as it moves outward. Continue to extend the line outward at the outer corner of the eye, following the line of the tape.
 This is how you create the beautiful smoky effect. Blend it out until you are satisfied with how it looks. The tape makes this step virtually fool-proof, because the product will only go onto the top lid. Once you gently remove the tape, you have a beautiful, crisp line.

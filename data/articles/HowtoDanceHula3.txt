 Lift your tailbone, so that your butt is elevated, but try not to push your belly forward. Try to imagine your hips as separate from your torso. They should be a little further back and higher than normal, but your torso and chest should not tilt too much to accommodate them.
 This is like the Kao step, except that instead of shifting back to left immediately, you will bring your weight to center, and then shift your weight to the left. Do this for four counts. Then, repeat in the other direction, with your first weight shift going from center to left.









Imagine making circles with your butt. The rest of your body will stay static, but your butt and hips will move in circles going clockwise for four counts, then counter clockwise for four counts.
 The hand that corresponds with the leading hip should be in the middle of your chest, with the palm pointed toward the floor. Your elbow should be bent and at shoulder height, going straight to the side. The other hand should be on the other hip.









When your leading hip switches, switch the arm positioning.

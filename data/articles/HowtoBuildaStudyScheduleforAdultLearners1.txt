 There are many free ones on the web. Look for a plan where each day is broken into 15 or 30 minute segments. This will be your "Working Plan."  Later, you will want to obtain or purchase a weekly calendar for the school year that has the same 15 or 30 minute breakdown to each day.;
, It surprises many students that this is really the first step. They normally want to begin with the last step, namely study times, but don't do that!  Start with your "fixed" events, then do the other steps in order.


Fixed events are your work hours, class hours, travel time to and from these events, and any other items that cannot be moved or changed each week.
List what the event is and draw a line to indicate how much time that event covers.
 These are your daily living activities such as meals, dressing, etc. Again, list the activity and draw a line to indicate how much time each activity normally requires.

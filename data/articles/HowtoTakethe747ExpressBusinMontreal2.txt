, This shuttle doesn't loop in downtown, so you can't just go to the stop where you were dropped off.


If you are getting on the 747 from the Berri-UQAM metro station, follow the signs to the 747 bus and bus terminal (gare d'autocars). Once at the bus terminal, look for door 15. The bus waits right outside this door. If you do not have exact change, this station has machines that will accept bills and give you a card to use.

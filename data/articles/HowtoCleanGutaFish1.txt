 Fish spoil rapidly after they die, so have a plan in place to clean them as soon as you're off the boat. Keep them alive in the water on a string until your fishing expedition is over, and ice them down in a cooler when it's time to pack up for the day.


Keep the fish wet until you scale them. If they have dried out, soak them a few minutes in ice water before scaling to make the scales easier to remove.
If you're buying a whole fish from the market, clean it as soon as you get home, rather than storing it in the refrigerator. You should also plan to eat it the same day you buy it.;
, Try to find a table high enough to work comfortably on, that can be rinsed easily with a garden hose when you are finished.


Avoid setting up your cleaning station indoors. Cleaning and gutting a fish is a messy job, and you won't want to clean scales or skin off your kitchen counter tops, sink, and walls when you are finished.
Many marinas and other fishing areas have cleaning stations set up for this purpose. Know ahead of time whether you'll have access to one, and make sure it has running water.
 Set out a bucket for the fish parts, gloves if you want to wear them, a sharp cutting knife, and a container for the cleaned fish. If you have a lot of fish to clean, set out a cooler full of ice to keep the cleaned fish cold.


If your fish has scales, you'll need a butter knife or a scaling tool; either one works just as well.
If your fish does not have scales, you'll need a pair of pliers, or something sharp, to peel the skin off of the fish.

 People often times think they are only friends, while one of them develops intense feelings for the other.
 Here are some signs that a friend has fallen for you:


Touching your shoulders and ask for hugs.
Offering their sweater or coat in a chivalrous way.
Making jokes about the people/person you are dating.
Inviting you over more often.
Kissing you on the cheek or asking for kisses on the cheek.
Asking who you like, a lot.
 This may go with all types of attraction, but it especially happens in a friend dynamic. They might check your reactions to things consistently. For example, they’ll look at you to see if you laugh when they make a joke.


Be careful if you hear them talk about insecurities in their appearance. They might be self-deprecating and compare themselves to someone you find attractive.
 If you find that you actually like them, then that is great and you should tell them. If, on the other hand, you just want to be friends, you’ll need to be careful.


Honesty is the best policy. Don’t tiptoe around the elephant in the room. Be upfront about the way you feel and how much you appreciate your friendship.

 Put some comfy shavings or straw in there as a bedding, some food, and maybe a little mobile at the ceiling. Don't make it look too scary to them- just tie a few simple pieces of straw, a few small pieces of ribbon, and maybe a small bell to a string or a piece of yarn. You can even paint the wooden house from blue to red to green-get creative! Your chicks will love it! They will be sleeping in here every night so make sure it's a very nice place to be!;
, Chicks love to flap their wings, and a ramp will fit that requirement just right! Don't do it too high, though! They could hurt themselves when they hit the ground, this is because chicks can't fly yet but it's good for them to try at a young age. Also, make sure they will land on soft grass, soft shavings, or something soft so they won't hurt themselves. You can get creative and make it like an airplane's takeoff ramp. If you do get creative, it will take you far.
 Tie a chain around a piece of metal, hang it up somewhere low, and you're complete! This is a nice place for them to rest.

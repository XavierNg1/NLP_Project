 Getting in contact with the LGBT center in your community (if you have one) is going to be the fastest way to find LGBT events. They have a calendar of events, and give you the option to host events.


If you live in New York City, the LGBT Community Center has a calendar of events. Even if you don’t live in the city, they can suggest venues and reasons to host your own event. They can provide a Meeting & Conference Services team that will further help you in your event planning., If you don’t live in New York, you can still find pre-planned events. Grinder regularly hosts prides, parties, and events. You can find the events along the bottom of your app screen.


Also look at the ad banners when you log in. They ads are specifically designed for Grindr and focus on the demographic that you’re looking for. Clubs and bars that advertise on Grindr are a great way to meet gay and bisexual men.
 Prides have been growing every year. The most popular one is in Provincetown, MA. This is their Carnival week and typically happens in late August. Anytime you visit PTown, there is likely to be an event. Even if there isn’t, the town is nationally recognized as one of the most popular resorts among gay travelers and you will have no trouble meeting gay and bisexual men.

 You can wash them both the same way, but, depending on what the actual shower curtain is, that could change. You might want to add something to the soap, or wash at a different temperature, for a cloth curtain as opposed to the plastic-y liners. It is ok, however, to wash them together if they are the same material.

, No need to waste water or electricity. Furthermore, cold water is better for the materials in the long term, as hot water can cause some melting and issues. Place the liner in the wash.
 You can pour this right where the soap is supposed to go.
 A half-portion of your normal soap amount should be fine, as this is about half the size (or less) of a normal load of laundry.
 The liner is not fabric -- it is plastic. The softener will do nothing but give a strange, chemically smell to your liner.
 Because the liner is the only thing in the wash, you could choose a shortened cycle if you have the option. Otherwise, just let the washing machine do its job.
 You must, however, be prepared for the dripping water. Do not put the liner in the dryer to heat dry it. While you could stick it in the drier for a few minutes on cool to shake off excess water, be careful. Hot air can melt the liner and ruin both it and your dryer.

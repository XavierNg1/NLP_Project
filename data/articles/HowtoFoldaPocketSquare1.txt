 For a great complement to your outfit however, it should be a complementary color or pattern.


Some ties come with a pocket square, which you can wear together, or you can mix it up depending on your style preference.
If you don’t have a pocket square, both a handkerchief or bandana can also be used.;
, Not every occasion calls for a pocket square, so the material pattern should complement your outfit, tying it together.


For formal events, you may want to opt for a white, or subtle patterned pocket square that’s crisp and neatly ironed. The fold you use should serve to accent your outfit, not distract.
For casual events, feel free to be more ambitious. Go with brighter colors and louder patterns.
 Even if you are going more casual, it’s good to start with a clean, ironed pocket square or handkerchief.


Ironing your pocket square before folding will also make folding much easier.

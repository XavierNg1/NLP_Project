 Remember that you are putting it into the socket that you placed inside the cap. Screw the entire cap on once it is filled with your smokable product.


Ground smoking material will work better, as it will restrict incoming airflow less than solid matter will.
Take the pieces of herb and rip it up into small pieces, about the size of bead or a very small pebble. Place the pieces of herb into the bowl â€“ remember your bowl is the head of the socket.
 Make sure you are in a place where it is okay for the water to spill out, like over a sink or a pool or outside. Part of the process is having the water empty out of the bottle while the smoke replaces it. Now let go of the carb and as the water is pouring out of the carb, light the bowl.While the water level is lowering the bong will pull in the smoke from the bowl.
 Now cover the carb again with your finger.The bottle should be filled with smoke. Now you are ready to smoke it.
 Screw off the bowl and start sucking in. As you suck in let go of the carb. This change in pressure in the bottle will help funnel the smoke into your lungs. Be prepared for a large hit.


Try to breathe the air in deeply. Breathing in air will bring the smoke into your lungs. Repeat the process as many times as you want.
Change the bottle about once a week. It gets dirty after frequent use.

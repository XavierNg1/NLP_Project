 Even if a shipping company—for example, the USPS—is responsible for the delayed arrival, you’ll need to contact the retail company first. The retail company will be able to tell you which company the order was shipped with, and will be responsible for issuing you a refund as well.


If your package has not yet been delivered, even though the guaranteed delivery date has passed, you may need to contact the delivery company to find out the location of your package.While the delivery company is not responsible for issuing your refund, their Customer Service representatives can at least inform you where your package is and when it should be delivered.;
, While different retail companies may have different specific refund policies, all companies should be willing to refund your shipping fees in the case of a late delivery.You’ll likely need to request the refund through the company’s Customer Service web page, or call the listed Customer Service phone number. In this interaction, be ready to provide all relevant information regarding the order:


Your order number,
A shipping number (if provided),
The date on which you placed the order, and
An emailed receipt.
 Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations, you’re entitled to a full refund for any products that have been ordered online or over the phone and arrived later than promised. If you prefer not to receive the late package at all and would rather cancel your order altogether, you can receive a full refund for the cost of the item and its shipping, as long as you cancel the order within 14 days.If the package did not have a guaranteed date of delivery, you’re still entitled to a refund if it arrived more than 30 days after the date when you placed your order.

 You need to know the specific food or treat variety that has been recalled. When a company recalls a food item, they will give you a specific flavor, variety, or type. This helps you identify the correct recalled item. Pay attention to the recall notice to see which specific product is affected.The specific flavor will be noted for a recall. After the brand name, they will specify if it is beef, chicken, or another flavor from the brand.
 Often, recalls cover only specific batches of the dog food or treats. When this is the case, the company will release a statement that includes additional information so you can get rid of the affected product.The product may give information, such as a flavor, variety, and a "best before‚Äù date to look for on the packaging. Additionally, the affected item will be stamped with a code. When looking to see if your product is affected, check the code on the side of the packaging. For example, the company may recall the beef flavored canned food stamped with a six digit code with a best before date of 01/01/2020.
If you are unable to find any information on the specific codes or varieties for the recalled item, get rid of any of the recalled food you have. This ensures you are not feeding your dog contaminated food.
 Before throwing out all of the food, keep a small sample of the contaminated food in an airtight container. The FDA or company may want samples of the food from customers. You should also keep the barcodes from the bag.

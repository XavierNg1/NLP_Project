Eat larger meals at least an hour before swimming and at least an hour after swimming.
Eat light before swimming, but make sure you eat something to have the fuel for the workout. You should eat less protein and fat before the swim because it takes longer to digest and won’t be able to be used as fuel. Carbohydrates are very important before the workout.
Eat a snack within an hour after swimming to rebuild muscles.
Wait at least an hour after the swim to eat a larger meal. This will give your body time to rest after the activity and let digestion return to normal. Immediately after a workout, you digest food slower and so eating a heavy meal can cause you to feel overly full.



Eat more protein. This will help stabilize blood sugar if you need to go longer between meals.
Eat breakfast. Make it a light breakfast if the race is in the morning and a heavy breakfast if the race is in the afternoon.
Bring plenty of high carbohydrate snacks. This can be fruits, fruit juice, vegetables and crackers. You will need these on hand for breaks to boost energy quickly.
Drink plenty of water. You should consume enough water so that you don’t feel thirsty and your pee is clear. Water is important because it keeps you hydrated and keeps muscle cramps and headaches away.

 Prepare your hair for styling by applying a product that is designed to accentuate waves to wet hair. There are a variety of mouses and other products that will give you hold but will not make your hair crunchy., Diffusers are the spiky attachments that come with most hair dryers, and they're an absolute must for blow drying wavy hair. Blow drying with a diffuser will allow your hair to dry faster than it would naturally, which prevents frizz, but it will not weigh down your hair with too much pressure like blow drying without a diffuser will.


To get the most benefit out of your diffuser, hold it right up to the ends of your hair and use it to push the ends of your hair up towards the roots as you blow dry.
A good diffuser should reduce the amount of air your hair is exposed to. If you don't see a significant difference in airflow when you put the diffuser on your hair dryer, you may need a better diffuser.Use the low or medium heat and speed settings on your blow dryer to avoid drying your hair and creating frizz., To help give your waves some extra bounce, it helps to hold your head upside down or to the side as you blow dry. This helps prevent your hair from getting weighed down as it dries.


If you want added volume, you can try lifting your roots with duckbill hair clips before you begin blow drying. Simply divide the top layer of your hair into sections and put a clip under each section, angling it into the roots. This will help create some extra lift as your hair dries.

 This method requires a few basic household objects that you likely have on hand. If you have a small magnet, a piece of Styrofoam, water, and a cup, you can complete a fun experiment that will help you determine the polarity of your magnet., You donâ€™t need to fill your dish all the way, just enough so that your Styrofoam has enough water to float freely.
 The Styrofoam should be small enough to place in your water dish and a large enough to hold your magnet. If you have a large piece of Styrofoam, you can cut it to fit.
 The Styrofoam platform will turn until the North pole of your magnet is pointing North.

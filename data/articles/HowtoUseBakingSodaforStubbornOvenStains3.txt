 Remove stains on the inner glass of your oven door by applying baking soda and water/vinegar in the same way as you would with the other surfaces. Remember to leave the mixture on overnight or for 12 hours.


Keep the oven door open and horizontal to best allow the damp baking soda to sit on stains.
You may want to spot-treat stains to use less water, or apply a premixed baking soda and water paste, to avoid the possibility of the mixture getting in between oven doors that have double panes of glass., Remove oven racks from the oven and lay them on a surface that is okay to get dirty. Sprinkle baking soda over the rack, spray on white vinegar, then let soak in hot water overnight.You can also scrub at the racks using baking soda and a wet sponge or toothbrush for smaller grates. It typically works best to soak before scrubbing.
You can try soaking oven racks in a bathtub protected by old towels. Allow them to sit submerged in hot water with Â½ cup of dishwasher detergent for 4 hours or overnight. This will loosen grime and make scrubbing easier, or in some cases not even necessary.Make sure to wipe down the racks with a clean damp cloth once treated with baking soda, soaked, or scrubbed, to ensure they are free from any residue before placing them back in the oven.
 If you have a stove-top oven, you can clean the stove surface with baking soda in the same way you would the oven. Simply let baking soda and water/vinegar sit overnight and wipe down in the morning.


Remove grates if possible on a gas stove. Also note that you want to avoid allowing baking soda and water to drip down into the ignition area, so keep baking soda to a paste and apply carefully on gas stoves.
Remember to wipe down the cooking surface thoroughly with a clean damp cloth once the baking soda and grime is removed, then let dry. A glass-top electric stove will smoke easily from any baking soda residue or other moisture when it is turned on.

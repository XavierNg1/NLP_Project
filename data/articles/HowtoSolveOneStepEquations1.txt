 It’s easy to solve equations when you understand what they mean. An equation will have a variable (usually x{\displaystyle x}), which represents an unknown value. The equation will also have a constant, which is a number you need to add or subtract from the variable to equal a certain sum or difference.

For example, you might have the equation x−9=5{\displaystyle x-9=5}. The variable representing the unknown number is x{\displaystyle x}. When you subtract 9 from the unknown number, the difference is 5.

, To isolate a variable, you need to get it alone on one side of the equation by performing an inverse operation to cancel the constants. Addition and subtraction are inverse operations. So, if the constant is subtracted in the equation, to cancel it you would add.For example, in the equation x−9=5{\displaystyle x-9=5}, 9 is subtracted from the variable, so to isolate the variable you must cancel the 9 by adding it.
 As you manipulate equations to solve them, you must keep both sides balanced. Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side. So, if you need to add a value to isolate the variable, you must also add that same value to the other side of the equation.For example, in the equation x−9=5{\displaystyle x-9=5}, you need to add 9 to the left side to isolate the variable, so you also need to add 9 to the right side of the equation:x−9=5{\displaystyle x-9=5}x−9+9=5+9{\displaystyle x-9+9=5+9}x=14{\displaystyle x=14}.
 To make sure your solution is correct, plug the value of x{\displaystyle x} into the original equation. If the equation is true, your solution is correct.

For example, if you found that x=14{\displaystyle x=14}, substitute 14 for x{\displaystyle x} in the original equation: 14−9=5{\displaystyle 14-9=5}. Since this equation is true, your solution is correct.

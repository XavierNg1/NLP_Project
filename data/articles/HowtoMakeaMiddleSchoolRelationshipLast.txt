 It may take some time to find the right person, or to even get in a relationship, so always keep your eyes open for people. And don't ever think you can't go out with someone younger or someone older. Your lover doesn't have to be in the same grade as you for it to be a good relationship. It is actually good to have a relationship with someone in a different grade, it gives you both space away from each other, which evens out the relationship. Anyway, find a person who you really do like, and would want to be with for a while, and flirt, spend time with them, etc, until you finally go out! (Make sure they are as interested in you as you are to them! But sometimes it's not always the case; sometimes you have to work up to getting that far into each other together. It takes time, and you want to take things slow.);
,( If you truly like each other then you probably won't mind)" Don't text, IM, call, or talk to them all the time. Everyone needs their space and time alone. They will dump you if you talk to them all the time! So keep your distance, and let them always have time to hang out with their friends. It would be good if you got to know their friends, too.
 They will dump you! Don't go off saying I'm Mr. Something or go off saying she's Mrs. Something that can weird them out and push them away. Also don't write their name everywhere on your body it's okay to write their name on your hand and it's okay to doodle their name. Just don't make it as if they're all you are thinking about; you need to focus on school, but not ignore your boyfriend/girlfriend. If you have a Myspace or Facebook account, don't put all over your profile: "I love my boyfriend!" or "I love my girlfriend!" and don't put their picture everywhere.

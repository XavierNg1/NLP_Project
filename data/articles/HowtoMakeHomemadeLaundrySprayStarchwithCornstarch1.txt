 To make the starch spray, you’ll need a jar with a lid that is larger than a pint (473 ml). Open the jar, and add 1 pint of distilled warm water.You can make the spray in a bowl if you prefer. However, you’ll have to mix it by hand rather than shake it to combine the ingredients.
You can use tap water for the spray, but it’s better to use distilled, especially if you have hard water.;
, Once the water is in the jar, sprinkle in 1 heaping tablespoon (8 to 10 g) of cornstarch. Secure the lid on the jar, and shake the mixture vigorously to combine the water and cornstarch.You don’t have to be precise with the amount of cornstarch. As long as it’s approximately 1 generous tablespoon (8 to 10 g), the spray will be effective.
 If you want the spray to have a fragrance, add 1 to 2 drops of your favorite essential oil to the jar. Shake it again to ensure that the oil is fully incorporated.You can use any essential oil with a fragrance that you like. Lemon and lavender are particularly nice, though.
 When the spray is fully mixed, carefully pour it into a spray bottle. Label the bottle so you know what it is and store it with your laundry supplies.You may have an easier time transferring the spray to the bottle if you use a funnel.
The spray typically lasts for two to three months, though it may start to degrade. Discard it if you notice it becoming discolored or developing mold.

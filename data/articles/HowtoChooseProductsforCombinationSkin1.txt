 For your morning face wash, a water soluble cleanser will remove dirt, debris, and lingering makeup without irritating your skin. Walter-soluble cleansers are lighter cleansers that rinse off easily. When choosing a cleanser, read the label to make sure it's water soluble.Look for water-soluble cleansers that are labeled as gel-based or mildly foaming.
In addition to grabbing a water soluble cleanser, go for a very soft-bristled brush or washcloth for cleaning. This will minimize skin irritation.;
, Exfoliating your skin is an important means to clean pores and leave your skin feeling refreshed. However, combination skin can react poorly to harsh exfoliants. When selecting an exfoliant, opt for non-abrasive varieties.A leave-on BHA exfoliant is best for your skin. You apply this exfoliant and let it do its work. You will not need to use brushes or wash cloths on your skin.
Look for a gel-based or weightless product with a water-like texture if you have combination skin.
 When it comes to combination skin, there will not be one product you can use on every part of your face. Make sure to choose products to use on multiple parts of your face to help your skin stay fresh and clean.Dryer areas of your face should be cleaned with mild soaps and cleansing products.
The t-zone, meaning the area circling your forehead, nose, chin, and mouth, frequently requires slightly harsher products. If your skin is not as dry in these areas, apply harsher cleansers and exfoliating agents to clean out your skin, remove bacteria, and prevent acne and breakouts.
 If your skin is not consistently dry or oily in certain places, a herbal face oil can be used. This can be use on various parts of combination skin and may be better at cleaning and cleansing skin than typical face washes.Look for face oils specifically labeled "for combination skin." These oils will be catered to your skin type and leave your skin feeling clean and refreshed.

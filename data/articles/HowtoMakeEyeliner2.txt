 This method is a great alternative if you don't have activated charcoal on hand. The soot from a burned almond creates a rich, black liner that looks just as good as store-bought liner. All you need are a few household supplies:


A raw almond that has not been roasted or salted
A pair of tweezers
A lighter
A small container or dish
Butter knife

, Use the tweezers to hold the almond steady (and protect your fingers from getting burned) and hold the lighter up to the almond. The almond will slowly burn and smoke. Keep going until about half of the almond has turned to soot. It should be black and smoky.If the tweezers you're using are all-metal, they may heat up and burn you if you use the lighter for too much time. Put on a glove to protect your hand.
Try rotating the almond in a circle so it burns evenly on all sides.
 All that nice black soot is what you need to create eyeliner. Use a butter knife to scrape it off the almond and into the dish. If you need more soot, keep burning the almond or start on another so you collect a good heap of it in the dish.


As you scrape, make sure not to scrape off chunks of unburned almond. You want the soot to have a fine, dusty texture, with no big pieces.
Examine the soot afterward and pick out any larger chunks.
 You can use plain soot as eyeliner without mixing it with anything else. It will naturally mix with the oil on your skin to stay in place once you apply it. Dip your eyeliner brush into the container and apply eyeliner in your favorite style.
 If you like your eyeliner to have more of a paste or gel consistency, you can mix the soot with water or oil to make it a little damp. Start with just one or two drops, and keep mixing more in until your eyeliner reaches the consistency you want. Try mixing in one of the following ingredients:


Water
Jojoba oil
Almond oil
Coconut oil

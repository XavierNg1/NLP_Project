, It can be made easier by using a high end sewing machine and special needles for sewing leather, but if you are doing it by hand you will need to pre-punch each stitching hole with an awl, a nail, or some other similar punch tool to avoid breaking needles and swearing outlandishly when you poke yourself with the needle. Another tip is to use pliers to poke your needle through the leather.
 It is also a good idea, but not necessary, to superglue the fabric to the jacket as to hold the material in place. This also prevents the fabric from puffing out while wearing it and to make it look almost professionally done from a distance.

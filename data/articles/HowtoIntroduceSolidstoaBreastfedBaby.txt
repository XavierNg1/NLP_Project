 Just give the child the plain cooked vegetable without adding any salt, sugar, corn starch, or other food thickening.;
,, If the baby is going to have any negative reaction, then you will have time to take necessary measures.
 Then blend them very well; the result should be a liquid. After 8-10 months, you can make a thicker texture with small, soft pieces of veggies. For cooking, you can use a Beaba babycook, which steams, blends and warms food.
 The fruits will be sweet, so babies will surely prefer them and may refuse veggies. The pureed food should be warm.
,, Then, you may give either breast milk or formula. The next day, add another spoon. On the third day, three spoons. The traditional method includes one kind of puree per week, which equals to seven spoons by the end of the week, though you may only do it on five consecutive days.
 By the end of the first month, you will be able to change one milk or formula feeding to puree in the morning.
 One regular order of vegetables and fruits that you can introduce to your child is squash/zucchini, broccoli/cauliflower, carrot, pumpkin, and potato, apples, pears, sweet potato and peaches. Here's how you can do it:


On the first week, you will introduce squash/ zucchini.
On the second week, you will give 1 teaspoon of broccoli + 7 tea spoons of squash, 2 tea spoons of broccoli + 7 tea spoons of squash, 3 tea spoons of broccoli + 7 tea spoons of squash and so on until 7 tea spoons of broccoli + 7 tea spoons of squash.
On the third week, the first puree should be replaced with a new one, so on the 15th day, you will give 1 teaspoon of carrot + 7 tea spoons of broccoli, then 2 tea spoons of carrot + 7 tea spoons of broccoli, and so on.

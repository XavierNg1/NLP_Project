The easiest way to check is to open a Microsoft Word document. Press "Print" and look for a box to check that specifies "double-sided," "2-sided" or "duplex" printing. Be sure to check the preferences or settings in the Print menu.
Although duplex printing relies on the printer, larger corporate printers are more likely to support this type of printing, because it reduces waste and can be done quickly. Smaller, at-home ink jet printers are less likely to have the option.;
, The index may indicate options for types of printing, or you can do an online search for "duplex" printing and your type of printer.
 On some printers, you may have to change the default setting to duplex printing, instead of choosing it each time your print.
 You can ask an IT person or a colleague from a different department to check whether their assigned printer does this.


Go through the steps in your "Application" folder or "My Computer" to add a device. Add the printer that supports 2-sided printing.
If you can set your computer up with a copier or scanner that does 2-sided copies, it may also be able to print double-sided sheets from Microsoft Word.

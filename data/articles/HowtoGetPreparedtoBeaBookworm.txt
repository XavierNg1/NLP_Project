 and get out a pen or pencil. Make sure to stick to that notebook (the reason why I want you all to get out a notebook is because you must write down your goals and other things I'll cover up while making these steps). Write your first and last name in the front or back of your notebook. Write down any ideas for books/ formulate an idea section.;
, it can be whatever way you want it to turn out. This can take about 1-10 minutes to do. Remember, one of your goals must be related to reading books and/or writing. For example, be specific about how many books you want to read in a year (you must do the math sadly....) and begin with very easy books (something that fits your age).
 This can help you figure out what subject or what genre you appreciate. You can also find new friends with shared interests while you are there. Befriend the librarian, and simply look in the back of the books to read the description about the book to get the gist of the story.
 Log on to websites like sparknotes.com or goodreads.com to know more about the book/books you are currently reading or the one that you plan to buy.
 You can catch their reasons to write and know what were their inspirations. If you can relate to something they say, write it down in your notebook.
 It helps you collect feedback and track your progress via comments from other fans of the work you derive your fan fiction from.
 If you don't understand a part or word in the book, don't wait ask a friend online what it means unless you can look it up on your own.
 You will be amazed at how quick your notebook will fill up.
 Remember that becoming published and setting up a writing studio are all a lot cheaper now with e-books and e-readers galore.

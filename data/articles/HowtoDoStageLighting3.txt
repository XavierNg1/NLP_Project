 It is always good to draw up a picture of the stage and any fixed bars that you can use to hang your lights. Then, based on this, decide where you want to put your lights and where they will point, what colour they will be, etc. If you have the facilities, you can add more bars in or use stands on the floor. If your venue doesn't have enough lights, look into hire companies that can hire you lights for a fee.


You can also set up a DMX controller after you have hung your lights. Plug the lights in via DMX cable and set up your scenes including the brightness and color that you think are the best for your event.
 This is usually via a DIMMER RACK. Dimmer Racks give you the ability to fade the lights in and out fluidly using a lighting desk/console.
 PROFILE spots have shutters which you can use to make the beam square, or shutter the light of unwanted bits of scenery or walls. FRESNELS have an attachment called 'barn doors' which serve a similar purpose.

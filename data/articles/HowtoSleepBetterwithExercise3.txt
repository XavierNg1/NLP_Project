 A yoga routine designed specifically to help you sleep may help you relax and fall asleep. The poses incorporated into the following routine have been shown to positively affect sleep cycles. Studies have also shown that yoga and Tai-Chi can increase blood circulation and lung capacity. This light exercise will allow you to release muscle tension and stress before sleeping., Align your buttocks with your headboard and put your legs in the air, on the headboard or the wall. Breathe in and out in slow deep breaths.


If your hamstrings are tight, move your buttocks further away from the headboard.
Some people are more limber, and if this pose doesn’t do it for you, scoot closer to the headboard.
Try to relax as you stretch the backs of your legs.
 Do a gentle twist, with your right shoulder moving forward and to the left. Hold for one minute and then do the opposite side.


Do not do this stretch if you have any chronic back problems.
Brace yourself by using your off-hand on the bed.
It’s important to look the way you are stretching to keep proper alignment.
 Bend your knees and let them fall open, with the soles of your feet against each other. If you don’t have the groin flexibility to pull this off, try putting something under each knee to minimize the angle. Rest in this position for three to five minutes.
 In this pose, you kneel on the bed and allow your torso to flatten over your thighs and knees. Your toes should be pointed backward. Lay your arms flat over your head and breathe deeply.
 Rock gently back and forth for one minute while breathing deeply – inhale while sitting up, exhale while going back – as you rock.
 Picture each part of your body relaxing and becoming part of the bed, until you drift into sleep.

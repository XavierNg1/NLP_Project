 The Slide Master contains all of the information that will repeat throughout the presentation, such as the background and default positioning of objects, and can be edited at any point during the creation of your presentation.


On a Mac, click “View,” “Master,” then “Slide Master.”;
, To make sure your text or image heading appears at the top of each slide, you’ll need to work with the first slide in the presentation.


All changes made to this slide will effect all other slides in the presentation.
 To include a string of text at the top of every slide, click “Insert,” then “Text Box.” The cursor will turn into an arrow. Click and hold the mouse button while dragging the cursor to the left to create a box to type in. When you’ve reached an optimal size, let go of the mouse button, then type your header text.


Select one of the alignment options (left, center, or right) from the “Paragraph” area to align your text.
To change the color or typeface, highlight what you’ve typed and choose a different option from the text formatting area in the toolbar above.
 If you have an image you’d like to use as a header, click “Insert,” then “Picture.” Choose your image from the dialog box, then click “Open” to insert it.


To resize the new image without warping it, drag one of its four corners.
To move the whole image, click inside the image and drag it.
 If you want to stylize some text with special effects, click “Insert,” then “Word Art.” Choose from one of the style options, then begin typing.


In some versions of PowerPoint for Mac, Word Art is inserted by clicking “Insert,” “Text,” then “Word Art.”
To fine-tune the text's appearance, highlight what you’ve typed and use “Text Fill” to change the color, “Text Outline” to change the border, and “Text Effects” to add effects like shadows and beveling.
 You’ll be brought back to your PowerPoint presentation in normal editing mode.

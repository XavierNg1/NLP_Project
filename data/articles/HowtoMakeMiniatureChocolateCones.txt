 Draw ten circles on parchment paper that measure 7.5cm (3 inches). Cut out each of the circles. Form the circles into cone shapes, securing each one with a piece of tape.


Keep the cones evenly sized so that they will all turn out roughly the same size.;
, Place the pieces into a bain marie or double boiler. Heat to melt the chocolate, stirring as it melts to hasten the melting.
, Use a fine pastry brush or a small, new artist's brush to do this. Seek to make the coating even all the way around and cover all of the inside of the cone, to the top.
, You may need to melt the chocolate again if you haven't worked swiftly enough, that's okay, just melt as explained earlier.
 Place into the refrigerator to chill and set. This should be for a minimum of 2 hours.
 Peel off the parchment paper, doing so very carefully. The chocolate cones are now ready. You can either fill them with a filling of your own choice, use them as they are or use the suggested filling from the next section of this article.
,, If you don't have a piping bag, use a pastry bag or snip the end off a plastic bag.
 Be sure to distribute the amount of cream evenly between each cone.
 This step is optional and other items can be used instead, if preferred.
 Allow to chill for 1 to 2 hours before serving, or leave until needed. It's a good idea to transfer to an airtight container if chilling for more than 2 hours.
 The chocolate cones can be arranged on a plate for guests to help themselves to, or added as a garnish to any dessert dish that you've made.

 Your teacher may want to assess your ability to pull in good sources and format them correctly. It's important to write your bibliography according to the instructions outlined by your teacher. Don't neglect this important step, since many teachers deduct points when students forget to include their source material.
 If your teacher told you a certain font size and type to use, be sure to use it. Most reports are typed in Times New Roman, 12 pt font, and double spaced. The title of the report should be centered at the top of the page. Don't forget to include your name.


Don't attempt to turn in a report formatted in extra large font to make it look longer. Teachers can see right through this tactic.
If your teacher requested a handwritten report, be sure to write neatly and legibly.
 No matter how well-written your report is, it won't seem polished unless you make sure it is free of errors. Check for spelling errors, grammatical errors, and formatting errors. You may want to ask a family member or friend to proofread your report, too, since it can be hard to catch your own mistakes.

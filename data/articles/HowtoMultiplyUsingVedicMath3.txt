 Write down your numbers sitting on top of each other, like you would do when multiplying normally.
 Subtract both numbers and place the differences beside the numbers you subtracted.
 Multiply the two differences you got in the previous step and place the product in the first two places ( ones and tens)
, Subtract one of the two factors by the opposite number's answer in step two.
 Place the answer from step four to the left of the number you got in step three.
 This alternative method is a bit easier, since adding together large products like 8*8 and 9*7 isn't very easy. If you don't feel like learning an additional method, you can use the ones above instead.

 This will form a circle at one end of the strap. If using another type of strap (e.g. hook-and-loop straps or Olympic straps), skip this step.
 Slide your hands through the circles or attach the straps with the hook-and-loop fasteners so the end of the straps hang down along your fingers. Pull on the ends of the straps or adjust the fasteners until the straps fit snugly around your wrists.
 Start by going under the bar from back to front, and then wrapping the strap over the top and under again. Wrap the strap completely around the bar.








Some weight trainers prefer to wrap the straps in a figure-8 configuration. This can lead to a better grip on the barbell, but some people complain that after many reps, it can make the bar less comfortable to hold on to or even lead to friction burns.
 Close your palm and fingers over the area where the straps are wrapped around the barbell. This is what holds them in place. When you let go, they should slide off easily.If you're uncomfortable, re-wrap the straps to tighten or loosen as necessary.

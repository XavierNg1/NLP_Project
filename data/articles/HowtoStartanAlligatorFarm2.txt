 An area of 800 square feet (74.3224 square meters) will house the incubation room (for integrated farms), cooler, freezer, and storage space. The grow-out building holds new hatchlings, so no nursery is necessary.
 Typical buildings are about 5,000 square feet (464.515 m2). Different designs include concrete block, wood, or metal buildings, but all are thoroughly insulated and rest on a heated concrete foundation. Hot water pipes run through the concrete to provide a consistent temperature of 86 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (30 to 31 degrees Celsius) in the building; electric heating coils can be used but are less common.
 Pools about 1 foot (0.3 m) in depth with bottoms sloping towards a drain (for easy cleaning) and decks are prepared for each pen before laying insulation board and then pouring the concrete. Pens are about 12 feet (3.7 m) long and 14 feet (4.3 m) wide; each has a deck 5 feet (1.5 m) wide for feeding and basking and a pool 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. The deck is next to the center aisle so you can feed the alligators and hose out their pens easily (and without entering the pens). A 3-foot (0.9 m) wall of concrete block separates the pen from the aisle (to prevent climbing out and escaping).


Each pen can house about 160 2-foot (0.6 m) alligators or 50 4-foot (1.2 m) alligators and be divided to separate alligators under 2 feet (0.6 m) in length (0.6 m) from those over 2 feet (0.6 m); some states require this by law. Use concrete blocks to construct a wall that creates 2 pens capable of holding 80 2-foot alligators.
 This building uses the same plans as the first but is 7,300 square feet (678.192 m2). Construct a third building of 10,300 square feet (956.901 m2) for their third year of growth.

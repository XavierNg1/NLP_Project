 To do this, simply look at the number to the right of the tens digit of the rounding number. The tens digit is the digit that is second from last in a number, before the ones digit. (If you're looking at 12, look at the number 2.) Then, if that number is less than 5, keep the rounding number the same; if it is greater than or equal to 5 round the rounding number up one digit. Here are some examples:12 --> 10
114 --> 110
57 --> 60
1,334 --> 1330
1,488 --> 1490
97--> 100

, Follow the same protocol for rounding a number to the nearest hundreds digit. Check out the hundreds digit, which is the third from last in a number, just before the tens digit. (In the number 1,234, the 2 is in the hundreds digit). Then use the number to the right of the hundreds digit, the tens digit, to see if you should round that number up or down, making the numbers after it even 00s. Here are some examples:7,891 -- > 7,900
15,753 --> 15,800
99, 961 --> 100,000
3,350 --> 3,300
450 --> 500

, The same rules apply here. Just know how to locate the thousands digit, which is fourth from the end of a number, and then check out the digit in the hundreds place, which will be to the right of that number. If the digit is less than 5, round down, and if it's greater than or equal to 5, round up. Here are a few more examples to consider:8,800 --> 9,000
1,015 --> 1,000
12,450 --> 12,000
333,878 --> 334,000
400,400 --> 400,000

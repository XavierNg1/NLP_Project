 Although your boss is the one who likely assigned you a heavy workload in the first place, keeping them informed about your time constraints will help them understand so that they don’t give you work that distracts you. Be polite and ask for their input on your workload so that you maintain good terms with them.Be courteous by explaining to your boss that you would like to work on their new assignment, but that your current deadline prevents it. Offer to work on it at another time, or refer them to a coworker you trust to do a good job.
Remember to stay flexible with your boss. If they ask you to work on a different project because the deadline is sooner than yours, be open to that distraction. Count it as part of your scheduled interruptions.
 Don’t just put up a sign on your cubicle telling your coworkers to leave you alone. Send out an email or tell them face-to-face so that no animosity develops. Explain that you have a specific time frame each day for taking interruptions, and ask them to respect your daily schedule.
 You may be able to outsource some of the work in your high volume workload by finding coworkers who are qualified. You may want to find a coworker who can do tasks that you find difficult, or find coworkers you can pass the easy work to.


Make sure whoever you recruit has a strong work ethic and has no trouble following the daily schedule you are implementing to stay on task.
 Remember that you want to maintain a pleasant work environment because disgruntled coworkers can add to your stress and distract you. To do this, be polite and kind as much as you can in your interactions.


When a coworker disregards your scheduled interruption time frame and barges in when you are especially focused, resist the impulse to be rude. Instead, say something like, “Yea, I understand what you’re saying, but I’m just focused on this project right now. Could I chat with you on my lunch break?”

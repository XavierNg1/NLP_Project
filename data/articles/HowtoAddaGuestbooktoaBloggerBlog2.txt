 If you'd rather not deal with signing up for a guestbook service, you can actually use Blogger's built-in comment features to create your own pseudo-guestbook. The comments can act as guestbook entries.
 You'll likely want your guestbook to occupy a separate page so that you can easily link to it and add a menu item for it. Open your blog from the Blogger dashboard and click "Pages". Select "New page" to open a blank page in the editor.
 You'll want to let the reader know that they're on the guestbook page. Include an introduction and a prompt to get the reader interested in leaving a guestbook comment. Ask them to leave specific information that a guestbook would ask for, such as location and personal website. Direct the reader to fill out the Comments field to leave a guestbook response.
 Once you're satisfied with the way the guestbook intro looks, you can publish it so that it's publicly available. You'll want to add a link to it on your home page or add it to your blog's navigation bar.


You can quickly add a navigation bar by opening the Layout section and selecting "Add gadget". Select "Pages" from the list of basic gadgets, and enable your guestbook page.

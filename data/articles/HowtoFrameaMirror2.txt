 Your frame should be a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) longer and wider than the mirror's measurements. Make sure your mirror is thin enough or your frame is deep enough to hold it.
 You won't want a glass in front of a reflective mirror.
 Then fit the frame over the mirror.
 A mirror is heavier than a picture, so make sure the hanging mechanism - the wire or the hooks - are strong enough to support the weight before you hang it to a wall.

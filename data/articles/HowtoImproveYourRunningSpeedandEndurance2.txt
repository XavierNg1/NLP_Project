 It’s important to loosen up your muscles before you begin to exercise. This can prevent injuries and reduces the risk of cramps while you run.Do a set of walking lunges. Take a large step forward with your right leg so that your left leg is extended far behind you. Lower yourself until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Make sure your left knee doesn’t touch the ground and that your right knee is above your right ankle! Repeat for the left leg and do ten lunges per leg.
 Hold on to a sturdy object such as a chair. Stand on one leg and swing your other leg forward and backwards. Make sure to go through your full range of motion; this means swinging your leg up as high as is comfortable and then extending it behind your back as high as you can. Repeat for both legs.


Don’t swing your leg haphazardly or you may hurt yourself. Try to swing your leg in a smooth, controlled motion.
 Even though you’ll be exhausted from running, it’s important to stretch so that your muscles don’t cramp up.Do some standing quads. Stand with your legs together. Bring your left foot behind your back to your left hand, keeping your thighs firmly pressed together. Press your foot with your hand, taking care not to overextend your leg.
 Face a wall and press your palms against the wall at chest-level. Press the ball of your left foot against the wall with your left heel on the ground. Slowly lean towards the wall, taking care not to overextend your foot. Repeat this stretch for your right foot.

 Cut slits in the tops of the tomatoes and place them in a pot of boiling water. Cook them for about 3 minutes, or until the skin begins to peel away from the meat of the tomatoes. Remove them from heat and drain the water.


You can roast the tomatoes if you don't want to boil them. Cut them into slices and place them in an oven preheated to 350 degrees. Cook until the tomatoes have lost their structure and released their juices.
 Place the cooked tomatoes in a blender. Chop the raw tomatoes into rough pieces and add them to the blender. Blend the raw and cooked tomatoes until smooth.


Be careful blending the hot cooked tomatoes. Putting hot substances in the blender may cause the blender's top to fly off.
Don't overfill the blender. You may have to blend the ingredients in more than one batch.
 Set it aside to add to the ceviche later.

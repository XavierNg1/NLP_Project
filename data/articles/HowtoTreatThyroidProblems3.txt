 If you have hyperthyroidism, your body is producing too much of the thyroid hormone. Iodine can irritate your thyroid and cause health issues, so it is not recommended for individuals with hyperthyroidism., You can take several mineral supplements once a day to help manage your hyperthyroidism, including:Selenium, 200-400 mcg/day
Zinc, 20-40 mg/day
Copper, 4-5 mg/day
Calcium: This mineral is especially important for individuals with Graves’ disease, a common disorder in people with hyperactive thyroids. Graves’ disease can cause brittle, weak bones or osteoporosis, and calcium supplements can help to reduce these risks., Start with a good, whole-food vitamin, which is derived from food rather than synthesized in a lab, and produced from food with very little processing. You can then take other vitamin supplements, including:2-3 grams of omega-3 fish oils every day. If you have Graves’ disease, you should aim for 3-4 grams of fish oil a day.
B-vitamins to increase your energy levels. Take two to three times the recommended daily amount of B-vitamins.
Anti-oxidant vitamins, such as vitamin C (2000 mg/day), vitamin E (400-800 IU/day), l-carnitine (2-4 g/day), and CoQ10 (50-100 mg/day). I-carnitine has been shown to reduce thyroid hormone production in your body. CoQ10 has been shown to be low in individuals with hyperthyroidism.
 Only take botanical supplements once you have consulted a qualified naturopathic physician. Several botanical supplements have been shown to block the production of thyroid hormones in your body, including:Lycopus spp (Bugleweed)Lithospermum officinaleMelissa officinalis (Lemon balm)Iris versicolorEmblica officinalis (Indian gooseberry)

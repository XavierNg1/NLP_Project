 The phone should be resting on a non-flammable surface with nothing around that can catch fire. If you can, carefully transport it outdoors, where you can be sure that no damage will come to your property.Place the phone on a sidewalk or other paved area where the flames won’t spread.
Never discard a burning phone without first quickly evaluating your surroundings.
 In most cases, a cell phone battery fire will die out within a few minutes. During this time, you shouldn’t get too close to the phone. If the pressure inside becomes too great, it could explode, sending fragments of glass and hot plastic flying.Caution other onlookers to stay away for their own safety, as well.
You may be able to use a deep pot or similar container with a lid to control the fire. Creating an oxygen-deprived environment will help snuff out the flames., At the first available opportunity, either blast the phone with a CO2 extinguisher or douse it with cold water. The danger may not be over if other battery cells get hot enough to react. Once you’re sure the device is safe, have the fire department come out to remove the faulty device and inspect the area for structural damage.Always follow up fire-related incidents with a call to your local authorities.

 This can be nerve-racking for sure, but it is important to discuss abstinence early on. Then you can decide if the relationship is worth pursuing.
 Again, it's possible that your sexual boundaries expectations are different, so it's best to discuss it.


If you are physically attracted to your partner, talk about sex play, outercourse, and abstinence before, not after, you become (mutually) aroused.,


If you're both okay with holding hands and kissing, and over the clothes caressing, then make that clear. If under the clothes is not okay, then be explicit about that too.
 This is easier said than done. See "Practicing Abstinence and Being (Mostly) Fulfilled" below, and cultivate your own!

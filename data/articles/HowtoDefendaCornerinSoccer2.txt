 Pick a person from the attacking team that roughly matches your height. Call out his number to your team and let them know you have him marked. Make sure everyone has someone marked.
 Keep your back parallel to the goal. Keep only a distance of two feet between you and him.
 Ask him, “How are you doing” or telling him “Your shoes are untied” (feel free to use your own phrases).
 To make sure you don’t lose him in the crowd, place your arm on his shoulder and stay on him at all times!

, Wrestle off the man using your arms and get in front. This will prevent him from the opportunity to flick the ball into his team’s path.

When the ball approaches you, kick/head it away from the goal to the side lines.

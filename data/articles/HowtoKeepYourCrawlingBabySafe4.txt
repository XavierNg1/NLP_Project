 If your stairs and walkways are littered with toys and other debris that makes it hard to walk about without stepping on something, you might fall when carrying your crawling baby. Your crawling baby might get hurt if you fall while holding them.Assign each toy a special place. For instance, you might get a large chest and place all your crawling baby’s toys in it. Place the toy chest in a special play room. When your crawling baby wants to play, take them to the play room. When playtime is concluded, replace all the toys in the toy chest.
Obtain a lidless toy chest. Otherwise, your crawling baby might accidentally slam their head in the toy chest and get injured., Holding onto the handrails will give you a greater degree of balance while navigating stairs. If you do not use the handrail, you increase your likelihood for a fall that could hurt your crawling baby.Use a baby sling while navigating stairs so that you don’t have one hand on the handrail and one hand on the crawling baby.
 To prevent your baby from suffocating in a sling, keep your baby tight to you and in view. You should be able to see their face and they should be close enough to kiss. Support your baby’s back so that they don’t slump over into your chest., For instance, do not carry a mug of tasty hot chocolate in one hand while carrying your crawling baby in the other hand. You’ll have a hard time supporting the crawling baby, and the hot chocolate might slosh all over your baby, leading to burns.Instead of carrying hot food or drink along with your baby, first carry either your crawling baby or your food. Set it down. Then, pick up the one that you didn’t carry and set it down, too.
Similarly, do not carry hot food or drink near a crawling baby. You might trip on the crawling baby and your hot food or drink could spill on your crawling baby. This will hurt your crawling baby and it will start crying.

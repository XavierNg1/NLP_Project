 Choose a level, open playing field for this game. Lay out your hula hoops in a three by three grid, just like a tic tac toe board drawn on paper. The hula hoops should be positioned so that there is little to no space between the hoops.


If you’re playing this game inside on hard floor, use masking tape to create your human tic tac toe board. On cement, you can draw the board with chalk.
Check for holes, dangerous garbage (like broken glass), and other hazards, like roots or rocks, to prevent these from causing an injury while you play.
If you’re playing this game with many people, you might want to set up several game boards. This game works best with one to three players per team.;
, Human tic tac toe can be played one-on-one or with teammates. When playing with teammates, each team should have no more than three members. Separate teams so that there are two teams per board. Teams should stand opposite of each other with the game board in between.


Playing with more than three members per team is possible, but this will slow the game down and might bore younger players., Use a coin toss to determine which team goes first. You could also have teams select a captain and have the captains play rock, paper, scissors to choose the starting team. The starting team will go first as the X’s, the opposing team with follow as the O’s.To add a more physical aspect to this game, have teams race to a location and back again. Award the first move to the team that wins the race.
 Hand each team four bean bags, with each team having a different color so you can tell X’s apart from O’s. Teams should take turns placing bean bags on the game board until one team wins or the game ends in a draw. For teams with more than one member, rotate through members until the game ends.Reset the board by removing the bean bags and play again. You may want to shuffle teams so players don’t get bored playing the same people over and over again.

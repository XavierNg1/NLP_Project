 Some people's hands will never span more than an octave.;
, Put your pinky (or thumb, depending on which hand) on C and stretch it as far as you can. Hold this position, but don't hurt yourself. The most important thing is to feel the stretch; you don't have to go far past that. Using lotion and having regular hand massages can help your hands become more flexible.
 You will usually have to span using your left hand, but occasionally, your right hand will have a large distance to cover. Play pieces that have both. Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is a good piece to use for this purpose. It includes ninths for the right hand and many octaves for the left hand. Chopin's Prelude No. 20 in C minor has octaves for both hands all the way through.
 Play a C octave harmonic scale going up and back down. Try to increase speed and try to keep your fingers spread.
 Play a C with a ninth (D) harmonic scale going up and back down, again keeping the span.

 The cubes need to be rock hard.


Pop the cubes from the trays. Transfer them to a plastic freezer bag to store in your freezer. (Leaving the cubes in the trays will expose them to food odors, minimizing their deodorizing impact.) Label and date––labeling will prevent anyone using the cubes for their drinks.
 Make a habit of dropping one cube in your disposal every night after doing the dishes. This will prevent last night’s dinner from intermingling with this morning’s breakfast.

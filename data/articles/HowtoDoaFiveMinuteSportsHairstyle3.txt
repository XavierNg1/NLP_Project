 It's a little fancier, but french braids are resilient, and still look good when they get a little messy., French braid the side of your head opposite the part until just below your ear. Make sure that the braid is very tight to your head so that it wonâ€™t come undone while you play.


French braiding your hair is the same as normal braiding, except instead of braiding straight down, you add a section of hair every time you cross over the center. Begin by crossing the right and then the left side of the braid over the middle. Then, add a small section of hair to the right side and cross it over. Do the same with the left. Continue doing this until you reach a point just below your ear. ,

Secure the ends of the hair with bobby pins (if your sport allows them) and apply hairspray to keep flyaways in place.

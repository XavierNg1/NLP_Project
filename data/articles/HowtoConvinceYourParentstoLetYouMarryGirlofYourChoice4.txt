 Tell them why YOU like her, why you LOVE her, and what, in your view, makes her the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.


“Mother, you know that studying and doing well in school has always been important to me. Well, it's important to her, too—she's currently in medical school, and studying with her this past year was what helped me pass my exams. She's smarter than any previous girlfriend I've had.”
If this girl is a total stranger to them, then you obviously have to do more preparation before having this conversation. Learn what you can about her background, so you can share that with your parents, and anticipate the kinds of questions they will have about her.
 That way, when you break the news more openly to the family, you will already have a potential ally on your side.
 Arrange for your parents to participate with you and your girlfriend in a safe activity. Once you and your girlfriend have met each others' parents, or if the vibe seems open to it, ask both sets of parents to meet with you and your girlfriend. Fix a day on the calendar (perhaps over a comfortably informal dinner) and have a good first discussion.Arrange for your girl to have some alone time with your parents (individually, or, with both simultaneously), for them to get to know her better.
If you are meeting her parents, try being a little less-talkative than you are at your place—let her advocate to her parents just as you did to yours. You should always ensure that the parents (both sides) don't feel less-respected, misrepresented, or anything bad about the situation.
If she is in the room, let the girl talk in the middle of your discussion, which will help your parents understand a little bit about her, and the way she thinks, and the way she perceives and explains things to your parents.

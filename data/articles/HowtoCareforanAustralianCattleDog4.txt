 Interactive games are important to helping your cattle dog get rid of their excess energy. Such games increase the bond between you and your dog, and they are an important part of the socialization process. Some good games you can play include:


Hide and seek
Fetch
Catch with a Frisbee
Tug-of-War

, Your cattle dog needs plenty of exercise. While some breeds will be content with one or two walks around the block, cattle dogs need long walks at least once or twice a day.This will help make your cattle dog nice and tired, preventing them from getting bored or mischievous.


If you are a runner, you might consider taking your cattle dog on a run with you. This is a great way to get the proper amount of exercise for your dog.
 While leashed walks are important, your cattle dog should have the opportunity to run off the leash as well. In a fenced yard or park, let them run and play freely. They may enjoy playing with other dogs at a dog park or merely playing alone in their backyard.
 Agility classes offer structured games, activities, and obstacle courses that are fun for both you and your dog. Because of their natural agility and high energy, cattle dogs are ideal for agility courses.You can find local agility classes online, through your vet, or through your obedience training school.

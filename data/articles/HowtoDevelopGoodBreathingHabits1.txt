 Paying attention to your posture is key to developing good breathing habits. Bad posture negatively affects our breathing and can constrict our air passages and diaphragm. Working on keeping your spine in alignment with your shoulders, neck, and head by imagining all are being suspended by a string.
Don’t slouch! It places too much pressure on your diaphragm, limiting the muscle’s function.
Stand with your feet facing forward and in alignment with your hips. Don’t stand with one hip popped out to the side.;
, Breathe in through your nose while paying close attention to how your belly fills up with air. Exhale through your mouth for at least two to three times as long as you inhaled. Observe how your belly rises and falls, and be sure to keep your shoulders and neck relaxed., Take a deep breath and then slowly let it out. When you think you’ve completed the exhale, gently try to squeeze out a little more breath. Exhaling completely can help strengthen muscles needed to proper breathing, keep you feeling energized, and help regulate your mood., Instead of using your chest and throat muscles to breathe, instead focus on your diaphragm. Breathe in and expand through the lower parts of your rib cage and upper abdomen.

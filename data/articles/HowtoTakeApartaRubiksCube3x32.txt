 In the section above, a flat head screwdriver is recommended for prying the first few pieces out of the cube. This is a good choice, but it's far from the only tool you can use. Any sort of thin, stiff lever can be a big help. A few more suggestions are below:


Spoons
Butter knives
Popsicle sticks
Skinny wrenches or nails from your toolbox

, "Filleting" is a term that refers to sanding away at two faces that slide against each other. You can do this to the edges of the Rubik's Cube layers that are in contact with each other to open a very small gap between the pieces. This will make the pieces a little easier to take apart (as well as put back together).


Use caution with this method. Sanding too much will give the cube a much "looser" feel once it's put back together. Pieces may even fall out on their own.
 Adding a little Vaseline (or a similar lubricant) between the cube's rotating layers will make them easier to remove. When reassembled, they will slide past each other much more loosely (just as with the filleting method above). However, this method has the added benefit of not making it more likely that your Rubik's Cube will fall apart in the long run.
 See our main article on reassembling a Rubik's Cube for detailed instructions. The basic process is as follows:


Start by putting the edge pieces back for the bottom layer (not the corner pieces). Match each edge piece with the center pieces remaining on the frame â€” like colors should touch.
Now, add the corner pieces to the bottom layer. Again, like colors should touch.
Add the corner pieces to the middle layer (the middle edge pieces are already held in place by the central frame.
Build the top layer one row at a time. Once you have one row finished, turn the top layer 45 degrees (just like you did when you were taking the cube apart. The last piece you add should be a middle edge piece.

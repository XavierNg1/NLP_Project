 Meditation is being aware. Listen to your breathing and try to clear your mind of other thoughts. Many find it helpful to repeat a mantra to help focus.There are many variations of meditation, choose one that best suits you.
 Breathing slowly and from deep within your diaphragm will immediately relax you. This may be difficult when your nose is clogged so try breathing from your mouth.Place your hand on your stomach and feel it push out as you inhale deeply. As you breathe all the air out, bring your stomach back to its original position. This is not a forceful motion, but rather just to ensure that you're indeed taking a deep breath from your diaphragm.
 Whether you are looking at your pet or examining your hand, focus on the present to reduce stress. Breathe slowly and focus on the moment by describing it to yourself in detail., Relax by recalling a serene location or happy memory. Whether you transport yourself to a beach or time an old college road trip, focus on details to calm your mood., Music can greatly influence your mood so choose something with a soothing melody or a song that you associate with a happy memory.Be careful not to irritate an already sore throat by singing along too loudly.

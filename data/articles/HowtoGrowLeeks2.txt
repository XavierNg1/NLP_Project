 Plant the leek seedlings at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep and 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart. Pat the soil around the base of the leak so that it covers the roots and reaches the cleft where the leaves spread apart. The process of slightly mounding the dirt in this way is called "hilling."Instead of hilling, you can help the leek stems blanch by putting a cardboard tube over each plant, so that it rests around the base. This serves the dual purpose of keeping the sun away and keeping dirt out of the leek's leaves.
 The leeks' roots are shallow, and must be protected so that they stay moist. Water the leek bed thoroughly after planting, then mulch the leek bed with straw to protect it throughout the growing season.
 Water the leeks frequently to keep them growing healthy and strong. Do not let the soil dry out. Leeks need to be given a good soaking at least twice a week, and more often if you live in a dry place with little rain.
 About halfway through the growing season, hill the soil around the base of the leeks again, so that it reaches the place where the leaves cleave apart. The higher the hill, the larger the edible white part of the leek will be. However, hilling too high can cause the leeks to rot.
 Since leeks have shallow roots, it's important to weed frequently so they don't have to compete for nutrients. Weed the leek bed frequently throughout the growing season.

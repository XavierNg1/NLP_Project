 Depending on how much of a private person you are, you may only want to tell your closest friends, or you may want everyone to know. You may find it's easier to tell your most trusted friend(s) first, and have them be there when you come out to others. It's up to your preferences and comfort level.
 It can be easier to do this as well as you only have to explain it to one person. If you are unsure or worried of how they will react, remember that if they are your friend, they will support you.


Noisy or crowded places, such as malls or busy restaurants, can make it harder to have a detailed conversation.
Avoid springing the news at an event for someone else, such as a birthday party. This day should stay focused on them; you can bring it up on a different day. Your own party is fine, though.
 When your friends arrive, don't suddenly spring it on them. Briefly say hello to them or ask how they are doing, this can help to break the tension. Once you have done this, begin by telling them you have something really important to tell them. Say that this is something really big that you feel is important for them to know. Then proceed to tell them that you are coming out.


Something like this might work: "I've learned something interesting about myself, and because I'm close to all of you, I wanted to share it. I'm asexual."
Be prepared to explain what asexuality means, and give them some time to understand.
If your friend cannot accept the fact that you are asexual, then don't focus on them. Focus on the people that accept you for who you are, and support you. In time, your friend may slowly start to accept your sexuality, and even if they don't, you still have your family and your other friends.

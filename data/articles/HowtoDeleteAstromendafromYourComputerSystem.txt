 Go to control panel click "Appearance and personalization" then "folder option" then click "show hidden files" and check the box which corresponds with it. ;
,, Files that cannot be deleted will show a remark like this: "the file cannot be deleted because it is opened in another program". 

, Click the tab that says "process" then look for the astromenda file and then right click it and it will show a box that says "end process", click it and right away go back the file location of the astromenda and delete it as fast as you can, and then empty your recycle bin.
 Click start menu and right click the astromenda tab and a box will show "file is nowhere to find", and there is another box that says "would you like to delete it from the start menu", then click delete. 

,  Also check again the “start menu” for the second time and look if there is still a tab showing the name astromenda and right click to delete it. This sounds over-kill, but this is what it is to make sure that astromenda will be gone forever in your Computer system.

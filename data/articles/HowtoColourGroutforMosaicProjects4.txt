 Cement-based grout is the most commonly used form of grout, and is also the most cost-effective of grouts available for use. Epoxy is more expensive, more difficult to install, and harder to find, so it might not be worth the effort when making your decision. But to counter its cons, it has pros of being more durable and having greater resistance to chemical and water damage., Adding sand isn’t a crucial component to grout picks, but it is advised for tiles that have spaces in between them greater than 1/8 inch. It makes grout more resistant to shrinking and cracking which is a must for bigger tile space areas., For lighter coloured grout on floors, pick a grout colourant that includes a sealant. Sealing grout combats the high traffic and moisture kitchen and bathroom areas might receive and protect the grout for much longer. Stay away from “membrane-forming” sealers and invest in breathable “penetrating” sealers instead., Darker grouts can hide stains and dirt more easily than lighter shades, but are more likely to show staining and fading from harsh cleansers. Lighter grouts tend to show more dirt. Lean towards shades that are not super light but are not super dark either.

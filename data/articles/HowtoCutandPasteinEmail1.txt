 Identify the text/images that you want to cut or paste. If you plan to cut and paste text from elsewhere into an email, make sure to open up a draft into which you can paste the text. If you are cutting and pasting within a single email to rearrange the wording, make sure that you open that email.


When you cut text, you don't need to worry about pasting it immediately. Your computer automatically saves the most recent thing that you cut or copied to a temporary "clipboard". You will still be able to paste that swatch of text until you restart your computer or cut/copy something else.
If you have Microsoft Word open when you cut and copy, your clipboard can hold multiple swatches of text at once.;
, Before you cut or paste anything, examine both the words you want to cut and the space where you want to paste them. Read the email for flow, and ask yourself where this text will best fit. If you are pasting the text of another email into a text-heavy message, for instance, you probably don't want to drop it at the top of the email with no introduction, and you probably don't want to leave it in the middle of a sentence. Think about where this new text will be most effective, and consider which words/tenses you will need to edit in order to make the pasted words flow well within the existing document., To highlight text: left-click at the beginning of the section of text that you want to select, then hold and drag the cursor to the end of the section. Dragging the cursor should highlight the text with a blue background. Release the cursor when you have highlighted all of the text that you want to select.


If you want to copy the whole message, press Ctrl+A on a PC keyboard, or âŒ˜ Command+A on a Mac.

 Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the squash.


An easier way to remove the skin involves the use of a knife.

Cut the rounded ends off the squash so that the top and bottom become flat.
Hold the squash upright on your cutting board with one flat surface on the board and the other facing you.
Hold the squash steady with one hand. Use the other hand to slice just beneath the skin on one portion of the squash. Slice all the way down the length of the squash until this strip is completely removed.
Continue slicing off other strips of skin in this manner until you make it all the way around the squash.



Remove any large, hard seeds from the squash as you come across them while grating.
 Place the shredded squash into freezer-safe plastic containers or plastic bags. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the container before sealing it.


This headspace can be very important, so you really do need to include it. Headspace gives the squash room to expand as it freezes. Without that empty space, the pressure of expanding squash can cause the container you put it in to burst or crack.
 Place the containers of squash in your freezer. Keep them there until you are ready to use them for a dish.


Frozen summer squash should stay good for 10 to 12 months.

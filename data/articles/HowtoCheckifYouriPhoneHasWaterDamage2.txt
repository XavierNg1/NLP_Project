 One of the two liquid contact indicators on these models are located in the headphone jack.
 If you see a hemisphere of red when you look directly into the jack, the liquid contact indicator has been hit.
 The second indicator can be found at the bottom of the phone, in the charging port.
 If the indicator has contacted water, you'll see a tiny red strip in the center of the port.
 If your indicator shows contact, you can |try to repair the damage yourself. There's a good chance, however, that you'll need to get a replacement, especially if the water has sat for some time.


Water damage is not covered by AppleCare, but you may be able to get a replacement from your carrier.

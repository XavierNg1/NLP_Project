During the spring and summer months, carefully watch your existing garden to see where it might benefit from early spring flowers. Keep in mind that some bulbs will bloom very early in the spring. You want a garden that maintains color for as long as possible.;

Do your research. Some bulbs will bloom earlier than others, while some may grow larger or faster. Keep this in mind when deciding what kind of bulbs you want to place. Always plan to have the larger, fuller plants bloom behind or around smaller plants. Also consider how much room you have and how much room each bulb needs. The package of each bulb will suggest how much space it needs.



Once you've identified where you want to plant your bulbs, you need to prepare the soil. Start in the summer by adding fertilizer to the ground, working it in so that the ground remains loose. Keep this area as weed free as possible.

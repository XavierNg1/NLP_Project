 With the VLC Player, the DVD that you have loaded will show up on your desktop. Move it over onto the "Drop media here." The DVD will start to play the short into from the producer of the movie, for example, Universal or 20th Century Fox.
 The previews will then begin. At this point, if you attempt to fast forward, the software will "punish you," by going back to the beginning, forcing to you to start over: quite frustrating., In the drop down menu, at the bottom, you will see CHAPTER. Take the arrow to the right and you will see different chapters., After you skip a preview, repeat the same process of going to PLAYBACK, CHAPTER, and go to the last Chapter. If you are on Chapter 1, go to Chapter 4. Eventually, it will skip to the movie that you want to watch.

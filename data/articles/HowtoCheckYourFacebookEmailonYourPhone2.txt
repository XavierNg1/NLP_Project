 Click on your phone browser to open it then type in the primary email account address that is used with your Facebook.com (the mail ID you used to sign up with Facebook), for example, gmail.com.


If your email provider has an app, like Gmail or Yahoo! Mail, you can launch the app instead.
 Type in your username/email address and password on the fields provided to log in.
 When you signed up on Facebook, you used a primary email address, and the emails your contact send to your @facebook.com account now get directly forwarded to your primary mail address. Check your inbox for any Facebook emails that have been forwarded to your mail ID.
 Just select the mail that comes from @facebook.com, and click on it to open it.

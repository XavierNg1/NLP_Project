 Also research Tracking and Squires if you can afford the 200 food. These technologies are found at the barracks. It is advised that you research Pikemen as well.


At the blacksmith, research Forging and Scale Mail Armor. The Castle blacksmith upgrades are offered, but advancing to the Imperial Age is a higher priority.
 You do not need to build any other military buildings other than the barracks, castle, and perhaps some siege workshops if you wish. The barracks should all have one common rally point and be built near the enemy base in a row.
 At least 10 Pikemen should be created in order to mitigate the Knight threat, which dominates in the Castle Age.
 Another castle or two is encouraged due to its +20 population increase.


Research Anarchy. The unique technology is critical to the Goths' attack as it allows Huskarls to be created in the barracks - very useful, because castles are expensive and stone is generally not found in abundant quantities in the game.
Build a university. Universities have some defensive upgrades like Masonry and Architecture that increases building HP. This helps a little bit with the Goth's mediocre defense.

 Cut through the drywall along the lines you drew with your pen or pencil.
 As you knock through the drywall, pull the drywall off of the studs.
 Cut through the studs with a reciprocating saw to remove them. A reciprocating saw is a portable power saw with a blade that moves up and down very fast to cut through the wood studs.
 This can include nails sticking out where the studs were, or squaring up the edges and corners of where the wall used to be.

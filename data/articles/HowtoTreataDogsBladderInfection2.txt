 Foods are available that promote the optimum urinary pH to discourage bacterial growth, and are also low in the minerals which promote crystals to form in the urine.


Examples of such diets include Hills Canine CD diet and Purina UR (canine). While your dog is recovering, only feed your dog these foods, or else the benefits of these foods will be diminished.
 If your dog refuses to eat a prescription diet, then you can add Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) to his diet. The dose of the latter is not exact and is in the range of 250 mg twice a day for a dog less than 10kg, and 500mg twice a day for dogs over 10kg.Stick within the recommended dose because if the urine becomes too acidic, this can irritate the bladder lining and mimic the symptoms of cystitis.
 The theory behind this is that cranberries contain proanthocyanidins or "PACs", which decrease bacterial attachment to the lining of the bladder. With the bacteria less able to "stick" to the bladder, they are more easily washed away when the pet urinates.A 30kg dog requires two Crananidin tablets a day.

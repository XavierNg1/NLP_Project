 A volumizing mousse can help boost the volume in your hair when you blow dry. Squeeze a golf ball size amount into the palm of your hand, and apply it to the roots of towel-dried hair to give them extra lift when you blow dry.Be sure to choose an alcohol-free mousse to avoid drying out your locks.
 When you’re blow drying your hair, a round brush is a great tool for adding volume. Use the brush to pull up at the roots of your hair and run the dryer along the sections to lock in extra height and body as you’re drying.Don’t use a metal round brush. It can become too hot when you’re blow drying, so you run the risk of burning your hair or your skin.
You can also substitute velcro rollers for a round brush. Place them at the roots of your hair all around the crown, and blow dry your hair to add volume.
 If you have natural curls or twists, attach the concentrator nozzle to your blow dryer. When your hair is already dry, begin lifting medium size sections of your hair at the roots and hitting them on low heat for approximately 10 seconds. Repeat the process for your entire head for bigger hair.After you've hit all of your roots with heat, add even more volume to your natural hair by flipping your head upside down and gently comb through just the roots with a wide tooth comb. Flip your head right side up and allow your curls to fall naturally.
 When your hair is mostly dry, bend over slightly so your head is upside down. Gravity will help lift the roots to boost volume as you finish drying your hair.Focus the blow dryer on your roots when your head is upside down to get the extra height and lift.
If you have bangs, make sure to dry them completely right side up before flipping your head upside down to finish.

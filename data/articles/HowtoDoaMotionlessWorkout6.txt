 Flex your core muscles. Bend your legs into a 90 degree angle.
 You should feel your upper abdominal muscles engage more at this point. Breathe in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds.
 Try to repeat it 2 to 3 times.


Increase the difficulty of the position by placing your hands beneath your buttocks. Stretch your feet straight out and raise your shoulders and head while you flex your core. Breathe in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds until you reach 1 minute.

 Some of the professional photography niches are the People Photographers, Event Photographers, Sports Photographers, and Photojournalists. The people photography is an umbrella term for all kinds of events concerning people; a birthday, a wedding, a birth, etc. While you can, of course, do more than one thing, a niche can set you apart from the others.
 Are there things that you like to see or do? Do you have any interests, no matter how off the wall they are?


With photography, commercially, it is better to be a specialist at one, or a few, things than a jack of all trades. When clients want to hire you, they want what they perceive as the best (at least in their price range).
 What could you spend all day photographing and never get tired of it?

, Getting out there in the 'trenches' will help you separate the interests from the desires.
 More than likely, your niche will appear when you aren't looking.
 Write down the different types of photography you have been doing under the headings of "Like and Enjoy", "Don't Care For", or some such titles. Seriously look at it and put some thought into it.;
, Do they seem to have a theme? Is there something that seldom changes? Maybe, it's a particular effect you are creating without realizing.
 Sometimes, you need that "third eye" to see what you don't think. Maybe they can help you focus.
 Who says there already has to be a "niche" for you to get into?

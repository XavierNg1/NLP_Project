 Even if you have no physical therapist, it is easy to use self-care to reduce pain and swelling caused by RA with the application of heat and cold therapies. Heat is great for stiff joints while cold numbs pain and reduces inflammation.Use heat on your joints for approximately 15 minutes by applying a hot pack, taking a bath, or taking a shower. Heat relaxes muscles and eases your pain.
Use cold treatments such as massaging joints with ice, applying cold packs, or soaking joints in cold water to dull pain.
You can alternate between heat and cold applications. For instance, you can use warm water for 3-to-4 minutes, and then use cool water for 1 minute.
 As painful as it might sound, exercise geared to the needs and capabilities of the individual is a cornerstone of RA treatment. Even without the help and knowledge of a physical therapist, low-impact aerobics and exercises that build strength and flexibility can be extremely beneficial.Gentle activities such as walking and swimming work very well.
A physical therapist can be of great assistance in creating an exercise program tailor-made for you., Although the scientific evidence is inconsistent at this time, there are many studies and testimonials that suggest eating certain foods and avoiding others may help with RA symptoms.In general, a balanced diet (which according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration should be centered on plant-based foods) seems the best over-all way to go, but you can also try adding or removing foods thought to either promote or fight inflammation.Foods to add: cold water fish; fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; extra-virgin olive oil.
Foods to avoid: meats grilled or fried at high temperature, and omega-6 fatty acids found in processed snacks and most cooking oils.

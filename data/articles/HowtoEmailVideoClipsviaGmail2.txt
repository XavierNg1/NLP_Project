 Gmail allows you to embed YouTube links into your emails. The recipients will be able to watch the video without having to visit the YouTube site if they open the message in Gmail.
 You can also use the "Insert Link" button if you want to change the text of the link to the video.


You won't see the preview of the video when you paste the link into the message.
 Send the message to any recipient you'd like. If the recipient has Gmail, they'll see a preview of the video and be able to view it from within the email. If they aren't using Gmail, the link will take them to the video on YouTube.

 Small bits of buildup can become caked on your clippers. In some cases, this may have accumulated in a crevice. This kind of unsightly buildup may even remain after sterilizing or disinfecting. Use a toothpick to scrape the buildup from your clippers.


After you've popped the buildup free from your clippers, loose remnants might remain. Wipe the area with a dry cloth after using your toothpick to remove any remaining buildup.
You may find that more rigid tools, like tweezers or a paperclip, work best to remove exceptionally stubborn buildup.
 Allowing your clippers to soak in a cleaning solution or disinfectant can cause buildup to loosen or dissolve. Generally, the longer you soak your clippers, the greater the effect of your cleaning solution or disinfectant will have.


It may be most time efficient to set an hourly alarm and periodically check your clippers to gauge whether or not they need more time to soak., You might be surprised by how effective a simple dry scrubbing with a stiff bristle brush can be. Take your brush and apply it to your clippers. Switch your scrubbing direction and angle frequently while doing so.


By changing the angle and direction of your brushing, you'll attack gunk and buildup from all sides, improving your chances of scrubbing it free.
Since buildup has a tendency to accumulate in nooks and crevices, you may want to consider a small stiff bristle brush, like a toothbrush, to have better access to these narrow spaces.

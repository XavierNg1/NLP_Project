 Using slanted-edge tweezers, pluck your eyebrows into the shape you prefer. Your eyebrows should frame your eyes, and so use your eyes as a guide for how to shape your brows. Your eyebrows should be poised directly above your tear duct, and the high point of your brow's arch should be in line with the outer side of your iris. The other end of your eye brow should end just outside an imaginary line drawn from the outer corner of your eye.Taking a shower or bath before shaping your eyebrows will open your hair follicles, making plucking easier.
If plucking is painful, consider applying a topical numbing creme to your brows prior to plucking.
Experts recommend refraining from plucking for 3 weeks, in order to avoid over-plucking.
 Magnifying mirrors can overemphasize your eyebrows, and you might pluck too many. Using a regular mirror in a well-lit room is the best way to pluck your eyebrows.


Take a step back periodically to see your eyebrows from a distance. This will give you a better sense of what your brows look like to other people.
Remember, other people will only be looking at your eyebrows in ordinary light.
 Many people choose to only apply bleach to the tops of their eyebrows, where plucking may result in unnatural looking lines. If you use bleach on the tops of your eyebrows, the result is a natural looking eyebrow where stray or dark hairs are lightened.Bleaching can also be used to lighten any hairs between your two eyebrows.
Be very careful whenever applying any chemical near your eyes. If you accidentally get bleach creme in your eyes, rinse with water immediately.

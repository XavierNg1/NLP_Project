 For examples buy one of those modeling dolls from a craft store or look in the mirror. Making your pose realistic is important, but start of with something basic, a person standing with hands behind their back. Draw a large circle for the hips, the legs connected on.;
,, Draw circles/oblongs around your lines, making sure again it's realistic. If you're a man, start off drawing men, if you're a woman start by drawing a woman. Start off according to your gender and learn to know the male/female body better before you draw any boy/girl characters. Turn your dots into larger circles, for example, around the knees (this eventually makes the kneecap).
 Women have a slimmer waist while a man's is less defined. Add some lines for the neck and make some triangle shapes for the feet. Erase all the original 'skeletal' lines leaving only your border.
 You can basically design any clothes but an important part is the fold. They make the look realistic (that ever so important word again). Start basic though, a simple robe or something. If you need help, get a rag and hang it the same way. Gravity applies to fabric as well so make sure it falls the right way.
 You'll soon see the difference.

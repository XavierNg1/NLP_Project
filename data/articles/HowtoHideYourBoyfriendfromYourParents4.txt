 Have girl friends over, too. Emphasize to your parents that these boys are just friends. The more regular and neutral these visits, the better to warm your parents up to the idea of external male figures in your life.
 As weird as it may sound, band your boyfriend with the rest at first. If you've played it cool enough, your parents won't suspect a thing.
 After a while, your parents will probably loosen up and become used to having him around. This way when (and if) you choose to introduce him to them as your boyfriend, they won't be as disapproving. They will know him and have seen you interact, and they will know that it is a healthy relationship.


Never close the door to your room. That just calls for your parents to get suspicious. Have a very open and casual "friendship" with him in front of your family so that they are not uncomfortable or second-guessing anything.
 Once they are friendly with him and are used to having him around, you may choose to tell them about him or continue with how you're going. Whether they like him or not generally plays a large role in that.

 After you’ve had some practice comparing decimals, this step will no longer be necessary, but writing out the decimals will force you to pay attention to the numbers. You can write the decimals you’re comparing out in one of several ways including both side by side, vertical, and table.
 If you’re most comfortable comparing numbers written side-by-side, write the decimals out this way. Most math problems dealing with inequalities are written this way. A side by side decimal comparison would be the following:


0.6 = 0.60
.34 > .10
502.50 < 599.22
2000.00 > .001

, You may find it easier to compare decimals by writing each decimal on top of the other, as you would if you were adding them. If you write the numbers vertically, write them so the decimal points line up vertically. , Make a grid, filling in each space with a digit or a decimal point, again making sure that the decimal points line up vertically.

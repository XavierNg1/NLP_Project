 Once your stretch marks have faded to a slightly silvery color, it isn't difficult to help them blend in with the rest of your skin. One way of doing this is by using fake tanner to give yourself a light tan. This is a good solution in the summer when you want to bare stretch marks on your belly and sides. Purchase a gradual tanning lotion and use it to even out your skin tone.Don't get a "real" tan by sunbathing. The sun's rays could cause skin damage and ultimately make your stretch marks look worse.
Follow the instructions on the packaging to get a realistic-looking tan. There's no need to go overboard. Just tanning a shade or two darker will help to hide your stretch marks.
 If you want to temporarily hide your stretch marks, you can use the same makeup you use to hide blemishes on your face. This works best for stretch marks that are on a part of your body that won't rub against clothing. Choose foundation the same color as your skin tone. Follow these steps for a natural-looking appearance:Apply a light layer of foundation over the stretch marks and the surrounding skin.
Blend with a foundation brush.
Apply a layer of translucent powder to set the foundation.

 Wearing a shirt underneath a dress shirt can help reduce or eliminate outwardly visible stains. Your undershirt will “catch” the stains, preventing them from getting on your nicer clothing.;
, You may want to wear pads that absorb your sweat and block it from your clothing, known as dress shields, underarm shields, or underarm pads.


If using disposable shields, remove the covering of the adhesive backing to these disposable pads and stick the shield to the underarm of your shirt.
If using reusable shields, read the instructions about how to wear the shields. Some have straps that go over your shoulder, some pin to clothing or bra straps, and some are meant to be sewn into clothing.
 If you wash your shirts daily, before the stain has time to set in, the shirts will not become stained. If you cannot do a full load of laundry, rinsing the shirt and rubbing a dab of detergent or a sodium percarbonate (also known as “oxygen bleach”) on the armpit area may help.
 Traditional cotton weave tends to show sweat stains worse than other materials. Microfiber or “smart weave” materials can help repel sweat stains.

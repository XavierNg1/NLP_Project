 Bathing removes the oils, dirt, dead skin bacteria that you accumulate every day and is essential to having good hygiene. Showering frequently is the most important hygienic habit you can develop for your hair and skin.


If you don't have access to a shower, a cloth and some water will help remove dirt and irritants from your skin.
Showering too frequently can be bad for your skin as well -- once a day is enough.
 Long showers don't only waste water and electricity, they can clog your pores and dry out your skin. The heat is also tough on your hair. A short shower is all you need and will promote healthy skin.
 Using soap and a loofah, sponge, or washcloth, wash your entire body well to scrub off dirt and skin. This allows new skin to grow and prevents infections or excess bacteria.


Be sure to wash the areas you don't immediately think of -- feet, butt, genitals, and back.
Use deodorant or perfume after showers in the morning.
Try blasting 10-20 seconds of cold water right before you get out of the shower to close your pores and prevent sweating when you get out. , Shampoo removes dirt and grime, but it also strips your hair of natural oils needed for clean, healthy hair. Many dermatologists believe it is actually healthier to shampoo every few days than daily. When you wash your head, be sure to scrub you scalp lightly with your fingers to remove dead skin cells.
Always use conditioner after shampooing to return healthy oils back to your hair.

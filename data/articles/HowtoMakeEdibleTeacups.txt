Some of the cones may break as you do this, don't be too concerned!;
,,, Glue to the side of the cup using decorator's icing.
 Once you're satisfied it has set well, fill with candies, chocolates or other goodies.
 If you have lots to make, set up a production line using helpers. One person can glue the gummy rings to the cookies, another can cut the cups, while another can glue on handles, etc. It's a fun way to prepare for a party together and definitely reduces the time needed to make the edible teacups.
 To display, choose from one of these suggestions, or come up with your own idea:


Arrange a set of teacups on a serving tray covered in a pretty cloth and leave on the party table.
Place each edible teacup on a real saucer and serve individually.
Place each edible teacup on a paper doily for individual collection from a table display.
Arrange the individual edible teacups on a cake stand or cupcake stand.

 Sharpening with a knife improves the pencil's ability to shade and draw. Take care not to over sharpen, or the tip might break with pressure.


When using a completely new pencil, start 1–2 centimeters (0.4–0.8 in.) from the top and start peeling away from your body. Do this around the whole pencil until you get a nice, sharp tip.;
, Writing the title acts like a constant reminder of what you are doing and are trying to achieve.
 The best thing to do when you don’t have any ideas for the drawing is to draw a line. Drawing a line gives you a start to build from, ready to fill the paper with your ideas. And every cartoon robot starts with a line.
 This can go in many different ways, so use your imagination. Stick to the guidelines of a robot: edges, squares, rectangles, and a metallic appearance. Shade the edges lightly, as a reminder for later, in-depth shading.
 The head should connect to the body in a creative way, not just sit on top of it. For example, you can draw a fork connecting the body and head, or connect them with springs and hydraulics for movement. Feel free to add more technological parts at this point.


It is crucial for there to be depth in the drawing. This can be achieved by drawing 3D figures, using shading and perspective to give it a sense of depth. In the example drawing, the shading is done on the right side of the picture, which gives an effect as though light were shining on the robot from the left side.
 Once again, use your imagination to connect the pats together. In our example drawing, we have used hydraulics and motors to show the nature of the robot. Perspective and angle are important, as are outlining the edges.
 Add something else besides the robot to act as a complement for the robot.
 Add details like darkening the shadings and outlining the edges. Add a logo or name for personalization. Erase any errors made, and you're done!

 A prepaid card functions almost exactly like a debit card; you receive no credit and can only charge what you have deposited in the account. American Express does not report your transactions with a prepaid card to the credit bureaus and so it will not influence your credit score. However, American Express does keep an internal record of your transactions with the prepaid card. If you use the card frequently and consistently deposit money on it, American Express might invite you to apply for a card with more stringent requirements.

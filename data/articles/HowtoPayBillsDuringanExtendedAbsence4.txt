 If don’t use online banking or aren’t sure how to set up the automatic bill pay feature through online banking, then the easiest thing to do is just head to your local branch.


Doing this in person will make sure that it is set up correctly, and will also give you a chance to ask any questions about how the service works.
 Your bank will be able to tell you exactly what information you need to provide them, but at minimum you will need the name of the company, how much the bill will be (if you know), when it is due, and any account numbers related to the bill.


Having this list written up in advance will help you make sure that you’ve covered every single bill.
 If your bill must be paid using a check, your bank may be able to send a check directly to the company on your behalf. If the company offers online bill pay, then the bank can make a direct debit transfer to the company.Some banks may offer bill pay through direct debit, but not via paper checks. Other banks may offer to send checks, but not have a direct debit scheme. Be sure to clarify this with your bank.
 When you are setting up your automatic bill pay, make sure that you know the due date of the bill, and try to have it paid a few days in advance if it is possible. This will eliminate the risk of late payments.In some cases, such as with credit cards, paying a bill even a day late can be very harmful to your financial health.

 When a catfish bites, let the line go a bit slack and then start reeling it in, quickly. Read How to Reel in a Large Fish to learn proper reeling techniques.
 Make sure the fish meets the size requirements for keeping fish in your region.


If the fish is too small, you will have to unhook it and set it free.
If you plan to keep the fish, place it in a bucket of water so that you can clean and skin it later.

 The zest of a lemon is the skin and includes the natural oils that occur in the lemon. To extract the lemon's zest, use a kitchen tool to get the yellow peel off of the surface of the lemon.You can also remove the zest from the peel of the lemon after you freeze whole lemons.
 Once you're done zesting your lemons, transfer the zest to a zip lock or freezer bag. You can use the rest of the lemons in recipes that you make during the week, or you can slice them and freeze as well.
 Allow the zest to sit in the freezer for a couple of hours or overnight until it all freezes. When you are ready to use it, you can take out what you need and place the rest back into the freezer.


Zesting lemons after they are frozen will help keep the rind oils from spraying onto your cutting board.

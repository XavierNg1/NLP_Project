 For general cleaning, pass the microfiber cloth over the entire band. Most of the time, this will remove all debris., In a bowl, mix a finger-sized dollop of liquid laundry or dish detergent with the water. The water must be cold to avoid bleeding the nylon. Choose a mild detergent such as Dawn, especially when using dish soap, to avoid wearing out the bandâ€™s fibers.Another way to do this is to put the soap on your finger, get the band wet, and use your finger to spread the soap.
 Dip a soft cloth into the mixture. Unless your tracker is removed or waterproof, use the cloth to spread the soapy water. The soap will help fight tough stains as well as smells., Dampen a soft cloth with cold water and use it to wipe away all the soap. Otherwise, for removed or waterproof trackers, rinse off the soap under cold water., Place the band in a cool, dry location out of direct sunlight. Heat and humidity will damage the band. After a few hours, it will feel dry to the touch.

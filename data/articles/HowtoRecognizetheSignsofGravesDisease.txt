You should tell the doctor about symptoms and the suspicion of Graves' disease. The doctor may conduct a physical examination that includes checking the neck for a goiter, which is an enlargement of the thyroid gland.
Have the doctor draw blood for tests. The thyroid function tests are blood tests that determine how much thyroid hormone is in the blood. Antibody tests check the antibodies in the blood that indicate Graves' disease. The radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) indicates how much iodine the thyroid uses to make hormones.
 If the tests confirm that a person has Graves' disease, the physician discusses the treatment option available. However, if the tests don't confirm the suspicion, then the physician may take additional tests for any other medical conditions.

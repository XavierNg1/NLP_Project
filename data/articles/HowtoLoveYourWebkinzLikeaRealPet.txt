 It could be a regular webkinz, a little kinz, or a Webkinz JR.! Anything Webkinz-like is fine. Also, make sure you like the animal Webkinz you are choosing. If you don't like the animal you picked, you might not have a great time with that webkinz!;
, Go on your computer and type in www.webkinz.com and log in and press adopt a new pet! If you don't have an account, make a new account. Make a room for your webkinz, visit webkinz once a day, or enroll your pet in the Kinzville Academy!

, Make your Webkinz a home in real-life! You could make a little space in your room, their room! In your room, you could also make a Kinzville Academy or a W Shop! Make Webkinz come to life!

, If you want to make them act like a real pet, play with them! A real pet would die or run away if they are lonely!

, Webkinz LOVE to explore on and off the computer! Take them with you to the park or even in your backyard would satisfy them! You could bring them in a little bag.
 Feed them on and off the computer! Remember, if your webkinz was a real pet, you would have to feed them too!

, If they are dirty after a long day of activities, they probably look a little dirty. So go in your bathroom, get a wash clothe, wet it, out a penny size soap on the wash clothe and rub it on your webkinz. Don't put to much water and soap or else your webkinz will get ruined.
 Your Webkinz would get really upset if they are bored. So play with them!, Just because they have fur, doesn't mean they won't wear clothes!

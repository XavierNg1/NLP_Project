 Assuming you've ascertained that your roof is safe to stand on, and that you're comfortable doing so, set up your ladder right next to the house. Fill a satchel with the chimney brush and extensions, sling it over your shoulder, and climb the ladder.


If you feel any trepidation at the thought of climbing a ladder or standing on your roof, clean your chimney from the bottom instead, using the method outlined below.
If you're unsure about the quality of your roof, or if your roof is slanted and you're not sure you'll be able to keep your balance, use the other method.
 Attach the first piece of pipe to the brush. Insert the brush into the chimney. Using up and down motions, begin to scrub the flue clean. Add another section of pipe to enable you to extend the brush further down the chimney. Continue in this fashion until you've cleaned the length of the flue.


If you are using the rope and weight method, attach the weighted rope to the brush. Hold the end of the rope and lower the brush into the chimney. Lift it up and down in a scrubbing motion along the entire length of the flue.
 Place the supplies in your satchel and climb back down the ladder.
 Use the small wire brush to clean the bottom of the flue that you may have missed with the brush.

 Designate an area of the house as your dog’s area, so that they have a place to retreat if things get too intense or loud with the new baby or other person in the house. You could give them the laundry room or another small room as a retreat space. A dog crate could also be used.Dog crates range from $20 to $200.
You could also purchase a new bed for your dog.
 When the new person arrives, you should give your dog a sense of freedom to smell the person, as long as the individual is comfortable with the situation. You should make sure the doors are open and there are plenty of exits, so that your dog does not feel trapped.


For instance, do the introductions in an open area of the house and leave all of the doors open.
 You could ask the new family member or visitor to offer the dog a treat. This could give your dog a favorable impression. Give the new family member a dog treat. Tell them to ask your dog to “come,” “sit” or perform another basic command that they know. If your dog follows the command, get the new family member to give the treat.


You could also try standing alongside the new family member while they ask your dog to perform the command.
If you need to try a different tactic, you could ask your dog to come and sit while standing next to the new family member. Once the dog has performed the command, get the new family member to offer the treat.
Do not let him feed by hand because the dog might take it as a threat or as an alarm. Instead he can place it in his designated eating bowl.

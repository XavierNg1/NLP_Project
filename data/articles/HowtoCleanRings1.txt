 You may know that the ring is gold, silver, or brass. However, you may not know the type of metal if you haven't bought the ring yourself. Take the ring to a jeweler, and he or she should be able to tell you how to clean the specific metals and gems that make up your ring.;
, Each metal reacts uniquely with various chemicals. It is important that you treat each metal with care to ensure that it lasts a long time.


Clean gold with a soft cloth and a commercial gold cleaner. Avoid soap and chlorine.
Silver usually needs a clean cloth and some water. You can also buy special silver cleaners.
Diamonds need a special cleaning solution. Visit a jeweler or search online for diamond-specific cleaning products.
For cheap rings—the kind you might buy in a dollar store—use only your fingers to scrape off the grime.

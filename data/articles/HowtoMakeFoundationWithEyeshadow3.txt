 Apply some foundation to half of your face and use a mirror to test the color blend against the natural half of your face.Dip the tip of a foundation brush into the foundation and gently apply it to your skin. Use a polishing brush to blend from the center of your face outward. This will provide a smooth texture.Use a mirror to make sure the foundation color matches your skin color. If you are satisfied, apply foundation to the other half of your face for a completed, even look.
 If you are not satisfied that the color of your foundation matches your skin, modify the mixture.


If it is too light, add eye shadow to darken it. If it is too dark, add moisturizer to lighten the mixture, or start again and use less eye shadow. Every skin type and color is different. No specific, given amount is perfect for everyone. Use the suggested amounts here as a loose guide.

DIY cosmetics are a kind of experimentation. You may have to play around with amounts and ingredients until you have a personalized foundation that you are happy with., When you are happy with the foundation, store it properly in an airtight container to prevent drying.


A small Tupperware container will work very well for storage. Simply pour your foundation from the mixing bowl into the storage container. Be careful not to spill when pouring, as the foundation may stain surfaces.
Be storage-conscious. Store your foundation in a dry place away from direct sunlight. Do not store your makeup in the bathroom as humidity from the shower can cause bacteria growth. Air, sun, and humidity will all cause your cosmetic to go bad quickly.

 Show up on time or early, dressed and ready to play. Ensure you follow instructions and take part in the various field activities. Rather than chatting with your teammates, pay attention when your coach is talking, and work hard throughout practice to improve your skills, ball handling, field play, and conditioning. Take practice as seriously as you take games, and you'll see noticeable results in your playing.
 Identify areas you need to improve on and work on them yourself. For example, if you struggle to control the ball in the air, practice juggling for fifteen minutes each night. Pick small, easily identifiable skills and work to improve them on your own.
 Confidence is a major factor in any regular player. If you believe in yourself, then your team will definitely believe in you. This will also become evident in the way you play: you will become more aggressive and dominant a player as your confidence increases.
 Take the game seriously, and work hard both on and off the field. In addition to improving your play, this gives your coach or manager a good impression of a good player.
 If you are accorded a few minutes of play on a match day, do your best for as long as you're on the field. Give it your all and work to impress your coach, but more importantly, try to help your team in any way you can. Work with your teammates rather than trying to show off your skills with the ball. And if you can, it never hurts to please the fans. Being a fan favorite can be a very big advantage.
 Strive to be at your best and you will experience that 90 minutes eventually.

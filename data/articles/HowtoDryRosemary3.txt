 Rinse the rosemary and shake or blot it dry, or use a salad spinner to remove excess moisture.
 Run the dehydrator at a low heat setting (between 95 and 105 degrees F) until the rosemary stems break when bent.Herbs that are more delicate crumble when dry, but rosemary leaves are more likely to break, much like the stems.
 Transfer the dried rosemary to a clean, glass jar and seal tightly. Store in a dry, dark cupboard.

 Once you have picked the correct compression gear for your situation, you can start compression therapy. The compression gear acts as an extra muscle, which helps to push the blood in your legs, arms, or other affected area through the veins and back to your heart.


Compression therapy also stimulates the muscles to decrease the swelling in the ankles or wrists. This happens because the blood that does not flow back to the heart builds up as fluids, which can leak into the tissues and cause swelling., When you talk to your doctor, you will be given specific guidelines on how long to wear your compression gear every day as part of your therapy. Your doctor will also let you know long your rest periods should be each day.


Often, your compression gear will worn during the day and removed while you sleep., In compression therapy, the main purpose is to improve blood flow. This is obtained by supporting and strengthening your veins. When your veins work properly, they return blood to your heart, but they only have one-way valves leading toward the heart. The action of your muscles helps to move blood through your veins.


An injury, being overweight, or having blood clots will block the return of the blood to your heart, which can cause serious chronic blood flow problems., To help along your compression therapy, you need to try to be as active as possible. This works with your compression therapy to keep your blood moving. Since spending long periods of time sitting or not moving at all removes one of the major ways blood can be moved back to the heart, being active helps your blood start moving again.


If you have a mobility problem, look into low impact movement, such as water therapy or swimming.

 Running, biking, swimming, and jumping rope are all good choices for this exercise.


This routine does not spot-target your abdomen, but it does provide you with the cardio you need to melt excess fat. If you tend to gather excess fat around the middle, performing this as a part of your daily exercise regimen may help you lose more of that fat.
 Spend 10 minutes increasing your level of exercise from easy to moderate intensity.

At easy intensity, you should be able to hold a conversation with little to no problem. At moderate intensity, you should be able to hold a conversation but should only be able to speak in intervals of three or four words.
For instance, if you plan on running, work up from a walk to a jog.
 Each sprint should be 30 seconds long, and the sprints should be separated by 30-second intervals or light recovery exercise.

During your sprints, you should exercise at full intensity. Exert enough energy to become breathless.
Keep moving during your recovery periods. Walk or jog slightly.
 For 10 full minutes, perform your chosen exercise at moderate intensity without pausing to recover.

Again, during moderate intensity exercise, you should be able to speak but only in groupings of three to four words.
 Repeat your sprinting procedure, performing 10 additional 30-second sprints of intense exercise with 30-second intervals for rest in between.

Continue moving during your recovery periods by walking or lightly jogging.
 Finish up with 5 minutes of easy intensity exercise to wind your body down slowly.

 Try getting to level 5, and then go to Flaris, and talk to Losha's (the Food NPC) sister. She should have a question mark or exclamation mark over her head. Talk to her and you will receive a quest; go to Leren Mnts and find Yorrn, her dog, and bring it back. You will receive 15,000 penya.;
,, The amount of Penya you sell them for differs on each server; each server has a different 'economy'.
 These monsters drop huge amounts of penya. You can stay and level there from level 60-65. They also are known for dropping a lot of sunstones.
 Some giants drop rare weapons or equipment. You can go to an NPC and sell your drops there or go to Channel 1 and open up a Private shop and sell the items at your own price.
 If you have GPotatoes, you should buy some Scrolls of Protect or something that people usually shout for and have good prices on.

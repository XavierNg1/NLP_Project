 Converting a PDF file to a Word document will allow you to edit the file just like a standard document. For smaller PDF files, you can convert them for free using a variety of free websites. If you plan on converting a lot of files, or have very large PDFs to convert, you will want to download a conversion program.


For ease of editing, choose the “.doc” format when converting the file. This will allow you to open it in almost any word processor.
 Make any font changes that you would like. Chances are the fonts from the PDF file will not have transferred 100% correctly.


Converting the document will sometimes result in formatting errors. Always thoroughly check the converted document for any problems.
 Click "Save As" and select the "PDF" format. This will convert the file back into PDF format.

 Gallons can be imperial or US Imperial gallons are used in the UK, and US gallons are used in the US. Since these two types of gallons are not the same, the conversion formula will be different depending on which type of gallon you are converting from.

If the problem does not specify which type of gallon, and you are a student in the United States, it is probably safe to assume that you are converting from US gallons.

Outside of the United States, it is probably safe to assume that you are converting from the imperial gallon.

, The formula is L/100km=282.48xmpg{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}={\frac {282.48}{x\;{\text{mpg}}}}}.Substitute the number of miles per gallon into the formula, then divide. The quotient will give you the equivalent number of liters per 100 km.

For example, if you are converting 24 miles per imperial gallon to liters per 100 km, you would calculate:L/100km=282.4824{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}={\frac {282.48}{24}}}L/100km=11.77{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}=11.77}So, 24 MPG (imperial) is equal to 11.77 L/100km.
 The formula is L/100km=235.21xmpg{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}={\frac {235.21}{x\;{\text{mpg}}}}}.Plug the number of miles per gallon into the formula. Divide the MPG into 235.21. The result will be the converted number of liters per 100 km.

For example, if you are converting 24 miles per US gallon to liters per 100 km, you would calculate:L/100km=235.2124{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}={\frac {235.21}{24}}}L/100km=9.8{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}=9.8}So, 24 MPG (US) is equal to 9.8 L/100km.

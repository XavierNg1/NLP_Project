Try eating foods rich in biotin, fatty acids, B vitamins, folic acid, niacin and protein. These foods include salmon and other fatty fish, eggs, nuts, avocados and lentils., A lot of damage can happen at nighttime when your hair rubs against your pillow, absorbing moisture from the hair and causing breakage.

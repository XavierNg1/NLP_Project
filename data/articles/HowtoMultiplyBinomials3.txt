 General formulas allow you to simply plug in your numbers instead of calculating FOIL every time. Binomials that are raised to the second power, like (x+2)2, or the third power, like (4y+12)3, can be fit into a preexisting formula easily, making solving fast and easy. To find the general formula, we replace all of the numbers with variables. Then, at the end, we can plug our numbers back in to get our answer. Start with the equation (a + b)2, where:



a stands for the variable term (ie. 4y - 1, 2x2 + 3, etc.) If there is no number, then a = 1, since 1 * x = x.

b stands for the constant being added or subtracted (ie. x + 10, t - 12).
 (a + b)2 may look more complicated than our earlier example, but remember that squaring a number is just multiplying it by itself. Thus, we can rewrite the equation to look more familiar:


(a + b)2 = (a + b)(a + b)

, If we use foil on this equation we'll get a general formula that looks like the solution to any binomial multiplication. Remember that in multiplication, the order you multiple does not matter


Rewrite as (a+b)(a+b).

First: a * a = a2


Inner: b * a = ba

Outer: a * b = ab

Last: b * b = b2.

Add the new terms: a2 + ba + ab + b2


Combine like terms: a2 + 2ab + b2


Advanced Note: Exponents and radicals are considered to be hyper-3 operations, while multiplication and division are hyper-2. This means that properties of multiplication and division do not work for exponents. (a+b)2 does not equal to a2 + b2. This is a very common mistake among people.
 Let's take equation (x+2)2. Instead of doing FOIL all over again, we can plug in the first term for "a" and the second term for "b",


General Equation: a2 + 2ab + b2

a = x, b = 2
x2 + (2 * x * 2) + 22


Final Answer: x2 + 4x + 4.
You can always check your work by performing FOIL on the original equation, (x+2)(x+2). You will get the same answer every time if done correctly.
If a term is subtracted, you still have to keep it negative in the general equation.
 Given the binomial (2x+3)2, you must remember that a = 2x, not simply a = 2. When you have complex terms, you need to remember that both the 2 and the x are squared.


General equation: a2 + 2ab + b2

Substitute for a and b: (2x)2 + 2(2x)(3) + 32

Square every term: (22)(x2) + 14x + 32


Simplify to final answer: 4x2 + 14x + 9

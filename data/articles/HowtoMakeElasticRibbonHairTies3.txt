 Some stores sell it as "elastic ribbon." You can find it online and in fabric shops. It looks like a smooth elastic with a crease running down the middle. You can get it in all sorts of colors and patterns.
 You need the elastic to be long enough to wrap around your head like a headband, minus a few inches/centimeters (remember, it will stretch). Listed below are a few suggested measurements:Baby: 12 to 14 inches (30.48 to 35.56 centimeters)
Child: 15 to 17 (38.1 to 43.18 centimeters)
Adult: 18 to 20 (45.72 to 50.8 centimeters)

, You don't have to do this, but it will help prevent fraying. The glue in the next step can only do so much.
 Place a drop of fabric glue on one end of your ribbon, design-side-out. Bring the other end of the ribbon over the first one until they overlap by about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Press it into the glue, blank-side-down., You can use pins, brooches, hair clips, or other embellishments.If this is for an infant or a young child, choose something soft, like a ribbon bow. Glue it over the seam with fabric glue.

 Surgery should only be considered as a last resort if you are suffering from several conditions due to your horseshoe kidney. The risk of the surgery done to separate the two kidneys is actually very high, so it is only done in very severe cases. For the most part, surgery is done to fix conditions caused by horseshoe kidney, and is done less often to actually separate the kidneys.The surgery to separate a horseshoe kidney involves three separate surgeries in which a surgeon will work to separate, repair damage, and reconstruct your kidneys.
 If you suffer from frequent kidney stones and choose to have your kidneys surgically separated, the surgeon will remove your kidney stones at the same time.


Again, having surgery done to separate kidneys is risky, so you should consider getting the kidney stones removed via medication and safer surgical practices (see Method 2 for more information).
 If a kidney tumor, particularly a cancerous tumor, is found it will have to be removed surgically to make sure that it does not cause your kidney further complications. Talk to your doctor about the different procedures available and what would work best for you based on your medical history.During a kidney tumor removal, the tumor will be dissected and the surrounding tissue will be removed.
 Ureteropelvic Junction “UPJ” Obstruction can occur in people who have horseshoe kidney. Because your kidneys are joined, your ureter (the duct that carries urine from your kidney to your bladder) can be in a position where it becomes bent or kinked. Surgery will be done to correct this so that your urine can flow in a normal way through your body.


It is important to get surgery if you have UPJ obstruction because it can cause your kidney to dilate (open up) and can lead to cause abdominal pains, nausea, side back pain, weakness and severe colic. You may also see blood in your urine. It can also lead to a series of kidney infections.

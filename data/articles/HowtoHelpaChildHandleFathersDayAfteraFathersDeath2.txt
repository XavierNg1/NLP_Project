 If you remember a specific meal that their father liked, plan to have that for Father’s Day. You could invite friends and family over for a barbeque, or just go out to their father’s favorite restaurant. If the child is interested, you could let them help cook the meal., You can take the child to their father’s final resting place. This might be a cemetery, or a mountainside where his ashes were scattered. Either way, it can help a child to go to the physical place that they associate with their father. This will give them a sense of closeness to him., Instead of going to Dad, you could bring him with you. Wherever you and/or the child go that day, bring a picture of their dad. This will give them the sense that they are spending time with him in some way. Looking at the picture(s) also serves as a way to recognize their father., If there is a particular sport that the child’s father enjoyed, take them to a game. Cheering for a favorite team will make them feel close to their father again. If their team is too far away or the sport is not in season, watch recordings of old games and have a sports party., Turn on some music that the child’s father would have enjoyed, or just sit quietly. Allow both of you time to think about the man that you knew and miss. You can also reflect by writing in a journal or making some form of art.For example, you could encourage the child to draw a picture of themselves with their dad.

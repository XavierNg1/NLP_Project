 Protein helps your child to grow. They also help in the production and renewal of cells. Consider making your child a sandwich that contains proteins. Foods that contain protein include:


Meats like turkey, beef, pork, and chicken.
Fish like tuna, salmon, and halibut.
Cheese like mozzarella and cheddar.
Tofu, beans, and eggs.
 Carbohydrates, or carbs, help to boost your child’s energy levels. However, there are some carbs that are better than others. Avoid giving your child simple sugar carbs like candy. Instead, give your child complex carbs like:


Whole grain products like whole wheat bread, or whole grain pasta.
Brown rice.
Green vegetables like spinach.
Starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes or corn.
Lentils, beans, peas and other legumes.
 Vitamins and minerals can help to boost your child’s immune system and keep their body functioning properly. Fiber helps to keep your child’s digestive system running smoothly.


Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
 Calcium helps to build strong bones and teeth. It is an important part of a growing child’s diet. Choose low-fat dairy products to give your child, rather than whole-fat. Some dairy products include:


Yogurt and cheese.
If you pack milk, make sure it is in a thermos where it will not spoil.
 While keeping nutrition in mind is important, you should also think about what your child likes to eat. If you struggle to get your child to eat certain veggies at home, it is very unlikely that they will eat that particular veggie at school when you are not there.


Send the food that you child loves and will definitely eat without your supervision.

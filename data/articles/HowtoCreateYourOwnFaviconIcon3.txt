 Many website editors come with a built-in form that allows you to upload your favicon to your website automatically. If you are using a website editor that has this built in, look for options that say "Upload Favicon" or "Add Favicon" in your website's settings menu. Select your favicon.ico file and upload it to your site.If you can't find a place to upload your favicon on your website editor, you'll have to do it manually.
 If your website supports File Transfer Protocol or FTP, then you can use your FTP client to upload your new favicon.icon file to your root(index) directory.If not, then you'll have to go to your web hosts page and upload the image manually. Remember to replace the existing favicon.ico file with your new file., Find the place where you can access the PHP and CSS files for your site. Go to your site's header.php file and edit it. Under the <header> tag type, "<link rel="shortcut icon" href="<?PHP echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri();Â ?>/favicon.ico" />". This should connect your site to your favicon.Because you're using PHP, it means that any sites that use your header file will now have the same favicon.
 Once you're done uploading the favicon you can refresh your browser to see your new image next to the address bar. To go directly to an image of your updated favicon, type, "http://www.yourdomain.com/favicon.ico."If your favicon does not initially appear, you may have to reset your browser's cache.

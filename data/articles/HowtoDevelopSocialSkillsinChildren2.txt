 It is important to discuss feelings with your toddler. Through your discussion of how they feel, they begin to learn words associated with those feelings and can later use those words to talk out their feelings. This will help them transition to talking about feelings instead of acting out their frustrations.You might say something like “I know you are sad that it is bedtime, but we can play with your toys again tomorrow.”

, It is important to observe how your children play and act out to understand their feelings. By watching and understanding your toddler’s feelings you can more effectively discuss them. You can also teach your toddler to express their feelings in more socially constructive ways.If your toddler is angry, you might say something like “I know that you are upset that the candy is gone, but you cannot hit people. Instead, you can show us you are upset by taking a deep breath and just telling us you are upset.”

, Toddlers need to understand what is expected of them. They will naturally push the boundaries, but if you set firm limits and give explanations for those limits, most toddlers will begin to respect the rules. This gives them the structure and boundaries they need to feel secure.Emphasize the positive aspects of rules with your toddler. For example, explain that the your child must get enough sleep tonight so that he or she can have more fun tomorrow.
 Babies do not interact very well with each other, but once children start to reach the toddler phase, they begin to socialize a bit with other kids. Encourage your toddler to make friends, and teach him or her how to do things like introduce him or herself. This is one of the early milestones in socializing your child.Do not be surprised if your toddler plays more “beside” the other children than they play “with” the other children. Parallel play is common in this stage.

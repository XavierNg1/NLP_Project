 Go online or visit the jewelry section of your local craft store. Look for converters that are made for fish hook earrings. These converters replace the pierced earring hook instead of working in conjunction with the pierced earring.These converters will have a small extra hoop in the front that will be used to attach the earring.
 Use jewelry pliers to gently remove the piece that goes through your ear. Open the small hoop on the converter and place it around the hole on the pierced earring. Use the pliers to close the loop. Your earrings are now ready to wear.If you do not want to remove the fish hook, you can use a hoop converter instead.
 A hoop converter is a thin metal hoop that you attach to the pierced earring. If you use this with a fish hook earing, use your pliers to close the opening of the pierced earring first. Once the fish hook is closed, hang it on the hoop converter.This method is one of the quickest. The pierced earring remains intact because you do not have to remove any pieces.
Keep in mind that this type of converter will add extra length to your earrings.
If the pierced earrings are heavy, you may want to use a fish hook converter instead.

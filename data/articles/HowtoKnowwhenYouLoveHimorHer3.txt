 When you love someone, you want to spend as much time as possible with them. You hate to see them leave, even if only for a little while., Even small things like trips to the grocery store together or gardening side by side seem fun when you’re in love. Pay attention to whether you love spending time with them or if you feel relief when they leave. If it’s really love, you’ll be sad to see them go.
 When you love someone, you’ll feel slight jealousy. You don’t want them to be with anyone else, so this is a natural emotion. Slight jealousy is completely normal and shows that you love them and want that feeling to be mutual.


Possessiveness and suspicion are not the same as feeling little twinges of jealousy when your crush spends time away from you. These are indicative of insecurity and are never good for a relationship., When you like someone, you probably like hanging out with them, but when you truly love someone, you develop a “best friends” kind of connection with them. You don’t get tired of their company. You connect with them on a deeper level and share personal, intimate details of your life that you don’t share with everyone.A close, personal friendship with your partner is an indicator that you are in love with them. If you support each other and still challenge each other to grow spiritually and mentally, that's a sign of deep love., Avoid constantly looking for someone to love. You'll know when you find someone you truly love, and it'll feel natural. You can't rush or force love.


Don't feel like you have to find romantic love to be happy, and avoid clinging to someone who doesn't reciprocate your love.

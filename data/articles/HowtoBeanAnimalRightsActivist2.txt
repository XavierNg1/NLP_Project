 If you believe in animal rights, start acting on that principle in your daily life by taking animal products off your plate. This means learning to eat a mostly or entirely plant-based diet. Doing so puts your belief into practice while refusing to support industries that exploit animals.There are many variations of plant-based diets. The most basic distinction is between vegetarians and vegans. Vegetarians generally don’t eat meat or products that come from the body of an animal. Vegans avoid all animal-derived products, including eggs and dairy.
Many products, like gelatin or artificial food colorings, contain animal byproducts that you wouldn’t think. Take time to educate yourself about which surprising foods and ingredients you should be avoiding with the help of the Vegetarian Resource Group: http://www.vrg.org/ingredients/.
 Don’t purchase products that contain animal byproducts or patronize companies that perform animal testing.PETA publishes a list of companies that employ animal testing available here: http://www.mediapeta.com/peta/PDF/companiesdotest.pdf. Avoid these brands when you’re shopping and instead opt for ones that explicitly advertise that they’re vegan or cruelty-free.
Be especially wary when it comes to your clothing and fashion. Many materials, like leather, silk, down, and wool, are animal-derived and their production processes involve high levels of animal cruelty. Instead, look for alternatives like cotton, hemp, faux fur, pleather, and other synthetic materials., Don’t invest in companies that create animal-based products or use animal testing. Instead, put your money where your mouth is by investing in companies that are certified as cruelty-free. That way, you will have a direct impact on changing industries to observe animal rights.PETA also publishes a helpful list of animal-friendly companies that are worth buying from and investing in.

 No other fingers hold the pencil. Imagine pinching these three digits together, but not overly tightly, with the pencil in between.
 This side is the one closest to your body.
 The tip of this finger should just rest on top of the pencil. Along with the thumb, this finger holds the pencil in place.









Avoid placing undue pressure on the pencil with this finger. This is a common mistake that results in uncomfortable and/or heavy writing. Too much pressure can eventually result in pain when holding the pencil.
 The pencil should rest on the first joint of your middle finger. This finishes off the tripod positioning.

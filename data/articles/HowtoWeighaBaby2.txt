 Stand on the scale. Register your weight. Write it down. Ideally, use a scale that can measure in tenths of a pound. This method is less precise than a baby scale but is cost effective.


1/10 of a pound is 45.36 grams or 1.6 oz

, Preferably hold your child while she is naked. This will ensure a more accurate reading. If you prefer, you can hold your child’s clothes while you weigh yourself so that only the child’s body weight is added when you weigh yourself with a dressed child.
 Register the weight. Write it down. Subtract your single weight from your combined weight. The result is your baby’s weight.


For example: if you alone weigh 140 lbs. and you and the baby weight 149.8 lbs., then your baby weighs 9.8 lbs. on his own.

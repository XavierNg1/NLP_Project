 Sit with your legs spread wide so that you can rest your elbows on the inside of your thighs. This is to allow more pressure to come from your entire body onto the piece rather than just your hands.;
, This serves two purposes, one so that the clay will stick well to the wheel and also to eliminate air bubbles that are in the clay.
 As the wheel is turning dampen your hands and get the ball wet as well. Then start patting the ball into a cone shame until it is no longer wobbling.
 Again force the clay into the center of the wheel. If you are right handed your left elbow should dig into your left thigh. Your entire body is used to center the piece.
 Press your arms into your side to keep your arms from moving. Leave enough clay on the bottom of the piece so that you will be able to have a bottom.
 When water builds up on the bottom of the cylinder use a dry sponge to soak up the excess water.
 This is called pulling, be careful not to puncture the clay, however apply enough force so that clay is being forced upwards. How fast you pull up on the piece is affected by how fast the wheel is moving. Therefore the quicker the wheel is spinning the faster you can finish a piece. It is better to not go fast when you are first starting out, once you feel more comfortable with the motions you will be able to go faster.
 If there is a large amount of clay around the base of the piece then trim the base of the piece with a wooden tool that is cut at a 45 degree angle.
, Careful not to go through the bottom of your piece. Make sure that the wire hugs the wheel tightly.

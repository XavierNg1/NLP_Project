Trans-resveratrol from red grapes has only "two-ring" molecular structure.

Green tea has a "four-ring" molecular structure.;
, This allows it to trap far more free radicals than any other antioxidant, as it has this complex molecule, and it can form the same polyphenols and phlorotannins, but in the more sophisticated molecular structure compared., The higher the ORAC score, the better, as foods and natural substances with high ORAC scores may protect your cells and tissues from oxidative damage.

Seanol has an ORAC value of a whopping 8,368, far superior to green tea, red wine’s resveratrol and many fruits and vegetables.

Seanol has over 10 times more ORAC value than an orange. You’d have to eat 7 or 8 oranges a day to get the same ORAC value as one serving of Seanol.


ORAC Value of Seanol for 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) for food items:

Seanol 8,368 / Raisins 2,830 / Blueberries 2,400 / Blackberries 2,036 / Strawberries 1,540 / Oranges 750 / Red grapes 739 / Cherries 670 / Spinach 1,260 / Broccoli flowers 890 / Beets 840 / Corn 400 / Eggplant 390 / Tea 700–1,600 (Red wine is noted for resveratrol from red grapes.)



, Why? Because its ORAC score is up to 100 times greater than any land-based antioxidant."

Now, these statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

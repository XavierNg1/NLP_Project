 Thaw the chicken if it's been frozen, and cut the chicken into smaller pieces to avoid drying it out during the reheating process.
 You don’t have to bring the chicken up to room temperature if it's been frozen, but make sure it's not frozen solid. Place it in the refrigerator for several (6-8) hours before reheating it to slowly bring the temperature up.


If you are going to reheat the chicken immediately, place the frozen chicken in a water-proof Ziploc bag and run cold water over it until it thaws.
You can also thaw it in the microwave on the “Defrost” setting.
 A cookie sheet would be ideal. Check the bottom of the dish to make sure it will stand up to extreme temperatures.


Spread the precooked chicken pieces in the container, doing your best to keep even spacing between the pieces.
Cover your chicken pieces with leftover pan juices, if available.
Cover the dish or cookie pan with aluminum foil to keep the chicken from drying out.
 Set the oven to 425 to 475°F (220 to 245 degrees Celsius). Different ovens take different amounts of time to preheat, so make sure the oven is up to the right temperature before you insert the chicken for reheating.
 Once the oven has preheated, place the chicken in the oven. If the chicken has been cut into small pieces, it may take only a few minutes to reheat properly. If you are reheating large pieces, like whole breasts, you may have to wait longer.



Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature and make sure you’re not leaving the middle cold.
The chicken should be brought up to an internal temperature of 165°F before serving., Use oven mitts to protect your hands when removing the chicken from the oven, and use a potholder or trivet to protect your counters from the heat of the container.


If you have large pieces of chicken, let it rest for a couple minutes before cutting into it. This will allow the juices to redistribute, so you won’t have dry, tough chicken.

 A cremation can cost in the hundreds or thousands of dollars depending on the choices that you make. You will want to decide whether or not to have a viewing of your body beforehand and what type of ceremony to have for the interment process. Do you want your cremated remains to be buried, kept in an urn, or scattered?Direct cremation refers to the process of cremating the body without a viewing or gathering beforehand.
If you would like a viewing beforehand, you may want to look into the option of renting a casket for your body. If you opt for a cremation your funeral director will provide a container that will hold the body secure during the cremation process itself., You will want to designate a container to hold your ashes post-cremation. You can shop around or use a family item as an urn. Or, you can look for another container or box that suits your personality. The container itself can be placed in a cemetery or taken home by a relative or someone else of your choice., Many people like the idea of having their ashes scattered but you will want to leave very specific instructions behind discussing how to go about it. You will want to receive advance permission to have your ashes scattered on private or government-owned property. You will also want to make absolutely sure that this is your final choice as it is irrevocable once completed.Some cemeteries set aside a particular area where mourners can scatter ashes as they so choose. Ask the funeral directors that you meet with if they provide such a service.
Note that if you decide to scatter ashes in the ocean you must be a minimum of three nautical miles offshore. For more information contact your funeral director or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 In recent years, millions of people have used car donations as a good way to support charities and receive tax deductions. It is important, however, to identify a reputable charity that deserves your support. Be sure that the charity has 501(c)(3) tax status, so that you can receive a tax deduction for the donation., If the title is in the name of two people, both will be needed to make the transfer. If the title is in someone else’s name (a parent, child, etc.), you will need to have that person make the donation, or transfer the title and then make the donation. If you do not have the title certificate, you will need to request a duplicate from the Registry of Motor Vehicles., Some charities will suggest that you simply hand over the title certificate and let them take care of the paperwork. While this sounds helpful, don’t do it.For the transfer to be valid, you need to:


Complete the transfer information on the back of the title certificate.
Report the accurate odometer reading at the time of the transfer.
Enter the name of the charity or an authorized representative.
Sign and date the form.
Keep copies of all the paperwork.

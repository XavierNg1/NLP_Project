 Etsy.com is the biggest and most well-known online marketplace that enables crafters to sell online easily. Even the most novice user can set up a crafts storefront that showcases their products and enables buyers to ask questions of the seller, request custom items and pay for their order through PayPal.
 The hardest thing a crafter needs to do to sell crafts online easily on Etsy is to write product descriptions and upload product photos. Etsy will even handle search ending marketing that enables shoppers to find your store. In exchange, you will pay Etsy a small listing fee to add your item to the storefront and a small commission when the item sells.
 Facebook has an application that enables users to showcase their Etsy store in their profile. You can also use Twitter and Link'd In to announce new products, coupons and sales.

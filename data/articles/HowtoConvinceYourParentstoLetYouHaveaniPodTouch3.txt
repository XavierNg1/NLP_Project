 See if your parents would be able to pay you weekly in exchange for chores and good behavior.


Your parents may only want to pay you to do certain chores. This is okay too-- every bit adds up.
Mention that you are saving up for something specific, not asking for extra spending money.
 You can work part time when you are fourteen, but if you are younger you can still work around your neighborhood.


Families are often looking for babysitters, so it’s a good idea to find parents and ask if they need any help watching their kids.
People often need help with yardwork, especially lawn mowing. You can go door to door asking if people need any work done on your yard.
 If you are going to save money, you should make sure that you won’t spend it on anything else. Ask your parents to help you set up bank account, or at least keep your money in a place where you can’t get to it.


Tell your parents you want to learn how to save money. They will appreciate your effort.
A bank account is a great way to keep your birthday and holiday money safe.
 Once you have $75, you have enough money to pay for half of a refurbished iPod.Approach your parents and tell them that you’ve saved enough money to pay for half of the iPod, and ask them if they would be willing to pitch in the other half.


Let them know how long you have been saving up. Say, “I’m taking the expense of the iPod very seriously. I’ve been saving up for three months in order to help pay for it.”

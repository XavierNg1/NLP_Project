 Raincoats come in a variety of different and stylish colours. For instance, you may want to choose a neutral tone such as khaki, beige, or black. These colours are timeless and will look nice with a variety of different outfits.


For example, a khaki coloured raincoat paired with dark skinny jeans and Wellington boots will look stylish on a rainy day.
 Bright coloured raincoats can also look stylish. For example, you could choose a brighter colour such as yellow, red, pink, orange, green, or blue. These bright colours will contrast with the grey and dreary weather, making you stand out on a rainy day.If you are feeling really bold, opt for a patterned raincoat. These can add even more style to your rain gear.
 You may want to purchase a raincoat with a lining. This can help to keep you warm on cold rainy days, as well as add style to your outfit. If you have decided on a neutral coloured raincoat, you could add a splash of colour with a bold printed lining.For example, a Burberry raincoat comes with an iconic plaid lining that is a stylish feature of the jacket.

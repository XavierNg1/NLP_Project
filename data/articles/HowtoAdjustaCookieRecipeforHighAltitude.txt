 This will add too much air to the cookies. With high altitude baking, the low air pressure causes the air bubbles to expand faster. The cookies will rise quickly and then collapse, making them dry and brittle.


If your cookie recipe calls for egg whites, only beat them to a soft-peak.;
, (12 to 36 g) for each cup (191.6g) used. Reduce the sugar by 1 tbsp. (12 g) at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), 2 tbsp. (24 g) at 5,000 feet (1,524 m) and 3 tbsp.(36 g) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m).
 (0.47 g) to 1/4 tsp. (0.94 g). Reduce baking powder by 1/8 tsp. (0.47 g) at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. (0.47 to 0.94 g) at 5,000 feet (1,524 m) and a full 1/4 tsp. (0.94 g) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m). Metric reductions for baking soda are 0.54 to 1.07 g.
 Add 2 to 3 tbsp. (29.6 to 44.4 ml) of water for every cup (99.4 g) of flour used at 5,000 feet (1,524 m). Increase it a further 1 to 2 tbsp. (14.8 to 29.6 ml) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m).


If you are cooking at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), it is not necessary to increase the liquid unless your recipe calls for a large amount of flour.
 The batter will set faster in a higher temperature and retain a moist center. This step will also save the cookies from being too dry because they aren't under the hot element for very long.
 This will depend upon how long the cookies are supposed to bake as cookie recipes can call for cook times ranging from 5 to 20 minutes.

 This is great as an at-home DIY project or even as a craft project with kids – liquid watercolors are non-toxic and fun and easy to use. Here’s what you’ll need:


Pieces of wood
Liquid watercolors
Bowls, cups, or ice tray
Wax paper
Paintbrushes (optional)

, An ice cube tray is convenient as you can put small amounts of each color into each little container, but if you need a wider area (for dipping, etc.) you’ll be better off with a wider-brimmed bowl.


The beauty of liquid watercolor is that it is good to go. No mixing or heating up necessary. When you pour it in, that's all you need to do. It lasts much longer than food coloring and is cheaper, too.
 That’s really all it takes – at least at first. Dip it in for just a few seconds and see what you think of the color. Remember: it will get lighter as it dries.


It’s not a bad idea to dip in one side and set the wood down to dry on a side that isn’t dyed yet. Then you know whichever side it lays on won’t get tarnished or stick to the surface when laid down.
If the color is too light, dip it in for a few seconds once more, applying another coat.
 If you're worried about getting it on your fingers, put on a pair of rubber or plastic gloves. However liquid watercolors do wash off pretty easily if addressed quickly.


Keep this in mind for your objects, too. If they get exposed to water, the dye could start coming off – at least eventually. It's important they stay dry (out of water and out of mouths).
 Once you’re finished dyeing, set all the pieces on wax paper to dry overnight. Come back to them in the morning and see if you like the color. If not, you can always reapply.

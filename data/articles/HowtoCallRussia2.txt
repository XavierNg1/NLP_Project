 Russia currently has eleven time zones! Depending on the region you’re calling, you could reach them just before they are going to sleep or just before they wake up for work. Russia’s time zones range from 2 hours later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) to ten hours later. In other words, the Russian time zones cover GMT+2 to GMT+12. Before calling, check the destination time for convenience and courtesy.Moscow is GMT+2.
Novosibirsk is GMT+5.
 Once you have the international prefix, country calling code, the local code, and the personal number, you’re ready to make the call. Dial each of them in sequence and wait for the connection. The following example is the dialing sequence from Chicago, USA to a local 111-22-33 number in Moscow: 011-7-495-111-22-33.


Depending on the dial tones you’re accustomed to, the dial tones when calling foreign countries may sound slightly different.
 Remember that some international calls can cost a lot of money. You could contact your personal phone service provider and ask for international rates, or special one-time rates. If there are no feasible or suitably economical options available, you may want to look into the cost of an international prepaid calling card.


Research multiple card options if using a calling card. Some rates from the U.S. or U.K. allow calls to Russia for less than $0.10 or €0.10.

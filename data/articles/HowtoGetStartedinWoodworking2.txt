 When joining wood, the most straightforward approach is the butt joint, in which you simply butt the end grain of one panel against the side of another. This joint can be secured with glue for a clean appearance, or with screws for a sturdier, if less attractive finish.
 A biscuit joiner is a power tool that cuts a narrow groove into the end of each piece of wood to be joined. You can then fit small wood chips called "biscuits" into these grooves, which gives you extra stability for a glued joint.
 Another way to increase the surface area for the glue to adhere to is by cutting a groove into one piece of wood. These grooves allow the second piece of wood to contact the first piece along multiple surfaces. Rabbits, dadoes, and grooves are 3 types of this joint, so named based on the orientation of the cut to the wood's grain.
 Of course, the 2 quintessential woodworking joints are the dovetail and the mortise and tenon, in which the 2 wood pieces interlock with each other. These joints take much more careful cutting to create, but are unrivaled in their elegance and strength.

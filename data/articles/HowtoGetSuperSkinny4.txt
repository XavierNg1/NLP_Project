 Find someone who you can count on to share you triumphs and tribulations with. This process doesn’t happen overnight and having someone to discuss it with will help you get super skinny.


Make it count. Be sure your accountability partner is someone you are comfortable with and someone who will be honest with you. It will only make the process harder if you aren’t open with them.
Find someone who can relate. If possible, find an accountability partner who is also trying to lose weight or has done so in the past. It will be much easier to relate to them if they are going through the same thing you are.
 Weigh yourself at least once a week if not more. These mini goals will help keep you on track and make you aware of any changes you might have to make.


Keep it consistent. Each time you check your weight, do so with consistency. This means if you first weigh yourself when you first wake up, do so at the same time for every weight-check. Keep mini goals written down. Use rewards, as mentioned in Method 1, to keep you focused.
 Each month, be sure that you’re reaching the weight you want to reach. From here, make adjustments as necessary.


Learn your body. If you aren’t seeing the changes that you want, don’t be afraid to make adjustments. Not everyone has the same body, so no everyone’s body reacts the same to diet and exercise.
Change it up. Weight loss is likely to hit a plateau if you don’t change it up. It doesn’t mean that you’ve been doing the wrong thing—just that your body has adjusted to your new lifestyle. So change it again, and surprise your body into losing more weight.

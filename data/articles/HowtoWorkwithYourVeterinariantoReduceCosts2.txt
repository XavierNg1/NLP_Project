 Many pet-friendly organizations exist which help pay the veterinary bills for individuals and families who cannot afford to pay their own. There are also quite a few veterinary assistance funds which have been created solely to assist with payments for expensive veterinary procedures. Paws.org maintains a partial list of these organizations and funds, which include: the Brown Dog Foundation, PAWS 4 A Cure, Frankie’s Friends, The Pet Fund, and The Magic Bullet Fund.Some of these organizations—such as the Helping Pets Fund—require that the veterinarian apply for the fund. For this Fund and others like it, you’ll need to speak with your vet and ask them to send in an application for financial assistance.
 Pet insurance—much like typical health insurance for humans—will charge a monthly premium and help out substantially with any medical expenses that your pet incurs. Talk to your vet and ask which pet insurance company they recommend, then take out a policy for your pet.You should do this even if your pet does not need a surgery or procedure in the near future, as pet insurance companies may be unwilling to insure a pet which needs an immediate surgery.


Most pet insurance policies will help cover costs of routine veterinary care (including check-ups and vaccinations) in addition to surgeries and emergency medical costs.
 Many healthcare-specific credit cards—including Care Credit—can also be used to pay for veterinary expenses. These credit cards will offer various payment plans that will help you pay off an expensive veterinary procedure over a set duration of time, without an excessive amount of interest. You can apply for healthcare credit cards like Care Credit directly on their websites.On either a regular credit card or a healthcare credit card, you can always call and ask to raise your credit limit. This will be useful if you’re concerned that you veterinary expenses may max out or exceed your credit limit.

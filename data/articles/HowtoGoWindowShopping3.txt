 Most people think of a brick and mortar location when they think of window shopping. Browsing websites online is, in effect, the same thing as window shopping. It may actually be more convenient, especially if you have mobility issues or little time to get out of the house. To go window shopping online, set aside a block of time that you can do this without being rushed. For example, take a couple hours to do so after you’ve put the kids to bed or during their nap time., Online window shopping is a great way to compare items and prices side by side. If you are looking for one particular item, find the item on a few different sites, pulling each site up in a separate tab on your computer. You can then flip back and forth between the tabs to compare statistics on each site., The bookmarks feature on web browsers makes it especially easy to save your favorite items or sites. When you find a product you like at a great price, bookmark this site so you can easily find it the next time you log on. You can also use this feature to save sites that provided inspiration, good information about a particular item, or advertise upcoming sales. You’ll use this feature much like you’d use a note pad or notes app while window shopping brick and mortar stores.

 Make sure that it fits first! Smaller notebooks are best, as they take up less space than normal, school-sized ones.
 Consider getting a pen that can stay on your notebook for added convenience., Record the date that you're knitting on. Print out, photocopy, or manually copy over the pattern you're working on into your journal. Then while you're working through the project use a system of tallies, check marks, etc. to keep track of your place in the pattern. Write yourself helpful notes to remember if you ever revisit the pattern again., It's important to remember what sort of yarn you're using if you plan to throw away the wrapper. (You could actually just stick the wrapper onto the page.) It's good to write down the needles you used for future reference., If the pattern you're using doesn't explain all the abbreviations they use completely, look them up and write yourself a little explanation so you don't waste time looking them up while you're knitting., You can also use fun pens and maybe a sticker or a piece of yarn from each project, so your journal becomes really fun and sort of like a scrapbook., How much yarn did it take? What would you have done differently a second time around? What did you think of that brand of yarn? All of this is helpful for future knitting projects.

 Don't apply the olive oil mask right before an event such as a wedding or party. If you encounter problems removing all the olive oil, your hair can look limp or unwashed. This can lead to unappealing, greasy looking hair.Be sure to only apply olive oil treatments to your hair at least several days before any big event so you have plenty of time to deal with any unforeseen circumstances or accidents that may occur.
 Leaving your hair against your neck or forehead while applying and removing olive oil can cause breakouts on those areas. Place hair in a shower cap or towel to avoid any potential skin problems.Remember that hot olive oil can burn your skin. Warm it gently and be cautious when applying it to your hair.
 Before you initially apply the olive oil to your hair, take a bit of a precaution by diluting the olive oil with water. Dilute the olive oil in half by adding one part olive oil to two parts water.


Taking this step will make the oil easier to get out of your hair once you are done with the application. This could save you a lot of trouble handling too-greasy hair later.
 Leaving olive oil in your hair for too long can be quite problematic and damaging to the skin on your scalp. It can cause the pores on the scalp to get clogged which can lead to blemishes and irritation. Additionally, it can make any flakes of skin (dandruff) stick to your head which can compound the problem.If one of the cleansing methods doesn’t work, don’t be disheartened. Keep washing your hair or trying other methods until your hair is back to normal.

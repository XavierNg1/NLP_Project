Level 20-49

Headgear: Andras Hat
Overall: Simply buy an overall with a little bit of strength, and then scroll it for dexterity. This way, you add Accuracy(The Dex gives ACC) and a little bit of attack.

Shoes: Squishy shoes are okay, however I believe you can get better shoes.
Accessories: Larson's Challenger Equipment, Free Spirit Piercing

,


Level 80+

Headgear: Scarlion Hat
Overall: Your Choice
Gloves: Brown workgloves with 12 attack or more
Shoes: Facestompers

These things are great choices to make your warrior great, however they require a lot of funding and mesos. Brown WG's are just 100m+ alone, with attack they are so much more. You must be very rich to do these things. Good luck creating your warrior, and keep in mind what you should buy. Only buy things if you NEED them


Accessories: Your choice, but you should get STR rings 2-7, Warrior Symbols, Angelic Blessing, and any Pendants you can find.

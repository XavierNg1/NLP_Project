 Do you need more water in your eye-dropper? Does it take more pressure to make the diver drop? Predict what will happen in advance. Then make two bottles and compare the two.


Hint: Salt water is more dense than fresh water., Leave some air in the top of the bottle and then give it another shot. How much can you take out and still keep the diver working? Any? Half? None? Make a prediction first using your knowledge of the divers.


Hint: When you squeeze the bottle, you're compressing everything, not just the air in the diver., Use a small 1-litre personal soda, then try it with a gallon jug. Do you have to squeeze any harder to make the diver work?


Hint: Is it easier or harder to compress a big metal spring compared to a small one?


, What happens if you use cold water? What about hot? Make sure it is not so hot it melts the plastic, but sticking it in the fridge for an hour or microwaving for a minute or so should do the trick.


Hint: Warmer water has a lower density than cooler water.

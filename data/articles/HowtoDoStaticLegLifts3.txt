 You may think seated leg lifts look pretty easy, but appearances can be deceiving. Even small movements will give you a serious workout.Sit up straight with your legs extended in front of you. Make sure your back is neutral and your shoulders are rolled back, not crunched forward. You may want to place a rolled towel or blanket behind your lower back to help your posture.
Lift one leg up and out to the side in a slow, controlled movement. Hold the lift for ten seconds, then slowly return it to center and lower. Do the other leg to complete one rep. Your range of motion may be small at first, but you can build up gradually as your muscles get stronger.
 If you learn how to isolate each of the muscles in your legs and contract them without moving, you can do isometric contractions. These static exercises will help tone your muscles, giving you a tighter and more fit appearance.If you've never done isometric contractions before, it may be easiest to start with large muscles such as quads or calves. You can work on contracting smaller muscles as you develop better body awareness.
 For isometric contractions to work, you need to be squeezing the muscle as tightly as you possibly can. With each repetition, try to squeeze the muscle a little more tightly.Hold the contraction for five seconds. Breathe deeply as you do so.As you practice, work your way to contracting the muscles for 60 seconds at a time.

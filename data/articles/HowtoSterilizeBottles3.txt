 It must be able to fit a steamer basket as well as bottles, lids and nipples placed inside the basket.










Place the steamer basket inside the pot. The bottom of the steamer basket should be just above the water.
 Add as many as will fit, then cover the pot with a lid.









If you have too many bottles to fit in the basket, you can sterilize them in batches.
You can also add lids and nipples to the steamer basket.
 Bring the water to a boil. Allow the bottles to steam for 5 minutes.
 Use a pair of tongs to remove the bottles from the pot and place them to dry on a clean dishcloth. Store or use the bottles when they are cool and dry.









Make sure your hands are clean when you handle the bottles after sterilizing them.
Use a microwave or electric steamer as an alternative to a steamer basket. Put bottles and teats in a clean microwave or electric steamer. Activate the microwave or electric steamer according to the manufacturer's instructions.

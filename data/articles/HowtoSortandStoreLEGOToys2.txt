 Many brands, including Rubbermaid and Sterlite, make plastic storage containers that work well for LEGO bricks and other pieces. Depending on your needs, you can find both open and lidded varieties. To maximize your storage space, though, stackable bins are a good option.Clear bins or boxes work especially well because you can easily see what’s inside. However, if you’re color sorting your LEGOs, you may want to color code your bins. For example, choose red bins for your red pieces and blue bins for your blue pieces.
 When you’re sorting your pieces in your bins, you don’t want to overload them or it will be difficult to find pieces when you’re working on a project. Having the LEGOs in a single layer in each bin is ideal because it makes it easier to see all of the pieces.It helps to buy bins in a variety of sizes, so you can customize your storage based on the size of the pieces. Small pieces, such as Technic pins, clips and hinges, can get lost in large bins, so smaller boxes are a better choice.
If you are storing small LEGO pieces in a larger bin, you may want to place them inside a Ziploc or other plastic bag to make them easier to locate when you’re building.
 One of the benefits of using this type of storage for your LEGOs is that they’re versatile. You can stack the bins on a bookcase or shelving unit, stash them in a closet, or even tuck them under a bed to keep them out of sight. In a child’s bedroom or playroom, you may want to simply stack them on the floor, so it’s easy for your child to access them.

 You can look at the official station map (click on the blue bicycle icon to see how many bikes and open docks there are for that station) or use the Divvy "CycleFinder" app.


One way to map out your bike route is to enter your starting and ending addresses on Google Maps and use the "bicycle" option. This will also give you a time estimate.;
, If you use a Divvy bike for more than 30 minutes, you'll get charged extra. To break up the trip, you'll want to return your bike before the 30 minutes expire. Dock it, request a new code at the console (you'll swipe the same card that you used to pay for the pass) then use the new code to take out a bike (it can be the same bike as before or a different one, it doesn't matter).
 The app tells you how many bikes are at each station so you can better plan for this. Stations are more likely to be busy or break on busy days, like sunny weekends.


If the station is full, go to the kiosk re-swipe your credit or debit card (24-Hour Pass holders), and select “Station Full?” to add 15 minutes to your trip.
If docking doesn't work and you're running out of time, call Customer Service at 1-855-55-DIVVY (553-4889).

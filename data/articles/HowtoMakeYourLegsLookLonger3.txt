 A simple way to make legs look longer is to show them off. Wear shorts and short skirts often. The shorter the cut, the longer your legs will look.
 Straight, horizontal hemlines interrupt the eye as it travels down your leg. Maximize the amount of length you can get from wearing a skirt by choosing an asymmetrical hemline. An asymmetrical hemline will soften the break, allowing the eye to follow smoothly down your legs., Because calves are large muscles, they tend to be the thickest part of a person's legs. When a skirt ends at the calf, it can make even the tallest person look stumpy. Instead, stick to skirts that fall either closer to the ankles or at the knee or above., Wide pants that just graze the top of your foot will make your legs look slender in comparison while creating that long solid line that lengthens their appearance. On the other hand, shorter pants will cut the line equally short. Likewise, pants that touch the ground are a bit too long and will make you seem shorter.

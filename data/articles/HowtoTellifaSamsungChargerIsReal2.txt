 If you want to find a real charger, you'll need to purchase one straight from Samsung.
 This should be at the top of the screen, toward the left side of the options bar.
 This will take you to the mobile accessories page.
 This will open a page with a comprehensive list of mobile accessories for Samsung devices. You'll be able to find a charger here.
 This is the standard charger that should have come with your phone if you purchased it in-store.


You can also opt for a wireless charger at the top of the page; these are more expensive, but harder to replicate than USB chargers are.
 Fake chargers can damage your phone, stop working, and even cause electrical fires. If you want to purchase a new charger, click the "Add to Cart" button on the right side of your screen and follow the check-out instructions.

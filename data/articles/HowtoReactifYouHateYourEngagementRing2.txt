 If you do not have the heart to tell your significant other that you do not like it, then you will just have to learn to love the ring. Perhaps your fiancé chose the ring because it is within their budget, or because it is an heirloom. Instead, focus on what the ring symbolizes — love and commitment.Your fiancé picked that ring specifically for you as a symbol of their love. Consider regarding the ring as a representation of that love and express your own style through your other jewelry.
Remember that you can pick a wedding ring that you love and you can wear that after the wedding instead.
 If you cannot learn to love the ring, then suggest redesigning the ring. When making this suggestion, approach the situation as a project that you and your partner can bond over and work on together.For example, if you do not like the setting, then suggest picking a different one.
If the ring is an heirloom, you might suggest resetting the stones in a style that you like.
 Many big-name jewelry stores have return policies on rings, for example, 30 to 60 days for a refund or 90 days for store credit. Before suggesting an exchange to your partner, find out where they bought the ring and research the store’s return policy.This way, if you are unable to return or exchange the ring, you can avoid an uncomfortable (and unnecessary) conversation with your partner.

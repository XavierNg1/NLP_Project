 You may not be able to escape change completely, but if a political action or demographic alteration is affecting change you cannot deal with, move somewhere else.
 Are gangs moving into your neighborhood? Build a privacy fence, shutter your windows, or use other tactics to fend off their effects.Â  Obviously, this is an over-the-top example for most of us, but it is a situation which has overtaken some communities.
 Suppose you know you will suffer a loss of employment or a reduction in hours or wages. You may be able to save up some cash or reduce your debt in preparation for those changes.
 People often fight doggedly against change, only to realize the change was for the better after the fact. Think about the reaction to the Civil Rights Movement of the 60's in the U.S.. No one would want to go back to those times, but many people fought passionately against them at the time.

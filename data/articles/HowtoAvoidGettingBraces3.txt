 Caring for your teeth, before or after remodeling treatments, is important. You want to make sure you avoid needing further treatment after braces, aligners, or retainers are removed. You should brush your in the morning and before bed.


Use a soft bristle brush and gently brush your teeth on all sides, using circular motions. Use a fluoride toothpaste. In addition to your teeth, brush along the gum line and on your tongue.If you have arthritis or conditions that limit motion in your hands, try a battery operated toothbrush., You also need to floss your teeth each day with dental floss. This will remove plaque between the teeth that cannot be otherwise removed. Flossing also prevents gingivitis and gum disease. Floss until you reach the gums, but do not dig into your gums with floss until they bleed or become sore., While you might not like the prospect of getting braces, sometimes alternatives can be too expensive or will not work for you given the level of correction needed. Crooked teeth are also dependent on genetic factors, so even if you brush and floss regularly braces may still be necessary.

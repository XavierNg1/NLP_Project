 Crush them using your hands and leave the wick beside. Chop them up using a knife.;
,, Add some food coloring if desired.
 Make sure the chocolate touches the wax.
, Make sure the wick is tall enough for it. Usually, the longer the wick, the easier the project is.


Use a stick and place it over the container. Attach the wick to it using sticky tape.
 If it has melted, pour the mixture quickly in the candle container and let it set to dry. The chocolate would dry with the wax mixture. There might be some leftovers. Quickly pour the left-overs in another candle-container. You can use this for next time.


If there is food coloring in it, it should spread it colors around the wax mixture. Mix it if you don't want this 'marble' effect.
 Don't touch it or do anything do it. Once the wax has frozen, place the candle container directly in the freezer so the chocolate can be 100% frozen too.
 When you have finished, put it back in the freezer.

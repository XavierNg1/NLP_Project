 How the beans were roasted is very important. French roast is pretty strong, Italian roast even stronger. As a rule of thumb, the darker the bean the stronger the coffee.;
, These are two very popular Italian brands and most serious coffee lovers will adore the taste. You may also choose other high quality gourmet brands like Gevalia or even Starbucks.
 Some coffee brands use a lot of chemicals during the growing and roasting process which affects the taste and could possibly affect how your body reacts to the beans. Organic coffee steers clear of the bad stuff. Not all chemicals are toxic or bad, though, and the lack of standards in organic farming can prevent you from making an educated, informed decision. Be sure to do your own careful and thorough research.
 Lavazza and Medaglia D'Oro, or El Pico, are all good espressos that you can brew as a full pot of coffee. Just use a little less and tamp it down after filling the filter basket.
 Buy from coffee shops and local roasters where there is a little more certainty about the age of the coffee.
 Fair Trade certification ensures a minimum price per pound for coffee growers; however, this amount may not reflect changing economic conditions that increase the cost of coffee production. Direct Trade practices---although not monitored by a third-party trade organization---establish a direct exchange between roasters and growers. Roasters engage in face-to-face discussion with growers and see their product first-hand, encouraging higher-quality coffee, better labor standards and higher wages to sustain the grower-roaster relationship.
 If a coffee is shade grown, it means they didn't have to clear-cut land in order to maximize the number of coffee plants they could grow. Instead, they choose a more environmentally sound way to grow the plants. Often shade grown coffee is also organic.

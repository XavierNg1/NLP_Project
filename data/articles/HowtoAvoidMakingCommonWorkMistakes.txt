 While employees are expected to be friendly, and some socializing is necessary for employees to bond, spending hours talking about personal things, gossiping, flirting or "creating drama" is inappropriate. Never ignore your work in order to engage in non-business conversations, especially if you have clients or customers waiting to be served.;
, Avoid ranting about politics, religion or anything else that others might hold different views about. People typically present a more bland version of themselves at work; just because they don't talk about controversial topics doesn't mean they don't have any opinions or that their opinions are the same as yours.
 The company offers benefits and perquisites to encourage employee retention, not because it cares about you. A business downturn may force change or cuts; don't expect the company to forgo profit in order to make you happy.
 Part of every employee's job is to let the company know which employees are performing well so they can be rewarded or promoted. This is true even if the employee is you.
 Don't grouse about the company or bad-mouth your coworkers or supervisors. Keep in mind that decisions are made and policy set by company executives, who won't share their reasons with you. Make suggestions if invited or offer to help, but don't simply complain.
 The best way to keep your job and advance in the company is to be perceived not only at good at your job, but well-liked and easy to work with. You may have to suppress your natural personality in order to get along.

 This image shows a nose and mouth, but you don't have to. For a winking eye, just draw a curved line.;
, The bottom eyelid should be at a downward angle, and the top lid should hover above the original oval. On the winking eye, thicken the eyelid, and add things like eyelashes.
 One at the top, and one at the bottom right. with that drawn, draw the pupil. The pupil is simply an oval that is drawn with the bottom erased. Add eyelashes to the open eye, as well.
 Don't draw them all the way around; you only need them here-and-there.
 This can be a little challenging sometimes. You basically want to cross-hatch; going up and down, and then left and right. A few circles never hurt, either. Make sure the pupil is darker at the top than at the bottom. Add zig-zags around the original oval, skipping a few spots (but don't skip too much) and doing VERY short zig-zags around the eye-lights. Thicken the top and bottom lines of the eye.
 Draw it on both sides of the pupil. Color that with a dark shade; but with your regular pencil, not with your colored pencils! That part's not till later. You may need to darken those zig-zags from earlier.
 Shade this in with a medium tone. Shade the remaining space with a light tone.
 Don't pen where the shading in, as that will make it look bad. But pen the zig-zags, eye-lights, and everything else! Erase the penned parts when the ink is dry. But don't erase the shading.
 I chose reds and pinks, but any colors will work. Do the coloring one shade at a time; I start with the darkest part first. So erase the darkest shading (the part at the top) and add your darkest color. Repeat these steps with the other two shades.
 To do eyeshadow, put it in-between the top lid, and the line that's often drawn above it. (See the picture above. You should see hints of blue.)

 Most fake Nike shoes do not come in an original Nike box. Instead, they are shrink-wrapped in clear plastic or donâ€™t come in a box at all.


Most of the boxes for fake Nikes are hastily glued together and therefore not as sturdy as true Nike boxes.
 If you have owned similar Nike shoes in the past, compare them to your new shoes. If the two pairs significantly differ in quality, your new shoes are likely fake and may fall apart within the first several days of use.


Real Nikes are always softer and grayer than fake ones. This is because they are made from real leather, while fake Nikes are manufactured from pleather.
The midsoles of fake Nike shoes tend to have visible dots from the manufacturing process, unlike real Nikes.
Check the lacing. Real Nike shoes are usually fully laced, while fakes tend to skip every other lacing hole.
 Every pair of authentic Nike shoes comes with an SKU number that is identical to the SKU number on their box. If the numbers are missing or do not match, they are likely fakes.


Check the tongue label. Often, fake Nike manufacturers put outdated sizing labels on the inside of the shoe. For example, a fake label may tell you the shoe was designed in 2008 when in fact Nike first manufactured that item in 2010.
 The soles of most fake Nike sneakers feel plastic-y and don't have much traction, while real Nike shoes have BRS 1000 rubber soles.


Most fake Nike sneakers do not fit true to size. They generally are 1/2 size smaller and significantly narrower than real Nikes. Try the same Nike shoe in a trusted retailer to get an accurate reading of how it feels.

 Unless it becomes a routine problem, if someone makes fun of you the best way to handle the situation is by ignoring the teasing altogether. By ignoring the bully you are denying them the attention that they are seeking by making fun of you. They are likely to get bored and leave you alone.When someone starts to tease you, don’t give them the attention that they are seeking. Continue to do what you were doing and act like you didn’t hear them.;
, If ignoring the bully does not work, consider walking away from the situation. While this still denies the bully the attention that they were seeking, it also sends a clear signal that you will not tolerate being teased. This will also prevent you from having to hear what the bully has to say.If someone starts to pick on you while you are at your locker at school, grab the books that you need and go to class.
When a co-worker is making fun of you in the office, find something else to do. Go to a different room to work, grab a cup of coffee, or take a trip to the restroom. The bully will likely be back to work by the time you return.
 If persistent teasing is getting you down consider finding an emotional outlet. Exercise can help you release built up anger and stress. It can also be a great confidence booster.Take up boxing or kung fu to release some built up aggression.
Yoga or distance running are great outlets to manage stress and clear your head.

 A tight fitting sports bra can do very well to flatten your chest. You can try on a sports bra that is a size smaller for extra flattening. However, it shouldn't be painful to have on and it should never restrict your breathing.


When you're trying on your sports bra, take a couple of deep breaths to ensure it's not restricting your ability to breathe.
Move around in your sports bra when you're trying it on by bending, slouching, jumping, and sitting. This gives you an idea of how your sports bra will fit and feel when you're in motion. It might feel and look good while you're standing up, but it might feel differently when you're moving in it throughout the day.
Look for bras that are made of spandex. Spandex is both stretchy and form-fitting at the same time.
Don't wear a sports bra for too long if it is particularly tight. The general rule for most chest binding methods is to wear the garment for no more than 8 hours.
 If one sports bra doesn't do the trick, try putting on two to better flatten your chest. You can try:


Putting the first sports bra on regularly and the second one on backwards.
A larger size for your second sports bra. If the second bra is too hard to put on over the first one, go up a size and see how it fits and feels.
 With any method of binding, it's always important to do it safely. Tight or long-term binding can cause permanent tissue damage, respiratory problems, bruising, and broken ribs.


Do not use ACE or elastic bandages over your sports bras. Any type of chest binding with bandages can be dangerous, causing damage to your breast tissue, lungs, and ribs.
Never wear your sports bra to sleep.
Only bind your chest for a maximum of 8 hours.
Get fitted for a sports bra. A professional can help you find a bra that fits you better and flattens your chest for effectively.

 This can be an easy way to change a common fraction to a decimal without using your calculator or doing long division. First, you simply have to find a way to multiply the denominator of the fraction to get either a 10, 100, 1000, and so on. You can find this number by trying to divide the denominator first by 10, then by 100, then by 1000, until you find a whole number. Here are some examples:


3/5. 10/5 = 2, which is a full number. You know you can multiply 5 x 2 to get 10, so 2 will be your magic number.
3/4. 10/4 = 2.5, so that's not a full number, but 100/4 = 25, which is a full number. So, now you know you can multiply 4 by 25 to get 100, so 25 will be the number you use.
5/16. 10/16 = .625, 100/16 = 6.25, 1000/16 = 62.5, 10,000/16 = 625, which is your first full number. So, now you know you can multiply 16 by 625 to get 10,000, so 625 is your magic number.
 This is pretty straightforward. Simply multiply both the top and bottom of the fraction by the same number. Here's how it will look:3/5 x 2/2 = 6/10
3/4 x 25/25 = 75/100
5/16 x 625/625 = 3,125/10,000

, Now, simply check out the bottom of your denominator to see how many 0s you're working with. If you just have one, then move that decimal point over to the left one digit, and so on, and you'll have your final answer. Here's how you do it:


3/5 = 6/10 = .6
3/4 = 75/100 = .75
5/16 = 3,125/10,000 = .3125

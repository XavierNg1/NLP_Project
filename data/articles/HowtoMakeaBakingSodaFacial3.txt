 Before you can use this facial, your face will need to be clean and free of any oil or dirt. Wash your face using warm water and some face wash. Rinse the soap off and pat your face dry using a clean towel.
 Soak a washcloth in warm water and squeeze the extra moisture out. You want the cloth to still be wet, but not dripping or soaking.
 You will ½ teaspoon of raw honey. The honey will not only get rid of any pimple and blackhead-causing bacteria, but it will also help reintroduce moisture into your skin.
 You will need ½ teaspoon of baking soda. The baking soda will act as a mild abrasive and help exfoliate your skin.
 You can use your finger, or you can simply fold the washcloth over the baking soda and honey, and massage it until you get a paste.
 Be sure to get the mixture all over your face, but avoid getting any near your eyes or mouth. Do not rub your skin too hard, or you will risk irritating your skin.
 Gently splash your face with warm water, and massage the skin to get the mixture off.
 You will need ¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) of water and 3 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar. Pour both ingredients into a clean bottle and shake it to combine everything. Baking soda may upset the pH of your skin, but apple cider vinegar will help balance it out again.


This toner is perishable and will need to be kept in the refrigerator when you are not using it.
Consider adding 5 drops of rosemary essential oil to your apple cider vinegar toner. Rosemary essential oil has both preserving and antibacterial properties.
 Soak a cotton ball with some of the toner, and gently rub it over your face, focusing on the forehead, cheekbones, and nose. Avoid the sensitive areas around the eyes and mouth.

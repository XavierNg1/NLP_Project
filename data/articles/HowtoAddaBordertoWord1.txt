 Borders work best if you highlight either an entire paragraph or a single line. If you highlight multiple lines but not an entire paragraph, each line will have its own separate border., You'll find the Borders options in the Home tab in all versions of Word since 2007.
 You can find this in the Paragraph group, next to the Shading (paint bucket) button.


Clicking the Borders button will add a simple line bottom border to your selected text.
 This will open a list of border configurations you can pick. You'll see a preview of the border as you place your cursor over each on.


If you're just looking for a simple border, you can select it from this menu. Read on to create a more stylized border.
 By default, the border will just be a simple solid line. The Borders and Shading window will allow you to customize the appearance of the border.
 You can choose between a Box, Shadow, or 3-D border. These options can be found along the left side of the Borders and Shading window.
 The Style menu will display a list of available styles for your border lines. Select the type of line you want to use for your border.


Use the Color drop-down menu to change the line color.
Use the Width drop-down menu to change the size of the border line.
 By default, the border will form a complete box. You can press the buttons around the preview toggle sides off or on.
 If you want the border closer to or farther from the text, the Options button will allow you to change the distance. You can set separate distances for each side of the border.
 The border you've selected will be applied to your highlighted text.

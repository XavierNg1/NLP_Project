 When you begin supplementing your cat’s food with enzymes, start with a dosage that is smaller than the recommended amount. Over the course of one to two weeks, gradually increase the dosage to the proper amount. This way you can monitor the effects of the supplements on your cat’s health.For example, if you feed your cat one cup of food per day, then sprinkle less than ¼ teaspoon of powder onto your cat’s food for the first five to seven days.;
, Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon of powder for every cup of food, or sprinkle an appropriate amount of powder per the instructions on the bottle. You can mix the powder into your cat's dry or wet food, or leave it on top.For example, if you feed your cat two cups of food per day, then sprinkle ½ teaspoon of enzyme powder over your cat’s food.
Some products may advise you to mix the powder with water. If this is the case, then mix the powder with an appropriate amount of water per the instructions on the bottle.
 Because dosing is easier to control with powders, you may want to choose the powder form over the tablet. However, the powder may make your cat's food soupy and unappetizing.If your cat refuses to eat its food because the enzymes make it unappetizing, then opt for the chewable tablets instead.

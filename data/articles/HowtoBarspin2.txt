 Do your Bunny Hop, but practice doing it so you pinch your seat with your thighs as you go up.


Feel the control of the bike as your things hold the seat. That control is how you will be able to barspin.
You may need to adjust your seat height to be a little higher. If it is too low you won't be able to do the seat pinch very well. You can always put it back lower once you get it.
Wear knee pads when you practice the seat pinch. Unless you love bruises all over your knees. Some people do.
Practice riding with no hands, keeping the bike straight by doing the seat pinch. Do that no hands riding on flat ground again.
 The manual spin is just practicing the spin of the handlebars with the bike still.


Hold the bike (or scooter) still by putting the wheels hard against a chain link fence.
Get the front wheel off the ground by holding the bike up with your feet.
Spin spin spin. Practice spinning the handlebars. Use one hand to spin, the other hand to catch. (Very important.) Doesn't matter which hand is the spin and which is the catch.
Practice the hand spin till you get it.
 It's up to you and your bike. 360 is normal. But just choose one.


Try each when you practice, and you will know pretty quick what you like.

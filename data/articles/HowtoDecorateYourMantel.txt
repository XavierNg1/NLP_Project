,, First, find a medium rectangular picture in a frame. It could be a family picture, or even a famous painting by Van Gogh or Monet. Whatever image you feel would match the setting of the room, put it in the center. This will add a nice old fashioned, but somewhat modern look to your living room.
 These pictures should be fairly smaller than the center piece, but not tiny. They should also have frames.
 First, start with the left side. Find a candle in a fancy dish or display. Put that in the corner. Right beside the candle, place a small statue or figurine. Remember, this piece does not have to be fragile or expensive. It could be a little knick-knack you picked up at the dollar store. As long as it's pretty with colorful design.
 Do the same thing to the right side as you did to the left side, but this time the things don't have to be exactly the same. For example, instead of a big candle you could use a small candle, and if you put an angel figurine on the left side and you don't have another angel figurine, you could improvise and use a small wooden animal.
 Spray your favorite air freshener, relax in an armchair or sofa, grab the remote, and flip the TV on. Congratulations, you have decorated your mantel and made it look beautiful! You deserve to kick back and relax!

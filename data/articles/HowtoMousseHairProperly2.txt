 It should be damp to the touch all the way to the root, but it should not be dripping. Lightly wet your hair in the sink or the shower. If you accidentally get your hair sopping wet, no worries – just dry it lightly with a towel.

Try leaving time after your shower for moussing. Your hair will already be wet, so you won't waste any extra water wetting it in the sink!

, Shake the can to agitate the mousse and hold it vertically when spraying. Section your hair and apply your mousse to the roots of each section, beginning at the nape of the neck and working up to the top of the head. Don't be afraid to spray the mousse directly from the can into the hair's roots – as long as you don't over-do it, mousse is barely noticeable when it dries. Spread the mousse evenly over the root area with a finger.

If you're in a rush, simply flip your head over so that your hair hangs down and gently apply mousse to the roots this way, spreading it through the root area with your fingers.
If you have plenty of time, be methodical with your hair sectioning and your mousse application. The more richly and evenly you apply your mousse, the more "lift" you'll be able to achieve.
 Using your hands, work the mousse into your hair so that it's evenly distributed all the way to the ends. If needed, add additional mousse to any ends that the mousse doesn't reach. Comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb or a gentle brush to help distribute the mousse.

, As mousse dries, it will stiffen slightly, giving your hair more lift and strength. Use a blow dryer set to "low" to dry your hair, paying special attention to your roots. The more thoroughly you dry moussed hair roots, the stronger they'll support your hairstyle and the more "lift" you'll get.

Try using a comb or brush to part your hair so that you can blow dry the roots directly. For extra lift, pull your hair at ninety degrees from the head with short, repeated strokes while you dry it. It will dry with a very full, bodied appearance.
Alternatively, air dry your hair. Air drying won't give your hair as much volume, but it will give it a shiny, "wet" look. You can comb air-dried hair to ensure it's smooth and manageable without affecting its hold.
 Now that you've got voluminous hair, style it! This is ultimately up to you - there's no wrong or right way to style moussed hairdo. Here are just a few ideas (feel free to mix and match):

Make the most of mousse's volumizing properties by going for a lifted, "tussled" look.
Add a few twists. Twist sections from the side of your head around a brush, heat it with a blow dryer, then allow it to cool. Unwind your hair and let it fall.
Control curly, frizzy hair. If your hair reacts negatively to moisture, work a little mousse into your normal hair style to control your unruly curls.

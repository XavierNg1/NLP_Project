 This grid will be your starting point for creating your custom pattern.


Note: you can purchase poster board already grid-lined in one inch increments to use for this purpose if you like.
 Make the vertical line the length of your center front length. (this will be the center front of your corset, use it as the starting place for your remaining pattern.) For example, if the front center length was 12, you would draw a 12 inch (30.5 cm) vertical line.
 For example, if your bust is 36 inches (91.4 cm), 36 divided by two is 18.
 The length of this line should be half your bust measurement. Subtract one more inch from this length. For our example of 36 inches (91.4 cm), half would be 18, one inch less would be 17 inches (43.2 cm).
 You want a point approximately 2/7ths or 28% of your bust measurement to the left. And the point should be down from the top line by two inches plus 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) per cup size. Using a 36C, the point would be 36 divided by .28 over to the left of the original vertical line. The point would be one inch down for an A cup, 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) down for a B cup, and 2 inches (5.1 cm) down for a C cup. (2.5 for a D, 3.0 for a DD, etc) This is the underarm point.
 You can call this point "Y".
 Measure that half distance out along your horizontal line from the right side and mark it. Call this point "Z".
 Make your line a flowing curve rather than sharply angled. You now have the top edge of your Corset!

, From the bottom of the vertical line on the right, measure out half your waist measurement and mark the end of it. Let's call this point M.
 Mark the point where the line from X intersects the bottom "waist" line. Call that intersection "N".
, Mark the point as "O".
, You now have a pattern that you can follow for sewing up your Renaissance Fair corset.

 Do not take the hermit crabs name like it is. Really, hermit crabs are really very social animals. In the wild, they travel in packs of 100, so be sure to buy 2, 3, 4, or 5!;
, Some people think the hermit crab will pinch them so they don't even try to pick the thing up! If you play with the hermit crab for about 10 minutes a day, it will be really happy!

, Do not let the hermit crab sit in the cage for days and days without being taken out. It will be like jail for the little guy! Be sure to let him out at least once a day!

, If the hermit crab is stuck in a boring plain house with nothing to play with, he will not be really nice when you try to play with it. Make sure the hermit crab's house it as nice and as fun as possible! Remember to give him a 10 gallon (37.9Â L) tank with a lid to keep heat and humidity in. Your crab will suffocate if he gets cold! A good book to buy/check out would be Hermit Crabs for Dummies seeing as it was written by someone who knew what they were talking about and it doesn't give false information..

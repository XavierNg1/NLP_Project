, For this example a manga drawing is been used. You could choose anything you like. You can choose to copy the image entirely over the layer or you could make it smaller with the Transform tool. If you do this take the eyedropper tool (I) and click on a colored part of the logo. Change your background color to your foreground, and pick another color that matches your logo.


If everything is alright you should have something like this example.
 Enlarge the layer with the Zoomtool and use your Pencil to make 3 squares just like the picture on the right side.


Click on Edit and choose Define Pattern, name your pattern and click OK.
 Make sure you choose the pattern you just made. Fill the layer. As result you should have a grid pattern on the layer similar like the picture on the right side.
 Choose the type tool, choose a font and size and type the text.

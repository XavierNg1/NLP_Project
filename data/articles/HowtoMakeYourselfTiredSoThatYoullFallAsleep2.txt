 Working out during the day is an incredibly effective way to rest better at night. In fact, exercise seems to correspond so directly with sleep quality that many of our hypotheses about the purpose of sleep stem from our observations of how exercising depletes our energy reserves.Just be sure not to exercise within three hours of bedtime, as it can have a temporary stimulating effect., Make a stop at the bathroom just before bed. This will help you to clear your digestive system so that you fall asleep more easily — and stay asleep throughout the night. In the same vein, don’t drink large amounts of fluids in the hours leading up to your bedtime and which might wake you up in the middle of the night. Limit what you drink after about 8 pm., Make your body as comfortable as you can for sleep. If some of your clothing feels tight, don't hesitate to loosen or remove it. This includes your hair bands, socks, bra, and anything else that might feel like it's not letting blood circulate freely. Make sure that you have enough pillows and blankets to be comfy, as well.
 If you pay attention to how you sleep, you might notice that you are sleeping in a bad position or putting strain on your posture. Keep your back straight and make sure your neck is not resting too high or too low. If your bed is too firm or too soft, consider replacing it, covering it with a foam pad, or even sleeping with a body pillow to make yourself more comfortable.

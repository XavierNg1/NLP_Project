 You’ll need a freezer-safe, shallow pan or bowl to make the ice cream. Before you begin making the base, place the container in the freezer to chill it for 3 to 6 hours.A stainless steel pan that’s approximately 13-inches by 9-inches (33-cm by 23-cm) works well for making the ice cream.
 When the pan or bowl is properly chilled, transfer your prepared ice cream base to it and cover it. Return the container to the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes so the ice cream begins to solidify.You’ll know that the ice cream is ready for the next step when the edges just begin to freeze.
 Once the ice cream has chilled for a while, take the container out of the freezer. Use an electric hand mixer to mix up the ice cream on medium speed. That will help break it up and create a smooth, creamy texture.If you don’t have an electric mixer, you can mix the ice cream by hand with a wooden spoon. It will just take a little more time and elbow grease.
 After you’ve broken up the ice cream into creamier texture, cover it again and return it to the freezer. Let it chill for another 20 to 30 minutes and then mix it again. Repeat this process another three to four times until the ice cream is firm but still creamy and smooth.If you’d like to add crumbled cookies, brownies, or candy to the ice cream, mix them in by hand just before the last time you return the ice cream to the freezer.
 If you aren’t going to eat your ice cream right away, transfer it to an airtight, freezer-safe container. Store it in the freezer until you serve it.It’s a good idea to let the ice cream sit out for 5 to 10 minutes before you serve it so it’s easier to scoop.

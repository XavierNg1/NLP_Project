 You can't shop with your friends if there are no friends coming!;
, Try making this decision ahead of time. That way, you can make sure everyone knows about it, and will be able to join you in your shopping expedition.
 If they are all in a mall, this won't be a problem.
 Even if the clothes are your size, it doesn't always mean you will like them once you try them on.
 If you are in a mall, remember that there's a food court with a variety of options. If you are not at the mall, decide on a place that is around the stores you guys are shopping at. Remember to bring money that is specifically for that, maybe $10-20.
 Remember that you will have to carry these bags around all day with your friends.
 Malls have lounge areas.

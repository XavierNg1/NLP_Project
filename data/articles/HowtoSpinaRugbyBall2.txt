 Spinning the ball keeps it stable, meaning that your teammates can prepare their hands to grab the ball seamless out of the air instead of trying to manage a wildly flailing or rotating ball. A simple spin pass is one of the quickest ways to move the ball short distances.


Accuracy is always more important than spin, so make sure you're hitting your target on throws first., This is a good position whenever you're running in open space, as it gives you lots of options. Focus on using your fingers, not your palms, to grip the ball as much as possible. From this stance, with the ball in front of your body and pointing up, you have lots of options for moves:


You can spin pass to either side.
You can drop the ball down to either hip to prepare for a long pass.
You can tuck the ball into your chest for a tackle.
You can fake throwing the ball either direction., If you're throwing with your right hand, you'll be pushing the ball to your left. Cock the ball back slightly to get a little extra power by pulling the ball over to your ribcage.
 You're aiming for your teammate's chest. Push the ball out towards them with your right hand.
 As the ball, pull your fingers back towards you, as if you were gripping a bar on a subway or train. This puts the spin on the ball. You can also work on snapping your left thumb forward, spinning the ball clockwise as you release.

 If it’s not (1/4” tip, or RCA, for instance), you’ll have to find an adapter that takes whatever the tip of your speaker cable is and changes it into a 3.5 mm tip.
 Cables today are made to last a lot longer than they used to be. This does not mean they like being bent and tangled.


It is a small amount, but tangled cables do make it harder for the current to flow through the cable and will reduce the quality of the sound. It is hardly, if noticeable at all, but take care of your cables.
 Once plugged in to your MacBook, your speakers should work out of the box. You can mess around in the sound settings to optimize the sound if need be.

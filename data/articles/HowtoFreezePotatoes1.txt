 Plan to freeze potatoes at the peak of their growing season, which differs among varieties of potatoes. Choose potatoes with firm flesh, few bruises, and no sprouts.;
, Scrub off the dirt and debris with a stiff-bristled brush.
 Use a peeler to remove the potato skin, or if you're working with new potatoes, scrape it off. Rinse the potatoes to prepare them for blanching.


If the potatoes are large, chop them in half before blanching.






Don't cut the potatoes into small pieces; it's better to store them whole if possible.
 In the meantime, prepare a large bowl with ice water and set it aside.
 Allow them to blanch for 3 to 5 minutes. This process cleanses the potatoes of organisms and preserves their flavor and color.


Transfer the potatoes directly from the pot to the ice water bath using a slotted spoon or tongs.






Allow them to cool for about ten minutes.






Drain the potatoes when they are chilled, and pat them dry.
 You may also use a freezer-safe container.


Make sure the potatoes aren't wet when you place them in the bags or ice will form.






If you aren't using a vacuum sealer, close the zippered bag almost all the way. Insert a straw into the opening. Draw out the remaining air through the straw. Withdraw the straw as you finish sealing the bag.






Put enough potatoes in each bag to make a meal for your family. This way you'll be able to defrost exactly as many as you need at once.
 They will keep for up to a year.

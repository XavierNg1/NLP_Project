 Venus loves nature and is very passionate about convincing others to take care of our Earth. She enjoys hiking and camping and anything to do with nature. Be passionate about saving the world, and be nice to others!, Venus is not afraid of making an impression. She loves green and pink. To get her look, wear a black skirt with a green and/or pink shirt, pink or green shoes, and a shrunken denim vest. All the better if the shirt is nature related!!

, Wear green eyeshadow and a thin line of eyeliner. Put on a few coats of fluttery mascara. A rose pink lipstick and blush work very nicely!

, Venus has pink and green hair, parted to the side. Since you probably don't want to dye your whole head, part your hair to the side and use temporary hair dye to put in a few well placed pink and green streaks. You can also use clip in extensions.

 Most store-bought cards come with an envelope, if not, you can buy one separate. Write the address on the center of the front of the envelope.The address should include the person's name, street and house or apartment number, city, state, and zip code.
 If the post office has trouble delivering your card, they'll be able to send it back to you at this address.


You can write the return address on the upper left corner of the envelope or on the top center of the back flap.
 Most envelopes have pre-applied adhesive on the flap that you can activate by wetting. When you close the flap, press firmly along the edge to ensure a good seal.


You can lick the adhesive on the envelope with your tongue.
You may also use a slightly damp sponge, cotton swab, or an envelope moistener to wet the adhesive.Another option is to use a glue stick to seal the envelope. This works well when the adhesive isn't strong.
 The post office offers holiday themed stamps, if you want to use them on your Christmas Cards. Once the envelope is sealed and stamped you can place it in the nearest postal mailbox for delivery.

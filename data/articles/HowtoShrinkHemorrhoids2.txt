 Try to avoid straining on the toilet. Straining to have a bowel movement is the leading cause of hemorrhoids. Don't go unless you have to, and don't sit on toilet longer than 5 minutes.


Straining is also called the Valsalva maneuver. During the strain, peripheral venous pressures become increased, causing the dilated veins to become more painful. Try placing a cushion on the toilet (available at drugstores). Sitting on a cushion rather than a hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and prevents the formation of new ones.
 Constipation makes it more likely for straining to occur, making it tough to shrink hemorrhoids. To prevent constipation, drink plenty of water and maximize fiber intake to keep things regular.


A high fiber diet along with adequate water intake helps soften stools and makes them easier to pass thus reducing pain on hemorrhoids.
High-fiber foods include broccoli, beans, wheat and oat bran, whole-grain foods, and fresh fruit.
Fiber supplements can also help. According to Harvard health you may start slowly, and gradually increase your intake to 25â€“30 grams of fiber per day. Use a stool softener if other methods don't help your constipation.
 Certain herbs and supplements have been said to help shrink hemorrhoids and prevent them from returning. There's no scientific evidence that they work, but many individuals have found relief using these remedies:


Take triphala capsules, available at health food stores. They contain herbs that help with bowel health.
Use horse chestnut and butcher's broom. These substances are used in herbal hemorrhoid creams, and you can also take them in the form of tea.
Use aloe. Eat a teaspoon of aloe after meals, and rub aloe on your hemorrhoids for a cooling effect.

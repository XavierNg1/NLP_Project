 A full veil is made out of a single piece of fabric. It is folded in half to form two tiers: a longer veil that runs down your back and a blusher that is worn over the face in the ceremony.The total length of your full combines the first measurement (measurement of the longer veil) with the second measurement (measurement of the blusher). After adding together the two measurements, cut your veil to the appropriate length., Lay out the material on a flat, clean surface. Fold the material in half lengthwise. Fold the material in half widthwise., Locate the corner of the material where all four layers are separate. Use a pair of fabric scissors to round off the corners. You may measure this curve or choose to eyeball it. To achieve a smooth curve, carefully trim off the rough edges., Unfold the material and lay it out flat once again. Fold the top edge of the veil down so that it lays on top of the bottom layer of material. Adjust the length of the top layer until it is as long as the blusher measurement., Thread a needle. Insert the needle through both layers of material near the fold. Create a secure stitch on one end of the veil. As you continue stitching, gather the material. When you reach the other side, make sure the length of the gatherer material matches the length of your comb. Knot the thread and cut off the needle., Place the comb, curved side up, on top of the gathered edge. The blusher should be the top layer. Use a threaded needle to attach the comb to the veil by stitching several times around each tooth.

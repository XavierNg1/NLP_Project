 Solve T = 72 รท R. This is the same equation as above, just slightly rearranged. You simply enter a value for R. For example:


How long will it take for $100 to assume the purchasing power of $50, given an inflation rate of 5% per year?

Let 5 x T = 72, so that T = 72 รท 5, meaning T = 14.4. That's how many years it would take for money to lose half its buying power in a period of 5% inflation.


R x 10 = 72, where T = 10. Then R = 72 รท 10 = 7.2%.
 If you detect general trends, don't worry about numbers that are wildly out of range. Drop them from consideration.

 Find a sheet of plain drawing or a 9” X 12” piece of computer paper for your initial drawing. You will need a 12” ruler, a sharp pencil, an eraser, an uncluttered work space and/or a support board of plexiglass, stiff cardboard or foam core board, larger than your paper.;
, Be sure it is aligned exactly with the edges of your support board or table. Plan to keep the paper in this horizontal position while working on your drawing. Going off-angle will cause confusion as you work., This is is your "horizon line," also known as the eye level. Make it dark enough to see, but not so dark that you can’t eventually erase parts of it. The horizon line is where the sky and earth meet. It is also at your eye level.
 Put them at the very ends of the horizon line. Make small Xs or dots on the line. These points on the horizon line are where things you are looking at grow so small from distance that they blur into a spot and diminish., Do this by holding a glass straight out from your eyes to view it on eye level. Hold it a few inches below your eyes to see it from below eye level and a few inches above to see it from above eye level. You will work at eye level.

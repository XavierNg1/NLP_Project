 Micrometers and nanometers are both units of measurement in the metric system. Nanometers are smaller than micrometers.There are 1,000 nanometers in 1 micrometer., This information should be given to you. Make sure you are supposed to convert micrometers to nanometers. If you are converting nanometers to micrometers, or between units of measurements other than these two units, you cannot use this method, as  your calculations will be different. 

The micrometers might be listed as a whole number, or as a decimal. For example, you might need to convert 7.8 micrometers to nanometers.
 Since you are converting a larger unit into a smaller unit, you will end up with more units than you started with.Since there are 1,000 nanometers per 1 micrometer, to find the number of nanometers, multiply by 1,000.

For example, 7.8Ã—1,000=7,800{\displaystyle 7.8\times 1,000=7,800}.So, 7.8micrometers=7,800nanometers{\displaystyle 7.8\,{\text{micrometers}}=7,800\,{\text{nanometers}}}.

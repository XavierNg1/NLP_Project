 Turning your Location Data on or off can only be done in the Settings menu of your device.


Locate the Settings icon in your home screen or app drawer. The settings icon is a circular gear-like icon with a gray background and has the word “Settings” under it.
Enter the Settings by tapping on the Settings icon in your screen.;
, The Privacy tab has an icon on its left side showing a hand with its palm facing towards you and is set against a gray background.
, Tapping on “Location Services” will bring you to a new menu where you will see “Location Services” and a sliding On-Off rounded switch on its right side. Slide the round switch from left to right to turn the Location Services ON (you will see a green indicator on the left side of the rounded switch).


When you turn the Location Services on, you will be given a menu of applications below it. The Applications, and their icons, that you will be given are the installed applications in your device. You can now select which applications can access the Location Services in your gadget.
 In choosing the applications that may use your Location Services, repeat what you have done earlier when turning on the Location Services—by sliding the round switch on the right side of each chosen application from left to right.


Applications that try to access your location for the first time, even if they are running in the background, will always ask for your permission. You will see a prompt that will show what application is trying to access your location and a little explanation from the application’s developer how your location will be used by that application. You will be given two options: “Don’t Allow” and “Allow.” Just tap on the option that suits you.

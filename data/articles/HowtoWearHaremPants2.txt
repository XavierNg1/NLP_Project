 Cropped jackets and tops with harem pants look great because they allow the pants to be the obvious feature. Not only do short tops help people to see that your pants are deliberately billowing, but they accentuate the style. Defining the waist is key to successfully wearing harem pants, and shorter tops help accomplish this.Try a structured blazer in a neutral color such as tan, white, or black that match everything to wear with your pants.Be sure not to let your waist get lost. To help define your waist, stick with a crop top, or try wearing a belt around the smallest parts of your waist., If you do not want to wear a crop top, or your harem pants are not high waisted enough for one, wear a shirt that cuts off just below the top of the pants. This way, your shirt will give you the coverage that you need without covering so much of the pants that it looks sloppy. The top can be slightly lose or fitted, just not baggy.
 If you are wearing a longer shirt with your harem pants, it is important to tuck it in to avoid looking sloppy. A proper tuck is one that is slightly lose, but not billowy or coming undone.Watch out for shirts that are shorter in the front than in the back. These shirts do not tuck as well in the front, and you may be better off not tucking this style.

 Wash twelve avocados and cut each one in half around the pit. Use the knife to cut in a scooping motion around the pit until the two halves come apart. Use a spoon to scoop out the fruit of the avocado and deposit it in a food processor or blender. Dispose of the skin and the pit., Turn the food processor or blender onto the puree setting. Mix the avocado fruit until it forms a smooth paste. Then scoop out the blended avocado and put it in a medium-sized pot., Turn the oven on to medium heat and heat the avocados in the pot, stirring every five minutes. When the mixture starts to boil, it will start bubbling and you should notice the avocado oil rising to the top., Keep cooking and stirring the mixture until the avocado changes from a light green to a dark green or brown, and the water has evaporated., When the avocado mixture has stopped cooking, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Place a clean, thin cloth such as cheesecloth on top of the bowl, then holding the cloth in place around the rim of the bowl, turn the bowl upside-down and pinch the corners of the cloth together so that youâ€™re left with a sack of avocado., Squeeze the sack of avocado over a bowl to strain out the oil. The oil should come out drop by drop into the bowl. Keep changing your grip and squeezing for a minute or so until no more oil is coming out., Once you have squeezed out all the oil, pour the oil from the bowl into a small bottle or into a container with a lid. Your avocado oil is now ready for use!

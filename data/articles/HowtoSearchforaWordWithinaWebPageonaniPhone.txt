 Safari is preinstalled on your iOS device, so there’s no need to download and install it. Just look for the compass icon with a blue background on the home screen of your device, and tap it.;
, Enter the URL of the website you want to search for words at in the address box at the top of the browser. Wait until the web page loads completely.
 However, DO NOT press the Enter or Go key. As you enter the keyword to search for, a list of suggestions will display below the URL bar. Depending on how common the word you’re search for is, this list can be pretty long.
 Scroll down the suggestion list and find “On this page (X matches),” where X is the number of keyword matches found on the current web page.
 Tap the “On This Page” suggestion, and then tap “Find ” that appears below. You will then be taken to the first keyword match on the page, which will be highlighted.
 You can use the arrows at the bottom of the screen to cycle through the matching keywords until you find the one you need.
 You will remain on the selected keyword screen, and the highlights will be removed.

 These are typically the least dirty of all the dishes, so its a good idea to start your child off by cleaning these. First, instruct your child to submerge the dirty glass, plate or bowl into the soapy water or under the running water. Next, have your child remove the object from the soapy water and scrub it clean with the sponge, adding more soap if necessary. Finally, have your child rinse the object with clean water, stacking cleaned, rinsed objects beside the sink.


With younger children, it is always a good idea to demonstrate how to do the above steps before asking them to do it for themselves.
 These are often more dirty, with stains and leftovers that are much more difficult to scrub off. Again, begin by helping your child submerge the cooking dishes into soapy water. Next, instruct your child to remove the object from the soapy water and scrub it clean with the sponge, adding more soap if necessary. Have your child rinse the object with clean water, stacking cleaned, rinsed objects beside the sink.


Remind your child that the cooking dishes can be very dirty, so extra scrubbing may be necessary.
You can use plastic scrubbers or steal wool pads if necessary.
 Once all dishware and cooking dishes have been washed and rinsed, its time to instruct your child how to dry. Make sure the drying towels are clean, and if they become too damp while drying, use a second towel. When everything has been dried, show your child where clean plates, glasses, pots and pans are placed.

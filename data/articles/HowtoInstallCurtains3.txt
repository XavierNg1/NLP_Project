 Attach your curtains to the rod before hanging the rod from its brackets. This will make things easier for you. Clip the straight tops of tab-less and pocket-less curtains with curtain clips. Start at the outer edge of each panel and space each clip evenly.


Thread the rod through the top pocket opening of the rod pocket curtain panels. Pull each tab loop of both curtains over the rod.
 For most bracket and rods systems, you'll either thread each end of the rod through the bracket holes or place the rod on top of a crescent-shaped depression in the brackets., Press the two finials into each end of the rod, or screw them in place, depending on their construction. Once the curtains are hanging from the rods in the desired spot, test the curtains. Make sure you can move the curtains as theyâ€™re designed to move.

 Rewrite the quadratic equation in its factored form. There are several ways to factor out a quadratic equation, but when done, you should be left with two sets of parentheses that, when multiplied together, equal your original equation.


Example: (using decomposition)

3x2 - 6x - 45
Factor out the common factor: 3 (x2 - 2x - 15)
Multiply the a and c terms: 1 * -15 = -15
Find two numbers with a product that equals -15 and a sum that equals the b value, -2: 3 * -5 = -15; 3 - 5 = -2
Substitute the two values into the equation ax2 + kx + hx + c: 3(x2 + 3x - 5x - 15)
Factor the polynomial by grouping: f(x) = 3 * (x + 3) * (x - 5)



, This will occur when either set of factors equals 0.


Example: 3 * (x + 3) * (x - 5) = 0

х +3 = 0
х - 5 = 0
х = -3 ; х = 5
Therefore, the roots are: (-3, 0) and (5, 0)



, The axis of symmetry for the equation will lie directly in between the two roots of the equation. You need to know the axis of symmetry since the vertex lies on it.


Example: x = 1; this value lies directly between -3 and 5

, Plug the x value for your axis of symmetry into either equation for your parabola. The y value will be the y value for your vertex.


Example: y = 3x2 - 6x - 45 = 3(1)2 - 6(1) - 45 = -48

, At this point, your last calculated x and y values should give you the coordinates of your vertex.


Example: (1, -48)

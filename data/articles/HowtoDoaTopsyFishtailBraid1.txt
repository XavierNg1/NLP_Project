 Brush your hair to get rid of any tangles. If you have freshly-washed hair, apply some texturizing spray or mousse to make it easier to work with.


This style starts at the base of your neck. It works best for longer hair.;
, Start by gathering your hair into a low ponytail at the base of your neck. Split it in half horizontally, so that you have a top half and a bottom half., Leave the bottom one alone. If you have very dark hair, you could use a black hair tie instead. Make sure that the hair tie is small; this will help reduce bulk., Make a hole in the ponytail, just above the hair tie. Bring your finger up through the hole, and hook it over your ponytail. Use your finger to bring the ponytail down through the hole., Gather a small section from the left side of your loose hair. Add it to the left side of the ponytail. Gather more hair from the right side of your loose hair. Add it to the right side of the ponytail., Wrap another clear hair tie around your ponytail, including the hair you gathered into it. Leave the loose, ungathered hair alone. Flip the now-thicker ponytail into another topsy-turvy ponytail., Continue gathering hair from the lower section of hair, and adding them to the ponytail. Tie and flip the ponytail before adding more strands of hair to it.
 Once you reach the end of your hair, gather everything together, then tie it off with a hair tie. If you have enough hair left over, you could wrap a thin strand around the hair tie to hide it from view, then secure it with a bobby pin., Use your fingers to gently tug on the outer loops of your braid. This will help give your braid more volume.When you are done, set your style with a light misting of hairspray.

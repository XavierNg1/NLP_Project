 No other state restrictions apply for a minister., There are two ways to become a minister: through a religious education or through an ordination program, typically offered in person through a church, or remotely online. Those pursuing religious education tend to want to work in a religious role, such as church leadership, where religious duties largely comprise the role of minister in an organization. Others choose to become a minister solely to be licensed to officiate weddings. Decide your path ahead of time.
 Texas does not require any licensing or registration with the government when one becomes a minister.However, becoming a minister can influence taxes, and it is best to understand these potential changes ahead of time. Familiarize yourself with Form 4361 from the Internal Revenue Service, the application for exemption from self employment tax for ministers., Once ordained, some counties may require you to remain in good standing with the ordaining body. This means that your information would be up-to-date through the website you used to complete ordination. If you are unsure whether this is required in your county, call the county clerk's office, and ask whether this is necessary. If so, it usually requires nothing more than a certificate issued from the organization.

Tell your doctor how long you've experienced your symptoms.
Your doctor will also perform a physical examination to determine the disease's effects.
He will also perform tests to diagnose vitamin B12 shortage, such as blood tests to measure vitamin B12 concentrations and folic acid and hemoglobin concentration.
Once the diagnosis is complete, your doctor will begin treatment to stop further nerve damage and quickly reduce your symptoms.

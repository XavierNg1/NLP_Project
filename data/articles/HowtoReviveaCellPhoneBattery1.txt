 You’ll need the following:


9-volt battery—Any brand will do.
Electric tape—You’ll need no more than five inches.
Electrical wire—Basic thin electrical wire will do. Red (+) and black (-) are preferred.;
, You can identify the terminals of the battery by simply looking at the side of the battery. It will have a plus (+) and minus (–) sign to mark the terminals. Remember to use two separate wires or split wires for each of the terminals.


Do not connect the positive and negative terminals of either battery with itself.
Most cell phone batteries have more than two terminals, use the ones that are furthest from each other, or the ones on the outside. The center terminals are not to be used.
 Take note which wires go to which terminals of the battery, as not to connect a positive side to a negative.



Do the same with the negative wire.
Do not connect opposite polarity, positive to negative, because this can short out your cell phone battery.



Place them in a cool, dry place, away from any water or heat.
 You should check the battery every 10-seconds or so for heat.
,, If the level is low, plug the phone into a charger and wait until it is fully charged.

 If you are able to lift up the corner of your ingrown toenail, then you can put a little bit of cotton or gauze under the toenail to prevent it from becoming more ingrown.To do this, you will need to use your fingers to gently lift up the corner of your nail that is becoming ingrown. Only put enough cotton underneath the nail to lift it off of the skin a little bit. Do not put so much cotton under the nail that it is uncomfortable.
Change the cotton or gauze twice per day for about two weeks or until your ingrown toenail seems to have healed.
 Tight fitting socks and shoes can cause ingrown toenails and may also make an ingrown toenail worse. That is why wearing loose fitting shoes or open toed shoes may help your toenail to get back to normal more quickly.Try to wear loose fitting shoes or open toed shoes until your ingrown toenail goes away.
 Toe injuries from sports or getting a stubbed toe may cause an ingrown toenail as well.Consider whether toe injuries may be causing your ingrown toenails and get some protective shoes if needed.


Try getting some shoes that have reinforced toes or steel toes.
 Keeping your feet clean and watching for signs of a new ingrown toenail may help you to stop them before they get worse. Try to check your feet every day, such as when you take a shower or bath.


Ask for help if you have trouble seeing or reaching your toes. If you are diabetic, then getting regular foot checks is even more important to detect circulation issues.

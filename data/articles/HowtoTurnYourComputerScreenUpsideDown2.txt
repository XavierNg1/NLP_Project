 If you are using Mavericks (10.9) or earlier, you can force your Mac to rotate any connected display. If you are using Yosemite, only supported displays can be rotated., How you open this option to show the Rotation settings depends on the version of OS X you are using:


Mavericks (10.9) and earlier - Hold ⌘ Command+⌥ Option and click the "Displays" option.
Yosemite (10.10) and later - Click the "Displays" option. Using ⌘ Command+⌥ Option to open the Displays option in Yosemite can result in a serious bug.
 If you don't see a Rotation menu in Yosemite, your display does not support rotating. This is typically the case for internal displays on MacBooks and iMacs.
 When you rotate a display in Yosemite and have multiple displays attached, they will all rotate. You can fix this by opening the Arrangement tab and unchecking the "Mirror Displays" box.

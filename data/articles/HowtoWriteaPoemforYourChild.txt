 It could be many things so try to categorize your ideas. For example, tease out your ideas and feelings about:


Emotions
Lessons
Family
Or anything else you can think of that means a great deal to you.;
, This will ensure that your child will listen to you and focus their attention on you and your poem. You might have to pay attention to your child's actions or what they watch and play with, so that you can connect to them.
 Just take a break from your ideas and relax or get some work done. You might have a "lightbulb" and the perfect idea for your poem will come to you, as your brain relaxes and you make connections subconsciously.
 There are many patterns, so you may have to look up some sample poems.Remember: Your poem does not need to rhyme it can just be like a list of your thoughts.
 It may seem like this is asking you to go back to seventh grade with all of the revising and organization processes, but doing this will help you create a beautiful poem for your child.


If you find an error in your poem and you don't know how to fix it, don't stress about it. You may have to take another break from your poem and do something else, you'll think of something soon enough.
 If not, then revise it once more. If you are completely done now, you can read your child your poem. Make sure you have their full attention; this means having no devices, no toys, no television, or anything else about that can distract them. Read your poem with pride and with confidence, for this poem you have carefully written just for them. May your child love it.

 If you simply cannot get your baby to stop crying, remember that it’s okay to step away for a moment. Place the baby in a safe spot (e.g. their crib), and take a minute to read a book, listen to music, or meditate.Leave the room if you must, but don’t leave for too long, as a feeling of abandonment will only make the crying worse.
 If you need more than a short break, call someone you trust to take over for an hour or two. If you have a spouse or other caregivers available, take shifts so no one gets burned out.Remember — you are not a bad parent just because you need to take a break for yourself.

 Yungoos is found on most of Alola's early routes. Weaken it down and throw a Poke Ball at it.;
, If you have 6 Pokémon in your party when you catch it, you can choose to replace another Pokémon in your party with it.
 Yungoos will only evolve during the daytime, so make sure you're training it then.
 You are getting your own Gumshoos!

 Pour the milk into a small saucepan and place it over medium heat. Heat the milk slowly, making sure it doesn't boil, until it reaches 85 °F (29 °C). Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. Turn off the heat when the milk is sufficiently warm.;
, Place the drops of rennet directly in the milk. Use a spoon to stir the mixture for about 2 minutes.
 Cover the saucepan with a clean dish towel and let the rennet and milk sit untouched for about 4 hours. The rennet will start reacting with the milk to turn it into cheese., Remove the dishcloth and use a knife to make slices in the mixture and break up the curds. Slice several times in one direction, then make several slices in the opposite direction.
 Add the salt to the saucepan. Turn the burner to medium low. Stir the mixture as it heats to help the curds separate from the whey. Stop as soon as the curds have separated and the whey looks slightly yellow. Don't overcook the mixture, or the curds will be hard.
 Place a piece of cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl Pour the curds and whey into the cheesecloth to strain the curds from the whey. Keeping the curds in the cheesecloth suspended over a bowl, cover the curds loosely with plastic wrap and place all of it in the refrigerator to let the whey continue to drain for a few hours. Stir it every once in a while to help it along.
 Place the curds in a clean bowl and add the cream or half and half. Season with more salt to taste.

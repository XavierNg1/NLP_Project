 Before wearing your Superstar shoes, treat them with a water and stain repellent. Spray the repellant evenly on the area of your shoe. Dab the excess repellant with a soft towel, and allow it to dry overnight. When the repellant dries, add a second coat. This should help prevent moisture and most minor stains from damaging your shoes.You can buy water and stain repellant at your local shoe store.
Re-apply the repellant every few weeks as you would with winter boots.;
, Try to avoid getting your shoes dirty. Keep them away from dirt and mud. Don’t run through grass. Grass stains can be very difficult to remove. Take extra precautions when you’re eating so that you don’t spill food or liquid on your shoes.


The best way to keep your shoes white is to keep them from getting discolored in the first place.
 Inevitably, you will get some dirt on your shoes. Periodically, bang the soles of your shoes together to loosen dirt particles from them. If you allow the dirt to penetrate the fabric, it will be harder to remove.


Only knock your shoes together at the soles. If you knock your shoes together anywhere else, you will scuff them up.
Don’t hit your shoes together too hard or you might damage them., When you get a stain on a rubber part of one of your shoes, immediately use a magic marker to clean it. Dampen your magic marker and wring out the excess water. Rub it gently over the stain. Use your magic marker to spot clean the shell toe and the sole of each of each of your shoes.


Be careful not to smear the stain.
 If you notice a scratch or blemish on the fabric part of one of your shoes, promptly wipe it away with a shoe cleaner wipe. Wipe your shoes in a gentle circular motion.


Wipe your shoes softly to avoid scratching them.
You can substitute baby wipes if you don’t have any shoe cleaner wipes available.

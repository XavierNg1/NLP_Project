 Send in a spy or double-agent to find out information. A double-agent is someone who pretends to be joining the enemies' army, and are figuring out information about the enemy. When the enemies' army needs the double-agent most, he brings back the information to his army. Information about the general will be very useful, because if the general has has a machine gun, you can use a nerf shield. If he has a long-strike, you can sneak up on him, because he will most likely be looking through the sights a lot. If you find him, and he doesn't see you, then hold him hostage. And, of course, you will need to know the general's location.;
, This must be practiced before it is attempted. Watch your target from a distance through binoculars until you are ready to shoot at the general.
 If it is dark, wear grey. If you are in a grassy meadow, wear green and brown, or wear a ghillie suit. A ghillie suit will make you look like a bush or the grass, and you will be able to shoot without being seen.
 Learn to Walk Silently so that you can sneak up on the general and hold him hostage, or to get into position to shoot quietly.


If you hold the general hostage, you will need another armed person with you, so that you don't get captured instead of the general. If you are successful in holding the general hostage, do not let him escape, because you will have a huge advantage over the enemies. They may try to free the general, so set traps, and hide. Also, have two people need the general.
, Don't take them all on at once. Kill them quickly before they alert the general of your arrival.
 Once all the other steps have been completed, you are now ready to move in for the kill. Do it silently. Try to bring 2 other armed people with you so that if the general attempts to run, you can outnumber him, and he won't be able to outrun you.


Try to chase him into a dead-end so that you can either kill him or hold him hostage.

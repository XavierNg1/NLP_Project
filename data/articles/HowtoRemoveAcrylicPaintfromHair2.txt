 Use a generous amount so that you can saturate your hair. If you have long hair, or if there’s a lot of paint in your hair, you may need to refill your palms with the oil several times.


If you don’t have either of these oils, you could use other substances from around the house, like peanut butter or WD-40.Follow the same process of rubbing the product between your palms, but if using WD-40, wear latex or disposable gloves since the product could cause skin irritation, and avoid using it near your scalp., Check that the affected part of your hair is coated with oil, and allow it to sit in your hair for several minutes. This will soften the paint and make it easier to flake off.For really stubborn dried paint, you may want to apply the oil to your hair, wrap your head in plastic wrap, and then wait a few hours to give it extra softening time., Make sure to use gentle strokes, so as not to pull your hair from your scalp or to break it off at the ends. Try dividing your hair into 1-inch sections and combing them each separately.


For bad tangles, start at the bottom of your hair and just comb out the last inch. Then move up and comb the inch above that. Progress this way until you’ve reached your scalp and can easily glide a comb from root to tip.
 Lather your hair with your typical shampoo and then rinse to remove the oil. Depending on how much oil was in your hair, you may need to shampoo and rinse a second time.


You may condition if you wish, but you don’t need to since the oil you used to remove the paint also moisturized your hair.

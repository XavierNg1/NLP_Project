 There is very little you can personally do to make some wishes come true. For those types of wishes, you may decide to turn to supernatural methods in an effort to make them come true. Exactly what you should do in these situations will depend on your religion.


If you believe in one or more deities or other spiritual beings that will sometimes make wishes come true, try prayer. How you do this will vary based on your faith. If you're unsure, try talking to a local spiritual leader.
Some religions use specific magical rituals called spells to make wishes come true. In some spiritual practices, spells channel the caster's own power while in others spells are cast to ask a higher power to intercede on the caster's behalf.A currently popular New Age philosophy called the Law of Attraction asserts that people shape reality through their thoughts. If you believe this, focus your thoughts on your wish to make it happen., There are many fun, supposedly wish-granting traditions that people engage in every day. Since they typically don't require much more effort than a simple thought, there's no harm in trying them. Some examples include:


Silently make a wish when blowing out the candles on your birthday cake.
If you see a shooting star, make a wish.
When you notice the time line up on a clock, for example at 11:11 or 03:33, say your wish to yourself., There are many websites that take traditional wishing into the Digital Age. These sites typically instruct you to type your wish into a textbox for it to come true. Depending on the site, your wish may be posted publically or kept private.


Be very careful not to reveal personal information when typing your wish, especially if you're a minor. Never include your phone number, name, address, or location. You never know who may be reading.

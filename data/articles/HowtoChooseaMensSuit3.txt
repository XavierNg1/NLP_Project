 The waist of the pants should sit approximately at your navel. The pants should not fall or sag when worn without a belt or suspenders. Neither should they be pinching or too tight.Wear the sort of shirt and shoes you would when wearing a suit when shopping for a suit.
If you know that you’ll be wearing a belt, a pair of suspenders, or both with your suit, try them on along with the suit. Be aware, too, that some suit pants are incompatible with belts.
 Pleated pants are those with a creased central line running down the front of each leg. Plain-front pants have a smooth uniformity across the entire surface of the legs.Pleats make the pants a bit more flexible. They are best for larger men.
Thin men tend to look best in plain-front pants.You can use pleated pants to determine if you’re wearing the right size. If the pleats disappear when standing upright, your suit pants are too tight.
 Cuffed pants are those that have a narrow margin of fabric just above the ankle of the suit pants. Uncuffed pants end without any sort of differentiation.Typically, pleated pants have cuffs and plain-front pants are cuffless.
 The break is a measure of how much your pant cuffs bunch at the ankle. No break pants just barely touch the top of your shoe and do not crease or bunch at all. Slight or medium break pants have a slight crease in the ankle or lower shin. Full break pants evince significant bunching at the ankle and lower shin., There are two types of suit pants pockets. Slanted pockets are those which extend from the waist in a downward angle toward the outer edge of the leg. Straight pockets are those which resemble a simple vertical slit in the side of the pants.Slanted pockets are slightly less formal than straight pockets.
Rear pockets always consist of a simple horizontally-oriented slit. You might have one or two rear pockets. They will typically have a button to fasten one or both.

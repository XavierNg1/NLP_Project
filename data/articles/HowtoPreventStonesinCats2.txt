 It is important to promote frequent urination for your cat, so that crystals and stones are not allowed to build up. In order to do this, you should provide several litter boxes for your cat to use and make sure they are kept clean. Putting one more litter box out than the number of cats you have will help to ensure that your cat goes whenever it has the urge.Clean litter boxes regularly in order to encourage your cat to use them.
 In order to promote frequent urination, you should place your cat's litter boxes in places that give it a bit of privacy. Placing the litter boxes in noisy or busy areas does not allow for your cat to relax and do its business.


This does not mean that your cat's litter boxes should be in out of the way places, far away from the core of your home. It simply means that your cat probably needs a bit of privacy, so place litter boxes in private corners or out of sight of the rest of the home.
 Stress can impact the health of your cat greatly, so try to keep your cat's stress to a minimum. One way to do this is to minimize changes to the cat's routine and supplies. For example, avoid changing the type of litter you put in your cat's litter boxes, as this can cause distress and confusion around urination.If your cat's routine is changed dramatically, this can cause it a lot of stress, which can lower its resistance to infections and decrease its usual eating, drinking, and urination cycles.
If you need to make changes to your cat's routine or supplies, make them incrementally. For example, if you do need to change the type of cat litter you use, do it gradually. Add some of the new type into the old type, so that the switch is made over the course of a few weeks.

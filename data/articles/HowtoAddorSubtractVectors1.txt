 These component parts are usually expressed with a notation similar to that used to describe points in a coordinate system (e.g. <x,y,z>, etc.). If these pieces are known, adding or subtracting vectors is just a simple adding or subtracting the x, y, and z components.


Note that vectors can be 1, 2, or 3-dimensional. Thus, vectors can have an x component, an x and y component, or an x, y, and z component.
Let's say that we have two 3-dimensional vectors, vector A and vector B. We might write these vectors in components as A = <Ax,Ay,Az > and B = <Bx,By,Bz>, using x y z components accordingly.;
, In other words, add the x component of the first vector to the x component of the second and so on for for y and z. The answers you get from adding the x, y, and z components of your original vectors are the x, y, and z components of your new vector.


In general terms, A+B = <Ax+Bx,Ay+By,Az+Bz>.
Let's add two vectors A and B. Example: A = <5, 9, -10> and B = <17, -3, -2>. A + B = <5+17, 9+-3, -10+-2>, or <22, 6, -12>.
 Note that subtracting one vector from another A-B can be thought of adding the "reverse" of that second A+(-B)., A = <18, 5, 3> and B = <10, 9, -10>. A - B = <18-10, 5-9, 3-(-10)>, or <8, -4, 13>.

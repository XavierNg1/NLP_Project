 Most experts recommend not bathing your baby more often than every other day. Do not use hot water. Use mild unscented soaps (e.g. Oil of Olay, Caress, Camay, Dove, Aveeno, and Purpose). Never scrub the baby’s skin. Gently apply the soap, moving the soap in small circles.Gentle soaps are better than natural antibacterial products like tea tree oil, which may trigger eczema flare ups.Baths should last no longer than 10 minutes.
Avoid bath additives that will further dehydrate your infant’s skin like Epsom salts.
An oatmeal bath with natural colloidal oatmeal, or Aveeno oatmeal bath packets, can also help.
 These three ingredients are anti-inflammatories and will reduce your infant’s eczema redness. Just add four or five drops of chamomile or licorice (the root, not the candy) into your child’s bath. Fenugreek comes in powdered seed form. Simply add a teaspoon to the warm bathwater., Some doctors will recommend a bleach bath for babies with extreme eczema. Bleach baths help prevent infections. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria that lives on the skin of many children with eczema and can occasionally cause flare ups. Bleach baths fight off this bacteria. If your doctor recommends it, substitute a normal bath for a bleach bath 2 times a week.


Pour 1/4 cup of bleach into a half-filled, warm bathtub. This is the equivalent to one to two teaspoons of bleach per gallon of water. This small amount of bleach added to the bath makes the water soothing to your baby, not harsh.
Make sure to dilute the bleach before contact and avoid contact with the eyes., Vigorous drying will only further inflame your child’s skin condition. Take a soft towel and pat your baby until their skin and hair is dry.

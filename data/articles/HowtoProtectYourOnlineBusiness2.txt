 You should never copy someone else's! No matter what your website designer/developer says, do not copy. Regulators are now starting to focus on consumer protection and in many countries they are issuing penalties to websites for non-compliant Privacy Polices and Terms. It's not worth taking the chance of being sued in your business and not worth the penalty.There are many inexpensive online services offering wording for Terms, Privacy, etc., including TermsFeed, iubenda, and Free Privacy Policy., If you have a website that is a classifieds site or other people can post things such as photos, comments, images, advertisements, you should protect yourself and your business against any claims. This could include non-receipt of a product, problems with goods and services, defamatory comments, breach of copyright, etc.You should ensure they agree in writing to take over any litigation before letting them post as you are responsible for everything on your website.
Personal guarantees without financial capability are worthless. You will need to set up a pre-approval process of anything posted on website.
 If you ensure you have visible and clear policy terms on refunds, delivery, replacements, warranties, etc., you will not only protect yourself and your business, help to minimize any confusion for your customers. Many countries have a requirement that you make your refund and return policies clear upfront.Examples of refund policies include offering a one-year warranty, stating refunds are accepted within 30 days with all tags attached, or stating that a replacement will be offered if the product is damaged during shipping or does not perform as promised.
You can never ensure you will never be sued. But you can protect yourself and your online business by setting it up correctly, and by checking that you are not breaching anyone else's copyright idea, name, terms and policies.

 To make a ~5% bleach solution add 1 tablespoon (14.8Â ml) of bleach to a cup of water. Mix well. This solution is great for sterilizing plastic surfaces.


Be careful when working around bleach to not to get any bleach on your clothes or other fabrics.
 Put bleach solution in spray bottle and spray, or use a clean rag or sponge to apply, bleach onto the plastic surface.


Alternatively if the plastic item is small and water friendly, you can soak the plastic directly in the bleach solution.
 Let the bleach solution sit on the plastic for 10-15 minutes.
 Use water to rinse off the plastic. Depending on the item you can do this with a hose or faucet, or with more delicate items you may need to wipe it down with a wet cloth.
 Dry your now clean plastic with a clean dry towel.

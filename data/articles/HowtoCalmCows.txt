 Quite often after cattle have been handled rough or have gone through some rough, stressful times, they will calm down on their own if you leave them alone. Simply leave them feed and water and don't do anything to them or with them for a few hours.;
, Never step nor push too far into a cow's flight or comfort zone otherwise you will cause unrest. It is preferable that you keep out of a cow's flight zone in order for her to remain calm and quiet.
 All animals respond better and more calmly to you and your needs if you are calm and quiet around them. Cattle have very good hearing and can hear you just fine when you're talking low. You may be the type that prefers to talk to them, or one that chooses to say little to nothing at all. It is your choice which you want to use to best get those animals to calm down.


Some cattle folk find that reading a book to a herd of cows will not only get them to relax, but to get them used to the sound of their new owner's voice, if the animals are stressed and panicked about the presence of a complete stranger.
 Don't think about anything or worry about anything. Just live in the moment, breathe deep, and think about literally nothing. When you're calm, they're calm.
 Let them choose when it is in their best interests to approach you. Cows are naturally curious, and when they've recovered their fears and curiosity takes over, they may approach you and sniff you over.


If it's safe to be in the same pen as them, simply standing in one spot will be sufficient to get them to come to you. They can smell you from a distance and study you, and make their minds up as to whether you're a threat or a friend. Remain calm throughout the whole process.

This may also be a good time to talk to them quietly if you feel the need to do so.
 Once they've calmed down or you feel they have relaxed enough for you to not be around anymore, it would be a good time to simply leave with a good frame of mind.

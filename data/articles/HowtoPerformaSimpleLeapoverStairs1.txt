 It's a good idea to have a spotter and a very soft landing. Choose someone who is already familiar with performing this parkour move, to help you get the jump sorted properly.;
, Do not leap from anywhere that is too high and/or that causes you fear. Put your safety first.


Choose a set of stairs that is reasonable, such as no more than four small steps. A set of stairs between one story and the next story of your house is not safe; never attempt to jump such a set of stairs. Always keep the amount of steps manageable and realistic for your height and athletic ability.
 Land with your knees bent and your fingertips on the floor. This ensures you can easily spring back up to continue running.
 Keep jumping from the next highest step, until you are confident with jumping from any step on the set of stairs.



Once confident with jumping from the top step, try running at the stairs and jumping. This increases your confidence.






Once you have mastered this, you could try landing and then rolling to lessen the impact.

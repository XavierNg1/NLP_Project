 You can make flowers with pleated satin ribbon fairly easily. You will need a length of ribbon between about 18 and 24-inches long. You will also need some quick drying and strong glue. If you have a glue gun, you can use that. To form the base of the flower, you need a chipboard circle, and for the centrepiece you will need a button.The diameter of the chipboard circle will depend on the size of flower you want to make.
A few inches diameter should be okay for a length of ribbon that is 18-inches long.
 Start rolling up one end of the ribbon in a spiral in one hand, so you have the beginnings of your flower. Place a blob of glue at the centre of the chipboard backing and press the centre of the small spiral onto the glue. The glue will dry quickly so you need to be able to work fast to stick the ribbon down.
 Once you have stuck down the centre of the flower, you will wrap the ribbon around in a growing spiral. Add more glue to chipboard backing as you go and stick the ribbon down. This is tricky work, but you will still need to act quite quickly.









As you wind the ribbon and stick in down, you will see that it is developing into a flower pattern.
Once you have covered the chipboard backing circle, trim off any excess of ribbon.
Finish it off by gluing your centrepiece button into the heart of the flower.

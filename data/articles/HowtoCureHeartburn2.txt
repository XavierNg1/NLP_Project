 If your frequent heartburn symptoms persist for more than two weeks despite efforts with OTC medications, then make an appointment with your doctor., Since recurrent bouts of heartburn are often indicative of gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), your doctor may ask you to submit to some diagnostic testing to help determine the best way to treat you.These tests will also examine you for a complication of GERD called erosive esophagitis, which is when your stomach acid has done actual damage to your esophagus.Tests for the condition include:X-rays to look at the shape and condition of both your esophagus and your stomach
An endoscopy, which will check for abnormalities along your esophagus caused by long-term esophageal erosion due to stomach acid, especially if you are over fifty or have had GERD for longer than five years
An ambulatory acid probe test, which measures when acid backs up into your esophagus and for what duration
Your doctor may also biopsy some of the cells found in your lower esophagus to test for a condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which is a precancerous condition resulting from long-term GERD symptoms. However, this is only a small percentage of those with GERD., Both H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are available in prescription strength from your doctor.If OTC strengths of these drugs haven’t controlled your symptoms, then your doctor will likely first recommend a prescription option to control your symptoms.
 For GERD that isn’t controlled by medication and which has developed into erosive esophagitis, your doctor may even discuss surgical options with you. These options include:Fundoplication, which is when your surgeon wraps a small section of your stomach around your lower esophageal sphincter, which helps strengthen the muscle, allowing less stomach acid to pass through it
Inserting a device (such as a Linx) that is implanted along your lower esophageal sphincter to help strengthen it

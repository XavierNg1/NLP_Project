For example, you might be telling yourself that you’ll say something stupid or embarrassing.If this is the case, try to think about times when you have made a phone call and you didn’t say anything embarrassing. Now, reframe your self-talk by saying something like, “I have made several phone calls without embarrassing myself. I am capable of having a successful telephone conversation.”

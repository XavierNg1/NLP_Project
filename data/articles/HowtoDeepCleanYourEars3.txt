 If you have a stubborn plug of earwax that can’t be coaxed out with mineral oil, you can try flushing it out at home. This is often how doctors do the job, but they have specialized tools and training. Don’t squirt excessive amounts of liquid into your ear, or with excess pressure, or you may damage your eardrum., This is the type of gadget used to clean out a baby’s nose. Make sure the liquid is at body temperature.Squeeze the bulb, place the tip down into the liquid, and loosen your squeeze; the liquid will draw up into the bulb.
 Place the bulb just inside the rim of your ear canal but never any further into the ear. Hold your head upright, but slightly tilted to that side so the liquid can drain out.Stop immediately if you feel pain. See your doctor instead.
You may want to try to soften and loosen the earwax with mineral oil before attempting this method.

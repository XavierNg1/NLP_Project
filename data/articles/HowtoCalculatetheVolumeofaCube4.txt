 By definition, the diagonal of a perfect square is √2 × the length of one of its sides. Thus, if the only information you're given about a cube is regarding the diagonal length of one of its faces, you can find the side length for the cube by dividing this value by √2. From here, it's relatively simple to cube your answer and find the volume of the cube as described above.


For instance, let's say that one of a cube's faces has a diagonal that is 7 feet long. We would find the side length of the cube by dividing 7/√2 = 4.96 feet. Now that we know the side length, we can find the volume of the cube by multiplying 4.963 = 122.36 feet3.
Note that, in general terms, d2 = 2s2 where d is the length of the diagonal of one of the cube's faces and s is the length of one of the sides of the cube. This is because, according to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sums of the squares of the other two sides. Thus, because the diagonal of a cube's face and two of the sides on that face form a right triangle, d2 = s2 + s2 = 2s2.
 If the only piece of information you're given about a cube is the length of a 3-dimensional line segment stretching diagonally from one corner of the cube to the corner opposite it, it's still possible to find the volume of the cube. Because d forms one of the sides of a right triangle that has the diagonal between the two opposite corners of the cube as a hypotenuse, we can say that D2 = 3s2, where D = the 3-dimensional diagonal between opposite corners of the cube.


This is because of the Pythagorean Theorem. D, d, and s form a right triangle with D as the hypotenuse, so we can say that D2 = d2 + s2. Since we calculated above that d2 = 2s2, we can say that D2 = 2s2 + s2 = 3s2.
As an example, let's say that we know that the diagonal from one of the corners in the base of the cube to the opposite corner in the "top" of the cube is 10 m. If we want to find the volume, we would insert 10 for each "D" in the equation above as follows:


D2 = 3s2.
102 = 3s2.
100 = 3s2

33.33 = s2


5.77 m = s. From here, all we need to do to find the volume of the cube is to cube the side length.
5.773 = 192.45 m3

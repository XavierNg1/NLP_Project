, Remove the dough from the refrigerator and discard the plastic wrap. Set the dough on a floured work surface. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) circle.


If you want to make one large pie, roll the dough into a shape that matches the dish you're going to use. This could be a round pie or cake pan or a casserole dish.
If you plan to make individual pies, cut the rolled-out dough into smaller shapes large enough to cover the baking dishes you plan on using., If you want to make one large pot pie, pour the entire amount of filling into a deep pie dish or cake pan or an 8-inch casserole dish. To make individual pot pies, distribute it evenly among 4 ramekins.
 Drape the crust over the top of the baking dish, or dishes. Use your fingers to crimp it around the edges so that it stays secured in place. Use a knife to make a few cross hatches in the top of the crust. If you wish, use a fork to make decorative notches around the edge of the pie. If you're making more than one pie, repeat until each pie has a crust.
 Place the pie (or pies) on a baking sheet, so that the filling won't spill over onto your oven floor as it cooks. Bake for about 20 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and slightly puffed.

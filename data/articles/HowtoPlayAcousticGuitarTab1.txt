 If you're confident finding frets and strings quickly, you can move past this step and onto reading tabs. However, it never hurts to review some guitar basics:



Fretting: The small metal strips on the guitar neck. If you're right-handed, then the first fret is the one farthest to the left. To play a fret, you push the string down just to the left of fret (right-handed). So, to play the 3rd fret you'd play just to the left of the third metal strip, so your finger is between the second and third frets.

Strings: The six strings are ordered, starting from the thinnest string on the bottom, as eBGDAE. The thinnest string is the 1st string, the thickest string (on top) is the sixth string.;
, Tablature uses six lines to tell you which string to play on. The number on the line tells you what fret to play on that string. So recognizing and memorizing these strings is essential to quickly play tabs. The top line is always your 1st string, the higher E-string. The last line is for your sixth string, the thickest string on the guitar. Some tabs label the strings, some do not:e|-------------------------------------|B|-------------------------------------|G|-------------------------------------|D|-------------------------------------|A|-------------------------------------|E|-------------------------------------|







, When you see a number other than zero, press down in before the fret of that string and play that note. So, if there is a "2" on the second string, you'd play the note on the second fret, second string. If you see "0" you don't hold any frets down. Just play the string openly. In an example:










e|-----0--2--4--2--0--2--4--2--0------|
For example, the tab above would simply cycles through three notes, the open E-string, the second fret, the fourth, and then back down.
 If there are a few numbers stacked on top of each other then you should play a chord. Play all the notes simultaneously. Fret all of those frets at once and strum the strings that are fretted. Note that any zeros are open strings, and still part of the chord.









Some tabs also tell you the chord right above the tab, putting a "Gmaj" or "C7" above the tab so that you can read it much more quickly than six simultaneous notes. The chord in the video is a C-major.
 Once you know the basics of tablature, all you have to do to play it is read from left to right. As notes come up, just follow the fretting pattern to play the song. Note, however, that this is just the order of the notes, not the speed and length they're played. This, however, can help you if you're just starting -- you can follow the tab in any tempo you like to get used to the notes, then slowly speed up.
 Unlike traditionally scored music, tabs may not show how long to play or hold a note. The best way to learn is to play the tab along to the original song, getting used to the timing and feel. Some tabs have a small tempo designation at the top, but since you don't know how long to play each fret for, this may not be very helpful.









While the distance between notes on the tab is a good guide of pauses and timing, it is just an approximation. Don't expect each space to be perfectly timed out.
Many tabs have lyrics written near the notes. While not perfect, this is a good way to get used to the timing.

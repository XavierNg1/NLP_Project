 Adjust the saw blade to about .25 inches (0.635 cm) above the thickness of your board. Setting the blade too high could splinter your wood and setting it too low will cause it to not cut all the way through., If you don't have a built-in miter gauge, you'll have to set one into the miter gauge slot, which should be on the left of your saw blade. If your saw didn't come with a miter gauge, you can purchase one at a hardware store or online., To make perfect crosscuts, the miter gauge must be squared with the sawblade. Loosen the handle on the miter gauge and place a 45-degree drafting triangle along the length of your saw blade. Adjust the gauge until both sides of your drafting triangle runs at a 90-degree angle against the blade and the miter gauge. Once it's perfect, retighten the handle on the gauge to hold it in place., Use your right hand to pull the miter gauge handle and set the gauge to the back of the saw. Using your left hand, firmly hold your board against the edge of the miter gauge. Keep your fingers at least 6 inches away from the saw blade cover.The board should be sitting at a 90-degree angle to your blade on the miter gauge fence.
 Push slowly but deliberately with your right hand onto the miter gauge handle and keep a firm grip on the board with your left hand. Push the miter gauge fence forward and cut your board., Once you've cut through your piece of wood, pull back the board to the starting position. Turn off your table saw, and you've just made a crosscut.

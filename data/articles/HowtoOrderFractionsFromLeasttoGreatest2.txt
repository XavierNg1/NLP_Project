 For example, compare the fraction 3/5 and the fraction 2/3. Write these next to each other on the page: 3/5 on the left, and 2/3 on the right.
 In our example, the top number, or numerator, of the first fraction (3/5) is 3. The bottom number, or denominator, of the second fraction (2/3) is also 3. Multiply these together: 3 x 3 =Â ?


This method is called cross-multiplication, because you multiply numbers in a diagonal line across from each other.
 Write the product, or answer to your multiplication problem, next to the first fraction on the page. In our example, 3 x 3 = 9, so you would write 9 next to the first fraction, on the left side of the page.
 To find out which fraction is larger, we'll need to compare our answer above with the answer to another multiplication problem. Multiply these two numbers together. For our example (comparing 3/5 and 2/3), multiply 2 x 5 together.
 Write the answer to this second multiplication problem next to the second fraction. In this example, the answer is 10.
 The answers to the multiplication problems in this method are called cross-products. If one cross-product is larger than the other, then the fraction next to that cross-product is also larger than the other fraction. In our example, because 9 is less than 10, this means 3/5 must be less than 2/3.


Remember, always write the cross-product next to the fraction whose top number you used.
 To compare two fractions, typically you transform them to give them the same denominator, or lower part of the fraction. Secretly, this is what cross-multiplication does!It just skips over actually writing the denominators, since once the two fractions have the same one, you only need to compare the top two numbers. Here's our same example (3/5 vs 2/3), written without the cross-multiplying "shortcut":


3/5=(3x3)/(5x3)=9/15
2/3=(2x5)/(3x5)=10/15
9/15 is less than 10/15
Therefore, 3/5 is less than 2/3

 Try to wait until there is a break in the class discussion or a transition between activities. Raise your hand or approach the teacher’s desk and ask to visit the restroom. Do this as soon as you suspect that your period is starting so you can avoid any staining. You may need to indicate that you can't wait, as some schools limit bathroom breaks.You might say something general, such as "Excuse me, I know that we're going over important material right now, but I need to go to the restroom and it's urgent.";
, Provide additional details if your teacher refuses your first bathroom break request. Approach your teacher’s desk or wait until the end of class to keep this conversation private.


You could explain, “I’ve started my period and I need to visit the restroom to take care of it.”
For added protection, you can request, “Please keep this private.” They should do this anyway, but it might give you extra peace of mind to state it directly.
 Wrap a sweater or jacket around your waist, if you have one. If not, your teacher might let you borrow one. Know that just because you started your period does not mean that you will stain your clothes.
 Take a number of deep breaths as you walk to the restroom. Do a quick back stretch in the restroom. Smile. Remind yourself that women have periods and it is completely normal.
 The adults around you have all dealt with periods before, in one fashion or another. They are used to these situations and will not feel weird or embarrassed about talking about your period with you.

 You will have to be observant to notice them. In fact, the more obvious the signs are, the more serious the rabbit's condition is.


This means that you want to get a rabbit's temperature under control before it is showing the physical signs of heat stroke. That can only be done if you are being an attentive rabbit owner.
 The earliest hint of impending heat stroke is red ears. This is because the rabbit increases the blood supply to the ears in order to try and lose heat.The ears have less fur, so the heat can more easily come out of the rabbit's body through the exposed skin on the ears.
 Rabbits cannot pant and only sweat through minor sweat glands in the paws, so they have no efficient way of cooling off. They usually breathe through their nostrils but when over hot they will open their mouth and attempt to mouth breath.This is unusual and so should be taken seriously.
 In addition to mouth breathing, the rabbit may flare its nostrils. This indicates heavy breathing and breathing more quickly in order to try and lose heat., This can indicate a variety of problems in rabbits, most commonly problems with their teeth, but it is also a sign that the rabbit is overheated. The rabbit may drool or dribble saliva in an attempt to lose heat., Commonly, heat stroke will cause lethargic and weak behavior. The rabbit will be reluctant to move and wants to stay in the same spot. If forced to move, the rabbit may seem weak and wobbly, or confused.Ultimately, heat stroke leads to convulsions, which can lead to coma and death.

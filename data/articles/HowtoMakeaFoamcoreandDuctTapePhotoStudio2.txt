 This will work for a headshot, still life, or macros.


The background can be propped up against a heavy object such as a can of food, a pile of books, a wall, etc. Or, you could make a stand to attach to the back of the piece of foamcore so that it is able to stand alone, allowing you to place it just about anywhere.
If you intend to use foamcore outside, you'll need to attach a weighted stand to prevent it from blowing away. Taping on a stone, metal weight or similar object to the stand will give the background some strength against a breeze.
 Use tape the same color as the foamcore to tape the background pieces together for a larger background or an instant small studio for special objects.

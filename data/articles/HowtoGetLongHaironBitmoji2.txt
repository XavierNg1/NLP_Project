 To change your Bitmoji’s hair and other features on your computer, you’ll need to be using the Bitmoji browser extension for Chrome.

If you don’t have Chrome, see How to Download and Install Google Chrome before proceeding with this method.
 If you see a green button with a white winking chat bubble at the top-right corner of Chrome, you already have the extension and can skip this step. Otherwise:

Go to https://www.bitmoji.com.
Scroll down and click Get it on Google Chrome. It’s a large black button near the bottom of the screen.
Click Add Extension.
When you see the sign-in screen, enter your Bitmoji username and password, then click Log In. If your Bitmoji account is linked to Facebook, click Log in with Facebook to sign in (you’ll have to sign in to Facebook if you’re not already signed in).
 It’s the green icon with a winking white chat bubble at the top-right corner of Chrome. A small window will appear displaying your personalized Bitmoji., It looks like a person’s head with a pencil at the top-left corner of the Bitmoji window., Since the Bitmoji Style avatar doesn’t include the option to change hair-length, you’ll need to switch to Bitstrips Style., Now you’ll see several options that you can change., It’s in the second column near the top of the list., You’ll see a preview of your avatar with its new long hair.

Changing the hair length may also change the hairstyle to something you don’t like. To choose a new hairstyle, click Hair Length, then click Hair Style (it’s just above Hair Length) to select a new style.
 It’s the green box at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Your Bitmoji now has long, luxurious locks.

 Wash the car panel with a light soap and warm water. Dry the area thoroughly with a clean white towel.

, This is the least abrasive measure for taking care of fine scratches. Sometimes it is all that is needed to get rid of a scratch.
 Auto detailing solution can be used, but acetone products, such as nail polish remover, work just as well. Moisten a clean, white cloth with acetone and wipe it lightly over the scratch. Continue applying the acetone until the scrape or scratch vanishes.
 If the scratch does not disappear after applying the acetone, get some car rubbing compound and a buffing pad. The car rubbing compound can be found at any auto parts or body detailing store.
 Saturate sandpaper with water and rub it carefully over the affected area. Wet sanding will remove the scratches and any other imperfections by using the heavier grit of the sandpaper against the lighter grit in the paint.









Use an ultra fine sandpaper, preferably a 2,000 to 3,000 grit wet/dry sandpaper when sanding. Add two or three drops of liquid dish soap to the water before wetting the sandpaper to make the water a little more slippery. This will help to improve the sanding.
 Dust away any debris or dust from the buffing and the sanding.



Apply car wax or polish again if you used more abrasive methods. Using products such as acetone, buffing compound, and sandpaper will remove protective wax and sealers, as well as scratches and scrapes. Use any brand of wax or polish that is usually used on the car and lightly cover the paint with it.

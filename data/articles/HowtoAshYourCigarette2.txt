 The cigarette should be held at its filter with the index finger hovering above. The grip should be firm without crushing the filter in the process.
 Be sure not to tap it too hard or else the cigarette will bend a bit or break. Avoid touching the ash or the point where the cigarette is lit so you don’t burn yourself.
 This method doesn’t provide a great amount of pressure on the cigarette so it’s likely that you’ll have to “ash” it multiple times. Always find a proper place to ash that doesn’t damage yours or someone else’s property.

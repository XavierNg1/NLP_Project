 This will open the program to a new blank page (e.g., a blank Word document).


You can also click on an MS Office program from the Programs list in the Start menu.
 Once you open the blank document in any MS Office program, look at the top-left of the screen for the Microsoft Office button, which is circular in shape having four different colors squares inside it; click on it. This will open the File menu for the 2007 version of the MS Office program you opened.
 Replace with the MS Office program you opened. For instance, if you opened MS Word, you’ll find “Word Options”; if you opened Excel, you’ll find “Excel Options.”


You can find this button right next to the “Exit” button.
 The Options window will open on the Popular tab by default, displaying a series of customization options on the left panel.
 Under the heading “Top options for working with word” is a drop-down option with “Color scheme” written besides it. Click this to view the different themes available for you to choose.
 Microsoft Office 2007 has three color themes: Black, Silver, and Blue.
 This will apply the theme to all MS Office programs.

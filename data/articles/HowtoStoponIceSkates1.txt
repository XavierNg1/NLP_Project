 This is usually touted as the easiest way for pure beginners to learn how to stop on ice skates. Begin by skating slowly forward, on a straightaway, with no obstacles or turns before you., As you glide, turn one skate at a 45 degree angle. Let it hang behind the other skate to create friction.
 Bring the dragging skate up into the instep of the leading skate. Make sure to keep your dragging skate in contact with the ice as you do this. You may need to apply some pressure., Lean back slightly, and tip your weight into the direction you're coming from. Keep your shoulders straight, pointing forward. Let your arms hang at your sides. Keep your weight on the rear foot, creating friction, until you slowly come to a stop.

 Bees will flee from smoke, or become dazed and less aggressive if they inhale too much. Build a campfire or light a smoky candle to keep bees away from your camping or picnicking area. A barbecue is unlikely to be effective, due to the attractive scent of meat.


Citronella candles, which are often sold as insect repellants, may be effective at driving away bees purely because of the smoke, not the citronella., Mothballs contain a powerful pesticide that can drive away or kill many insects, including bees. This option is more commonly used in attics and storage spaces, but some picnickers put mothballs in fine mesh bags or old nylon stockings, and hang them from trees.Mothballs can be dangerous to humans as well.Keep mothballs away from children, and avoid the strong-smelling fumes they produce.
 Bitter almond oil, or its pure active ingredient benzaldehyde, can be used to repel bees. Pour a little onto a rag, and keep it in a warm, breezy, outdoor area where it will evaporate quickly. Be aware that it may cause harm in large quantities, although some studies disagree.Keep the rag away from pets and children.


Some people add an equal amount of tea tree oil to the rag, which may also drive away bees.This has not been scientifically tested, but may work in some cases.
 Sometimes, attracting bees to alternate options may be an effective method of control, especially when you are using deterrent methods around your own food. Some people report success when laying out dishes of sugar water, maple syrup, or strips of banana peel on the opposite side of the lawn or field, so the bees feed from other areas instead.Keep these lures a significant distance away, or they may backfire.


If wasps are around as well, lay out both sugar and meat, as different types of wasps are attracted to these two substances.
Do not use this method at a campground, since animals such as bears or skunks may be attracted by the food as well.

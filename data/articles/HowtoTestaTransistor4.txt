If the display shows high resistance when each of the leads are touched, you have found the base (and you have a good NPN transistor).
If the display shows 2 different readings for the other 2 leads, clamp the black probe to another lead and repeat the test.
After clamping the black probe to each of the 3 leads, if you don't get the same high resistance reading when touching the other 2 leads with the red probe, you either have a bad transistor or a PNP transistor.

 Since bettas can live anywhere from five to seven years, if you want to maximize your betta's time living with you, you should try to find a somewhat small one. Beware, as baby betta fish have different needs and will die if you treat them as an adult. , Color is an indication of health for bettas. When examining a betta, look for a fish with bright, vibrant coloring.Most bettas are brightly colored, but may have some pale colors filling in gaps between stripes and spots. Certain breeds of betta, such as piebald and Cambodian bettas, are lighter in appearance, having a peach color.
Horizontal stripes can be an indicator of ill health. Avoid getting a betta if it has horizontal stripes.
 Fins should be free of discoloration, disease, or visible wounds. Clamped fins may be a sign a betta is ill or the water condition is poor. Black, raggedy fins can be a sign of fin rot., You want to choose a betta with healthy gills. Both gills should open and close without trouble. If a fish is gasping for air, and one or both set of gills is not opening and closing, this is a sign of ill health. Red marks around the gills can also be a sign of poor health., You should quickly scan a betta's body before purchasing it to make sure it's in good health. Make sure the betta does not have any obvious signs of illness. A healthy betta will be free of the following:Missing fins
Lumps or bumps
Red streaks on the gills
A sprinkled salt appearanceÂ 
White, fuzzy patches (do not confuse this with normal coloration patches some have)
A distended belly
Raised scales

, You want to make sure your betta has healthy eyes as well. Ideally, a betta should have clear white eyes. Milky eyes, bulgy eyes, or reddish circles around the eyes are all signs of poor health.

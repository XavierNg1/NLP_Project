 Use a pair of scissors to cut the loofah so that it can be opened up to line the inside of a caddy tier. If you plan on using multiple tiers, you may need more than one loofah.


The lining of loofah mesh will hold the orchid bark inside the caddy. This will prevent it from falling out of the caddy and spreading around your home.
You can use other materials in place of a loofah to line your caddy tiers. However, plants that receive most of their nutrients from the air, like orchids, need to be able to breathe. A mesh material is preferred., Cut another segment of mesh from your loofah. Take the orchid from its pot carefully and wrap it in the mesh. Wrap it gently but firmly. A firm wrapping will help the orchid stay in place., In most cases, you should be able to tuck the loofah enmeshed orchid into a corner of the caddy. It should be stable and upright. If not, insert a small pole in the caddy and use a piece of twine to attach the plant to the pole and stabilize it.
 At this stage, feel free to add more plants that receive most of their nutrition from the air to your caddy in the same fashion as your orchid. Some varieties you might try include mosses, bromeliads, rhipsalis, and more., You may need to use your hands to hold the loofah lining in place, but once you start filling it with bark, the bark should help stabilize the loofah material. If the plants or loofah material are loose, use wire or twine to attach them to the caddy.


In most cases, after some time passes, the plants will become established in the shower caddy garden and will need less support. When this happens, feel free to remove the ties/pole., Generally, plants like orchids do best in a well-lit place. Soap and shampoo can also be unhealthy for these sensitive plants, so be strategic in the placement of your caddy.


For the first few weeks, you should water your caddy every other day. After that, you should be able to decrease the frequency of watering to once or twice a week.

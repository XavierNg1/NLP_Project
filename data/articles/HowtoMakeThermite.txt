 Make sure there is nothing that can burn within four meter radius of the reaction. Check that metals with low melting points, such as lead, tin, cadmium, or zinc, aren't near your four meter radius.;
, In addition to being extremely hot, thermite emits UV radiation that can damage your eyes if not dealt with properly.
 As a precaution, fully clothe your body and make sure you're wearing thick gloves.
 The iron oxide and aluminum will react to form thermite, while the magnesium will serve as the ignition material.


You can find aluminum powder in a paint store, an Etch-a-Sketch, or you can buy it on the internet.
If you don't want to use magnesium strips to ignite the materials, you can also use a combination of potassium permanganate and glycerin, both of which can be obtained in retail stores and online.
 There will be a lot more iron oxide than aluminum.


For example, if you have 10 grams of iron oxide and 10 grams of aluminum, take 8 grams of iron oxide and 2.7 grams of aluminum powder and mix them together until fully incorporated.
 Note that if you ignite the thermite, it will melt through the cast iron.
, If you're using potassium permanganate and glycerin, put a fairly good size pile of potassium permanganate on the thermite, then drip glycerin onto the potassium permanganate. That is not very reliable so it's best to use a magnesium strip.

 To roast butternut squash, season the cubes with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Roast the squash cubes in an oven heated to 350 °F (177 °C). Remove the squash from the oven when the cubes are soft on the inside and brown and crunchy on the outside.


Add savory spices, like cumin, chili powder or cayenne pepper, to make a spicy side dish.
Add sweet elements, like brown sugar, maple syrup or agave nectar, to make a delectable treat.
 Butternut squash soup has a silky, creamy texture, perfect for warming up on a winter night. To make it, follow these steps:


Roast butternut squash cubes in the oven until they are soft.
In the meantime, sauté a diced onion and a few cloves of minced garlic in some olive oil in a large soup pot on over medium heat on the stove.
Add the butternut squash and a quart of chicken or vegetable stock.
Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce it to a simmer, and cook for 20 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper to taste, then blend it in batches in the blender.
Serve with a drizzle of cream and some black pepper.
 If you want to skip the peeling process, you can bake a squash whole and cut it when it's soft. Poke a squash all over with a fork and place it on a baking sheet in an oven heated to 350 °F (177 °C). Bake the squash for about an hour, until it's tender when you poke it with a fork. Remove it from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, and cut it into slices.

 Surgical correction involves your dog having a general anesthetic so that he can sleep through the procedure. Once the dog is asleep, the ear flap is clipped and prepared with a surgical scrub. An incision is made on the underside of the ear flap and all the blood is drained out of the pocket.Multiple stitches are then placed through the ear flap to hold the skin against the cartilage and encourage it to bond back down.
 Again, a buster collar is a large plastic cone that is placed on your dog’s head to keep him from biting or scratching at the stitches. Your dog will have to wear this collar until his stitches are removed.
 They will be removed by a vet or a vet tech. The removal process is a simple matter of snipping the stitch and pulling it out of the skin.


This process should not be painful and can generally be done in the pet clinic.
 You could also wash it twice a day if you prefer. Washing the wound with salt water helps to keep it clean and bacteria-free, as salt water is a mild disinfectant.


You can make a salt water solution by adding a teaspoon of salt to a pint of boiled water. Let it cool before you use it to wash your dog’s ear.
Soak a cotton pad in the salt water and then wipe the wound down.

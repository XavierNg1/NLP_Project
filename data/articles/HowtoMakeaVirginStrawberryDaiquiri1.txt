 You will need about a glassful of ice.;
, Strawberries come in different sizes, so how many strawberries you use will vary. This could be anywhere from 3 to 6 strawberries. A simple way to figure out how many strawberries you'll need is to simply cut and slice some strawberries and start filling up a measuring cup. Stop when you are just short of the Â½ cup/4 ounces/120 millimeters mark.


The best strawberries are fresh and ripe, but you can also use frozen ones as well.If you do use frozen strawberries, thaw them first., For a sweeter daiquiri, add some more sugar. Keep in mind that if the strawberries are already very ripe, you may not need much sugar.
 From time to time, open the blender, and push the mixture down the sides with a spatula. This will help things mix more evenly.
 Slice a strawberry partway, from the bottom almost to the top. Slide it over the rim of the glass.You can also use other garnishes as well, including mint leaves, paper cocktail umbrellas, or orange/lime slices.
For a fancier twist, add a swirl of whipped cream on top, and place a maraschino cherry on top.
 If you'd like, you can pop a straw into the daiquiri.

 While dogs and cats have lived with humans for thousands of years, capuchins are wild animals and not domestic pets. As a result, you should not hold them to the same standards as traditional pets, expecting them to be tame and quiet.If you want a quiet pet, a capuchin might not be the right choice.
While capuchins might seem docile, calm, and friendly as infants, they often become louder, unpredictable, and sometimes aggressive as adults.;
, The more you know about capuchins, the better you will be able to recognize what sort of behaviors or noises are normal and which ones might be an indication of a medical or emotional problem.Capuchins communicate with each other (or their human companions) using calls and vocalizations, which convey fear, excitement, happiness, and other emotions.
Learn about their behavior in the wild and in captivity so you will be better able to interpret and understand these vocalizations.
 In the wild, capuchins live in large, noisy groups of 10-35 primates.Since capuchins make noise in the wild, it is unreasonable and unfair to expect them to be quiet or silent in captivity.
When kept in captivity, they are often more content in pairs., If your capuchin’s needs aren’t being met, they might become very loud. Here are a few basic guidelines to keep in mind:Make sure they have large spaces to exercise, both indoors and outdoors.
Capuchins also need a lot of mental stimulation, so provide them with toys and puzzles that you change out regularly so they are not bored and acting out.
Ensure they have a varied and balanced diet. In addition to primate food, offer them fresh fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds, eggs, and insects.

 With a little planning and extra effort, you can make sure your gun won't explode when you try to fire it.
 Stand behind a stone wall or large tree and fashion a simple rope-pull to activate the gun from safety. Mount pistol solidly to a table, bracing it in a boot or between two heavy books, or some other rigid support, at least ten feet in front of the barrier.
 Just tie a string, elastic band, or some other cord to the metal bracket to pull back and release.
 If pistol does not fire, shorten the elastic bands or increase their number. Fire at least five rounds from behind the barrier and then reinspect the pistol before you attempt to hand fire it.


There's the serious potential of injury in the making of homemade weapons. Take this seriously and use extreme caution.

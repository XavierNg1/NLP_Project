 If someone continues to violate the boundaries that you have asked them to respect, it’s important to stand up for yourself. Of course, it’s important to remain respectful, in the interest of keeping the peace as much as possible.For instance, feel free to say things like, “I’m always happy to see you David, but we need some time to ourselves tonight. I’ll let you know the next time we’re having guests over.”

, Sometimes, establishing and trying to maintain boundaries can lead to conflict between your values and those of one of your family members. Further, you may both become invested in arguing about your perspective, in part because you want an issue to be resolved. However, sometimes it is simply best to walk away and let tempers cool down.This is especially important when a family member is hard to talk to about things like healthy boundaries. It may take several conversations to get through to them.
Remind yourself that other people’s anger is not a reason to compromise on your values. You may even want to say something like, “I understand that you’re upset, but I’ve been very clear about how I feel about this and I’m not going to change my mind simply because you’re angry. Let’s talk about it again when we’re all a bit more calm.
 If a boundary that you are serious about maintaining continues to be violated, you may need to spend less time around the violating party for a while.For instance, if you’ve spoken to someone about drinking less around your kids but they continue to over-serve themselves, you may need to ask them not to visit your home, and/or avoid visiting theirs.
Though this may feel cruel, it’s more than fair to give someone the time and space to decide whether they are willing to adjust their behavior to respect a fair boundary that you request.

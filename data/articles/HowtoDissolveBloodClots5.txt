 Studies suggest that regular aerobic exercise can prevent and reverse blood clot formation by increasing blood flow. Try walking, cycling, rowing, running, swimming, or jumping rope – whatever gets you moving – for forty-five minutes every day.
 Dehydration thickens your blood and damages your blood vessels. Be sure to drink plenty of water, as staying hydrated can prevent clots from forming.
 Nattokinase is an enzyme that breaks down fibrin, which may prevent clots from forming and dissolve those that have begun to form. Nattokinase is found in natto (a fermented Japanese food made from soybeans), fermented black beans, fermented shrimp paste, and tempeh.
 Rutin targets protein disulfide isomerase, an enzyme involved in blood clotting. It is found in apples, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, limes, buckwheat, onion, and tea. Have one of these fruits as dessert after each meal, or incorporate them into the meals themselves.
 Bromelain enables your body to produce plasmin, which helps to clear away the fibrin that holds blood clots together. Bromelain is found only in pineapples. If you are at an increased risk for blood clots, considering including pineapples in your dessert after as many meals as possible.
 Garlic inhibits the production of thomboxane, which is involved in blood clots. It also contains ajoene and adenosine, which helps prevent and dissolve blood clots.


Onions also include adenosine, so you should incorporate them into your diet as well.
 Too much protein (especially red meat and dairy products) seems to stimulate blood clot formation. Try to eat plenty of fish instead. The omega 3 fatty acids will reduce your cholesterol, thin your blood, and reduce clotting.


For best results, focus on salmon, tuna, herring, mackerel, and sardines.

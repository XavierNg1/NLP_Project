 Primer is used to cover porous surfaces, to provide a barrier between the surface and the remaining coats, so that the paint is not soaked up by the surface. Typical porous surfaces it is used on include: new plaster, bare wood, unpainted metal, etc.;
, Undercoat is used over the primer. It's the coat to add before you add the main color. Depending on the brand purchased, it may be specially tinted or have certain protective properties you need for the surface or area being painted. Most paints require undercoat even if primer has not been needed. Some types of paint may claim that there is no need for an undercoat but generally it ensures a smoother finish if used.
 There are different types of paint that you can apply and each one will provide a specific kind of finish:


Water based paint: This paint tends to be used for walls and paints a flat surface. It can also be used for other painting work, as indicated by the container instructions. The great thing about this paint is the ease of clean-up - simply wash out with water. This paint is often low VOC (volatile organic compounds) these days, making it easy on your respiratory system.






Stain or semi-gloss paint: This provides a sheen finish. It is best used to highlight specific features or rooms. It's also suitable for high traffic areas. It can be either water-based or oil-based. If oil-based, you'll need to take greater effort cleaning up afterward.






Gloss: Gloss paint is hard-wearing and is usually used for wooden areas such as skirting boards and window surrounds. This one is usually oil-based and requires mineral turpentine to wash the brushes.






Non-drip. This is an alternative to gloss. It has a gel-like consistency and it won't drip when using, making it a great choice for painters who find this aspect of painting troublesome.

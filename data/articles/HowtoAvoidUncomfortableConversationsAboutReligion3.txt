 If you can't escape the conversation, and the person won't let the topic go, be upfront about not wanting to talk. Politely but firmly remind them that religion is a personal and sensitive topic, and it may not be appropriate to discuss it in all situations. Suggest that for the sake of others around you, it's best not to debate religion right now., If the person is not being combative but wants to talk about religion, tell them another time and place would be better. If you are genuinely interested in talking to them about religion, you can actually set up another time to talk. If you just want them off your back, keep it non-specific.Something like “Why don't we talk about this at the next company picnic?” should do the trick.
 With reasonable people, this old standby actually works. If someone brings up religion in an awkward situation, tell them you likely don't agree on spiritual matters and should probably talk about something else.

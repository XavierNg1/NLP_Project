 You will need 2 shots (44 to 88 milliliters) of espresso. If you can't get any, try 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 milliliters) strongly-brewed coffee instead., Let it come down to room temperature first, then pop it into the fridge or freezer. Leave it there until it gets cold, then take it out and pour it into a blender.
 Whole milk is the standard, but you can also use 2% or nonfat milk. If dairy isn't your thing, you can use soy milk instead., You will need 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup. You can also leave it out for a coffee frappuccino. If you do this, however, consider adding in a little more sugar.

For a caramel frappuccino, use 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of caramel sauce and 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of caramel syrup., Plan on using 1 cup (140 grams) of ice. If you want a thicker beverage, try 2 cups (280 grams). You can also add a pinch of xanthan gum instead., This will only take about 30 seconds or so. From time to time, you may have to pause the blender push any unmixed frappuccino down with a rubber spatula.
 Pour the frappuccino into a tall glass. Add some whipped cream on top, if desired, then pour a little bit of your flavoring sauce on top. If you used chocolate sauce to make a mocha frappe, consider adding some chocolate curls or shavings as well.


You can skip the whipped cream and/or sauce if you want a simpler drink.

 You should be on your stomach, your palms flat on the ground and underneath your shoulders. Keep your spine straight, and lower your head until your neck is aligned with your spine., Press through your hands as you push yourself up. Your upper body should slowly start curving upwards, from your head all the way down to your hips. Keep your body still from the waist down. Inhale the entire time you’re pushing up. Pull your shoulder blades together when you reach the top position, opening your chest further.


You’ll notice you need to strain slightly to take in a full breath. This opens up the chest and deepens your lung capacity., Slowly bring your upper body back down towards the ground, allowing yourself to rest gently on the ground. You should be following the same curve as the previous step. Your chest should touch the ground first, followed by your shoulders, neck, chin and head., You can take a couple of seconds between each repetition to reset properly. You shouldn’t be hurrying as you perform this exercise; the goal is to slowly learn how to control your breathing and expand your lung capacity.

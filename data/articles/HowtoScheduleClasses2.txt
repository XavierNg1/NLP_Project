 The classes you take will not be heavily scrutinized by others. Take classes you know you'll enjoy. In addition, do not choose difficult classes for you.;
, If you are even considering going to college, it is a good idea to take at least one challenging class. Now is the time to make mistakes, and if you get in over your head, dropping the class won't be as big of a deal. Do the best you can and don't worry so much about your grade in the class. Later, when you're deciding what to take in high school, you'll appreciate knowing what to expect in an honors or AP class.
 Do as much as you can in Middle School. You may not have as much time later, and if you have to cut back on extracurriculars, you'll know what you really enjoy, and what you don't mind dropping.
 Though it may be hard to think ahead, some classes require you to take a class before you can take it. For example, if you want to do your school newspaper, you might have to take journalism, photography, or maybe even a business class. Thinking about that now will save you a lot of stress later.

,,, Speed is everything.
,, Movement, speed and confusion are the key. Run around, prone and jump all the time. If you stop for a second or more, you will get killed because, usually, there are other people that watch the fight from distance but don't shoot because they are not sure if they can get you in one or two shots. Once you stop, you WILL get killed. By the way, going prone is not laying around for a minute... You have to prone and get up the same instant.

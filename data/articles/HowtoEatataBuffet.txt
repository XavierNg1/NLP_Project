 This will allow you to plan your meal and make the best choices.;
, Do you want to do it section by section - or course by course? Is there one section that interests you more than others - where maybe you want to concentrate most of your eating? Think about what you want to eat - don't just go up and grab food blindly.
 Talk to yourself (not out loud!) about what would be the healthy choices or convince yourself that some really bad choice doesn't look all that good. It may not work but the guilt may help you follow the next steps.
 When you go up to get food, take only a teaspoon or tablespoon-sized portion of each choice. Your goal is to taste everything you want - just not in huge portions. With buffets, the desire to taste everything combined with taking "regular-sized" portions is what will do you in.
 As you taste, decide if the item really merits getting more. For example, let's say the macaroni and cheese looked great - and tastes terrible! You won't be going back for that. On the other hand, the General TSO chicken is delicious and worth getting another taste.
 Too many people were brought up to feel bad about "wasting food" because of all the starving children in some country. Because you took mini-portions, you aren't wasting that much food.
 Be as tough as a food critic on this. Don't waste your time on mediocre food items - your health is more important than that.
 People will sometimes be really good on the appetizers and entr√©e items then go completely nuts when they see mounds of desserts.

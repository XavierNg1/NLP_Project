 Meditation will help you focus and harness your subconscious mind. Before meditating, determine the length of your session. If you are a beginner, try to meditate for 5 minutes. Change into comfortable clothes. Grab a timer and proceed to a quiet, peaceful environment. Choose a location without clutter or distractions. Sit outside, on the floor your apartment, or on your back porch. Stretch before assuming a comfortable seated position. Touch your toes, release the tension from your neck, and relax your shoulders., Find a stable seat. Sit in a straight backed chair with your feet planted firmly on the ground or cross-legged on top of a pillow on the floor. Straighten your back—your spine’s natural curve should be present. Position your upper arms parallel to the sides of your body. Your elbows will have a slight bend and your hands will naturally fall gently atop your knees. Lower your chin slightly and gaze at the floor. Settle into the position, become aware of your body, before you proceed., Close your eyes and begin to follow your breath. Focus on your inhale and your exhale. As you relax, your mind will wander. Thoughts will flow from your subconscious mind to your conscious mind. Note these thoughts, but don’t judge them. Allow these thoughts to pass. When you realize your mind has wandered, return your attention to your breathing. In time, your mind will wander again. Always continue to come back to your breath. Repeat this process until your session is complete.

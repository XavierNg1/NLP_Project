 It is said that the Goth subculture was born in the 80s; regardless, early Goth style was inseparable from Goth music. As such, a Traditional Goth will venerate the earliest Goth bands: Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Birthday Party, The Sisters of Mercy, and anything played in the infamous Bat-Cave club. Other influential bands (e.g. The Velvet Underground) may also be revered as minor deities.;
, Traditional Goth fashion recreates the looks of the earliest Goths. In the beginning, Goth was heavily influenced by Punk: it includes fishnets, leather jackets, piercings, heavy makeup, and the occasional bondage gear. It also gained Punk's wide usage of the color black (and it usually has other dark colours, such as purple).
 Since Traditional Goth attempts to faithfully follow the early days of Goth, you should do research to make sure you're doing it justice.

 Go to the craft store keeping in mind the kind of sewing projects that your friend likes to do and the colors that he or she uses. Choose some of the following items to place in the sewing kit:

10 or more unique matching buttons.
Paper flowers or crocheted flowers.
Spools of attractive ribbons. Spools of colorful thread. Striped twine.
Creative masking tape or stickers.
Grid paper that can be cut into circles or shapes.
Needles, a small pincushion and pins.
 Then consider the rest of the sewing kit and decide how to attractively fit all of the contents in the jar. Place the needles and pins near the bottom so that they do not hurt anyone during transportation., If it does not fit, you can simply use the pincushion as the lid. If not, place a piece of fabric over the top and tie it on with striped twine., Your crafty friend will appreciate that these sometimes expensive items can now be part of her craft stash.

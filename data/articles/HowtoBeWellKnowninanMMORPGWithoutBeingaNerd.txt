 Most MMORPG games are pay-to-play, meaning you have to pay a monthly fee, while some are free and cost nothing. Usually the free versions are limited, meaning you can't use all the features. So find a game you want to get into, and read on. However, if you want to try to be the best player in the game, sign up to be a beta tester, because when the game first comes out, you'll be the first to play. This means you'll be able to play longer than anyone else (besides the others that signed up for it of course). When you choose a game, try it out. You never know if you'll like it or not.;
,, As long as you do something in the game you'll still be able to keep up - unless your friend never comes off of course.
 Once people have grabbed the top spots it is usually very difficult to steal them back. If by chance you manage to get highly ranked, don't let it go to your head. Set a good example and help educate the new players out there. Don't go around calling people "noobs" - it is that sort of behaviour that gets you a bad reputation.
 If you can't be the top ten players, at least you can get a lot of friends. They can be more satisfying than the highest ranks a game can offer.
 That is the reason people play games and it should stay that way. Don't start playing just to raise your levels or you will not get as much out of the game as you should.

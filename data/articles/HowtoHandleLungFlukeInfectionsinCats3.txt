 The most common symptoms of a lung fluke infection include coughing and difficulty breathing. The cough will likely come from deep in the cat's chest and bloody mucus may be coughed up as well.While many cats with this infection experience coughing and difficulty breathing, your cat may have no symptoms at all if the infection is mild.
 If the lung fluke infection becomes severe, your cat may develop pneumonia, pneumothorax, or bronchiectasis. These infections cause severe breathing difficulty that requires immediate veterinary care. If your cat seems as if it cannot breath, you need to get it to a veterinarian immediately.Pneumothorax is a condition in which the lungs collapse, due to air collecting in the chest cavity outside the lungs.
Bronchiectasis consists of damage to the bronchioles of the lungs, which leads to a thickening, widening, and scarring of the lungs.
 If the lung fluke infection becomes very advanced, your cat may have a very low energy level and go into a depression. If your cat has no energy, is not interested in its normal routine, and is having difficulty breathing, then it may have a lung fluke infection.Lethargy and depression can be symptoms of a variety of health problems. These symptoms alone do not indicate that your cat has a lung fluke infection but it does signal a medical problem that should be assess by a veterinarian.

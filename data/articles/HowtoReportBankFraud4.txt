 The FTC maintains a website where you can file complaints about individuals or businesses that engage in fraudulent activity.


Although regulatory agencies such as the FTC don't investigate or resolve individual complaints, they compile your information into databases that are used by federal, state, and local law enforcement to uncover patterns of criminal activity., Before you submit your complaint, you must first place it in one of the FTC's categories.


If you're unsure about where to place your complaint, you can use the sub-categories to better understand the types of complaints within each category. There is an "other" category if the suspected fraud you've encountered doesn't fit into one of the FTC's categories, or isn't accurately described by any of the sub-categories., The FTC complaint form includes space for you to enter details about yourself, the individual or company that perpetrated the fraud, and details about the incident.You don't have to provide personal or contact information for yourself. However, if you choose to remain anonymous, the FTC or other regulatory or law enforcement agencies will be unable to contact you if your complaint becomes the focus of further investigation.As part of the complaint process, you have the opportunity to describe the fraudulent incident in your own words. As you do so, avoid including any personal details or sensitive information such as your bank account or Social Security number in the description itself., The FTC gives you the opportunity to look over all the information you included before you submit it and make any changes.


Once you're satisfied that the information you entered is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge, you should print a copy of your complaint for your records., Your complaint will be added to a nationwide database available to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies that investigate and prosecute fraud.

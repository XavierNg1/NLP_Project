 They love the tasty little hoppers, and have prodigious appetites. They eat loads of grasshoppers and will save your garden from destruction. Many cities and towns allow keeping these birds with permits.


Not only do you get pest control, you get fresh eggs, and an occasional pot pie!;
, Hot pepper wax insect repellent is the key. It's in all the garden catalogs, and soon it could be on all your plants. Insects can't stand the taste, and therefore do not eat the leaves!

, Head to the grasshopper hangouts at dusk or dawn, and move more slowly as the air cools down. Knock them off the leaves into a bucket of soapy water where they'll drown, or just knock them on the ground and step on them.

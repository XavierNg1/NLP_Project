 The suggested supplies that could go in a pouch are as follows:

Beauty supplies: This includes lip balm, lotion, deodorant, sunscreen, concealer, mascara, etc.
The basics. Tissues, lens cleaner (if you wear contacts or glasses), your phone, sunglasses, your wallet and a pen are necessary.
Medications you might need, such as aspirin, painkillers, etc.
Teeth care: Be ready for a dental emergency! Dig out your travel toothbrushes, floss and a travel-size toothpaste bottle.
Put together a small sewing kit. Pack pins, needles, thread, extra buttons and snaps and a tiny pair of scissors.

 When what you need is a quick chocolate fix, this cake will hit the spot. All you need is 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) cocoa powder, 4 tablespoons sugar, 4 tablespoons flour, 3 tablespoons milk, and an egg.


For a fudgy, gooey, extra-chocolatey version of this cake, skip the milk and add just one tablespoon of flour, or leave it out entirely. It will come out with a richer consistency.






If you love the flavor of Nutella, add 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) to the mix.






You could also add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter if you're so inclined.






Espresso or brewed coffee add depth of flavor - throw in a teaspoon or two.
Add a few shakes of cinnamon and cayenne pepper for a spicy variation.;
, Any microwave-safe mug will do; just make sure the batter doesn't rise higher than 2/3 way to the rim. Grease the mug with butter or oil, then use a spoon to mix the batter thoroughly until all lumps are removed and the ingredients are completely incorporated.


If you don't have a microwave-safe mug, you can use a bowl or another dish.
If you're planning to serve the cake to someone else instead of eating it straight from the dish, consider using a dish with a more cake-like shape, such as a ramekin.
 Start by microwaving for 1 1/2 minutes. Check to make sure the mug isn't overflowing with batter; if it is, wipe it off and let it rest for a second. Then close the door and microwave for another 1 1/2 minutes before removing the mug from the microwave.
 If you wish, add some toppings like icing, whipped cream, or strawberries before enjoying your cake.

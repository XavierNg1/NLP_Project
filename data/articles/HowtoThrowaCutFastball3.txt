 You don't want to telegraph your pitch until the exact moment you release the baseball. Tipping the hitter off early could ruin the surprise of the pitch.
 The cutter is a fastball, after all. You want a simple up-and-down motion with your hand, not delivering any spin with your wrist.


Make sure your arm-speed is similar to your fastball arm-speed.
Extend your arm fully as you deliver the pitch.
 This will cause the ball to move away from a right handed batter and in on a left handed batter.

 One way to help your senior dog who has developed a noise phobia is to remove the source of the noise. Senior dogs react negatively to stressors, so being exposed to the noises that upset them can upset them even further.If the noise is something you can remove or eliminate from the house, you should get rid of it.;
, You can try to help your dog reduce their noise anxiety by drowning it out with another noise. This new noise should be something that does not upset your dog or cause more anxiety. Make sure it is loud enough to mask the other noise, but not so loud that it will hurt your dog’s ears.You may want to try putting on the television or playing music for your dog.
 One way to handle the older dog’s noise sensitivity is to place the dog into a small, quiet room. The room should be away from the source of the noise. An interior room with no windows or a room in the back of the house is a good choice.You can try blocking light from the room. Set up a comfy bed for your dog to lay down so they can feel safe and relaxed.
 Another way you can help your dog deal with their noise anxiety is to place them in their crate. If your dog feels safe and comfortable in their crate, it may help ease the anxiety. Try placing a heavy blanket over the crate to help block out the sound.Place soft blankets in the crate to help block and absorb some of the sounds.
Consider placing the crate into a quiet room away from the noise.
Make sure your dog doesn’t get too hot with the blanket over the crate.
Be sure not to keep your dog in the crate if he is still distressed by the noise and is trying to get out.
 Never try to cure your dog of noise phobia by "flooding" him with the sound. This only causes distress and makes the problem worse. However, in the long term, you can use gradual staged exposure to the noise at a low volume. As your dog becomes used to it, turning up the volume can be a useful way to desensitize your pet.

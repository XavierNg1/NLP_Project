 If you're questioning the meaning or purpose of your existence, or if the foundations of your life seem shaky and transient, you might be experiencing a crisis (usually called "existential" because it relates to ideas explored by the philosophical school of existentialism), which may result from:


The sense of being alone and isolated in the world
A new-found grasp or appreciation of one's mortality
Believing that one's life has no purpose or external meaning
Awareness of one's freedom and the consequences of accepting or rejecting that freedom
An extremely pleasurable or hurtful experience that leaves one seeking meaning., Existentialism posits that each individual is empowered to choose the parameters of his or her existence. Choosing to add meaning to your life yourself, without the help of anyone else, can ultimately help you resolve an existential crisis. Below are some methods that can help.

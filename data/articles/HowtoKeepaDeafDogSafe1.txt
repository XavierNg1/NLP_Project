 A collar and tag can help you get your dog back if it accidentally gets loose. The tag should have the dog's name and your contact info on it, but it should also state that the dog is deaf.Stating that the dog is deaf on the collar tag will allow anyone that finds your dog to better understand your dog and the situation. Having your dog microchipped with your contact information is a smart idea.;
, Your dog should only be allowed off leash in a completely enclosed area. Unlike with a well-trained hearing dog, even with a well-trained deaf dog it can be hard to get it to come back if it gets loose. This is simply because it cannot hear auditory commands.Even in an enclosed yard consider putting a bell on your dog. Putting a bell on your dog will allow you to keep tabs on it in the event that it gets loose. Using an invisible fence system with a vibrating collar is a humane and sensitive way to help your dog understand the boundaries of the yard.
 In general, it's not a good idea to let a deaf dog off leash in an unenclosed area. Even if the dog is well trained, it will not be able to hear you if you call for it. In addition, it will not be able to hear possible hazards, such as cars, coming towards it.There are some owners of deaf dogs that do let their dogs off leash eventually, once the dogs are highly trained and behave reliably. If you feel comfortable doing this, it is advisable to keep the dog within your eyesight at all times.

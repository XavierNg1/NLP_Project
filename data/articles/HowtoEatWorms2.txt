 Get out a metal baking sheet, ungreased. You'll need roughly 1 cup of worms., Give them a rinse in cold water while the shallow saucepan heats up. Then dump the worms in for a quick boil, killing bacteria and partially cooking your bugs.
 You should have put the worms in boiling water, poured off the water three times by now. This will remove impurities that cause the worms to taste terrible.
 About halfway through, use some tongs or a spatula to flip the worms so that both sides cook.
 Use a little butter and olive oil and cook the veggies until they are starting to brown on the edges, roughly 8-9 minutes.


Throw in a dash of salt as soon as you add the veggies to the pan.
Add some finely chopped garlic for the last few minutes if you like it.
 Don't let them cool completely, just so they're cold enough to handle.
 You'll likely need to add another 1-2 tablespoons of butter so that nothing sticks to the pan. Add another dash of salt.
 This will make everything tender and tasty. If you want a creamier chow, add in a cup or yogurt or sour cream for a thicker, richer dish.
 This soupy dish won't even taste like worms when you're done! Simple and easy, you can easily customize this as well.


Add hot peppers and fresh ginger with the onions and mushrooms for an Asian-inspired dish.
Substitute some fresh tomato sauces for half of the stock for a richer "sauce."
Mix in chopped carrots, celery, root vegetables, or peppers for added vegetables. There really is no limit.
Add your favorite spices while the stock cooks to liven up and personalize the flavor.

 Find the correct combination for your multiple-dial combination lock on the lock's packaging, or on a sticker behind the lock.


Remember to remove the combination sticker from the lock before you use it.
If you have trouble memorizing things, remember to write the code down on a piece of paper somewhere.
 The first number in the code represents the number that your leftmost dial must be on to open the lock. Rotate the dials until the indicator on the side of the lock lines up with the first digit of the code.


Sometimes the indicator for the numbers will be a red line or arrow., Continue to rotate the rest of the dials from left to right until all of the dials are aligned with the indicator on the side and correspond with the correct code., Once correctly input all the numbers, you can pull on the body of the lock to disengage the shackle. When you put the lock back on, make sure to rotate each dial a couple of times to reset the lock.

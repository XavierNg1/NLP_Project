 Whisk together the cider vinegar, water, sugar, Dijon mustard, olive oil, basil, pepper, and salt in a large bowl until evenly blended.


Continue whisking until the sugar is completely dissolved. This could take a few minutes.
Note that this produces a fairly liquidy dressing.
 Use a clean spoon to taste test the dressing. Adjust the salt, basil, pepper, and salt as needed to match you own tastes.


Since the consistency is so runny already, altering the amounts used for each ingredient will not have a dramatic effect on the texture of the dressing.
 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until just before you are ready to serve or otherwise mix it.


Fold your coleslaw mix into the dressing, thoroughly coating all the vegetables with dressing.

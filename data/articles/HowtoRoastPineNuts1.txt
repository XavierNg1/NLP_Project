 Pour nuts into a colander and sort them, removing any discolored ones.;
,, When the oven has preheated, place the baking sheet on a top oven rack and cook the nuts for 15 minutes.
 Do not transfer the nuts to a bowl while cooling, as this will cause moisture to build up on the bottom nuts and only the top nuts will cool off properly.

 Slang is constantly evolving, and it is tough to find a definitive source of knowledge to determine what words are "in" and what are "out." Short of going to Australia, you best bet to pick up slang is to watch Australian media. That said, there are some words that have been around long enough, and are popular enough, that you could reasonably use them in front of an Australian and avoid weird stares.



Esky → Cooler or icebox.

Uni → University.

Arvo → Afternoon.

Thongs → Flip-flops.

Bogan → Redneck, uncultured person. Use with care-- it may be offensive.

Root → Sex. Remember this when "rooting for the other team" at a sporting event.Chunder → Throw up or get sick.

Stoked → Excited.

Tucker → Food., American slang is filled with simple filler words and phrase like "gosh," "guys," "say what?" etc. Australian is no different. Some things to try out include:


Ending phrases with the word "mate." Mate can be used anytime you would normally say "guys," "man (as in, "come on, mate!"), or similarly simple slang terms for a person.
Using "Reckon" when you're thinking of something. "I reckon that's not a bad idea, mate."
Throwing in the phrase "she'll be 'right," to ease concerns. "I hope I didn't burn dinner... Ah, she'll be right, mate.", This is perhaps best learned through an example, such as "This Wikihow article is great as." Unlike in English, where you would complete the comparison ("great as good cake"), Aussies leave the rest up to imagination. You can use this with any adjective.


"That movie was sweet as, mate!" Sweet as, in particular, is a common expression similar to a young American's "That was totally sweet!"
"That guy is lazy as, mate.", There are a lot of Australian slang words that are simply shortened and made to rhyme with "see." This is where the phrase "barbie" (for barbeque) comes from. Some other options include:


Present → Pressie
Breakfast → Brekkie
Mosquito → Mozzie
Sunglasses → Sunnies.

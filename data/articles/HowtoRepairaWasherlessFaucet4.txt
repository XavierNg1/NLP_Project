 You may need to tilt the handle back or remove a decorative cap to reveal the screw. Unscrew the handle, remove it, then remove the escutcheon cap underneath.


Some faucets have a locking nut you'll have to remove as well.
 You should see a cylinder with a protruding stem. Loosen the two screws fastening this in place, and lift the whole assembly out. Note the position of the cylinder, as the base has inlet holes which must match the holes underneath it.


If the cylinder does not lift easily, try cleaning its edges with a few drops of distilled white vinegar. If that still doesn't work, you can get a special extraction tool for this purpose from a plumbing store., Two-handled ceramic disk faucets usually have a simple O-ring around the cylinder, plus a seal and spring underneath. One-handled ceramic disk faucets usually have three seals underneath the cylinder.Corroded O-rings can be replaced with a new O-ring after greasing it with nontoxic, heatproof plumber's grease. The seals can be more of a pain to work with, but you can install them in much the same way if they are damaged.


Take the old seals to a hardware store to ask for replacement.s

, The cylinder and the disk inside it are sturdy and rarely need replacement. However, replacements are usually cheap, and just need to be screwed in.If you can't find the source of the problem, or just don't want to deal with the tiny seals, order a replacement with the exact same dimensions and shape.
 If there is mineral buildup on the cylinder, clean the openings with distilled white vinegar and a plastic scouring pad.Rinse thoroughly.
 Insert each component in the reverse order you disassembled them. Make sure all connections are tight.
 A rapid increase in water pressure could fracture the disk inside the cylinder. Move the faucet to the "on" position, then turn on the water valve gradually.

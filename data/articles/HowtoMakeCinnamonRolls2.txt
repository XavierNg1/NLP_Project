 Measure 2 3/4 cups of flour from the final sifting.
 Make a "well" or indented spot for the yeast on top of all the other ingredients. Place the bread pan into the bread machine.
Select dough setting.
Press start/stop
When the time reaches 0:00, press start/stop and remove the dough.

Combine water, yeast, milk, and egg together in a bowl until well blended.
Add egg mixture to dry ingredients.
Add butter.
Add any extra ingredients (see "Tips").
Stir until mixture is smooth and slightly sticky.
 The remaining steps apply for both methods.


Place dough into a clean bowl and knead it, using oiled or floured hands to move the dough around several times.
Cover the dough and let it sit in a warm or room temperature spot for at least 30 minutes. The dough should double in size before shaping. A clean tea towel makes a good cover.
 Lightly grease baking pans while waiting.
, Punch the dough down with clean hands. Place down on surface and pound down or roll out until you get the shape of an even rectangle.
 Brush on or apply with another tool. Make sure it's evenly applied and use all of the butter. Apply cinnamon evenly coated and then add the sugar on top.
 You should have a long cylinder.


Cut the dough up into pieces. You may get about 6 to 8 pieces, using the ends as well. Place in the lightly greased baking pan(s).
Cover and let rise about 20 minutes, and preheat the oven about 10 minutes prior to adding the rolls.
, For every 1 cup of sugar, add 1 tablespoon and a 1/2; for 2 cups you need 3 tablespoons of milk. If you need more milk to make it soupier, feel free to add more, but only add a little bit in at a time. Blend until smooth.


Spread or drizzle the glaze over the rolls after you take them out of the oven. Enjoy!

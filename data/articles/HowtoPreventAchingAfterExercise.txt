Walk on the treadmill slowly for 5 to 10 minutes to get your heart rate up enough to stretch your muscles.;

Try walking briskly for 10 minutes on a treadmill after you've finished you regular routine. A cool-down exercise will loosen the muscles you've tightened throughout your exercise and lower your blood pressure.



Focus on your major muscle groups when stretching prior to exercising. Stretching should be a slow process; don't rush through it. When you get to the gym or before you start your main exercise, your muscles are not ready to go full force. Stretching readies your muscles. It also can prevent muscle strains or pulls.
Take the time to stretch again after your cool-down session post-workout.



Make an exercise blueprint that is in keeping with how in shape you are at the start. Beginning an intense workout regimen when you've been leading a sedentary lifestyle prior is not the best idea. You will experience more muscle soreness and achiness than you should and it could prevent you from continuing your plan. Create a program for yourself that increases in intensity over time.



Weight training without knowing what to do is a recipe for muscle disaster. You could pull a muscle if you don't know the proper techniques.



Muscle pain is common when lifting weights or doing other eccentric exercises, but if the pain is especially severe and feels "wrong," do not continue.



Heavy-impact exercise such as running on a treadmill will cause extra muscle soreness the following day if you didn't wear the proper footwear.



Vary the muscle groups you use throughout your workout. Switch from one exercise to a completely distinct one immediately afterward. Perform both aerobic exercise and weight training during your workout.



Dehydration can weaken your muscles and entire body.

 For example, if the original price of a computer was $200, type “200” in cell A1.
 For example, if you ultimately paid $150 for the computer, type “150” in cell B1.
 When you do this, Excel automatically calculates the difference between the two prices and displays the numerical value in the cell.


For this example, the numerical value in cell C1 should be 50 if you enter the formula correctly.
 When you do this, Excel divides the price difference by the original price.


For this example, the numerical value is cell D1 should be 0.25 if you enter the formula correctly.
 When you do this, Excel converts the decimal into a percentage. In this example, the value in cell E1 should be 25%. This means that you saved 25 percent on the purchase of the computer.
 Because you entered formulas into the other cells, Excel will automatically update the cost savings percentage when you change the original price or the final price, or both.


For example, say you also purchased a lamp for $10 that originally cost $17. If you type “17” into cell A1 and “10” into B1 -- and leave all the other cells as they are – the corresponding savings of 41 percent will display in cell E1.

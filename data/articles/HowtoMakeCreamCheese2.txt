 Add the milk and the cream to a large, nonreactive pot and warm over a low heat until the temperature reaches 70°F (~21°C).


Do not allow the milk and cream to boil.
Use an instant read thermometer to get an exact temperature read.
 Add the buttermilk to the milk and cream mixture and stir to combine. Then add the veal rennet.
 Cover the pot with a lid and leave the cream cheese mixture overnight, at room temperature. The next day, the mixture will have set.
 Sprinkle the salt all over the surface of the set mixture.
 Using a large wire whisk, cut the gelled cream cheese mixture into small curds.
 Line a large colander with a butter muslin cloth. Place the colander in a bowl large enough to hold the whey. Gently pour the cream cheese mixture into the colander and let it drain for about 30 minutes.
 Gather the corners of the muslin cloth and tie them together with a rubber band to form a bag. Empty out the whey that has collected in the bowl.
 Place the cloth bag containing the cheese back in the colander, and put the colander back in the bowl. Put the whole thing in the refrigerator and let the curds continue to drain overnight.
 Use immediately or store in a plastic container in the fridge for up to two weeks.

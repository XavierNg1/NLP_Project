 Look closely at the metal backsplash. The metal particles may appear to move in a certain direction, such as side to side. If your backsplash has a noticeable grain, always scrub in the direction of it. This will prevent the metal from taking on tiny scratches., Use a microfiber cloth or non-abrasive sponge. Metal brushes and scrub pads will scratch your backsplash, so avoid them. Warm water cleaning, when done routinely, limits the need for deeper cleaning. Never use hot water on the backsplash.A mild detergent, such as a dish soap like Dawn or a non-chloride cleanser, can also be used for extra cleaning strength. Add a drop or two of the detergent to the water., Use the microfiber cloth to clean the backsplash. Work in circular motions along the grain. Most of the time, the day’s stains will come right off. Older stains are likely to require deeper cleaning.Never use scrub pads or wire brushes on the backsplash. These will scratch it.
 Get a dry cloth and use it to absorb the water on the metal. Although metal backsplashes are resistant to damage, hard water can weaken them. It’s better to dry the metal by hand so water doesn’t sit on it.

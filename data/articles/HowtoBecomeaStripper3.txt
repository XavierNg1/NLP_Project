 Make sure to wear your heels while you're practicing -- the same routine done barefoot will feel completely foreign when done in heels for the first time. Dancing and stripping simultaneously in high heels will be the most challenging part of your routine. Having a mirror or a video recorder will help you see what you look like and what areas you need to improve upon (or nix entirely).


If you have an upcoming audition, consider calming your nerves and dancing at an amateur night at a different strip club. Practicing alone in your room or in front of your boyfriend will not offer you the same experience as legitimately dancing for strangers. Getting a night in beforehand can seriously take the edge off your anxiety.
 Usually, you'll be looking at a three-song set up of fast, medium, and slow tempo music. Find a song that fits each category (that you like and know well!) and develop a basic routine. You can deviate from each one a bit, but having the basics down will help keep you confident.


Try not to do anything that's too repetitive; you might come off as a one-trick pony if you repeat the same move too often. Each tempo should set you up with a different vibe and thus each song should be orchestrated differently in your movements.
 If you haven't practiced them beforehand, most likely what you try to do will not be sexy. You will learn them in time, so relax -- you don't need them for your audition.


The best way to learn how to pole dance is to watch videos online. Then, copy the easier moves. Another alternative is to take pole dancing classes. Of course, wikiHow sheds some light on the topic, too.

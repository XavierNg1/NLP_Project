 They should be specific and attainable.


Determine whether you want to attract additional customers, keep your current customers happy or attain more visibility for the product or service your business provides.
 For example, if your goal is to attract more customers, expect orders from ten new customers in 60 days.
 Look for any money that you can spend on promotion strategies or a marketing and advertising budget.
 You can use platforms such as Yahoo Small Business, SiteSell and other low-cost sites to set up and maintain a website for as little as $10 per month.


Use your website to promote your business and tell your story. Include testimonials from satisfied customers, samples of your work, and biographical information about you and any other owners or leaders.
 Blogging is a good way to share information with your customers and gain visibility in your industry. Try WordPress, Blogger, or another user-friendly blogging platform.


Try to blog at least once a week, and share your blog on your website and with your social networks. Email a link to your blog to anyone you think might be interested.
Look for opportunities to contribute to other blogs. When you write a guest blog for someone else, you will have an opportunity to link that blog to your own site. This will drive additional traffic to your business.
 Use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media sites to communicate with your customers and attract new ones.


Keep your posts and comments engaging so people will be encouraged to follow or "like" your small business. Hold contests, post fun and interesting questions, and offer discounts. Your content must be refreshed at least every two or three days.

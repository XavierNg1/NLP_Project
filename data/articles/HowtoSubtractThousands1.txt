 Generally when subtracting, you subtract the smaller number from the larger number, which results in a positive answer, or difference., The larger number should be on the top. Ensure the digits in each place value are lined up; that is, the ones place in the top number should be lined up vertically with the ones place in the bottom number, the tens place in the top should be lined up with the tens place in the bottom, etc.The place values in a 4-digit number, from right-to-left, are the ones place, tens place, hundreds place, and thousands place.

The place values should always be aligned. Even if you are subtracting a 4-digit number from a 1-digit number. Since a 1-digit number only has ones, you will align this number with the digit in the ones place of the larger number.
 Remember, the ones place is on the far right. If the bottom digit is larger than the top digit, you must borrow a ten from the tens place. To do this, subtract 1 from the digit in the tens place, and add 10 to the digit in the ones place. Make sure you cross out the original digits and write the new numbers after borrowing.For example, if you are calculating 5,914−2,346{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346}, you will subtract 4−6{\displaystyle 4-6} in the ones place. Since 6 is larger than 4, you must borrow from the tens place. The 1 in the tens place becomes a 0, and the 4 in the ones place becomes 14. So now you will calculate 14−6=8{\displaystyle 14-6=8}. So the digit in the ones place of your answer is 8.
 The tens place is the digit second from the right. Remember to use the new digit if you borrowed from the tens place when subtracting the ones place. If the bottom digit is larger than the top digit, you will have to borrow from the hundreds place. To borrow from the hundreds place, follow the same procedure you used when borrowing from the tens place.

For example, if you are calculating 5,914−2,346{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346}, you will subtract 0−4{\displaystyle 0-4} in the tens place, since you borrowed a ten when subtracting ones. Since 4 is larger than 0, you must borrow from the hundreds place. The 9 in the hundreds place becomes an 8 , and the 0 in the tens place becomes 10. So now you will calculate 10−4=6{\displaystyle 10-4=6}. So the digit in the tens place of your answer is 6.
 The hundreds place is the digit third from the right. Remember to use the new digit if you borrowed previously, and to borrow from the thousands place, using the same borrowing procedure, if the bottom digit is larger than the top digit.

For example, if you are calculating 5,914−2,346{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346}, you will subtract 8−3{\displaystyle 8-3} in the hundreds place, since you borrowed a hundred when subtracting tens. 8−3=5{\displaystyle 8-3=5}. So the digit in the hundreds place of your answer is 5.
 The thousands place is the digit on the far left. Make sure you use any new digits after borrowing. You will not have to borrow in the thousands place, since the top number is ultimately larger than the bottom number.

For example, if you are calculating 5,914−2,346{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346}, you will subtract 5−2{\displaystyle 5-2} in the thousands place. 5−2=3{\displaystyle 5-2=3}. So, 5,914−2,346=3,568{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346=3,568}.
 Since it is easy to make mistakes when subtracting larger numbers, it is always a good idea to check your answer with a calculator.

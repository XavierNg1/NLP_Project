Also remove lose furniture and objects that can be easily swept away such as plants, pool equipment and toys, lawn furniture, grills, and other lose objects., Set the machine according to the manual’s instructions. Start with a low setting and the least powerful nozzle first. Pick an inconspicuous spot and stand at least three feet away from it. Spray the area for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, stop and check the spot to make sure the surface is not damaged.Make sure all the outlets, inlets, and accessories are perfectly connected and secured before turning the pressure washer on.

 Turn the pressure washer up to a higher setting, for example 2000 to 2600 PSI at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius), and begin washing the pool in small sections. Use the washer’s wands and attachments to reach tight corners and crevices when you need to.If you are having a tough time removing the scaling from the tiles, then turn the temperature up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius).

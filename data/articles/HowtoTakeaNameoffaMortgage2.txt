 Refinancing of the loan by the other person will remove your name. The refinancing party must demonstrate, to a lender, sufficient income to pay the monthly payment and refinancing costs., The refinancing party will need to submit an application for refinancing. He or she will have to attach items such as pay stubs, tax returns, credit card statements, bank statements and documentation of any other loan obligations. The lender will also check the personâ€™s credit history and score.
 If the refinancing is approved, your lender will notify you both. At this point, it is advisable to seek out an attorney to close the deal. The attorney can make sure the documentation is drafted properly. He or she will also ensure you are no longer listed on the mortgage or the property records.

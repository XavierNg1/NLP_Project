 If you have had infestation problems in the past, make sure the equipment is far away from the source and clear of waste that may attract other insects.
 This can help to drain wastes away from the area and avoid contamination.
 Set a schedule to dump the debris whether or not the removal container is full.
 Keep all areas that are not in use free of dishes, waste and personal belongings. The walls, floors, ceiling and appliances should be free of clutter for easy cleaning.

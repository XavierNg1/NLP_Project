 PTRCs are local branches of a national network of libraries that have been designated by the USPTO to help the public with patent questions. Each designated location has a staff of trained individuals who can help you conduct patent searches.To find your local PTRC, visit the USPTO website and search PTRC locations by state. While most states have a PTRC location, not every one does. In addition, the nearest PTRC location may be hundreds of miles away from where you live.If you cannot easily access a PTRC, you may need to consider conducting the research yourself or hiring help.
 Once you have found a PTRC close by, call them and make an appointment. The USPTO website has all the contact information you need. Be aware that there may be fees involved. In addition, not every PTRC will offer the service you need.When you call your local PTRC, ask about the hours of operation, the fees, and the services they provide. If they are able to help, set up an appointment to meet with a representative at the PTRC.
 Before you arrive for your appointment, prepare documents and conduct any preliminary research you think is relevant. For example, you should brainstorm relevant terms beforehand. You should also create an outline that includes what your invention is and what you are looking to get out of a patent search (i.e., you want to make sure there is nothing identical out there).
 When you arrive for your appointment, you will meet with a trained individual who will assist you. You will be given access to USPTO resources, including their search databases. They will demonstrate how to use the search tools and they will help you conduct your patent search.In reality, the PTRC will use the same process as if you were using the USPTO search function on your own. However, the trained staff will know what to look or and will help you manipulate your searches to get the results you need. These are things that take time to learn and may be difficult to do on your own.

 Use a shampoo designed for straight hair and a conditioner too, as this will protect your hair from heat and keep it shiny. It also slightly weighs down the hair, preventing it from curling as much.;
, This stops your hair breaking as much; a good method is to gently pat the lengths and ends of hair.
 This straightens your hair and the comb prevents breakage usually caused on wet hair by a bristle brush.
 This focuses the air flow and when teamed up with brushing, can give a straight blow dry.
 For volume, brush hair towards the ceiling and aim the air flow at the brush, or hang your hair upside down and aim your dryer at it, whilst brushing. Depending on hair length, you may want a different look. You can achieve a straight 'do with curled under ends with a round brush. Position the brush under the hair (roughly a two inch wide strip) and brush outwards, then once you reach the ends, keep curling it in towards you (all the while focusing the air flow onto the part of the hair in the brush)

, This step is only required if the blow drying did not straighten as desired.
 Hold the ends of your hair towards the ceiling and clamp with the straighteners. Depending on the style of hair, the top layer may only be required(and the only layer safely possible!)

, Clip top layers up and work from the bottom, curling under if that is the look you want (as short hair tends to flick out if it rests on your shoulders). To avoid too much flicking out if you want a poker straight look, straighten hair upside down and keep brushing out until it cools, otherwise when you stand up again it will cool to the shape of your shoulders.

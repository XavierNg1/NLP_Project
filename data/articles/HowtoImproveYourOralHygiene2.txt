 So-called "ribbon" or "tape" flosses cover a wider surface area than narrower thread flosses, allowing you to remove more material with each stroke. You should use waxed floss instead of non-waxed, since waxed floss slides more easily between teeth, and is less likely to shred or break during flossing., While the bristles of your toothbrush will remove some of the food and plaque from between your teeth, only floss can remove the deepest materials. Food materials and plaque left between the teeth for long periods of time can accelerate tooth decay, and lead to the buildup of tartar, a hard substance which is much more difficult to remove. Tartar also causes bad breath and gum recession. Daily flossing is as important to good oral hygiene as brushing., Wrap about 1/3 of this length around each of your middle fingers, leaving around 6 inches of floss between them. This will ensure a tight grip on the floss, allowing you to control it more easily. , Don't use sharp, snapping motions, which can cause irritation and hurt your gums. Once the floss is between your teeth, curve it around one tooth into a C shape, gently moving it into the space between the gum and the tooth. Finally, using gentle motions, move the floss back away from the gum, holding the floss tightly against the side of the tooth. Repeat this motion for each of your teeth, and make sure to clean the rear side of your back teeth.Make sure to throw away all used floss. Recycling the same length of floss can re-introduce bacteria to your teeth which you have previously cleaned off.
 A little irritation or blood is normal, especially if you haven't been flossing regularly. The pain and bleeding should cease after a few days. If they do not, this may be a sign of gingivitis, a gum disease. Talk to your doctor about treatments for gingivitis, but continue brushing and flossing daily.

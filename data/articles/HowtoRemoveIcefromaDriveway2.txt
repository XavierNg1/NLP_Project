 If you have ice on your driveway, you probably have some snow too. Any method that melts ice will melt snow, too, so you can’t effectively remove the ice if you don’t remove the snow first. Push it off of the driveway with a plow or snow shovel., Grab a spray bottle that’s at least a quart (about one liter) or a half gallon (about 2 liters). Add the alcohol and put the spray nozzle back on. If you want to make the alcohol last longer, dilute it with water to a 50/50 ratio.Note that diluted alcohol may be slightly less effective at melting the ice.
If you don’t have a spray bottle, carefully use a sharp knife to poke four or five holes in the cap of the alcohol bottle and spray the alcohol in this way.
 Walk from side to side on the driveway, spraying the alcohol as you go. If you’re able to bend over, hold the bottle about a foot away from the ice so it hits it more directly. If the alcohol runs out before you cover the driveway, refill the bottle and continue., After you leave the alcohol sitting on the ice for 15 to 30 minutes, grab a sturdy metal snow shovel. Break up the ice and push it off to the side of the driveway. In a pinch, you don’t have to shovel it off, but you risk it freezing again.

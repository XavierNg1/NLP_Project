A Cross Rail: This is a type of upright fence. The jump is made with two poles, each with one side resting on the ground so they form a cross at the centre. It can be used to improve straightness as it encourages the horse to jump in the centre of the jump and are therefore useful as the first element of a spread or combination. It makes the horse want to jump in the center and it helps get your horse ready!






Ascending Oxer (Staircase): This is a type of spread fence. This is can be double or treble bar, with need 2 and 3 pairs of wings respectively. On each pair of wings, an upright fence is constructed. The bar(s) in front must be lower than the one behind it. This is a nice jump for the horse as it follows the shape of the jumps. This jump must only be jumped one way as it has a false ground line the other way.






Pyramid (Tiger trap): This is a type of spread fence. This will have 3 or 5 wing set closely together. On each pair of wings, an upright fence is constructed. The middle bar must be the highest and the bars either side ascending or descending similar to the ascending oxer. This is a nice jump for the horse as it follows the shape of the jumps.






Upright (Vertical): This is a type of upright fence. This consists of a jump with a vertical bar along the top. If the jump is very low, only one pole is needed, other poles under the top one will fill in the gap and make in jump look more solid. These jumps may or may not have a pole as a ground line.






True Parallel (Square Oxer): This is a type of spread fence. This has two or more pairs of wings. On each pair of wings, an upright fence is constructed.






Combinations: These can be doubles, trebles, or quadruples. They are a set of two, three or four jumps respectively, set a few strides apart, more than three strides. They can include any of the other jumps.

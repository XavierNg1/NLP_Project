 Once you’ve installed the game on your mobile device, connect it to your Facebook account. Doing so will automatically backup and sync your progress since it’s now stored within your Facebook account.


Even if you’ve lost your mobile device or accidentally deleted the game, you’re assured that your progress hasn’t been lost. If you’re playing directly from Facebook with a web browser, you may skip this step.;
, Collect friends on Facebook. Playing Bubble Witch Saga can be a social activity. You can see your friends’ progress on the game map, and they can see yours. Your scores are also tabulated and ranked against your friends. Invite your friends to play Bubble Witch Saga as well.
 You are allotted only five lives maximum at a time. Once you use one up, it will take 30 minutes to replenish. Consuming all five lives in one go will require you to wait at least two and a half hours for another full set of five lives. However, you can ask your friends for lives.


From the game map, click or tap the heart with your number of remaining lives. The “Get more lives” window will appear. Click or tap the “Ask friends for help” button and select the friends you’d like to ask lives from. Click or tap the “Ask For Lives” button to send out the requests.
A friend can give you a life once a day. These gifted lives are given and received for free and won’t count against your five lives.
 Requesting for lives can take some time. Some people give, some people don’t. Not everyone is generous in giving away free lives.

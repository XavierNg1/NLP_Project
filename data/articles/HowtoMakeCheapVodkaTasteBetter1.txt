 The key ingredient in your filter that removes impurities from the vodka is generally a charcoal filter. This kind of filter removes oil and sugar, along with any other impurities, from the vodka that that make it taste less than delicious.Using a small funnel can help you pour your vodka into your filter’s reservoir more easily, resulting in less liquor spilled.;
, Give your vodka a firm swirl after completing each filtration cycle so that impurities are evenly distributed. This will create a consistent taste throughout your filtered batch and prepare it for the next round of filtration.You should also keep your vodka chilled, as colder temperatures will cause impurities to be easier for your filter to catch.While your vodka is dripping through the filter, you might place it in a freezer to help the filter catch impurities.
 Continue to regularly agitate your vodka and keep it in a cold place as you continue to filter. You’ll want to use a clean container for the filtered vodka to collect into, and for best results, you may want to change your filter every few filtration cycles.As your filter strains impurities out of your vodka, its ability to continue to do so diminishes.
While it’s unlikely you’ll need to change your filter after a single filtration, you should pay attention to your “change filter” indicator and swap in a new one when necessary.
For filters without a “change filter” indicator, you may want to use a new filter every two to three filtration cycles for best results.
Remember to swirl each completely filtered batch of vodka to improve its consistency.
 The filtration process causes the composition of the vodka to become disturbed. You’ll want to give your recently filtered vodka some rest time, 15 to 30 minutes should do the trick, before you then use it for drinking.

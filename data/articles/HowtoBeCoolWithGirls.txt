 When you first meet a girl, try to make the best impression possible in front of her and directly to her. If you want to be her friend, just talk to her. Start with a simple "Hey, what's up?".;
, A girl will never like a guy who is a jerk. Girls like guys who are respectful, confident, and make them feel good at all times. They hate when a guy is a jerk and/or selfish so try to make the best impression possible.
 If you wear the same clothes that other people wear, you either do it because you want to be like them, or you like their style. Girls hate wannabes that pretend to be someone they are not. Wear the clothes that you like. Act however way you want.
 If a girl is sad, be there to comfort her even if you don't like her. If a girl is being yelled by her boyfriend, step in and stop him. If a girl is being picked on, defend her. This will not only prove that you are a gentleman, but also that you care for them and that you are a good person.
 Look good, smell good, look confident and smile at all times. This will make a really good impression.
 Girls hate it when a guy gives up. Don't give up in your favorite sport or goal in life. Fight all the obstacles in life and you will get rewarded.

 In Minecraft, slime blocks have a slight "bouncy" effect when you jump on them. On top of this, you don't receive any falling damage from landing on them — no matter how high you fall from.This makes them perfect for making a trampoline! Since you'll want to make a trampoline that's big enough to hit when you're falling from a great height, you'll probably want at least nine before you get started.


Slime blocks are crafted from nine slimeballs at the crafting table.You can get slimeballs by killing slime mobs, which tend to appear underground and in swamps.;
, Make a square or circle with the slime blocks. Keep it one layer thick — multiple layers won't change the properties of the trampoline. This will be the "bouncy" surface of the trampoline that you'll jump on to.


If you wish, you can just put this pad on the floor. However, if you're going for a realistic-looking trampoline, you may want to make a frame of wood, stone, or metal a few blocks off of the floor. Putting a ladder on one side is a nice touch.
 Use whatever spare blocks you have to build your skinny tower — stone and wood work fine. There's no "right" height, but the higher you jump from, the more you'll bounce.


Unless you want to build a system of stairs, a ladder will be a huge help for getting to the top again once you jump. Craft ladders by arranging seven wood sticks in an "H" shape at a crafting table., You should bounce several times before gradually coming to a rest. Now, just climb up and try again!

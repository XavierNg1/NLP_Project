 Performing a nose manual requires basically the exact opposite actions as a normal manual. Start rolling forward, then shift your stance so that your front foot is on the curved portion at the front of the board (the "nose"). If it isn't already, put your rear foot on or near the rear trucks. Put a slight bend in your knees. This stance makes it possible for you to lift the rear wheels off the ground, balancing on the front wheels.
 As you roll forward, shift your weight from the center of the board onto your front foot. For balance, raise your arms away from your sides, and, if necessary, lean back ever-so-slightly. At first, this will invariably result in the board slipping out from under you. This is OK - with time, you'll develop a sense of where your center of mass is and you'll be better at keeping your balance.
 To hold your nose manual as you roll forward, you'll want your weight balanced carefully over the front set of wheels. At first, this will be exceedingly difficult, but, with practice, it will become easier. If you're having difficulty keeping your balance, try shifting your hips and/or torso to compensate for any imbalances. You may also want to experiment with using your back foot to push gently downward and maintain balance.


As soon as you are able to hold your nose manual for a second or so, start trying to hold it for longer and longer distances. With patient practice, your sense of balance will gradually improve and maintaining your balance during a nose manual will become as natural as doing so during a normal manual.
 As with normal manuals, to return to a normal riding stance, force the elevated portion of the board back down to the ground. As you do so, shift your weight back over the center of the board to make it easier to maintain control. Finally, move your feet back to their normal riding positions.

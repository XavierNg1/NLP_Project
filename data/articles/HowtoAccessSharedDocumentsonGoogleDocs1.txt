 Go to the Google Docs website using any web browser on your computer.;
, Under the Sign In box, type in your Gmail email address and password. This is your one Google ID for all of Google’s services, including Google Docs. Click the “Sign in” button to proceed.


Upon logging in, you will be brought to the main view with all your documents listed and sorted.
 There’s no ready filter for identifying docs shared with you. There’s no central folder or location where shared docs are stored in Google Docs. However, you can easily identify shared docs by looking under the Owner column. Your owned docs have “Me” listed under the Owner column. Otherwise, you’ll see the Google name of the person who owns them.
 Once you’ve identified a shared doc, click it once to open it. Depending on the access level assigned to you by the owner of the doc, you will be able to edit, comment, or view it.

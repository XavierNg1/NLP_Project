, Your children are highly trained in spotting differences. If you continue talking about "looking past" someone's race or being "colorblind", then you are saying that something is wrong with that person's race for you to ignore it.
 Talking about how we are all the same, is saying that being different is a bad thing and that difference interrupts harmony and balance. Don't give your children the message that people must have similarities or have to be the same as you in order for them to show kindness and respect.

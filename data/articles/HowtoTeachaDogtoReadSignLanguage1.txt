 Using obedience hand signals first is good because other dog trainers will know these signals, even if they don't rely on them solely.For instance, a common hand sign for "down" is to hold your hand up at your shoulder with your elbow bent, then move your hand to the floor.The main drawback to using only obedience signs is they may not cover everything you want to do with your dog.;
, Another option is to use American Sign Language. One plus of ASL is that people who are deaf will be able to communicate with your dog. One drawback is that ASL often takes two hands, which can be a problem if you have your dog on a leash. Nonetheless, some people modify ASL to be used with one hand.You can find basic ASL dictionaries online.
 You can also, of course, make up your own hand signals. The plus side is you'll be able to easily remember them. The downside is the only people who will be able to command your dog are people you teach the signs to. In addition, some people find it hard to just make up signs off the top of their heads.

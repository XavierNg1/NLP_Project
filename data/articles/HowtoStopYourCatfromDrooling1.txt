 Cats often drool when they are happy and content, like when they eat catnip. Don’t feed your cat catnip. Also feed your cat on time so it doesn’t drool when it’s happily waiting for food. And put a towel on your lap when you pet your cat, because you can’t prevent this type of happy drool., Cats drool after eating bitter or unpleasant things, like medicine. Also distract your cat with toys or a ball of yarn after you apply topical flea or worming medication to try and prevent it from licking the medication off its fur. Treat your cat with food or water if it does lick any medication off.


Bring your cat to the vet for medication and treatment if you notice your cat has symptoms like twitching, seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, not eating, and/or problems with its coordination after it licks topical medication off its fur.
 Nausea can cause drooling in cats. Feed your cat something mild or give it some water to help with an upset stomach. Take your cat to the vet if you note more serious symptoms, like loss of appetite, grinding teeth, or listlessness.Check with the vet to be sure your cat’s nausea is not a sign of problems with the liver, kidneys, or pancreas, which will require immediate treatment.

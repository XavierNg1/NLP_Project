 The cooking time is the same as when cooking with a plate. It will be easier to make a lot of pancakes quickly using a plate, but a mug can give you a novel, single-serving pancake.
 Pour water into the mug (about half a mug's worth) until the mixture becomes a paste of medium thickness. Mix with a teaspoon until the consistency is smooth. You can add more water if the mixture is too thick, and more flour/pancake mix if the mixture is too thin.
 The pancake is fully cooked when there is no runny mixture left in the mug. If the mix is still runny, then microwave the mug for 30 seconds longer.
 When your mug pancake is thoroughly cooked, it is ready to eat. Drizzle syrup, sugar, or butter into the mug, and enjoy!

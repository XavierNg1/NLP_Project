 Popularity is very dependent on your confidence level. If you have poor posture, it sends the message to others that you have low confidence. To fix this, stand or sit up straight and keep your arms and legs uncrossed. This will show that you are confident and approachable.Being confident will show people that you like yourself. This makes them feel like they can trust you and that they will like you, too.
 Another clear sign of confidence is the ability to maintain eye contact with another person. When you are speaking or listening to someone, look them in the eye. Avoid distractions like cell phones or other people walking by. If you are speaking to multiple people, make sure to make eye contact with each person.For example, if you ask your teacher a question, make eye contact with them.
If you are speaking in front of your class, make eye contact with each person before you are finished speaking.
 To speak in a confident way, you will need to speak loud enough for anyone listening to hear you. A conversational tone is perfect if you are speaking to one person across the table, but if you are speaking to a crowd you will need to project your voice. Use concise sentences to get straight to your point and avoid filler words like “Um” and “Uh.”An example of a concise sentence would be “I think that everyone should ski at least once.” Something like “Well, skiing is fun, but I don’t know if people really know that,” is not concise.
 To be confident, you need to feel comfortable in your own skin. Practice good hygiene habits such as regular bathing and brushing your teeth. Be sure that you dress appropriately for the occasion, as well. Being over or underdressed can cause you to feel uncomfortable around others.For example, you wouldn’t wear a suit and tie to a Superbowl party with friends (usually). You also wouldn’t wear a T-shirt to a wedding (usually).

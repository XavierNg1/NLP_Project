 If your dog typically goes out in your yard for exercise and to relieve itself, this is a great place to start. Shovel or use a snow blower to clear paths through the snow for your pup to walk through. Take care to avoid creating piles of snow high enough that your pup is in danger, if the snow collapses onto the path., You can make little paths that lead to your dog's favorite spot in the yard or at least from your door to a cleared area. This will make it easier and safer for you and your dog to walk in the snow. If you keep the areas around your doors, driveway, and sidewalk clear by shoveling after each new snowfall, walking your dog will be much easier., If your neighborhood, street, or yard are too snowy for your pup to walk safely, look for less snowy walk locations. Typically, parks and schools are cleared by the city, so youâ€™ll be able to walk further with less obstruction for your pup. If you are able to drive your pet, take a train, or bus to an area with less snow, this could be your best option for a comfortable walk., Dogs should always be trained against this behavior, but it can be especially precarious in the snow. If your pup starts pulling on the lead, stop immediately, and try to establish both solid footing and control of the dog. Stay in one place until your pup stops pulling, and continue to stop each time it starts pulling.

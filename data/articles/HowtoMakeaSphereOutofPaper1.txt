 Choose a thicker paper like cardstock or construction paper for a sturdier sphere. You can also use decorative scrapbook paper or plain copy paper if you’d prefer. Use sharp scissors to cut your paper into 12 strips that are ½-inch (1.25 centimeters) wide and 6 inches (15.25 centimeters) long., Evenly stack the strips of paper. Punch a hole on either end of the stack using a standard hole punch. The holes should be about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) from either end.If you have difficulty punching a hole through the entire stack, separate the stack into two or three piles and punch the holes into these smaller piles. Just make sure that the holes you punch are evenly placed from stack to stack.
If you decide to use decorative or printed paper instead of blank paper or blank cardstock, stack the strips so that the decorative side all faces one direction.
 With the strips all in one stack, place a metal paper fastener into the hole on either end. Flatten the "tail" of the fastener against the back of the stack.If you are using strips cut from decorative or patterned paper, position each fastener "head" against the decorated side of the paper.
 With both ends secured, use your hands to carefully bend the stack of strips into a C-shape without creasing any of the strips.If you’re using decorative paper, remember to have the image face outward.
 While the stack is bent, gently pull the strips apart, spreading them into the shape of a sphere. You can adjust the pieces to overlap to make your sphere look more like a globe, or you can create spaces between the paper to make it look more like a lantern.If you want to hang your sphere, wrap the middle of a piece of thread around one of the metal fasteners. Then wind the thread several times. Knot the ends to form a loop, which you can use to hang it.
You can easily flatten the sphere by sliding the paper strips back into a stack.

 To remove lumps, sift the powdered sugar into a medium mixing bowl. Then add the orange zest and whisk the two ingredients together.To change the flavor of the icing slightly, you can also add or substitute different citrus zests, such as lemon, grapefruit, or lime.
 Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of juice and whisk to combine. Whisk in more juice as needed if the icing is too thick. The ideal glaze consistency depends on what you're looking for:For a thinner glaze that you can drizzle over cookies and cakes, add more orange juice to make the glaze a little runny.
For a thicker glaze that you can dip cupcakes into without it running, add less juice.
 There are several ways that you can apply a glaze icing to different desserts. Check the recipe you're working with to see if it calls for special instructions.


For cakes and Bundt cakes, run a whisk or spoon through the glaze and then drizzle it over the cake, letting the glaze run down the sides.
For cupcakes, dip the top of each cupcake into the glaze. Let the excess drip off over the bowl, then flip the cupcake over (right-side up) and let the glaze set for about 15 minutes.
For cookies, use a pastry brush to brush the glaze onto the top of each cookie.

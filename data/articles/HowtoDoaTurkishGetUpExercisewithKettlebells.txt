  From the fetal position facing your kettlebell, hold your kettlebell with both hands and keep your wrist in line with your forearm bone.;
,  Roll with both hands on the bell handle till the bell rests on your side. Bend the knee on the side which you started on, and extend your opposite leg at 45 degree angle from your body.



Warning. Keep your shoulders retracted and your lats engaged for the rest of the workout to prevent injury.
 Use whichever arm you were lying on in the beginning to hold it for the duration of the workout.  The opposite arm is used for all other movements since one will be holding the bell.



Tip. Keep your eye on the bell.
 Place your arm 45 degrees from your body.
  Push off the ground with your elbow at the same time you push off your bent leg. Driving through the heel, roll onto your forearm.
  Press off your forearm and twist your hand down to lift up.
  Use your glutes to thrust your body into the air.  Remember to keep your core engaged.
  Pull your leg back till your knee is directly under the kettlebell.  

,  Bring your hip in line with your torso to form the classic lunge position.  



Tip. Look straight forward and not at the bell.
  From the lunge, it is as simple as standing up.  



Tip Keep your core engaged.
  Follow each step backwards till you are back on the ground, lying on your back.

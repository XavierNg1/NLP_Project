 You will need to use baking soda and water. Combine the baking soda with a small amount of water. Add more water or baking powder if necessary until a paste is made., Apply the paste directly to the grout. Use enough paste so that the dirty grout is saturated with the baking soda and water. The paste should only be applied to the grout. Do not put it on the tile.
 The amount of time you allow the paste to sit depends on how dirty the grout is. If the grout is only slightly dirty, you can allow it to sit for a few hours. Allow the paste to sit overnight if the grout is very dirty., Once you have let the paste sit, scrub the grout with a toothbrush. You may have to use a little force if the paste has hardened. Scrub until you see clean grout underneath.
 Pour water onto the remaining paste. Rinse the grout off until all of the paste is gone. Use a towel to wipe off the paste. Dry with a towel.








You can use oxygen bleach on the grout if it doesn’t turn out as clean as you’d like after the paste.

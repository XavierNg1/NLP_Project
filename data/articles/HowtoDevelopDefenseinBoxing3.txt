 As the punch comes in, lean your torso back and slap the punch away. Let your opponent’s momentum carry the punch past you. This works best when you slap the punch downward or across your body.If your opponent is throwing a left-handed punch, slap it away with your right hand. If your opponent throws a right-handed punch, slap it away with your left hand.
This is most effective when you immediately throw a punch of your own while your opponent is off balance.
 With your hand in the basic defensive position, your palms should be facing you. As you see the punch coming in, twist your wrist so that your palm faces away from you. Push your hand forward three to five inches to make contact with the punch. Step and lean back slightly to take the impact of the punch.Immediately bring your hand back into your defensive position, or use the hand you didn’t block with to throw a quick punch.
 Boxers love this technique for its simplicity. As you see the punch coming in, press sides of your forearms tight together. Raise your arms slightly so that your gloves are just below your eyebrows. Take the impact of the punch and get your arms back into standard position.

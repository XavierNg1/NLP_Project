 You can change how fast the pointer moves in response to you moving the mouse (or dragging your finger on the trackpad) in System Preferences. , This is where you will find numerous mouse settings that can be adjusted to meet your needs.


If you are using a trackpad on a laptop, choose “Trackpad” from the “View” menu instead of “Mouse.”The rest of the settings will be the same.
, Moving the slider to the right increases the pointer speed, making it more sensitive to your touch. Moving it to the left decreases the speed, which enhances precision, but less sensitive to the touch.
 This option may not appear on all systems. If you find you need to double-click too fast for your liking, you can move the slider to the left to decrease the double-click speed. If you click quickly and find that your system doesn’t register your clicks, move the slider to the right.
 This will save and apply your settings. You can return to this menu at any time to re-adjust your settings.

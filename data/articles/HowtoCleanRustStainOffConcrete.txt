 Power wash concrete using a commercial grade pressure washer, degreaser and surface cleaner.  An alkaline concrete cleaner may be used. Rinse well.  Cleaning the concrete first will open up the pores of the concrete and allow F9 BARC to soak in deeper and remove more of the orange battery stain than just applying F9 BARC alone.;
,,  Do not “spot spray” on your first application. Use a circular overlapping spray motion. Spray from one side of the concrete pad to the other using a fine mist up to a uniform spray. High pressure low volume at 60-70 psi is recommended. Apply from control joint to control joint on the entire pad of concrete. Apply a bit more product on the areas with more staining. Apply as evenly and as thick as possible without letting F9 BARC run down the concrete. If F9 BARC does run down the concrete leave it alone. F9 BARC should begin to turn white and foam slightly.
 Stains will disappear as concrete dries.
 If not, proceed to #7. It is better to go heavier on the first application and lighter on the second application. On the second application you may use less product on the areas with less staining and more product on the areas with stains remaining. It is acceptable to mist-spray on this application.
 Stains will disappear as concrete dries.
 Wet the concrete with water to reactivate the F9 cleaner. While wet, lightly broom the concrete to help F9 penetrate the concrete even deeper. Do not let concrete dry. Rinse lightly with a pressure washer to remove remaining surfactant. Do not use a surface cleaner here. Allow concrete to dry completely and evaluate results.

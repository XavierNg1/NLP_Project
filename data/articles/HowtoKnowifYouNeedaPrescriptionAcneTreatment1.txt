 Many people treat acne with face wash, creams, or gels purchased at the store containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, or alpha hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid and lactic acid.Using these products, acne should clear up within four to eight weeks.If this has not occurred, you may need prescription acne medication.


Look at your products to see if they contain these ingredients. If not, try a face wash or cream with one of the two for about six weeks before deciding to get a prescription.
When using a product with benzoyl peroxide, the common OTC strengths are 2.5 to 10%. For salicylic acid, it ranges from 0.5 to 5%. You may want to try a stronger OTC treatment before going to the dermatologist.
While most retinoids require a prescription, there is one called Differin that is available over the counter. You might try using this to see if it is effective before getting a prescription retinoid.;
, Some people end up with pimples or blackheads because they aren’t using the right products for their skin. Whether you have oily, dry, or combination skin will influence which products you choose. To do this, you need to determine what type of skin of you have.Oily skin is shiny with larger pores. Dry skin has dry, red patches. Combination skin is both. You may have dry patches, but your T-zone (your forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin) may be oily.
People with any skin type should wash their face twice each day with face washes labeled non-comedogenic. Salicylic acid works well for oily skin. Dry skin needs a gentle cleanser that moisturizes and doesn’t over-dry your skin.
 You should wash your face in the morning and at night with a cleanser that is made for your skin type. Ask yourself honestly if you follow a proper skin care regimen. If you do and you still have persistent acne, you may need a prescription.If you do not follow a proper face cleansing program, start one.

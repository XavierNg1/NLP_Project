 Windows Vista introduced new graphics drivers that enable effects such as the Aero desktop and better hardware acceleration. One of the downsides of these new drivers is that full-screen is no longer supported for console (Command Prompt) applications. This means that you can no longer make the Command Prompt full-screen in Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 8.1. You can use the following workaround to make the window take up the whole screen, but it won't be true full-screen.


Windows 10 allows you switch the Command Prompt to full-screen by pressing Alt+â†µ Enter.
You can disable your video card drivers, but you'll lose the Aero theme in Windows and your screen resolution will max out at 800 x 600. See the next section for details.
If you run a lot of DOS programs and want to use them in full-screen mode, you may want to try the DOSBox emulator. This program emulates the DOS environment and allows you to run programs full-screen. See the last section for details.;
, You'll need to start the Command Prompt as an administrator, which you can do from the Start menu.
 If you aren't logged in with an administrator account, you'll need to enter the administrator password.
 This will load the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC). Don't worry about using this tool, you'll only be using it to trick the Command Prompt into maximizing the window. You'll notice that the prompt will change.
 Click the Maximize button in the corner of the Command Prompt window. It should now take up the whole screen, but will still have borders and the title bar.
 You will be taken back to the regular Command Prompt. The window will stay maximized. You can now start using the Command Prompt in a window that takes up the whole screen.
 Your changes will stay in effect even after you close the Command Prompt. The changes will even take effect in the regular version of Command Prompt.

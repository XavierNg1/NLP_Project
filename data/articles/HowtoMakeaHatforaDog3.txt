, Make the same cone template as explained in the previous hat's steps, adjusting the cone size to your dog's head size. Place the cone paper template over the black foam and cut out the cone shape and assemble as in the previous hat's steps (you'll need to do this before making the brim, so that you can check the circle circumference). For the brim, draw a circle that is the same circumference as the base of the cone and another circle about 2.5cm/1 inch out from the first circle, so that you have a circle within a circle (the inner circle will be cut out).
 Cut out the inner circle and around the outside of the outer circle, so that you're left with a doughnut shape.
 Measure the amount of elastic needed, double it over and knot at the edges. Staple the edges to the sides of the base of the cone.
 Hot glue into place with a few dabs here and there. Allow to dry.
, Where the ribbon joins, glue this piece over the join.
 It's now good to go!

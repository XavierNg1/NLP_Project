 You'll want to have maximum control over the egg; if you use your other hand, it might accidentally slip.






;
,, Make sure the part of the egg you tap is the widest part; if you break the egg near the top or bottom, it'll be more likely to shatter in your hands.









Some say eggs should be cracked against a flat surface, while others swear by rapping them against the edge of a metal bowl or pot. Either method works as well.
You can also tap something hard against the egg, rather than the other way around. Try taking a heavy knife or another heavy utensil and tapping it firmly across the center of the egg.
 Use the thumb of your second hand to push gently into the cracked part of the eggshell, then pull the halves apart with both hands. Do this gently, to minimize the chance that the egg will shatter or that small pieces of shell will get into your bowl.









Experienced chefs who have to crack dozens of eggs at a time are able to open the egg halves with one hand. To do this, center the cracked egg in your palm and hold it face-down over your bowl. Use your forefinger to stabilize the back of the egg, then pull it apart using your thumb and middle finger to separate the halves. This method takes a lot of practice!

, If you're using the whole egg, go ahead and pour it in, yolk and all.









To separate the whites and the yolk, position the egg over the bowl and gently pour the yolk back and forth between the egg halves so that the egg white drops into the bowl and the yolk is preserved whole in a shell half.

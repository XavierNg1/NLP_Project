 An important life skill is the ability to joke back with others without being too mean. A certain amount of making fun is a part of life. If you can joke a bit, and give as good as you get, others won't pick on you so much.Some people tease their friends, and their boyfriends or girlfriends, out of affection – they really do think they are being funny. They will admire you if you can tease them back without getting upset.
 If a friend has suddenly started teasing you about a boy, for example, you could say, “Why are you suddenly so interested in my love life, anyway?” Or, if they have been poking fun of your new look, you can say something like, “When did my hair cut become the most fascinating thing this group has to talk about?”, Pay attention when you are around someone who is good at deflecting criticism, and can toss back witty remarks when they are being teased. Notice how they deal with it, what kind of things they say, and the reaction they get. When you're being teased, you can think to yourself, “What would this person say in this situation?”

, Your friends might be teasing you because they sense that you are changing, and they are afraid you will outgrow them. They are mocking you because it is easier than evolving along with you – change can be scary. If you can match their joke by taking it even further, it shows them that you are still the same person inside and there is no need to feel threatened.Your friend teases you for wearing a new leather jacket, saying, “What's up, Fonzie?” You say, “Yeah, and...I'm not stopping there. Tomorrow I'm jumping my motorcycle over a shark tank.”
You're wearing a new scarf. Your friend says, “Dude! Is that your girlfriend's scarf?” You say, “Sure is! And...I'm wearing her undies, too.”

 You can find the product specification on the back of the box of the phone. Compare it with your handset by going to Settings > About phone. If the specifications don’t match, it’s possible your phone is a clone.


In case the box is missing, the whole specs are available to view online on GSMArena or in its official website too.
 To check your own handset’s specification, search and download Antutu Benchmark from Google Play. The logo is a red Android image with fire as a background. It will let you test your device’s speed and will later detect full specification of your phone and device’s name.


If it will display another phone’s manufacturer’s name, then your phone might be a clone.
 If your phone is an iPhone, you can check the software. iPhone clones are not Java capable and use Android as their OS. The clone manufacturer cannot use iOS because it’s Apple-exclusive.


Remember also that the iPhone has the iTunes App Store, not Google Play.
An iPhone is connected to iTunes, and you must have an iCloud account to allow synchronization from your phone.

 Spend at least 20 minutes reading at home every day. You will be amazed by how much vocabulary you will learn and how much better your writing will be. You don't have to limit your reading to literature. Read anything you like: newspapers, blogs, history books, poems. The wider variety of reading you do, the better., When doing homework, take a short break about every 20 minutes. Stand up, stretch, walk around, rest your eyes, and drink a glass of water. Short, rejuvenating breaks are better than long ones that distract you or make you groggy., This means not waiting until the last minute to do assignments and giving yourself plenty of time before the due dates to review and revise your work. If an assignment is due the next day, don’t wait until after dinner to begin doing it. If it is due in two weeks, do not wait until the middle of the second week. Start assignments as soon as possible., Set clear limits for your homework. Don’t try to read an entire novel overnight. Doing too much at once will overwhelm you and cause burnout., Cramming almost never works, even for people who say they work best under pressure. Pace yourself and study in the few days leading up to the test, rather than only the night before or morning of the exam. Remember that good rest and exercise make for a clear mind.

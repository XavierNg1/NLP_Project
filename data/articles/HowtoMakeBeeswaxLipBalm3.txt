 Pour the melted lip balm into containers. Work quickly so that the balm does not begin to set up.









Do not overfill.
Use a turkey baster or large medicine dropper to squirt the mixture carefully into lip balm tubes if desired.
 Place lids on the containers.
 Do not expose to bright sunlight or high temperatures as the beeswax lip balm will melt. Discard if your lip balm ever changes its smell, consistency, or color.

 A person’s emotional defenses can be down if they are feeling tired or hungry. Find a good time when the person is rested and can approach a problem without getting mired in negative emotion., If you did something wrong or if you unintentionally hurt another person, apologizing is not a sign of weakness. It shows that you care that you hurt another person, no matter if it was intended or not.
 Work towards problem solving. Ask what the person would like to see happen as a resolution. If you can’t meet the person’s expectations or if the person is being unreasonable, see what you can negotiate.
 For example, you can say, “How can I help you to the point where we can resolve this issue?”, If you are trying to come to a compromise, stick with the issue that is immediately happening. Don’t bring up past fights or problems. Don’t use old grudges to get what you want out of a situation., It may be that you can’t arrive at a solution until the person has calmed down. This may take a while, and solving the problem will be delayed until the other person can respond without being too angry.

 Keep one tab open on some very boring research. When someone comes close, switch to that tab and pretend to be deeply engrossed in it. Your boss will leave you alone forever. Maintain that expression, even while on a different tab. But be careful, they may get you involved in the most boring of researches now!;
, People are bound to ask who you're texting so, just say it's a friend. Make up a random name if you like.
 If you're at school, writing or something, run your pen over your work, as if checking for mistakes.
 When they see you chatting just Alt+Tab to the word file and pretend that you have typed it there yourself.
 Maybe a shoelace of yours got untied, or you need to straighten your shirt and a pen fell out, or other things like that.
 If someone passes by you, just pick it up and start reading/writing.
 Pretend to examine the area.
 Pick it up and pretend that the cap fell off too. Anything will work as long as it prolongs your stalling time.
 Don't get up and start walking around moving tables, just pretend you are organizing your workstation.
 Start stretching, but not too long as people might get suspicious.
 If your boss does check your work, stall them and start typing to make you look busy - type something like " The following topic of which I am about to discuss via work and documentation is..." as it babbles on.
 Go to Google and type in "things that make you look busy" and you find this site, read it, put your own stuff on it.

 Cracking your back can temporarily relieve back pain. However, persistent back pain should be evaluated by a medical professional.








Back pain can come in response to sitting in an uncomfortable position or strain during exercise. In most cases, it goes away on its own with time. However, back pain that persists beyond a few weeks should be evaluated by a doctor.
Depending on the cause of your back pain, your doctor will recommend a treatment. Back pain is usually treated with things like physical therapy and possibly medication. In rare cases, surgery may be required for back pain.
 Cracking your back can be fine once in a while to alleviate discomfort. However, cracking your back constantly can unnecessarily stretch out the muscles in your back. This can result in a condition known as hyper-mobility.








Hyper-mobility will loosen your back muscles, resulting in you losing function in your spine and the muscles and ligaments surrounding your back.
If you feel the need to constantly crack your back due to pain, see a doctor instead of repeatedly cracking your back.
 Stretching is usually better than cracking your back to alleviate mild pain. To stretch your back, flex forward and then backwards. Then, bend from side to side. This should relieve some tension.








This is best done in the shower after about five minutes of showering.

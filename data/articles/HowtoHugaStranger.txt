, The more people there are, the more people there are to hug. Note that if you choose a place that's owned by someone (such as a shopping mall) it might be a good idea to get permission first.
 If you're lazy or shy, just smile at people and wait patiently for them to come up to you and offer you a hug.
 That means you wrap your arms around a person over their shoulders or just below their arms and maybe pat their back gently a few times. Try to avoid touching people below the waist, and there's no need for your hips to touch, either. Wait until they let go, unless you get creeped out because you think they're trying to cop a feel.

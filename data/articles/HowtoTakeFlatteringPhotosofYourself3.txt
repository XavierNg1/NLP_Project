 Natural light is always better for photography. However, direct sunlight, particularly in the middle of the day when the sun is straight overhead, is often not flattering.If you are able, take photos on an overcast day.
If you are inside, try taking photos near a window with natural light (but not direct sunlight) coming in.
If you must use light that isn’t natural, avoid fluorescent lighting and overhead lighting. Indoors, you may be able to turn off overhead lights and turn on lamps for a better light effect.
If direct overhead lighting (either natural or artificial) can’t be avoided, use the flash on your camera to fill in light so that there are no shadows under your nose or eyes.
 Don’t become an embarrassed internet celebrity by taking and sharing photos of yourself with embarrassing things in the background.


Bathrooms and messy bedrooms are often not the best choice for selfies, but they frequently occur there. A picture is never flattering if there is a toilet in the background.If you are indoors, find a neutral background such as a blank wall or a window.
If you are outdoors or at an event, be sure to include yourself and your environment so that your picture tells a story.
 You may add some visual interest to your photograph by providing a visual frame.Here are a few suggestions for framing your photo:


Pose in a doorway.
Use both arms outstretched to hold the camera instead of one.
Stand between two things, such as trees or bushes outdoors.
Use your hand under or on your chin to frame the bottom of your photo.

 This can be done with or without supporting yourself with your hands.


This is an intermediate yoga pose, and not one that should be done with a sore or stiff back or without guidance from a knowledgeable instructor.
If you cannot sink backwards enough to reach the heels, use yoga blocks or other props to support your back. Again--this is a challenging pose. Supports can help reach this goal, not be a "cheat".
For a deeper, even more helpful pose, for advanced students, try to bring your head to the floor. This is the camel in diamond position.

 Your turtle should eat a balanced diet comprised of fruits, vegetables, and meat. If your turtle is aquatic, its diet should be 65% to 90% meat (e.g. earthworms, snails, mollusks, frozen pinkie mice, dried turtle food/pellets) and 10% to 35% vegetable based (e.g. mustard or collard greens, grated carrots, grapes, mango, cantaloupe). If you have a box turtle, its diet should be 50% meat (crickets, mottled mealworms, slugs, snails) and 50% vegetable based (e.g. berries, green beans, winter squash, flower heads).

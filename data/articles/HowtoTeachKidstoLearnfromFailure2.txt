 Children can naturally develop the ability to learn from failure when you constantly expose them to new things. The more new things they try, they begin to learn that taking risks doesn’t have to end in disaster.Always help your children search for new skills to acquire or new perspectives to consider. Read books. Get acquainted with new cultures.
 You may want to rush and fix every problem your child encounter, but they are much better off when they have the opportunity to try on their own first. Give your child the chance to consider options and think of a solution without your help.


Let's say your child has a fight with a friend. They may ask you how they should handle it. Give them the chance to figure it out for themselves first by saying, “I'll be happy to offer you some advice, but I want you to try to solve this on your own first. What do you think is the best way to make things better?”, When a teacher, coach or parent offers constructive criticism, many children focus solely on the negatives. Help your child learn to weed out the helpful nuggets found in criticism and take positive action towards improving in the given area.


For example, your son comes home and says, “Coach told me I will have to sit out the next game because I’m not working as a part of a team.” You might say, “I know that must be frustrating for you, dear. But let’s try to use his feedback to help you get better. What can you do to become a team player?”Encourage your child to think about why the person might be giving them constructive criticism as well. Seeing that the person may be doing so out of a desire to help them or out of love for them may also help your child to use the feedback in a constructive way.

 Oftentimes, aircraft can look like stars from far away. Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft is not only illegal, it can be extremely dangerous to the pilot of the plane. Even if you are certain that you are pointing at a star, it is best to circle the object with the laser instead of pointing at it., The laser pointer is simply a tool in your toolbox to view the sky. Other people around you may be trying to watch the stars as well and you don’t want to ruin their experience. Once the people you are with know what star to look at, turn the beam off.Use the laser just long enough to identify what you are looking at.
 Although it may seem that the beam of your laser pointer only goes a few hundred feet, it actually does not end. The beam continues to travel even if you can’t see it. High powered beams can cause a distraction for up to 22 miles.When using the laser pointer, always act as though the beam continues to infinity and be aware that it can get close to aircraft and cause problems.
 To avoid accidentally pointing the beam at someone’s eyes, hold the laser pointer over your head with an outstretched arm. Only activate the button for the beam when you are certain that no one is in the line of sight of the beam. Release the button to deactivate the beam before you lower your arm.Remember, never point the beam directly at another person or animal.

 Most butterflies are active only in the sunlight;hence, the chances for them to land on you are likely to be higher if they have enough warmth and light.
,, Butterflies are attracted to salt, something your sweat will definitely bring forth., It's important that you don`t do any sudden or rapid movements that could scare them off. Standing still improves your chances of a butterfly landing on you., Butterflies can be attracted with slices of oranges, bananas and kiwifruit. If you're near a group of butterflies , a slice of orange, for example, will be an irresistible signal for them to come toward you.

Place the slice somewhere near you. When they sit on it, you can take the orange slice gentlyÂ in your palm; the butterfly will not leave it.
Another alternative is to stand still and observe a feeding station quietly. Eventually, a butterfly may land upon you after feeding.
 It is said that what attracts butterflies most are pure souls.

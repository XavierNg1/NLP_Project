 After giving a few quick rescue breaths, assemble your needle. Use a 1” or 1.5” needle, called an IM or intramuscular needle. You can get these at needle exchange programs and pharmacies. Always have these on hand if you carry non-nasal Narcan., Pop the orange top off the vial of liquid Narcan. Insert the needle into the bottle. Pull back on the plunger until the liquid line reaches the 1cc mark.1cc = 1ml = 100U
Injectable Narcan comes in several different sized bottles – a 1cc bottle and a 10cc bottle. Only use 1cc of Narcan, not the whole 10cc’s. Giving too much Narcan too fast can cause the victim severe pain and other health problems.
 Choose a large muscle to inject the Narcan into. The best sites are the thigh, the upper, outer part of the buttock, or the upper arm (deltoid muscle). Generally, choose the outer thigh.

You can inject it through clothing if you need to., Insert the needle into the muscle at a 90° angle. Jab the needle into the muscle at a moderately quick speed. Go straight in and aim for the center of the big muscle. Press the plunger down at a moderate speed until all the Narcan has been injected.If you only have a small needle, inject the Narcan under the skin instead of into the muscle. Pinch a tent of skin in a somewhat fatty area, and insert the smaller needle at a 45° angle to their body.
 As with nasal Narcan, continue to monitor the victim and provide rescue breathing if necessary. Give another dose if there are no changes in 3-5 minutes.

 Punk hairstyles can run the gamut from carefully constructed liberty spikes to dreadlocks. Evaluate how much time you're willing to invest in doing your hair every day, and style accordingly. Browse the internet for some styles that might interest you.
 A mohawk is an iconic punk style. Here's how to make one.


Blow dry hair with a paddle brush. Hang your head upside down, and blast hair with a blow dyer on high heat.
Apply fixative. Rub the necessary amount of gel, glue, gelatin, hair wax or other fixative on your hands. With your head still upside down, put your hands together with your hair in the middle and pull downward to create spikes.
Use a flat iron. Go over your mohawk with a thin flat iron, head still upside down. Move in slow strokes. The gel might sizzle on the heat, but your hair won't actually burn if you keep moving the flat iron.
Apply hairspray. Buy the strongest possible hairspray you can (check the bottle for a "hold" number) and use it liberally on your mohawk. For extra hold, flat iron again, then spray one last time.

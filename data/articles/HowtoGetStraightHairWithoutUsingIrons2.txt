 Towel it dry so that it is still damp, but not dripping wet. If you wish to add straightening serum at this point, use your fingers to smooth it into your hair.
 Leave one section free. This will be the section you dry first.
 Any type of strong-blowing table or box fan will work. Turn the fan on so that it blows air directly toward your head.
 Working in long, straight strokes, brush your hair in front of the fan. Place the brush at the roots of the section of hair and pull it through to the tip, holding it straight for a few moments before allowing the hair to drop.
 Continue in this manner until your hair is completely dry. The process should take about 15 minutes, depending on the length and thickness of your hair.









Don't stop until there is no moisture left in your hair. Even a little dampness will cause the curl to come back.
Pay special attention to your roots, which tend to curl up unless they are completely dry.
 When your hair is completely dry, brush it evenly and use your hands to smooth in a light styling product, or mousse for hold.

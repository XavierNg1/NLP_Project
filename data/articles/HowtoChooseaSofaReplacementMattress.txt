 You can choose between an innerspring mattress, or a foam mattress. A spring mattress can get deformed and uncomfortable when stored inside the body of the sofa; as it just isn’t designed to be folded and stored for long periods of time. On the other hand, a foam sofa mattress has a high resiliency, thanks to its innate ability to form and shape itself into any situation. Once the sofa bed is opened up for use, the foam mattress springs back into its original shape, perfect for sleeping, thus making the foam mattress the better choice for sofas. (In the following look at the steps you need to consider when shopping for a foam sofa mattress.);
, This is a key factor when buying a foam mattress for the sofa, as you will want a replacement mattress that won’t “bottom out” with the weight of the sleepers. Densities between 1.8 and 2.5 pounds per cubic foot have longer lifespans and offer great support.
 A mattress with good IFD will have some ability to absorb shocks, meaning you won’t get bounced around every time someone else moves on the mattress. IFD is also a measure of the mattress's firmness.
 You will want a sofa replacement mattress thick enough to fit your needs, but not too thick or it might not fit your sofa bed mechanism when it’s folded up. Typically, four to five inches thick is perfect.
 Ideally, it should be made of a heavy duty backing fabric and ticking material, compatible with the rest of the mattress. You will want something comfortable and durable.
 You never know what is going to happen, and you don’t want to invest in a new replacement sofa mattress and have to replace it all over again in a short amount of time. A warranty gives you that peace of mind to know you are covered, no matter what small sofa disasters life brings your way.

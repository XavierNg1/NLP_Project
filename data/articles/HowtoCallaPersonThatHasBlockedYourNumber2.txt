 Perhaps the simplest solution is to call this person using a number that they have not blocked. This way, they won't expect that it's you on the other end of the line. If they hang up, they hang up – but you should at least get through the call-block screening. Be aware that this will likely only work once or twice before the person stops answering calls from unknown numbers.


If there are payphones in your area, spend a few coins and make a hard-to-trace call.
Check into a hotel room and make the call from the hotel phone.
Use a school phone or a work phone. Ask to use the landline at a shop or restaurant.
 Explain the situation to a friend, then ask if it's okay to use her personal phone to call this person. Be considerate of your friend's property, and do not use the phone to harass or threaten someone. If you take the situation too far, you may make your friend complicit by using his or her phone.


As with public phones: if you continually use the same friend's phone to call someone who's blocked your number, the call-blocker will probably stop answering calls from that number. He or she may even block your friend's number.
 If the person is going to hang up as soon as they hear your voice, write your friends/relatives a script and get them to talk instead. It helps if the proxy is a mutual friend – someone that the blocker trusts. This might be a good way to say what you need to say without making the blocker feel directly threatened. Make this clear in the beginning of the script.


For example: "Hey, Allie. This is Joe McAdams, calling on behalf of Billy. I just want to pass along a short message, and then I'll let you go about your day. He says; ''. Sorry to bother you!"
You can also use a voice changer to disguise your voice. If the person has blocked your number, however, there's a good chance that there is history here – and that they will quickly identify you.

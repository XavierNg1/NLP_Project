 Many a bibliophile would love nothing more than to have an entire libraryâ€™s worth of old, rare books. Unfortunately, such books are often costly. Before jumping into the world of old, rare book collecting, develop a realistic understanding of your budget and how much you can spend on your new hobby.The amount of money you spend on old, rare books depends on your income. The more spending money you have, the more you will be able to spend on old, rare books.;
, Another restriction on the size of your collection is space. An old, rare book collection can quickly consume all your shelf space. Limit your old, rare book collection only to books that you can adequately store and care for. Sell books that no longer interest you or fit within the scope of your collection., Some collectors of old, rare books will not collect books that have been restored. Others will collect restored books only if they were produced in the postwar era. Like your collection focus, the decision to obtain a book based on its condition and/or restoration status is entirely up to you.Unrestored books are typically favored over books that have been restored., The type of old, rare book that you decide to focus on depends upon your interests and personality. For instance, you could collect books only by a single author.There is no right or wrong way to narrow your collection focus.You might also collect old, rare books on a single topic or books from a single era (for example, botany books from the 19th century).
You could narrow your collection focus by concentrating on an aesthetic element (for instance, you might decide to collect only books illustrated by Edward Gorey).

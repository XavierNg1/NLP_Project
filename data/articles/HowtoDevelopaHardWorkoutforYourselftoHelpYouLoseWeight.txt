 If you try to leap into a difficult workout regimen without any prior experience, you'll likely end up frustrated or injured. Instead, set manageable goals, such as 20 minutes of jogging a day for a week, and increase these the length and difficulty as you become more fit.
 Aerobic exercise will help your body burn fat. Strength training, while beneficial, will cause you to gain weight in muscle and may not reduce your body fat as effectively.
 If you do the same workout each day, you'll quickly get bored. Try different activities, such as swimming, hiking, yoga, or canoeing to keep yourself engaged.
 For example, try to log a certain number of hours or miles each week, and reward yourself with a fun treat, like a foot massage or a day at the beach, when you meet it.
 Instead of comparing your performance to others or to an imaginary ideal, praise yourself for improvements you make.
 A partner can provide encouragement and push you to work harder. Just be sure to do the same for them!

, Know your body and what exercises are best for you. For example, if you have bad knees, you might want to try swimming as an aerobic workout instead of jogging. Pick activities that you enjoy. An example of a workout:



10 minutes warm-up For example, jog or walk briskly.







30 minutes aerobic exercise Jog, run, swim, kayak or bike







10 minutes strength training Push-ups, weightlifting, situps







10 minutes cool down Same as warm-up

 Listerine or a similar mouthwash contains a high percentage of alcohol that will kill live lice and dissolve the nits’ binding to the hair follicle. While some “natural remedy” websites suggest it, be warned that other medical websites do not recommend its use.For one thing, Listerine’s alcohol content can burn the eyes and sting if it comes into contact with open wounds. It could also be accidentally consumed by a child.


If you decide to use Listerine, use it to wet the hair completely and cover with a shower cap for 30 minutes or longer. This will kill the adult lice. Repeat if needed.
You can also put the Listerine on your hair and put a towel on your pillow, to keep it from getting wet, and go to sleep and do the remaining steps in the morning.
 After soaking your hair, flush the Listerine out thoroughly with warm water and apply a generous amount of vinegar to further loosen the nits.Following the above steps, apply a leave-in conditioner or de-tangler, brush the hair, and then use a nit comb to slowly remove the eggs section by section.
 Clean the nit comb in a dish of soapy water or in the heat of a dishwasher. Also put the Listerine into a spray bottle and spray your nearby furniture. This will kill the adults and help to prevent re-infestation.


You can wash any linens, towels, or bedding in hot water. Remember that sustained heat will kill lice and nits.

 There are 2 ways to do this:


Scroll up and down and/or left to right until you find the box with the name of the person whose sibling you want to add.
Type the first few letters of the name of the person you want to find in the search box in the upper right corner of your screen. Ancestry will automatically provide a drop-down menu of individuals with names that match the letters you provided. Use your mouse or arrow keys to select the person whose sibling you want to add.
, You will see the parents listed first, and then the spouse and children. Under the last child listed, you'll see a gray button that says, "Add a Family Member."

, You will see the profile page dim, and a dialog box will appear that says, "Which family member would you like to add?"

, You will see a new dialog box.



Click the "Select someone already in your tree" link at the top of the dialog box if you are attaching someone who is already in your family tree. Scroll down to find and select the person you wish to attach as a sibling.
Add a new person to your family tree. If you are adding a new person to your tree as a sibling, enter the first and middle name, last name, gender, place and date of birth, and place and date of death in the appropriate boxes. If you don't have information for a particular box, leave it blank.

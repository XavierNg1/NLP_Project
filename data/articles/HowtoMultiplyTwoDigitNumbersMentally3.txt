 You will be halving the even number.Remember that an even number is one that is divisible by 2. If both factors are even, choose the smaller number to halve.

For example, if you are multiplying 15×32{\displaystyle 15\times 32}, you would halve the 32, since it is an even number.
 To do this, divide by 2. If you know your math facts well, you should be able to do this easily.

For example, 322=16{\displaystyle {\frac {32}{2}}=16}.
 To double a number, multiply it by 2.

For example, 15×2=30{\displaystyle 15\times 2=30}.
 The new problem is the result of halving one of the factors and doubling the other.

For example, 15×32=30×16{\displaystyle 15\times 32=30\times 16}.
 Make sure you always halve the same number, and double the same number. The amount of times you halve and double should be same for both factors.For example:15×32{\displaystyle 15\times 32}=30×16{\displaystyle =30\times 16}=60×8{\displaystyle =60\times 8}=480{\displaystyle =480}

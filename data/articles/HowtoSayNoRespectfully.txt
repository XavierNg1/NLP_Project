 Do not interrupt the speaker.;
, Don't raise your voice or become upset, simply say that you cannot help this time. When you say no, say it in a confident, well modulated voice to sound more straightforward.
 For instance, say "I can, but my schedule is booked now. How about some other time?" You don't have to explain further. This deflects any resentment they might have towards your schedule.
, You have your reasons and they may not be ones you wish to discuss. If this is the case, try saying something like, "I'm just not able to." Leave it at that - if you must, change the subject, or say, "I'm sorry, but I need to go."

, If the case really is one that you feel okay explaining, make your explanation as simple as possible.
 If the requester does not want to accept your answer, tell him or her that your mind is made up and that you will not change it.

 The padding on a dogs feet is just the same as an average human's feet, if the ground is too hot for you then it is too hot for the dog and can damage their paws. If you do walk your dog, walk them in the morning or the afternoon where the pavement should be+ cooler., This will protect your dogs paws from the hot pavement and is recommended when going on long outings. Slowly introduce the boots to your dog using positive reinforcement and treats to make sure they are comfortable with them.

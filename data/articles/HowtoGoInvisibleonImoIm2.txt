When you block someone with the Windows app, you must first remove them as a contact. This means that when you add them back, they’ll be notified. If you just want to be invisible to someone temporarily without them knowing, use the Mobile method instead.
,,,, You’ll see a message at the top of the screen that says “This person is not in your contacts.”

, This person can no longer see when you are online.


When you’re ready to allow the person to see you online, Click the imo menu at the top left corner of the screen and select Blocked Users. Then, click Unblock next to the person’s name.
You’ll have to repeat this method for everyone you want to block/unblock.

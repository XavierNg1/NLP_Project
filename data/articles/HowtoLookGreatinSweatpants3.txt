 They should be tapered from the knee down, but loose around the crotch and thighs.You should not be able to see the outline of your pockets (or anything else).


The cuff should hit just above the shoe, never pool around your it.
Buy pants with an elastic cuff so you can bunch them up a little and show of your shoes.
 An ultra-soft cotton will feel amazing and can look great, but you can also find sweatpants in lightweight leather, twill, or khaki. Black, white, or gray are the most versatile (the right pair of black or white sweats could be mistaken for trousers or slim jeans), but you might want to try a kelly green or blue to mix things up.


Look for details like moto seams, belt loops, colored cuffs--these details will help separate your pants from looking like sloppy sweatpants.

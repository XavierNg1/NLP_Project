 Purchase evergreen trimmings or clip them from trees and shrubs in your own yard. If you’re gathering your own materials, fill a shopping bag with three- to six-inch cuttings. If you’re purchasing materials, look for cuttings at local garden centers or nurseries, and ask which ones will hold up well indoors.Examples of plants you can collect trimmings from are spruce and holly. If you have outdoor plants that already need trimming, like boxwood or arborvitae, you can upcycle their trimmings!;
, You can use short, sturdy decorative vases if they are able to hold water. Otherwise, place vessels of water inside of larger decorative bowls, pots or pedestals.For example, place tumbler glasses inside of pots, or nestle small vases into the centers of ornament-filled bowls. Be creative! Use items you already have or buy containers to suit your tastes.
 Get foam blocks that are about as long as you want each tree to be tall. You may want to cut them down to size, into one rectangular block per tree. Saturate the foam completely. Trim each one with a knife, from a rectangle shape into a cone shape. Keep the tops of the blocks flat.The foam won’t show, so don’t worry about making the shape perfect.
 Start at the bottom and put the longest pieces in first. Continue all the way up, choosing smaller pieces as you get higher on the trees. Put one or a few plant pieces at the very tops.Keep scissors or wire cutters on hand and trim “branches” down wherever needed as you’re arranging.
Fill in any gaps until the floral foam is fully concealed.
 You can brighten up your trees with artificial berry branches, strings of brightly-colored or metallic beads, and light-weight ornaments. Another idea is to add small bows and/or miniature candy canes.
 Check the floral foam every couple of days. Stick your finger in between the trimmings to feel the foam. If it isn’t moist, add a little water to the foam.Plan to water your trees every other day.

Limit a six-year-old to 30-45 minutes per day to play on your device, as well as video games and other electronics., Make sure that your child cannot make purchases while using your device. You will need to set passwords for app stores. Keep the password a secret., While games can be fun, distracting and educational, you will want to know exactly what is involved before you allow your child to use it. Research the game and play it yourself to get the best exposure to the entire process.

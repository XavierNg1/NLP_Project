 This can be done by clicking the "Info" tab of your profile, and then hitting edit in the right corner (see picture). It can also be accessed by clicking "Edit My Profile" under your name on the home page.
 Beside each of piece information, you will see a drop down menu. You can decide which groups of people will see which information by clicking the menu and selecting the desired option.


This can differ for each post. For example, you can set your work place visible to the public, but only allow your friends to see where you went to college.
Toggle between different sections of your profile by clicking the options on the left hand side of the page.

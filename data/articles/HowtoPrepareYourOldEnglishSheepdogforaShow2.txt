 Look around to find a breeder. The best places to spot one are in Dog Fancy classifieds, Dog World classifieds, AKC Gazette, or www.akc.org where you can find the breeder classifieds. Also, a GREAT place to spot your breeder is at your local kennel club's dog show. Internet listings are not the best, as many of the dogs come from puppy mills. Also, NEVER buy your dog from a pet store, as they always come from puppy mills with multitudes of health problems. Find a breeder that specializes in the area you would like to specialize in, whether it is herding, agility, obedience, or conformation.;
, This is the MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF BREEDING- DO NOT BUY FROM ANYONE WHO DOES NOT PERFORM HEALTH SCANS ON THEIR DOGS! You should do this also when breeding your future dogs.

 It's good to be smelling and feeling fresh everyday. Make sure you use products that make you feel comfortable and fresh.;
, Deodorant is an amazing product to make you feel as if you're fresh! You can also use deodorant on your feet, chest, and on your lower back for extra protection.
 Nobody likes bad breath and yellow teeth. Instead, try to brush yours at least two times a day! Use mouth wash to kill the germs that cause bad breath.
 Only 5% of people in the world spray their neck with perfume. The reason you should do this is because it freshens up your neck, especially in the summer, because you will sweat back there a lot. Also, to smell even better, spray your inner wrists, behind your knees, your inner elbows, ankles, and chest.
 A little lip gloss and mascara go a long way! If you really want to wear a lot of make-up then try cream blushes, light eye shadows, and pressed powder to set your make-up.
 Brushing your hair will make your hair feel nice and soft. Styling your hair will bring pops of expression! If you don't have a lot of hair to experiment with, that's okay. Just make sure you have it looking nice every day.
 New things don't have to be expensive! Try going to K-Mart or Target for the better looks and deals!

, You need people to see that you have enough confidence for anything. All your cleanliness will be for nothing if you aren't sure of yourself.

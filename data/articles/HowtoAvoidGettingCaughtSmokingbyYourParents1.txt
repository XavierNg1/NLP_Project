 This should be the most obvious rule! If your parents smoke, however, it is easier to get away with it. But if you smoke a cigarette in a non-smoking house, it will take days and lots of air freshener to get rid of the smell. Just don't do it!


However, if your house has a patio, you can go outside and smoke when your parents are not around. (Make sure any ash in the area is cleaned up if no one else in the family smokes.) If you have to, light a citronella candle to help mask the odor. Otherwise, avoid smoking anywhere near the house. The wood and brick will absorb the odor. BTW: while you are at it, try to not to get caught by your nosey neighbors.

, Don't do it. Use common sense. The best thing to do is to have them on you (inside a pocket or something) all of the time. Do this with your matches as well.


If you are going to school and you still have your cigarettes with you, it is a good idea to hide them in your waistband so if you get searched, most schools are not allowed to look in that general area.
 Don't be careless. Get rid of empty packs of smokes and matches. Get rid of ashes by washing them down the sink.

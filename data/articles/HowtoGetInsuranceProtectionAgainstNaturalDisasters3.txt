 Unlike deposits in a bank, the premiums you pay to an insurer aren’t guaranteed by any federal agency. If an insurer fails, you lose your money. While it isn’t likely a house fire would be the event causing an insurer to go bankrupt, a natural disaster can bankrupt an insurer on shaky financial footing. Therefore, it’s critically important that you investigate the financial stability of an insurer before you purchase a policy.You can find the financial strength on an insurer through one of the financial ratings firms. The strength of a firm is evaluated on a scale of AAA to D, with AAA being the best and D the worst. Some of the more well-known financial ratings services include Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch IBCA.
 U.S. state insurance commissioners will have records of complaints, licenses, and whether or not the insurer is covered by the state in case of default.Some state insurance commissions also keep records of the insurer’s loss ratio. The loss ratio describes the proportion of premiums spent in payouts. Anything less than 50% in payouts is suspicious—the insurer either overcharges or underpays.
 It never hurts to ask if you can get a discount on the premium price. While adjusting deductibles and making modifications to your house are likely to be the principle ways to receive a discount, there are a couple other ways to get your rates down.If you use the same insurer for multiple policies, like auto, homeowner’s and others, you’ll likely be eligible for a discounted rate. You can also ask the insurer if they issue discount to your employer.

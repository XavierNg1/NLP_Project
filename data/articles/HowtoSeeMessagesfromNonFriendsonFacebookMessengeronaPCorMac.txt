, It’s on the left side of the screen, right below “News Feed.” This opens the Facebook Messenger screen.


Another way to get to Messenger is to point your browser to https://www.messenger.com.
 It’s the gear at the top-left corner of the Messenger screen.
 Now you’ll see the list of messages you’ve received from people you’re not connected with on Facebook.
 The sender will not know you’ve read the message unless you click the Accept button at the bottom of the message.


Click Ignore at the bottom of the message to archive it without the sender ever knowing you’ve read it.
Click See Filtered Requests (beneath the list of message requests) to view messages Facebook thinks you don't want to see (including spam and possible scams).

 You can schedule an appointment to file for disability over the phone or in person at the nearest SSA office.


Call the SSA appointment line at 1-800-772-1213 in as far in advance as possible; as your appointment may need to be scheduled weeks or months later depending on the activity levels of your local SSA offices.



Gather or bring the medical and personal documentation you compiled earlier prior to the application process. You will need to provide the SSA office or telephone representative with your information so it can be entered into the application.
If you filed for disability over the phone, the SSA will provide you with instructions on how to deliver or send your medical and personal documentation to the nearest SSA office.

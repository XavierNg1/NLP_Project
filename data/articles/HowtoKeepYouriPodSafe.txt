 When you buy your iPod or receive one, make sure you buy the protective stickers. These can be easily stuck on and not only protect your iPod from scratches and falls, but they even protect it from water. Leaving an iPod outside in the rain with no protective layer will probably result in it shorting out, whereas an iPod left in the rain with protective stickers has more chance of surviving. There are also slip on covers you can buy, which protect the iPod very well. They come in all sizes and colors, and can be easily changed. Protective stickers and covers are essential. You can also by a small case or iPod sock to put your iPod in.;
, Leaving your iPod outside on the garden table while you put out the washing may seem like a good idea at the time, but when the rain is pounding heavily on your ceiling and you realize you left your iPod outside, it won't. So always keep your iPod close to you, where you can't forget it and where it can't be damaged. Don't leave it outside or near water or near a kitchen appliance.
 Obviously you wouldn't clean it with soap and water, or anything else. There are special cleaning wipes available from shops like Myer and other big department or electronic stores. Lint free cloths will work best. Make sure you use the wipes properly. Clean your iPod about once a month. It might not seem important to do this, but iPods can get clogged up with dirt.
 Yes, it's not the iPod itself, but it's also important to take care of your headphones. Never turn the iPod up on full volume, for it can seriously damage them.
 There are iPod viruses that will crash your iPod and delete boot or root files that your iPod depends on. Also if you have a virus on your computer it can be transferred to the iPod and either go to any other computers you use it with or harm your iPod.
 Don't try to trick your iPod by using emulators. A lot of emulators are viruses that can crash your iPod and void your warranty.

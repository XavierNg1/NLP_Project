 If someone is being a bully to show their friends how "cool" they are try not to cry or hide from the person. Laugh it off, make a joke about it, or tell the person they are "really funny". Crying or making a big deal only makes them insult you more.;
, If they confront you, and they probably will, when they say "Hey, freak!" or "Look, it's the dork!" pretend like you didn't hear them. Say "Hi, how are you?" and just keep walking. If they try to follow you and continue to call names turn around and ask, "Can I help you?". Commonly they will respond with something like rolling their eyes and calling you stupid or something else hurtful. If this happens just say, "Look, I would love to chat but I have to go now, I promised Mr.(teacher) I would help him early today.
 Try to be nice to them and act normal. Maybe if they are being nicer ask them why they are being so disrespectful to them often. Sometimes making friends within the group of bullies can help because the person won't feel very good making fun of you if you are friends.
 If none of the steps above worked, go right up to the person(people) and tell them something like, "You know, you don't have to make fun of me just because you wished you were as cool as me" or "It's really childish that you do this everyday, you try to act all grown up, but what kind of adult would do this?". Also something that phases them is "So, do you have a problem with people who don't need to be popular to survive? Is there something wrong with people who don't wear clothes like everyone else?".

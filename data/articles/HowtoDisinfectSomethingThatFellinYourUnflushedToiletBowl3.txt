 Run down to your local pharmacy or supermarket and pick up a bottle of isopropyl alcohol and a package of cotton balls. Isopropyl alcohol, also known as a rubbing alcohol, is a great way to sterilize objects like cell phones, remote controls and other electronics that you can’t afford to get wet (or wetter).Choose an alcohol with a high purity (60-90% or higher) that is free of additives or fragrances.
A small bottle of rubbing alcohol only costs a few dollars, but is useful for innumerable cleaning tasks.
 Remove the cap from the bottle of rubbing alcohol. Take a cotton ball and dip it into the alcohol, letting it soak into the fibers throughout. Shake the cotton ball a couple times to remove excess alcohol, then press it firmly against a clean cloth or the palm of your hand.You don’t want the cotton ball to be too wet, or alcohol could leak out and find its way into the sensitive openings of a phone, watch or pair of earbuds.
This method of sterilization has long been used in medicine and is proven to be effective., Use the alcohol-soaked cotton ball to swab whatever it was that was claimed by the latrine. Disinfecting with a damp cotton ball makes it possible to eradicate bacteria from the outer surface of the item without the risk of exposing delicate parts to any more unnecessary moisture. After you’re finished, pat the item with a clean towel to wick up any standing alcohol residue and let it air dry.Rubbing alcohol evaporates very quickly and doesn’t form a residue.

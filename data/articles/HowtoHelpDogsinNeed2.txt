 An excellent way to find a dog a good home is to foster it in the meantime. Foster owners or families provide dogs with a temporary home, food, water, socialization, basic grooming, and exercise until it is ready for a forever home. Foster animals are typically sick, injured, or juvenile, so instructions provided by the shelter for its care must be followed precisely. Call the ASPCA, Humane Society, or a local shelter to inquire about their foster programs, or apply online to foster a pet.For example, the ASPCA in New York accepts serious fostering candidates over 21 years of age, provides training, and eventually finds homes for the animals being fostered., If you are ready to accept a new pet into your home, adopting a dog in need is the most personal way to help. Visit your local shelter to get to know adoptable dogs, or look online for listings of available dogs in your area. Visit http://www.aspca.org/adopt-pet/adoptable-dogs-your-local-shelter to search by state, and by sex and breed of dogs.


Other popular websites, such as petfinder.com, provide listings of adoptable pets from reputable adoption groups.
 To hold an adoption drive, approach one or more local shelters or rescue groups and see how many adoptable dogs you will be dealing with. Pick a date and time, find a venue, plan a budget, and purchase necessary supplies (e.g. folding tables and chairs, trash bags and trash cans, cleaning supplies). Ask local business owners for contributions to the event, ask the rescue organizations for flyers or advertising templates, and share the event with the public on social media.Recruit volunteers for the event through social media, word of mouth, flyers, and by contacting large organizations (e.g. church groups, volunteer organizations, schools).

, When you first open Word, you will be presented with a variety of template options and special formatting. For the purpose of this tutorial, though, choose the "blank document" option.
 In the upper-left corner of the window, click on the File tab. This will open up a dropdown menu on the left side of the window with a few different choices.
 Find and click on the Open option. It should be one of the first choices listed for you. This should open up an additional menu, listing sources from which you can open a document.
 If the PDF file is on your computer, click Computer. If the PDF file is on a flashdrive or other external drive, click on that drive.
 Find and open the correct PDF file from its location on your computer.
 After opening a PDF, you will be notified that the process may take a while to complete. Depending on the size of the PDF file and the number of graphics in the File, the process will take longer.


Be aware that if you do have a large number of graphics, there is a chance that Word will not be able to properly format the document. It will still open, but may not look identical.
 If you downloaded the file from the web, you may be notified that editing is not enabled. This is a security measure that Word takes to prevent your computer from being infected by a virus.


If you trust the source, click File in the upper-left corner of the window, then click on "Enable Editing" from inside the yellow box.
 You can start editing the document just like you would any other Word document.
 Use the arrows on the left and right side of the window to navigate through pages, or scroll just like usual.

 Finding a job is often about networking and nursing programs often work to help place their students in positions upon graduation. Talk to your program director or visit your school’s career center to learn more.
 Network locally and at the state level. Join an organization like the Arizona Nurses Association and attend events they sponsor. This will give you an opportunity to network with nurses and health care professionals across Arizona.
 Each job you apply to may have different requirements, but most will require a cover letter, resume, and copy of your transcripts. You will also be required to verify your current license.
 Utilize your local networks and conduct online searches for jobs in both the private and public sectors. Send out applications to multiple positions, even if they’re not a perfect fit for you. Chances are your first job won’t be your dream job and that’s okay! It also might take a while to land a job, but keep applying. Persistence pays off.

 For a thicker smoothie, use a frozen banana. If you don't have a blender, you can use a food processor fitted with metal blades instead.
 For a sweeter smoothie, use vanilla yogurt. For a less sweet smoothie, use plain yogurt. You can also omit the milk and use more yogurt for an even thicker smoothie.
 The cinnamon will add a hint of spice and flavor to the smoothie, while the honey will add a touch of sweetness. The peanut butter will add some extra protein. If you are using peanut butter, be sure to use the smooth kind; it will be much easier to blend than the chunky kind.


If you like your smoothies extra cold and thick, add some ice cubes.
 Occasionally, pause the blender and push the ingredients down the walls of the blender. This will ensure that everything gets evenly mixed and that no lumps remain.
 You can enjoy it as it is, or you can garnish it with a sprinkle of oatmeal, a dash of cinnamon, or a drizzle of honey.

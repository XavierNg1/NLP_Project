 Remember, she is and will be in charge of some of the most important fronts in your life. It would not do to have it any otherwise.;
, It is equally important to be able to actually love her for being all that she is unto you. You, her husband, are no more of an individual (nor no less, as well) than her. This means that you cannot give either more or less importance to your own individuality than you would give to hers. If you have been doing so without realizing it, now is always the time to stop. If she is given to servility, it becomes your duty automatically to point it out to her and ask her to stop being servile.
 When you happen to doubt her integrity, as will happen between any two persons staying together in any given environment for a time, it is most important that you have a heart-to-heart talk with her on the matter and sort things out at the earliest.
 While she might make sacrifices, in an effort to 'adjust,' it is up to you to ensure that she makes none that you do not share in or know of. If you only know of any sacrifices she has made, it is up to you to reciprocate and make it worth her effort. How you do it is entirely up to you, but do it you must.
 If you are the provider in the family, you must, naturally, 'provide'. It is your primary duty and is no obligation to those for whom you provide.
 The above tenets are by no means the only ones that can be followed. However, they are inserted here with some calculations that will translate into a highly satisfactory married life if taken seriously and lived up to.

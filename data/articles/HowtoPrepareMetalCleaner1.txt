 These are available in most supermarket aisles. Look for a cleaner that says it has a PH-balanced cleanser, meaning it is not alkaline or acidic and will not damage what it cleans. These cleansers should be mixed in cold or lukewarm water, as hot water can disperse the chemical agents. When you clean some types of metal, you will need to finish by cleaning it with a neutral cleanser that will wipe away chemicals.
 This will rid it of any dust or grime before removing the tarnish made up of silver sulfide. Rinse the silver with water.
 The size of the pot depends upon the size of the silver you are cleaning. Use a small saucepan for jewelry or a large pot for silverware or larger fittings. Pour enough water in to cover your piece of silver.
 If you are using a small saucepan, 1 to 2 tbsp. (13 to 26 g) should suffice. Bring the water to a boil.
 Add the tarnished silver with tongs. Wait 3 to 5 minutes. You should see the aluminum foil start to turn black. Sulfide is more attracted to the foil and will transfer with the help of baking soda.
 Remove the silver, rinse with water and polish with a soft cloth.

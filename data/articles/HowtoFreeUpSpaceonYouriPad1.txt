 Go to Settings ––> General ––> Usage ––> Storage. There you will see how much storage is left, giving you an idea of how much storage you would like to restore. Once you know this amount, you can decide how to free up the space, either by deleting some apps or music, and so forth, or a combination.


You'll be able to see which apps are using up the most space and these are most often videos, photos and music.
 It's a good idea to use this opportunity to back up the iPad, just in case something is lost that you didn't want to lose. This isn't absolutely essential if you're just removing a few things but it's vital if you're doing a clean install.

 This is the most basic step you can take towards ensuring the cohesiveness of your furniture's wood colors. Sofas, armchairs, and coffee tables, for instance, could all feature mid-toned wood, while lighter or darker wood tones are incorporated through small accessories like picture frames and lamps.;
, Of course, you won't want to use a single tone of wood for the major pieces of furniture throughout your entire home. For instance, you may have 2 adjoining rooms, the first featuring beech furniture and the other featuring cherry furniture. To blend these 2 wood tones together, add accessories in each room that feature the wood tone prominent in the other room.
 If you do choose to use different wood tones for major pieces of furniture, try to spread them out through the room. Placing dark tones on 1 side of the room and placing lighter tones on the other will lead to an unappealing imbalance. The darker side of the room will feel "heavier."

, Consider the following design challenge: all of the wood furniture in your living room is dark mahogany, but the credenza that you're longing to buy is only available in a light and airy beech. To tie the credenza's look into the room, you can use a piece of furniture (like an ottoman or accent chair) that is upholstered in a warm yellowish brown that mimics the credenza's hue.
 As a general rule, mixing a lot of different wood tones will look messy and chaotic if you also have a widely varied color scheme. Therefore, if you have lots of different colored upholstery and d√©cor in a room, stick to a limited palette of wood tones. If you want to mix lots of different woods, try to keep your color palette subdued.
 There are certain situations in which contrasting wood tones are vital to successful design execution. For example, placing a pine dining table on pine flooring may lead the table's appearance to "wash out." In this case, contrasting a different wood with the flooring will make a more assertive, composed statement.

 The regular Biore packs have only the nose strips, which are not meant to be used on any other part of the face. You will need this pack so that you can use the non-nose strips on your chin, cheeks, or forehead., Consider using an exfoliating cleanser, as this will help get rid of any surface dirt and the worst of the blackheads.
 This will help open up the pores, making the blackheads easier to remove.
 Make sure that your hands are dry, or you will activate the adhesive too soon.
 This will make it easier to mold against your chin, cheeks, or forehead.
 Remember which side the backing was on, as this will be the side that's going to be pressed against your skin.
 Smooth the strip down against your skin, making sure to get rid of any air bubbles or wrinkles. If the strip is not sticking very well, dampen your fingers a little, and try to smooth it down.


Avoid placing the strip too close to your eyes. The skin in that area is too sensitive and fragile for these strips.
 During this time, the strip will harden, like paper mach√©. Try not to move your face too much, or the Biore strip may start to peel off. For example, if you are wearing the strip on your forehead, try not to raise your eyebrows too much.
 Once the strip is hard, grip one of the corners and carefully lift it away from your skin. Avoid tearing or ripping it off; not only will this hurt, but the strip won't grab as many blackheads.


If you put the strip on your forehead, start peeling from both sides and work your way towards the middle.
 The Biore strip would have pulled away all the blackheads, but it may have left behind some sticky residue. Cool water and facial cleanser will get rid of that. Avoid using hot or warm water, as you may irritate the skin.

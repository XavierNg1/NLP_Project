 For the kid inside of you that loves marshmallows more than it loves booze, this drink is a keeper. Chocolately, velvety, and decadent.
 Blandly-named but beautifully-conceived, a blue martini combines gin and blue Curaçao instead of the traditional vermouth. For the fun-loving and slightly cantankerous.
 Not "manly" martini but not "girly" martini either, this half-breed resists characterization. Earthy, deep, well-rounded — an enigma in a glass.
 Pomegranate juice, the major component of grenadine, contributes to this martini's essential charm. Pink and lively, slightly acidic but positively fresh.
 Like a whirlwind of coffee, chocolate, and whipped cream, this drink satisfies more than an outsized craving. For anyone who's ever wished that the classic Italian dessert was pure — not partly — booze.

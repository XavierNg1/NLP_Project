Removing yourself from the family will make it so that your account activity is no longer governed by Microsoft Family settings. If you are a youth using a family computer, know that this will send a message to your parents or whoever controls the computer.
You can also remove any other accounts that shouldn’t be governed by the family filter.
 Now that you’ve removed yourself from the Family settings, you can disable Restricted Mode.
 With any video open (restricted or not), scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the button that says “Restricted Mode.” Click the bubble next to “Off” and then click “Save.”

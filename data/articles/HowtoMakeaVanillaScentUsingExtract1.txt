 Organic vanilla extract has a potent vanilla scent, and most people use it for cooking and baking, among other things.If you don't already have a bottle of vanilla extract in your pantry, then you can purchase a small bottle at your local grocery store.


Any size will work, but if you plan on using a lot of fragrance, the bigger bottle will come in handy.;
, Once you're home, you can unwrap the bottle of vanilla extract, being sure to take off the protective wrapper underneath the lid. Replace the lid and put your finger on the opening, completely covering it, and turn the bottle upside down. Flip the bottle upright again and you should have a dab of vanilla on your finger.


Be careful not to spill! Vanilla extract pours a very thin liquid, so it's easy to waste if you tip it or pour too much.
 Most perfume hot-spots are the wrists, neck and under your ears. Put a dab or drop of vanilla extract on both wrists and the sides of your neck, or wherever you desire.


If your skin has a reaction to the vanilla, it could be that you're using a non-organic or synthetic vanilla with added ingredients.Stop using the product, or try using smaller amounts on different areas of the skin.
 Using vanilla extract as perfume is a good quick-fix, but it doesn't last long. You'll have to re-apply frequently in order to keep the vanilla scent strong.

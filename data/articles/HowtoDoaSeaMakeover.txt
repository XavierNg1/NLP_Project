 Take a curling wand (1/1.5 inches) and wrap your hair around it loosely. Make sure to leave one inch towards the bottom uncurled as it creates a beachy sort of effect, which is what you're going for. Once you're finished, spray a salt spray through your hair. If you don't have one, fill an empty spray bottle with water and put two or three tablespoons of salt in it. Shake it well.;
, Try to match it to your skin toneÂ  as much as possible, and if you can, make sure it's waterproof. Blend it into your skin with a foundation or stippling brush. To cover up blemishes or dark circles, use stick concealer.
 Apply an eye primer such as Urban Decay Primer Potion or Too-Faced Shadow Insurance all over the lid and up to the brow bone. This will ensure that your eyeshadow stays on longer and it makes it look better, too.
 Apply a teal eye shadow on the outer half of the crease.
 This will make your eyes pop and works with any color of eyes and eyeshadow.
 You can use a pencil liner or a liquid liner, but liquid liners can be messy and can ruin your makeup. Make sure you wing out your eyeliner so it looks like a wave in the sea.
 Don't put too much, though - you don't want to look overdone.
 Go from the apples of your face and blend outwards toward your ears. Don't look like a clown, dust it very lightly.
, You could also try blue jeans with a white belt and a crop-top, high-waisted shorts and an old blue shirt, or a white or blue polo shirt with a flowy skirt and beach sandals., Try a sand necklace, or a blue bracelet, fish earrings or a hairclip with shells in it. Don't be tacky, but don't wear anything too expensive either - the point is to wear nice jewelry, but if it got lost in the sea it wouldn't be a big deal., Have fun going to the beach!

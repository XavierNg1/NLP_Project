 Different courts will handle bail in different ways. While a lot of courts will allow you to hire a bondsman or post cash bail yourself, other courts do things differently. For example, Some courts will allow you to post a percentage bond, which requires you to pay around 10% of the full bond amount. Other courts will allow you to post real estate as collateral for your release. In this case, you will offer your property as collateral, and if you fail to show up for court, the court may take your property from you.In a few courts, you can submit a written promise to appear in court. If you break this promise, the court will charge you the full amount of bail. If you appear for all of your court appearances, you ill not have to pay anything. This is called an unsecured bond., Your bail contains a set of “conditions,” i.e., things you must do. These conditions are set by the court, but they can also be set by contract with the bondsman.You should read your contract closely so that you understand all of the conditions. Common conditions include:undergoing drug or alcohol treatment programs
continuing with school or a job
reporting regularly to the bail bondsman

, If you get released on bail a second time, then you have to pay the fee for the second bond. For example, if your first bail bond was $20,000, then you probably paid $2,000. If your second bond is $20,000, then you will have to pay an additional $2,000.


The fee you paid for your revoked bond will not be refunded to you.For this reason, you might want to try and get the original bond reinstated, which could save you money.
 You might not be able to afford the bond fee on your own. In this situation, you will need someone to cosign for you. This person is responsible for helping the bond agent find you if you miss a court hearing, and the cosigner is also financially responsible on the bond contract.

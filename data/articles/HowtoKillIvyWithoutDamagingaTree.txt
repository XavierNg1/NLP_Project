 If there are, do not even consider spraying as the tree will take up any poisons you spray. If there are none, and the tree has brown bark, spray glyphosate on the ivy that sits on the tree trunk., The lapse in time permits the glyphosate action to work on the entire ivy. Cut the vines as close to the ground as possible and cut out a section to prevent rebonding. Brush the glyphosate directly onto the cuts.
 Be aware that this will take around 1 - 2 years for the stems above the cut. Trying to remove the ivy will cause a lot of dust inhalation, and can damage the tree if the ivy has clung to it for quite a while. Over time the dead ivy will wither off. Overall natural rotting of the ivy can take 3 - 10 years., If the ivy sprouts up again anywhere, deal with it immediately by pulling it off.

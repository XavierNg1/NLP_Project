 At the bottom, you should see something that says 'You can useÂ this link to remove your signature'. Click on the underlined words, 'this link'., You should come to a page on Care2, asking you if you're sure you want to remove your signature. Below, you will see a box beside the date and time you signed the petition, as well as your Care2 username.,

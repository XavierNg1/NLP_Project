Find the 'fluidindex' folder that contains the credits.tpl and index.php. Transfer that folder into the styles folder.

public_html/wiki/templates/styles/fluidindex/credits.tpl
public_html/wiki/templates/styles/fluidindex/index.php


Put the *.css file in the Styles folder.

public_html/wiki/styles/fluidindex.css


Copy over the Options folder. Where you find the 'fluidindex.css' file, there is a folder. Copy it into the Styles folder.

public_html/wiki/styles/fluidindex/*.*



,, Under the Themes tab, there is a Theme option. Click on that. Your new theme should be in there.

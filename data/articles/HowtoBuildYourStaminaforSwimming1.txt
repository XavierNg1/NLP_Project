 Set up a training schedule that allows you to practice and improve every day. Commit to swimming at a certain time each week so you get into a habit and your muscles won't weaken in-between lapses.


Swim often, at least 2-3 times a week. Vary your swimming sessions with cross-training sessions in between so you have a chance to strengthen other muscles, too.;
, Don't just practice freestyle the entire time: incorporate many kinds of strokes into your sets. Different strokes work different muscles, and your endurance is only as strong as your weakest muscles.


If you're new to swimming, practice a stroke for three or four laps (or until you've got the hang of it). Some great strokes to start with are: freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and and the butterfly stroke.

Slowly increase the amount of time you spend on a certain stroke. Try to hold a certain stroke for 1-2 minutes longer each time until you build greater endurance.
 When you want to focus on strength, make a fist with your hand instead of cupping it or holding it out flat while you swim. The momentum your hands make will diminish, and your arms will have to work more to stay afloat. This will strengthen your forearms and increase your workout threshold.Do closed-fist swimming at the beginning of your workout rather than the end. Swimming with fists is tiring, and you may be too fatigued if you save it for your last sets.
 If you have a powerful kick, you'll greatly increase your swimming strength. Swim with your kickboard for a set number of laps so you can focus entirely on increasing leg endurance. Practice different kinds of kicks like butterfly kicks, back kicks, and side kicks.Plan to use a kickboard near the end of your workout, when your arms will be more tired and need rest.

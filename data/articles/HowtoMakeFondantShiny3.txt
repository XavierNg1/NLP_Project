If you don't have vodka, clear grain alcohols may also work. Avoid using tinted alcohols, though, since the color will bleed onto the fondant.
Use a clean spray bottle that has never held hair products or other chemicals to avoid accidental contamination. Salon-quality spray bottles are better than cheap bottles since cheap bottles may spray unevenly. Note than an airbrush could also work.
 Hold the nozzle about 4 inches (10 cm) away from the surface of the fondant. Lightly and evenly spray the alcohol over the fondant.


Only spray a light mist of alcohol onto the fondant. Using too much can cause puddles to form and may dry out the fondant to a damaging degree.
 Wait several hours for the alcohol to completely dry. After it dries, the fondant should have a soft glossy finish.


The gloss should be semi-permanent. It may fade after several days, but you should avoid re-applying the alcohol since too much can quickly dry out the fondant.

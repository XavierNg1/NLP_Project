 Select the application from the Start Menu or your Finder. Once it has opened, locate the picture that you wish to view.
 In order to zoom in on the exact location you wish to view, you should make sure that the picture is centered on your screen.
 Go to the "View" tab in the tool bar. From here you will see two magnifying glasses, one with a plus inside it and another with a negative. To zoom in, click on the magnifying glass with the plus sign. To zoom out, click on the magnifying glass with the negative sign.

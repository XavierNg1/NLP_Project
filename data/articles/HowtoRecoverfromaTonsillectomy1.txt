 After the tonsillectomy, you may feel groggy and in pain. Prepare for your recovery by arranging a ride home from the hospital after the surgery. Ask a friend, family member, or roommate to pick you up. You can then head right home to recovery fully from the tonsillectomy.
 Stay hydrated by having lots of water after the operation. Have eight to ten glasses of lukewarm or cool, filtered water. Keep a glass of water by your bed or couch and carry a water bottle with you if you are moving around your house.Avoid hot liquids such as hot chocolate, coffee, or tea for the first week. Hot liquids can irritate your throat.
 Bland foods that are soft and easy to swallow are the best options post-surgery. Have applesauce, vegetable or chicken broth, and pudding. You can also have soup, such as a blended vegetable soup. Go for foods that will provide nutrients and energy, without irritating your throat.Avoid acidic, spicy, and crunchy foods, as they can cause pain and bleeding.
If you are in a lot of pain after the tonsillectomy, you may need to arrange for someone to help you prepare food for you for the first several days. Ask a friend, partner, or roommate to help you.
 Stay in bed during the first several days after the tonsillectomy. Avoid strenuous activities like running and bike riding for at least two weeks post surgery. Try not to return to work for the first week and rest in bed or on the couch instead.You can usually return to normal activity, such as work, after you can eat a normal diet, sleep through the night, and do not need to have pain medication.
Your doctor can also tell you when you are well enough to return to normal activity.

 There should be a cable that is connected from your phone to “Line 1” on the back of your Time Warner modem. In addition to that, check that your coaxial cable is connected to the cable outlet or to the “Cable In” outlet on the back of the modem. Also check the modem is connected correctly to your wall via a phone jack.
 Try connecting another phone to the cables. If you hear a dial tone, the problem is not your service but rather your actual phone receiver.
 Do this by pulling out the battery from the modem or unplugging the modem from an electrical outlet. Turn back on the modem and check the phone for a dial tone.
 If you have been unable to solve your phone problems on your own, it's time to bring in a professional.

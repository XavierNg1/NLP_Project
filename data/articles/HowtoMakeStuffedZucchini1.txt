, Place some olive oil on a skillet and cook and stir the ground beef until it's nice and browned, for about 10 minutes. You can break up the beef as it crumbles while it cooks. Drain the extra fat from the beef and move it to a mixing bowl, using a slotted spoon.
 Cut it in half lengthwise, and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh. Leave about 1/2 an inch of shell all around the zucchini. If you find that it's too tough to really scoop out, at first, you can boil it for a few minutes or soak it in cold water for 10 minutes. You should also trim the ends of the zucchini.
 Place the zucchini flesh, bread crumbs, garlic, black olives, spaghetti sauce, and cheese in the bowl with the cooked ground beef. Mix the ingredients together until they are fully incorporated.
 Now, stuff each half of the zucchini with the stuffing mixture, packing it pretty lightly.
 Make sure to cover them with foil first.
 They should be good and tender, but not so tender that they fall apart at the touch. When they're ready, take them out of the oven and remove them from their foil.
, Then, place an oven rack about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) from the broiler, turn it on, and broil the zucchini until the mozzarella is browned and bubbling. This should take about 5 minutes. Then, remove the zucchini from the oven and let it cool for at least 3-4 minutes.
 Enjoy this hearty dish on its own or with a side of rice or pasta.

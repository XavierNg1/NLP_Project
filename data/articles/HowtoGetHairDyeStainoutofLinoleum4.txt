 Spray a small amount of alcohol- based hairspray on an inconspicuous area of the linoleum surface and let it sit for several minutes. If the linoleum looks unchanged, go ahead and use the hairspray to tackle the hair dye stain.Make sure to use alcohol-based hairspray, as the alcohol is the agent that will work to lift the stain. Alcohol is typically an ingredient in cheaper brands of hairspray.
 Hold the bottle of hairspray about a foot (30.48 cm) from the stain and spray thoroughly so that the stain is wet with hairspray but not soaked. Let the hairspray sit on the stain for several minutes., Use a clean cloth to dab at the stain using patting motions. Dab until the stain is completely lifted or until dabbing no longer has any effect., Wet a clean towel with water and wipe at the stain to remove any excess hairspray.

 With recent updates, all "current-gen" Roku devices can now add an official YouTube channel. This means every Roku device except the original Roku (released in 2010) can now add the YouTube channel.Note: Roku's model-naming system can be very confusing. The original Roku launched in 2010, and the Roku 2 launched in 2011. After the Roku 2 came out, they released a new Roku 1 and Roku 2 in 2013. This means that the Roku 1 and the original Roku are actually two completely different models.If you have the original Roku from 2010, the only way to get YouTube videos is to install the Twonky channel, which requires a subscription.;

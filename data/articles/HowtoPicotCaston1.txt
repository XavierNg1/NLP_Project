 Start by making a slipknot in your yarn about six to eight inches from the end. To do this, make a loop in your yarn, and then pull a second loop through the first one.Then, slide the slipknot onto your main needle. This is the needle that you hold in your left hand.Tug the end of the working yarn to tighten the loop.;
, Next, use the regular knit cast on method to cast on four stitches. To do this, insert your working (right hand) needle into the slipknot, yarn over, and then pull through and slide the slipknot off the needle as you do so. Then, loop the yarn over your main needle and insert the working needle through the loop. Yarn over and pull through again to create another stitch.Continue casting on with the regular knit method until you have four stitches total on your right hand needle.
 Once you have five stitches on your working needle, you will need to bind off two of them. First, place the needle with the stitches on it into your opposite hand. Then, knit into the first stitch. Next, insert the main needle into the first stitch on the working needle and loop it over the second stitch. This completes your first bind off stitch.Bind off a second stitch by knitting one and then binding off in the same manner as the first.
Return the last stitch to the main needle after you finish binding off two stitches.
 To repeat the process, cast on four stitches again, and bind off two stitches. Keep going until you have the desired number of picot stitches on your needle.

 Angels are seen as gentle people who are always there for others, and are very quiet. See if this personality is a personality you can have easily and fits you well.


Be mature. Not boring, just mature. Don't fuss or get angry at others and have a somewhat laid-back attitude.
Be a little quiet sometimes. Not shy, just quiet. Be modest and coy, not showy.
Don't be insecure. Be confident, but not a show-off.
Lighten things up. You can do that by joking around, having fun, or having the sweetest smile.
Don't sacrifice your own unique personality because you are an angel. Be yourself -- be funny, outgoing, whatever you want to, just make sure it isn't ruining your image.
Be sweet and/or charming. It takes skills, so check out How to Be Charming and How to Be Sweet.;
, Don't be rough physically or emotionally. Use compassion and empathy in all you do, and uphold the moral ethics of your religion or philosophy if you have one. If not, simply try to do only what you would like done to you.
 That is the key. Always listen to others, and they will think you actually understand. Don't interrupt, and look focused on people when they talk. Give advice, too, but inquire to see if they want advice before doing so. That way, people will come up to you and would feel your aura.


This doesn't mean you can't be talkative. However, use basic manners - don't interrupt and don't be loud.
 That means that you should always be there for others and just tell them you understand.
 It's tiring, but it's worth it and will make you and others happy. Help others, regardless of what you get in return. If someone offers you something in return of a favor, say, "No thank you, I'm just willing to help you."

, That means to charm people and never get tired of people complaining. Just act like helping is secretly your job.

 Though capricornus has several points that are a little jagged, its overall shape resembles a rough triangle. One tip of the triangle appears to be pointing straight down toward the earth. The other two points are pointing off into the sky.In the southern hemisphere, the constellation appears upside down.
 The horns of the sea goat are found above (below in the southern hemisphere) one of the points of the triangle. These “horns” are a cluster of stars that appear to make two points. This gives the appearance that the sea goat has a head and horns just like a normal goat., Knowing the main stars in any constellation can help you find it. You can look these stars up on the internet, or ask an experienced astronomer. Some of the main stars in Capricornus are:Alpha Capricorn (two different stars)
Dabih (also known as Beta Capricorni)
Nashira, or Gamma Capricorni
Deneb Algedi/Delta Capricorni

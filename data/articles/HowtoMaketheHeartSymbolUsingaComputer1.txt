 You can use this Alt code in most programs that allow typing. Place your cursor in any text field, from your browser's address bar, to a Facebook comment, to a Word document.;
, You'll need to have NumLock enabled for your numeric pad in order to use Alt codes.


If your computer has an integrated numeric pad, where the numeric keys are built-in to the regular keys as alternate functions, you may need to press the Fn key to activate it. This is most common with smaller laptops and netbooks that don't have room for a regular numeric pad.
Not all laptops have numeric pads, notably the ThinkPad line of laptops. If you don't have a numeric pad, see the Character Map section below.
 This allows you to enter codes with the numeric pad.
 You cannot use the 3 key from the number row at the top of your keyboard, it has the to be the 3 key on the numeric pad on the right side of the keyboard.


If you have an integrated numeric pad, this will be the L key since the right side of the keyboard converts to the numeric pad functions when NumLock is enabled.
 When you release the Alt key, the ♥ symbol will appear. If you are using a program with a font that doesn't support the ♥ symbol, you'll see a "□" character instead.

, Use numbers 1 to 12 and keep the numbering system steady in your mind as you work with the cords.


If you can't remember the cord numbers very well, use markers such as small plastic bread tabs with the numbers written on them - slip these over the cords, then shift and remove these as needed,

, Pull them taut to straighten. As cords are done with, you'll be tucking them off to the side when they are no longer needed.
 Weaving goes left-to-right, then right-to-left and each set of left-to-right/right-to-left must alternate between under/over and over/under. The instructions will make this clear.
 Take it under cord #2, then over cord #3, etc. Continue this weaving motion to the other side.
 Pass it under cord #11, then over cord #10. Continue this weaving motion back to the left side, to meet back with cord #2.
 Weave to the right, going under cord #4 this time, etc. This is an over-under sequence, the opposite of the first and second weave rows.
 Take it over #10, then under #9, and so forth, until you get back to cord #3.
 Keep weaving back to the right using this sequence.
 Keep weaving back to the left using this sequence.
 Keep weaving back to the right using this sequence.
 Keep weaving back to the left using this sequence.

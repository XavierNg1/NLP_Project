 It will need a tank of a size that allows it move around with ease.;
, You'll need some small rocks, gravel and some shells (shells are optional but look good). Algae killer will be needed to keep the housing safe; follow the package directions for use.


Frogs also like plants to use as hiding places.
 Put room temperature, non-chlorinated water into the tank. Fill the tank until it is three quarters (3/4) full.


Each frog needs about a gallon of water.
Water temperature matters, especially if raising tadpoles. Tadpoles grow faster in warmer temperatures, around 62ºF-70ºF is suitable for tadpoles.
 Place a bunch of shells, pebbles, etc in the bottom of the tank. Position them so that the frog has plenty of places to hide.
 One good food type is ReptoMin Floating Food Sticks. These are manufactured for aquatic turtles, newts and frogs. You can probably get it at most pet stores.


For average sized frogs 3-6 sticks a day, broken in half are fine. You need to break the stick in half though, to make it easier for them to swallow.
Sprinkle the food on top of the water.
 Aquatic frogs will also eat, brine shrimp and fish food. Sometimes they eat leftover food from the bottom of the tank but it's a good idea to remove uneaten food before it creates a mess and becomes a hazard.
 However, be aware that some frogs like the water murky, such as African Water Frogs, so you won't have to clean it as often.
 Take a net and quickly scoop the frog into the bucket.
 Keep doing this until the tank is light enough to carry. Then carry it to your sink.


A vacuum tube made for cleaning tanks can make this easier.
 Use water and a scrub brush to scrub out any algae and slime.
 Put it back where it normally lives. Put fresh room temperature non-chlorinated water in it, again filling to 3/4 full. Add some non-harmful algae killer in with the water as you pour it in.
, Do NOT pour the frogs back in because your pet frog may be harmed in the process. Done.

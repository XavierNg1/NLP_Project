 Carbines have a high rate of fire, decent firepower, and is pretty stable


Although you can use any gun you want to, the Carbine is definitely one of the best choices.;

Ammo cap gives a 40% chance to auto-reload your gun.
Quick hand let's you reload 30% faster.
 You'll be relying heavily on salts for this battle, hence Blood to Salt will be a great asset.
 Headmaster gives 50% more damage for critical hits.
 Tunnel Vision gives 25% more damage when aiming, but it lessens your damage by 25% when you don't aim, so it's a double-edged sword.


If you don’t want to use Tunnel Vision, you can use any footgear you want.
 This will help you thin down the amount of zombies that Lady Comstock raises.
 This will act as a second shield once your shield breaks down.
 There's going to be a small time frame in which she raises the dead, and you'll have a chance to shoot her during this time.
 This will quickly get rid of them and maybe even damage Lady Comstock.


Once you've killed all her zombies, she'll raise more to replace them.
 She raises her hands when she tries to revive zombies.


This is the best timing for doing head shots.
 If you use Return to Sender, you're invincible for as long as you have salts.


This is also where Blood to Salt kicks in after using most of your salt for Devil's Kiss. Chances are you'll have some left for Return to Sender once your shield breaks.
 This will do a lot of damage to her and the zombies around her. After that, switch back to Devil's Kiss and continue burning Lady Comstock and her zombies.
 You’ll might run out of salts. When you do, run for cover and wait for Elizabeth to throw some salts at you.


Covers are also good for getting a clean shot at Lady Comstock, so use them when necessary.

 One of the best things you can do for plantar fasciitis is to limit the amount of time you spend on your feet. The less pressure you exert on your heel, the more time it will have to heal. Additionally, try to avoid exercising on hard surfaces like concrete when you are experiencing pain. Opt for running on grass or an all-weather rubber track if possible.;
, Stretch your toes and calves throughout the day to prevent stiffness from occurring. By loosening up the ligaments, you can strengthen the muscles around your arch and relieve pain.
 Doing so can help reduce inflammation and can ease the pain caused by plantar fasciitis. Better yet, place a golf ball or a full water bottle in the freezer and use it to massage the bottom of your foot once frozen. Make sure to massage the inside of your arch thoroughly to try to reduce inflammation and ease tension., While some people receive relief from heating pads, heat can also cause inflammation that can make symptoms worse. If you do choose to use heat to treat your symptoms, make sure to alternate between a heating pack and an ice bath or pack. Always end with an ice treatment.
 Night splints position the foot at a perfect 90-degree angle to the ankle and hold the toes in an upward position to stretch the arch of the foot. This prevents stiffness and cramping from occurring during the night and allows you to maintain a constant, light stretch throughout the night.
 A walking cast holds your foot in place with a traditional cast for several weeks. This method is a bit more expensive and requires a substantial time commitment of inactivity. Additionally, you will likely have to undergo some level of light physical therapy after the cast is removed to restore flexibility.

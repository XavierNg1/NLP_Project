 Clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.
 This might be one color or two, depending on whether or not you wish to make divisions on the jar (such as one color from the top to the middle, and another color from the middle to the base). Alternatively, you can paint the entire jar, then paint on additional designs in a pattern or random formation, such as spots or love hearts.


The paint must be suitable for glass surfaces. Spray paint is recommended, as it's easy to apply and goes on evenly. Spray paint is used for this tutorial.
 Be sure the place you're spraying the jars in is well ventilated, to prevent you from breathing in toxic fumes.
 If doing more than one jar, add the other jar or jars at even intervals across the cardboard, for spraying at the same time.


If you're creating stripes, always mask off the areas that are not to be painted the color you're spraying each time. This includes the already painted areas; ensure each stripe is fully dry before making the next one.
 Don't get too close or there is a risk of causing the paint to drip, leaving drip marks on the jar's surface. Spray evenly.
 Follow the spray paint instructions on expected drying times, checking regularly. Once you're sure it's dry, additional decorative elements can be painted on, if wished.
 Here, it's up to your imagination. For example, you might like to tie a ribbon around the mouth of the jar, insert some artificial flowers on the ribbon and hang a little bell off it. Rummage around your craft basket for things that don't have other uses, and hang them off the jar as decoration.

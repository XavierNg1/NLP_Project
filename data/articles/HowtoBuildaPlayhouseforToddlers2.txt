 In most cases, this step will require you to lay out floor bond boards on the ground, which will help support the overall structure of the playhouse.


If you want the playhouse elevated from the ground, lay out wood blocks in every corner of the foundation, then lay the floor bond boards on top of the wood blocks.
 You can either use sheets of plywood, panels of wood, or any other material of your choice for the flooring.


Verify that your flooring is flush and even with all edges of the foundation or frame.
 To ensure that the flooring will support foot traffic, use nails or screws that are 2 inches (5.08 cm) long, and spaced 8 inches (20.32 cm) apart all throughout the flooring.
 Each wall of the playhouse can be constructed similarly to the way you built your flooring. For example, if you built your flooring using strips of wood, you can fashion each wall in the same manner.


Leave spaces in one or more walls for windows or doorways based on your preferences.
 90 degree brackets are ideal for firmly securing each wall to the foundation of the playhouse.


Install 90 degree brackets made from wood or metal approximately 6 inches apart along each wall to ensure that the walls are strongly supported and attached to the flooring.
 The style of roof can vary according to your preferences. For example, you can either fasten a flat layer of plywood to the top of the playhouse to achieve a box-like appearance, or build an angled roof using truss brackets.
 All edges of the roof should be flush with the outermost edges of each wall.
 Examples of decorations you can place on the playhouse are roofing shingles, paint, a real door with a doorknob, flower boxes beneath each window, and more.

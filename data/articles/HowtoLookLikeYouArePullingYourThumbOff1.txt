 It is important that you can see how the trick appears to your audience, so you can get a feel the angle at which you need to hold your thumbs so they are partially hidden., This means your left thumb is resting against the side of your hand that is pointed to the sky, and the back of your hand is facing your audience. Imagine where your audience will be standing (preferably directly in front of you), and be careful not to angle your hand so they can see behind your palm., Your thumb should be bent at a 90Â° angle, with only the bottom half (the half below your knuckle) visible to someone standing directly in front of you., It should appear as though you have one very long thumb--the left thumb providing the part below the knuckle, and your right hand making up the part above the knuckle, or the part with the nail., This covers the one area where it is obvious that people are seeing two bent thumbs held together, instead just your left thumb lying flat against the side of your hand., Your index and middle fingers will naturally move with your thumb. It will look like the tip of your left thumb has detached and you are pulling it apart., You may find you have to adjust the angle of at which you bend your thumbs for it to look convincing.


If you are left handed, the trick is exactly the same, just reverse it so your right thumb is the bottom of the thumb and your left thumb makes the tip.

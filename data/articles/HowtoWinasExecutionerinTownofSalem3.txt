 Very similar to "I Found Him," you must claim lookout., Still very similar to "I Found Him," say, "I was watching (dead person killed by an evil role) last night, and (target name) visited! Get him!" Now, everybody wants them dead.

This is also good to starter later in the game.
It is better to also say another person visited them, because if you don't, people will say that you are an executioner. If you lash at two people, that makes you look better.

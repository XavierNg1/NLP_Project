 You can also use a smaller bundle of diapers covered in a second receiving blanket to form a pillow inside the diaper stroller. This will most likely take six to eight diapers connected with tape so that they form the shape of a rectangle pillow.
 The hood of the stroller can be made of several diapers that are stacked and bent slightly to form the curve of the hood.


It can also be made from another blanket that is folded over the end of the stroller and propped up with the diapers that form the pillow.
 Once the diapers have taken on the basic form of a stroller, finishing touches can be added. Put your own personal touches on it. Add accessories like ribbons, balloons, or even baby shower decorations like tiny plastic baby bottles.


Consider stenciling or stamping the babyâ€™s name onto a piece of paper and attacking it to the front or back of the stroller like a license plate.
 If you plan to give more gifts, consider putting the gifts in the center of the baby carriage. You could wrap the gifts, or simply fill the stroller. Cute gifts include:


Stuffed animals, dolls, blankets, washcloths, or baby clothing.

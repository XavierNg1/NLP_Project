 For special effects like this, I like to select images that don't stand alone as a good pictures. This picture is not the greatest. The lighting is flat and the background is kind of distracting; however, the eyes and facial expression have some impact, so the image may be improved with a special effect.;
, This will open the toolbox for the Illusion Effect. Notice you can choose from two different types of illusions and adjust each mode by altering the number of divisions.
 You can set divisions with a negative or positive number and each one will cause a completely different look for your creation. As you adjust the divisions and modes you can see the results in the preview window. You can also change the zoom of the preview window to preview different parts of the image.
 This was done in Mode 2 with +8 divisions. I don't like it at all, so time to click UNDO and start over. GIMP makes this easy by allowing you to choose to render an image in a new window. Simply close the new window without saving and start over.
 This was done with Mode 1 and plus 32 divisions.
 It shows off the best features of the model's face, her eyes and lips. It gets rid of the distracting background and hides the bad lighting. This one was done at Mode 1 with -16 divisions. The applet requires a lot of experimentation, but with the right image and a little patience, you can turn a bland photograph into something interesting and possibly artistic.

 If they go to the right, you go to the left; if they head north, you head south. Always go the opposite of where they go.;
, Don't show them you are afraid of them.
, It is not good when you socialize with someone who is disliked, or someone who is constantly bullying you. It just makes the relationship between you and the person even worse.
, Showing emotion will cause the bully to do more to you.
 Stay quiet and if you dare to speak up, try to not say anything that will make you made fun of.
, Explain how you feel about the bully and next time, have your friend(s) around you, and so they can try to protect you.
 Bullies may bully because they don't like you, they are going through hard times, are jealous of you, jealous of others, or just insecure about themselves. Overall any of those qualities, they all want attention. Don't use violence back or spread rumors about them. Don't do anything to give them the attention that they are dying for.
 This is just a simple step out of many. Tell the bully how you really feel. No, don't tell them that you are hurt or your emotions are scarred, but tell them that you are tired of them bullying you and nobody else likes it. Also, be sure to stand up for friends,

If you get forced into a fight with a bully and they're not that much bigger than you, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself: if you show the bully you're not afraid of them, they are less likely to pick on you.

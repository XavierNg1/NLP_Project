 To get started, cast on the number of stitches that you will need to get your desired blanket width.To determine how many stitches to cast on, check the gauge of your yarn and needles or use the yarn label to guide you.


You can determine how many stitches to cast on by multiplying the gauge by the desired dimension. For example, if you want a lap blanket that is 24 inches wide and your gauge is 4 stitches per inch, then you would need to cast on 96 stitches.
A 96 stitch cast on would result in a small lap blanket. If you want a medium sized blanket, then try casting on 120 stitches. For a large lap blanket, cast on 160 stitches. For an extra-large lap blanket, cast on 200 stitches.
 After you have cast on your stitches, knit across all of these stitches using a basic knit stitch.However, if you want to try a different stitch or add some embellishment stitches, then you may also do that.
 Try to be patient and just work on the blanket in short sessions every day. Over time, the length will grow. Just keep in mind that it may take several weeks of regular work to complete a blanket.
 When you have finally achieved the desired length, you can finish the blanket. To do this, you will need to cast off your stitches and weave in any loose ends that were left when you switched skeins. Use a plastic needle to weave in the ends. You can simply sew them into the edges of the blanket to hide them.

 A detangler will help lubricate knots and tangles so you can run your fingers through your hair easily. Hold the detangling spray about 6 inches (15 centimeters) away from your hair, and spray about 4 to 6 squirts onto your hair.You may consider spraying a few more squirts if your hair is long or has a lot of texture.


Be sure to spray not only the top layers of your hair, but also the under layers as well.;
, When most of the tangles are removed, brush your hair back, and up into a high ponytail position at the crown of your head. You can use your fingers to smooth out your hair if it is very wet.Use the brush to smooth out any bumps and incorporate loose hairs into your beginning ponytail.
 Use a hair tie to secure your high ponytail. Twist it around your hair as many times as necessary to hold it in place, but avoid making it tighter than necessary. When your ponytail is tied, run your fingers through the ponytail to smooth out your hair.If your ponytail looks too tight, you can gently tug some hairs forward from the ponytail to loosen the look.
 Twist the ponytail in one direction, starting at the base of the ponytail and continuing down to the ends.When you get to the ends of the ponytail, continue twisting. The ponytail will start to twist around itself. Following the natural twist, wrap the ponytail around the hair tie to create a twisted bun.
 When youâ€™re finished wrapping the ponytail and have a twisted bun, hold the ends of your hair in place. Secure the ends of the ponytail with a bobby pin. Push a bobby pin over the ends and through, to the center of the bun.You may want to add a few more bobby pins around the bun for extra hold.
 Gently spray the top of your hair with hairspray to keep everything in place and tame flyaway hairs.Softly run your hands over your hair to smooth your hair back.


Consider spraying behind your head to keep any shorter back airs from falling out of your bun.

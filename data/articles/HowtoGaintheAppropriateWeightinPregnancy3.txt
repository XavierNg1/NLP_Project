 If you write out your daily diet, you may notice things that provide unwanted calories (without adding nutritional value) that can be removed from your diet.


For example, choosing water to drink over soft drinks, juices and other sugar-laced beverages that can ratchet up your caloric intake and cause you to gain unhealthy weight during pregnancy.
It is also helpful to avoid high-calorie snacks such as cake, cookies, candy and chips. These don't add any valued nutrition for your baby.
It can be of great help to cut back on carbohydrate consumption â€“ foods such as pastas, rice, potatoes, breads, cereals, and other grain products. These have high calorie counts and often contribute to unwanted weight gain.
 Salt causes your body to retain fluid.
 Switch from frying foods in oil to baking, grilling, boiling or broiling.
 Moderate exercise such as swimming and walking can be a benefit to you and the baby, and can help burn extra calories.


Exercise has actually been shown to reduce potential complications of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia and/or gestational diabetes (problems with your blood pressure and/or your blood sugars).Exercise, in addition to preventing excess weight gain during pregnancy, also helps you to lose weight faster after pregnancy because you will have stayed in better shape, making it easier to resume an exercise routine after your baby is born.Types of exercise to avoid include ones with high risks of falls or accidents (such as skiing, diving, horse-riding, or gymnastics), or ones where you could get hit with a ball (such as baseball or tennis), all of which pose a risk to the baby's safety.

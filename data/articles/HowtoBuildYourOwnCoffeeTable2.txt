 Furniture stores that sell precut tabletops often sell ready-to-install table legs as well. Ready-made legs offer one of the least costly ways to build your coffee table, and are available in a range of different styles and materials, including wood and polished metal.
 To give your DIY coffee table a nod to classic mid-century Scandinavian design, you can fit it with metal hairpin legs. Vintage hairpin legs can be found readily through Internet classifieds or auction sites like eBay. You can also have new ones made through an online metal shop.
 Some companies manufacture table legs that can be installed without any fasteners; this allows you to install them easily and swap out the tabletop if desired. One such product is the Tick Clip, produced by the German company Linie 58.
 If you have an existing table, dresser, or other piece of furniture with attractive legs, you can remove them and give them new life as part of your DIY coffee table. This method can help you preserve a piece of furniture with sentimental value in a new form.

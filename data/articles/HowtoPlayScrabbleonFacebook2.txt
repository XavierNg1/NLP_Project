 A "Create New Game" window will appear.
 You can choose to play a 2-player game or a game with 3 or 4 opponents.
 The "Create New Game" window lists your friends who also have the Scrabble for Facebook app. You can select from this list or, if you don't see the players you want to play, click "Load More Friends" at the bottom of the scrolling list to display the names of more friends with the app. Once you have selected your opponents, you'll see 7 tiles on your rack.


The 2-player game also offers you the option of playing a random opponent. If you select this option, your opponent will be chosen randomly from all Facebook users with the Scrabble app.
 If one of the tiles you're playing is a blank tile, the game will prompt you to indicate which letter you're using it to represent and mark that letter on the tile in red so that all players know your intent.
 At this point, your score updates and play passes to the next player. The game will notify you when it's your turn again.


Players have as much time as they need to make their moves, so a Facebook Scrabble game may take several hours or even several days. You can play more than 1 game at a time, if you wish.
As soon as you've played a word, your rack is refreshed with new letters to bring it back to 7 tiles. The bag icon displays the number of tiles remaining in the game, not counting yours and your opponents'. Once the bag is empty, the game reports the number of tiles a player who has fewer than 7 has remaining.
 As with the Scrabble board game, the values of unplayed letters are subtracted from the scores of the players who have them. Highest score wins. You then have the option to share your results on your timeline.

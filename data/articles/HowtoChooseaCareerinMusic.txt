 Start preparing yourself for a career in music while you are still in school. Most schools contain a wide variety of musical courses you can take including classes such as choir and band. If you are interested in a career as a vocalist (singer) then a choir would likely be a class you would choose. If you want to be in a marching band or orchestra, then band would likely be the place for you. Whatever your interest, there's almost always a class for it.;
, Whether you are in a rock and roll band, or you want to be a music teacher, college is the way to go. Along with providing you with a college degree, it provides you with classes in music that you can specialize in. Often times, colleges contain a wide variety more classes in the musical art than high school. And that isn't just for big colleges. Community colleges offer very similar courses. Do your homework and research what music career path you should go to college for.
 It doesn't matter how good of a musician you are, no one will hire you as a musician (from small bar gigs to major record labels) if you didn't show consistent interest throughout schooling. Your application will get tossed out before you can even play them a G note.
 Practicing is a vital key to becoming a musician. About 99.5% of all musicians play instruments, so you probably do too. Whether you play a 7-string guitar heavy metal, or classical harp you must always practice so you achieve maximum skill levels. The better you play, the easier it will be to get hired.
 Once you land your dream music job, stay passionate about it. Maybe you've had a music teacher who's always a grouch. It's because they lost the passion for they job, and for them it's only about the paycheck now.

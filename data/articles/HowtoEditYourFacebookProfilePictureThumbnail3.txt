 To get to your profile on your mobile browser, go to Facebook and then tap on the three stacked lines in the top right hand corner of the navigation bar at the top of the page.


Note: This method, like the app method will only let you make changes to your actual profile picture which will be represented in your thumbnail.
Once you tap, you will be brought to a page that shows your profile picture and name at the top.
 Once on your profile page, click on your profile picture.


You will be brought to a screen with your profile picture and links below it.
 You will now be brought to a page that displays your profile picture, and has options to rotate the photo left, right, or delete.


While this isn’t a permanent fix, you can quickly upload a new photo clicking the “Change Profile Picture” link instead of “Edit Photo” and upload a photo you edited either on your iPhone/iPad, or Android phone.
This will allow you to have a version of your photo that you like until you can properly change the thumbnail via your computer using Method 1.

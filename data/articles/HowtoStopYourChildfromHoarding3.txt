 Hoarding behavior in children is very significant. Though there are things you can do at home to help your child, it is essential to seek help for your child from a mental health professional. Hoarding generally stems from deeper anxiety and stress-related problems. If you address the hoarding behavior early, your child can get help before the behavior becomes more severe.Make sure you choose a therapist who has experience with hoarding.
You can ask your pediatrician for referrals to a child therapist. You also can search online for therapists in your area.
 Cognitive behavioral therapy is a common treatment for older children with hoarding tendencies. CBT works to change the hoarding behavior. This type of therapy should be done with a therapist who has experience with treating hoarding.In CBT, the child will explore why they feel the need to hoard.
CBT helps the child figure out ways to assess which objects they should keep and which they should give away. They will also work on ways to modify their behavior so they can get rid of objects without too much distress.
 Medication is another treatment option for children who hoard. The most common medication prescribed for this condition are SSRIs. These medications are commonly prescribed for obsessive-compulsive behaviors.Medication does not always help with hoarding behavior. You may consider behavioral therapy before medication.

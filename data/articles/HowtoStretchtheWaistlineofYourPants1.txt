 Pull your pants on as far as you can, ideally to the point where you can zip/button them up.


Laying down while buttoning/zipping your pants can also make them easier to get into.
If you can’t get the pants on far enough to zip them up, first do a little manual pulling. Use your arm strength to pull and stretch the waistband enough that you can pull the pants on.For extra muscle power, step one foot into the waistband, using your foot to hold it to the ground, then grasp the waistband with both hands and pull as hard as you can in the opposite direction.;
, Squat down, do lunges, pull each leg up to your chest, or do any other movements that will help pull and stretch the fabric of the pants.


But be careful not to go so far that you tear the pants.
 Test out the pants to see if you’ve stretched them out sufficiently. If not, repeat step two.

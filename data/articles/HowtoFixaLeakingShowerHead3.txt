 A diverter valve allows the water to switch from the bathtub faucet to the shower head. Over time, this valve can weaken and become clogged by sediment buildup. A malfunctioning diverter valve will leak even when water should be flowing through the bathtub faucet. You can fix a diverter valve by cleaning it, but it is usually better to just replace it. Start by shutting off the water supply either through the valve to the bathroom or through your home’s main supply.
 Locate the screw to your faucet handle, which should either already be exposed or which may be hidden under a cap. You can remove the cap using a tiny pocket knife.
 To remove the diverter valve, you’ll have to separate the valve assembly from the hex nut on the faucet stem by unscrewing it. If you have difficulty unscrewing the valve, wrap a vinegar soaked rag around the components for a short period to break up any limescale build up. WD-40 may also help to remove buildup.
 With the diverter valve free, you can now clean it using a small stiff wire brush and white vinegar. Once you’ve removed all sediment buildup, check the valve for wear and tear. If you don’t see any, let the valve sit out to dry. If you see cracks throughout the diverter valve, replace the valve assembly.
 Reverse the previous steps to reassemble the faucet handle. Before you screw it back on, turn on the water supply to see if the leaking shower head is now fixed.

 I would recommend if more than one person a five room, a big one. This provides space for a bedroom, living room, and bathroom. You will also need storage place for kitchen stuff,food, clothes and some other possessions. Feel free to adapt any of the rooms into a space that better fits your needs, you may consider replacing any of them with one of the following: Kitchen, spare bedroom, storage room, or hallway if it's too small for use.;
, This will help keep out the chill on a cold night and also provides extra cushioning when you need to sit or lay down.
 Do Not put these near walls as they may tear or set fire to your tent. Make your choice of fan or heater depending on the location and season.
, Make sure it will not catch the tent on fire by stringing them in the middle of the room and keeping them off as often as possible.
 This will keep out any unwanted guests and help ensure safety from the "bad people" of the world.
 That way you can enjoy a hot drink!

, That way you can have a warm meal.
 That way you will be comfortable during the nights.
 The bare ground can be very uncomfortable and cold, even in the height of winter. Or instead of an air bed, find a thick fold up air mattress, there are tri fold ones that are about 3" thick, that way you don't have to deal with the air mattress deflating.
,, Or you can Buy a potty or bucket and bury after.

 Once you have gained dog’s trust, it’s time to figure out if you can help it. Start by using a slip lead to secure the stray, so you can guide them away.Slip leads are convenient because they require no collar. You simply put the loop at the end of it over the dog’s head and tighten the slide on the rope so that it won’t slip off.
If the dog has a collar, you can use a normal leash.
 Don’t assume that the stray is ownerless; they might be a lost dog. Look for tags (if they’re wearing a collar), a tattoo, or a microchip to see if you can locate their family.Tattoos are generally located on the inner ear or leg.
Go to a vet to scan the dog to see if they have been microchipped.
 Make simple posters for your neighborhood and post brief ads online on community forums like Craigslist and Petfinder. Include a partial description of the dog, where you found them, and your contact information.You don’t want to provide too much information about the dog in the ads. Responders should be able to give a detailed description of their missing dog; otherwise, they’re probably not the true owners.
Be sure to distribute posters to local vet offices, pet stores, and animal rescues. While you’re doing so, show a photo of the stray to employees to see if they recognize it.
 Most shelters have facilities for housing lost or stray dogs and can advise you about how to help locate any possible owners through contacting public agencies. They also have resources available if you decide that you would like to foster the dog yourself.

 Do not pester a reporter to cover every meeting held by your non-profit. Story ideas must pertain to a relevant and timely issue in order to get any notice. It's important to have a human interest angle in mind.


If a reporter turns down your story pitch, don't take it personally. It may not work into the reporter's schedule, or she may not find the idea relevant at the time. Don't give up and remain on friendly terms with the person.
 Don't be afraid to give out your cell phone number. If a reporter cannot reach you with one phone call, he most likely will move on to an alternative source for his story.
 If you make her miss her deadline or feed her with lousy information, he will not call back the next time he needs help.

If there's no way you can answer immediately, ask the reporter when her deadline is. Be sure to get back to her as soon as possible.
 Press kits and releases are not as effective as making a call to a reporter, but they are a good way to send background information on your agency. Include your business card so reporters can keep your contact information on file.
 Reporters rarely receive praise.

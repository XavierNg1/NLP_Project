 Tenderly, rub it all over your face, gently and carefully, so that it will not hurt you if you poke yourself. Avoid getting it into your eyes or on your eyelashes.;
, (With scented water if you want.)

, Dust over the cheeks, forehead, and chin. Pat all over.
 (On the side of the head, next to the hair.)

, Do one little "flick" for the cat look, or two for a nice angelic look.
 Use the fake eyelashes to define your eyes and face more.
,, Put a nice lipstick or lipgloss.

The color of lipstick will depend on your dress. Don't pick a color that is not already found on your dress.
Beige or a light color is good if your dress is very patterned and already complex.
 Use a skin tone on the crease.

Again as with the lipstick, the color you choose is dependent on your dress, the program, and the music. Pick something that matches your dress and won't look trashy with the music.

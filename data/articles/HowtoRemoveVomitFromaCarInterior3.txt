 Any nasty smell will dissipate dramatically if it has the chance to air out. Before, during, and after cleaning out the vomit, be sure to let your car air out a bit with the doors open. Air out the car in your driveway or a parking lot, but not in your garage. There's not enough air circulation in a garage for this to be effective.
 The longer you let the vomit sit in the car, the more the fluid will soak into your upholstery.


In hot months, the vomit might actually putrefy and create an even more rotten smell if you just let it sit there., Baking soda is a classic stand-by for eliminating all kinds of nasty smells; it actually absorbs the smells and eliminates it.You can use baking soda with a bit of essential oil mixed in to eliminate the smell of vomit from your car.


Mix a few tablespoons of baking soda together with a few drops of your favorite essential oil. Any nice-smelling oil will do, but lemon or orange is especially good at eliminating smells. You can simply shake the baking soda and oil together in a plastic container with a lid.
After cleaning up the vomit, moisten the spot and sprinkle the baking soda and essential oil mixture on top. Cover the surface of the area that had vomit on it, and let it sit for ten minutes. Then, use a vacuum with a hose attachment to vacuum up the baking soda.
 If the smell is still in your car, you might try masking it with a commercial car air freshener.


You can try the type that hangs from your rearview mirror, the gel that sticks to your console, or a powder that you sprinkle on and vacuum up. Any of these can leave your car smelling nice and fresh.

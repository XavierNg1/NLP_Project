 Corn will generally take as much light as you can give it, so consider supplementing the light, especially if you're serious about getting corn out of this experiment. You may have to supplement the light if you don't have enough natural light. Try fluorescent bulbs.
 Try a washtub or something of a similar size.


As with any houseplant, protect the surface underneath. Use a large plant saucer between the container and the floor.
 Use a rich potting mix with plenty of organic matter and nutrients. Optionally, add additional fertilizers according to package instructions.
 Plant seeds one inch deep in the soil, 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) apart.
 Wait until the top of the soil dries out, and avoid watering so much that the roots are in standing water. Check for moisture before you water. Check at least weekly and remember that indoor containers will require less water than outdoor ones.
 Choose the strongest growers and pull the rest.
 The best pollinator for corn is wind, and that's not available indoors. Instead, try gently shaking the plants as tassels start to appear. The tassels produce the pollen and the silk receives it. Each strand of silk corresponds to one kernel., Corn is ready to harvest when a the juice from a kernel is milky, not clear. Other signs are brown silk but a green husk.When you've determined that an ear is ready, snap it off the stalk with a twisting motion and cook it as soon as possible.

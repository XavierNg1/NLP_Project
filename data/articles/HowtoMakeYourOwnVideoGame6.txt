 Once you have a working game from start to finish, it’s time to start looking for ways to break it. Finding the bugs in your game and squashing them is essential to making sure that as many people can play it as possible.
 Every conceivable way a player can interact with the game needs to be accounted for. Make sure that your game rules can’t be bypassed or broken by attacking those rules as much as possible.


Bug testing can take a significant amount of time, even as much as the game took to create. The more people you can get to help with testing, the more problems you will be able to find and fix.
 If you have a large list of bugs, and only a limited time to fix the game, make sure that you deal with serious, game-breaking bugs first. For example, if there was a bug that allowed a player to earn an unlimited high score in a score-based game, you would want to make sure that bug was taken care of immediately.
 Get some friends over to try out your game. Watch how they approach your challenges, and how they interact with your game world. Chances are they will try to do things that you never even thought someone would do.

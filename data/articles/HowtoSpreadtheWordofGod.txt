 One of the hardest things about spreading God's good news is gathering the courage to do it. However, if you pray then it only requires you to truly want courage to receive it. If you pray with one or more other Christians things will be even easier.;
, Don't think 'I'll just get persecuted.' or 'They'll think I'm weird', etc or you'll never get anywhere! Even if people strongly believe another religion, try to tell them of the word.
 No matter how hard it is to make them believe in Jesus, if you try hard enough and pray hard enough, it will be done.
 Don't tell just a few people of the good news, tell everyone you meet.
 How can you persuade others if you are not armed with righteousness and the sword of the spirit (The Holy Bible)?

, You can use emails, letters, organize parties and tell the guests, at work/school, sleepovers, online gaming chat rooms, websites or anything else you can think of.
 If you raise funds for a charity, give money to children, pick up litterÂ  etc, then people will know that you are a good person and you can tell them that you are representing God. If you really devote yourself 24/7 to the lord, you show people how much you believe.

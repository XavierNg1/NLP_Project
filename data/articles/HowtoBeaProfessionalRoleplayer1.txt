 You must have (or be willing to develop) correct spelling, grammar skills, etc. You must read other roleplayer’s posts in order to make your own. If you dislike writing, reading, or both, roleplaying may not be the hobby for you.;
, If you are tight on time, you may not be able to develop into a master roleplayer. You must be able to make at least a few, excellent posts a day. Advanced roleplaying requires even more effort from you.
 It also requires you to be able to work with other roleplayers. Roleplaying is almost like teamwork; you’re all working together to build up an exciting, excellent roleplay! If you don’t get along with your fellow roleplayers, then the roleplay will not turn out well.

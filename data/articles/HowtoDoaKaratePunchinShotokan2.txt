 Ensure your legs are in the correct positions, shoulder width apart.


If you look down at your front knee, you should see your knee is blocking your view of your foot. Your big toe should be just slightly to the inside, not 90 degrees but about 85.
Have someone test your stance by giving you push or two, to make sure you keep your balance.
Ensure your blocking hand is in front, and your punching hand is at nesting against your hip.
 Pull your back leg forward until it is in the same line as your front leg.


Do not rise up. Keep your head at the same level the whole time.
Keep your fist at your hip, same place.
You can extend your blocking fist if you want, but that is optional.
Move your back leg forward by sliding it, do not pick it up off the floor.
Your back leg should not move straight forward, but should move towards the center as it moves towards your body.
 Push off with your back leg, staying low, and keeping your fist nestled against your side.


Ensure legs are softly bent, to give you maximum power from the lunge forward.
Do not tense up.
Focus on your target, be it body or face.
 Roll your fist over to have your palm face down as you connect.


Exhale or Kiai.

Tighten your muscles as you strike. Your back leg should extend straight and your muscles should all tighten, so that the power flows from your feet all the way through to the punch.
The front leg returns to shoulder width distance to land in a strong position.

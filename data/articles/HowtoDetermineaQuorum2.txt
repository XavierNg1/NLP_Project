 At this point, you should use your experience with previous meetings to determine both the number of people you can expect and how many people you want to be involved in financial and institutional decisions.This process will help you determine the by-law for quorum.


For example, you may find that three people show up to any given meeting, even if you have an eight-person board. In this case, you may overrule your majority quorum in favor of a three-person quorum.
If your number of board members is flexible or changes frequently, consider using a percentage of board members present, rather than a set number.
 Ask the Secretary to write up the number required for a quorum. Give every member of the organization and opportunity to weigh in on the change before the vote.Before the vote, give the members of the organization the proposed amendment to the quorum by-law in writing, as well as the existing by-law for quorum.
Additionally, prior to the vote, provide the by-law as it will read once it is adopted.
A two-thirds majority is needed for the vote to pass.
 Once the vote has been taken for the amendment to your by-laws, if it passes, it is adopted and cannot be reconsidered. However, if the vote fails, the vote can be reconsidered.Send out the new, updated by-laws to members of the organization and the state and federal organizations that require copies of your by-laws.
Remind people that any meeting that does not have a quorum will not be able to do legal business.

 Many broom sticks are threaded, which allows you to unscrew the broom head from the broom stick. Having the broom head separated from the stick can make it easier to clean your broom., Before you get the bristles wet, itâ€™s important to remove as much debris as possible. Use the upholstery attachment to remove any debris from your broom. If you don't have an upholstery attachment, you can just use your hands to pull debris off.
 You can only get so much dirt off the bristles with your hands or vacuum. Bang the broom against the ground to loosen up and shake off any dirt that might be clinging to the bristles.

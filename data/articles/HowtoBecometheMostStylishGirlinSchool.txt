 Take all your clothes out and place them somewhere that you can see them all at the same time (e.g., bed, floor). Separate your clothes in two sections; the clothes you like and the ones you don't. Get rid of the things that are out of style, don't fit, are damaged, or that you don't like anymore. Donate these things to charity, or if you want to make extra money, sell them to a local consignment shop or a place that pays on-the-spot, like Plato's Closet, or Uptown Cheapskate.;
, Everyone has a different style, and it is probably made up of many different tastes and fashions. Make it your own and make sure it's something you feel comfortable with. Read magazines such as InStyle, Lucky, Seventeen and Teen Vogue/Vogue for some fashion inspiration. Examine ads and articles and pay attention to what you like and dislike. When you go into clothes stores, buy the stuff you like best and won't regret buying. Try on and feel fabrics to see which you would like best to wear. Try to emulate the former and avoid the latter.
 Fashion isn't just about clothing. How many times have you seen a cute outfit ruined by bad hair? Find a style that works for your hair--it can be wavy, curly, straight, brown, blonde, red--whatever, so it looks natural, pretty, and flattering. Find a talented hair stylist and get tips from her/him.
 By doing this, you will only end up looking like everybody else. Which makes you look like you want to blend in when you actually want to stand out. Stylish girls' clothes always gets the eyes by looking different from the others. It's okay to shop at Abercrombie, American Eagle, Hollister, etc., but make sure very few of your clothes say "A&F" across the chest (especially if you're in middle/high school/college). Try to wear something different that will make you stand out, but in a fashionable, reasonable way. Scour second-hand shops, Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, local boutiques and garage sales for unique garments and accessories.

 You need to be a little gentler when pouring these types of beers; their head grows larger and faster than normal. A proper head is at least 1 inch thick, or two fingers deep, but not more. Take a beer like this slow and easy.


For this type of beer, it may be advantageous to use a taller glass to allow for more foam. There’s an entire art form when it comes to pouring wheat beers, and hard-core believers even roll the bottle around on the table before finishing the pour. Try swirling the last third of the beer while still in the bottle before finishing the pour in your glass., The last ½ inch or so in bottle-conditioned beers is generally no good, so leave it in the bottle. It’s not that it’s bad (though it can lead to a yeast-y flavor), it’s just that it may cause excessive flatulence, or farting.


However, some people prefer the richer, more bitter, concentrated yeast taste. If you are one of these people, pour away.
 Beers like Budweiser and Miller are best poured slowly as in the steps above and down the side of a tilted glass. If you don’t, they’ll produce a glass full of head. While you do want some head for flavor and aroma, if it’s all head, there’s no beer.


Because these beers have little protein, a big head will dissipate quickly, leaving a half-empty glass. Creating a big head slows the pouring process needlessly – and can be quite messy to boot.
 Guinness aficionados swear by the two-part pour, or the double-pour method, for their beloved beer. This is where you pour the beer about ⅔ of the way up the glass and then wait for 30 seconds or so for the beer to settle (the nitrogen bubbles, technically). After that, fill ‘er up to the brim of the glass – preferably a Guinness glass.


Why is this important? Supposedly in creates the perfect amount of head and the best-tasting Guinness there is. If this is how they do it in Dublin, it’s probably not a bad idea.

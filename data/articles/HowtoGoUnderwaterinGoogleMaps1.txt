, Use the search box on the top left corner of the page, and type in the underwater location you want; for example, Atlantic Ocean or Pacific Ocean. A shortlist of possible results will drop down. Click on the location you want, and the map will automatically draw to the location you’ve set.
 There aren’t a lot of underwater locations available for street view, so to check if the location you entered has Street View, check the thumbnails that appear below the search bar. Locations with underwater Street View has an Underwater thumbnail.
 Click the Underwater thumbnail. The view on the screen will zoom into the water area and dive down.
 The images captured from the underwater location will be displayed. Use your mouse to navigate through the images. Click and drag the screen to move around. Clicking on the arrows that will appear will move you to that specific area. It will feel like you’re diving as you go past the fishes and reefs.


If you want to exit the view and search for a new one, just click the arrow pointing left at the top leftmost area of the screen. You’ll be taken back to the maps view of the location.

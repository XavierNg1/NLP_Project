 Choose cups that are made out of white, thin, disposable plastic, as youâ€™ll want white material that is easy to cut.
 Take a permanent marker and draw the desired shape of your teeth on the outside of the plastic cup.
 Get a sharp pair of scissors and cut along the lines you've drawn to cut out the teeth.
 The best place to attach them is behind your upper lip and in front of your teeth, where they can't fall out.

Check the teeth out in the mirror to ensure they are the desired size and look secure in your mouth.
If the fake teeth start to split you can use dental floss to tie them back together.

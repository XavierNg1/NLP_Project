 Seeders are those who continue to share the file after it has been downloaded. The more the seeders there are the faster the download will be.


If you can, try to download from a tracker with a lot of seeders for the file that you want. If you can connect to enough seeders, you can easily max out your connection speed. This can add extra risks if you are downloading music and films so learn to select reputable sources as "More is not always better";

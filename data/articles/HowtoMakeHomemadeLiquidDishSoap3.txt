 In a large bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon (2 g) of Borax, 1 tablespoon (14 g) of washing soda, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of white distilled vinegar, and ½ cup (120 ml) liquid castile soap. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are well blended.Borax is a natural mineral that’s ground down into a powder and used in cleaning products, such as dish soap and laundry detergent. You can find it with washing soda in the laundry aisle of most grocery markets.
If you want your dish soap to have a scent, you can use a scented castile soap, such as lavender, peppermint, citrus, or tea tree.
 Pour 2 ½ cups (600 ml) of water into a medium saucepan, and heat on the stove on high until it is boiling, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the stove, and gradually pour the Borax mixture into the water, whisking after each addition to fully mix the soap.If you want your soap to have a stronger scent, add 3 to 5 drops of your favorite essential oil, such as lavender or tea tree, and mix well.
It’s okay if your soap is thin and liquidy. It will thicken up as it cools.
 Allow the soap mixture to cool down to room temperature, which should take 20 to 30 minutes. Next, pour it into a dispenser and place it beside the kitchen sink.

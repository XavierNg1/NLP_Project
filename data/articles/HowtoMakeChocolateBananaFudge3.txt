 For the fudge, you’ll need a 6-inch by 6-inch (15-cm by 15-cm) baking dish. Use a piece of parchment paper to line the dish so the fudge won’t stick.If you prefer, you can line the dish with foil that’s been lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.
 Add 1 cup (250 g) of peanut butter and ¼ cup (54 g) of coconut oil to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirring afterward. If it’s not completely melted, continue heating in 15 second intervals until it is smooth.Be sure to mix the peanut butter and coconut oil after each interval in the microwave so you don’t overheat them.
 Once the peanut butter and coconut oil are melted, add 2 ripe, mashed bananas to the bowl. Stir the ingredients together well so they are completely combined.Because it has a thick consistency, it usually helps to use a fork to mix the banana into the peanut butter mixture.
 When the banana and peanut butter mixture are combined, add 2 tablespoons (22 g) of chocolate chips to the bowl. Mix them into the other ingredients so they begin to melt and marble throughout the mixture.Milk, semisweet, and bittersweet chocolate chips will work in the fudge.
 Once the chocolate chips are blended into the banana and peanut butter mixture, use a spatula to add the fudge to the prepared baking dish. Smooth the mixture to form an even layer.Press the fudge down in the dish to ensure that it is tightly compacted.
 When the fudge mixture is in the baking dish, cover it with a piece of plastic wrap. Place the dish in the freezer and chill it for at least 30 minutes, or until the fudge is firm., When the fudge is firm, remove it from the freezer. Use a knife to cut it into slices and serve.Store any leftover fudge in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It should stay fresh for about 2 weeks.

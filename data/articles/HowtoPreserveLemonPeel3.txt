 These are spices that will break down and diffuse into the sugar/salt/lemon mixture., Repeat layers, to top., Since you have only peel in this mixture, the sugar and salt work together to break down the skin and to preserve it, without making it overly salty or overly sweet.
 Preserving this way, the lemon peel should be able to keep for up to one year in the refrigerator.


Note the date and label the mason jar.

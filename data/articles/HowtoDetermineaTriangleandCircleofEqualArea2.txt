 The formula is A=π(r2){\displaystyle A=\pi (r^{2})}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the circle and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius of the circle., Remember to substitute for variable r{\displaystyle r}.

For example, if the circle has a radius of 4 cm, your formula will look like this:A=π(42){\displaystyle A=\pi (4^{2})}A=π(16){\displaystyle A=\pi (16)}.
 If you are not using a calculator, use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }. This will give you the area of the circle.

For example:A=π(16){\displaystyle A=\pi (16)}A=3.14(16){\displaystyle A=3.14(16)}A=50.24{\displaystyle A=50.24}

 So, the area of the circle is about 50.24 cm.
 The formula is A=12bh{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}bh}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the triangle, b{\displaystyle b} equals the length of the triangle’s base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the triangle., Since you want the area of each figure to be the same, use the area you previously calculated for the circle.

For example, if you found the area of the circle to be 50.24 cm, your formula will look like this: 50.24=12bh{\displaystyle 50.24={\frac {1}{2}}bh}.
 You can also use this method if you are given the length of the base (b{\displaystyle b}). Just plug the appropriate value in for the corresponding variable.

For example, if the height of the triangle is 10 cm, your formula will look like this: 50.24=12b(10){\displaystyle 50.24={\frac {1}{2}}b(10)}.
 Then, divide each side of the equation by this product. This will give you the length of the base of your triangle.

For example:50.24=5b{\displaystyle 50.24=5b}50.245=5b5{\displaystyle {\frac {50.24}{5}}={\frac {5b}{5}}}10.05=b{\displaystyle 10.05=b}

 So, the area of a circle with a radius of 4 cm is equal to the area of a triangle with a height of 10 cm and a base of about 10 cm.

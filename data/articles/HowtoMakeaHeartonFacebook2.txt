 Not everyone will believe it, but the icons you see in Step 2 below are actually hidden heart-shaped emoji.


If you're a Chrome user, you will see plain black squares, and if you're a Firefox, IE or Safari user, you will see plain black hearts.
All you need to do is copy the square/heart you want and paste it into a Facebook post or comment.
Once you post your comment, it will magically turn into one of the hearts described below.
 You can use one of the following:


Beating Heart--💓
Broken Heart-- 💔
Sparkling Heart--💖
Growing Heart--💗
Heart with Arrow/ Fall in Love--💘
Blue Heart--💙
Green Heart--💚
Yellow Heart--💛
Red Heart--❤️
Purple Heart --💜
Heart with Ribbon--💝

 In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (26 g) of coconut oil and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (21 g) of honey. Stir until the ingredients are fully blended.You can substitute olive oil if you don’t have coconut oil.
 When the coconut oil and honey are blended, add in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (12.5 g) of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of pumpkin pie spice. Mix the scrub well until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.If you want your scrub to have a stronger flavor, you can mix in a little more of the pumpkin pie spice. Just add it in small increments so you don’t alter the texture of the scrub.
 Once you’re happy with the texture and flavor of the scrub, use a spoon to put in a small covered jar. To use the scrub, scoop out a small amount with your finger and rub it over your lips. Lick the residue away, and follow up with a lip balm.

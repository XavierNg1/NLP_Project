 You can help your hair loss by changing your hair routine. Avoid shampooing too often because frequent shampooing can strip the natural oils from your hair. Frequent shampooing doesn’t really cause hair loss, but if you are stripping the oils from your hair, it can make the hair more fragile.


It is recommended that you only wash your hair two to three times a week., There are some shampoos that are loaded with chemicals. The extra chemicals can be rough on your hair, dry it out, and make your hair loss worse. Try natural shampoos instead that have ingredients that will nourish your hair, not strip the nutrients from it.


Avoid using products with ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), parabens, and ammonium chloride, especially if you have thin, fragile, or treated hair., Hair loss might be caused by too much conditioner. Conditioners can weigh down the roots of the hair and damage the hair follicles, which can cause it to break and fall out. Use a conditioner one to two times a week and avoid using conditioner on the scalp.Try a natural conditioner as well, such as Nature’s Gate, Babo Botanicals, WEN, and Intelligent Nutrients.

 If you have a one piece suit, do the 2-piece method in reverse. Take off the top of your swimsuit and roll it down to about your stomach. Towel-dry the exposed skin, then put your bra and shirt on.
 Take off your entire swimsuit now, then put on your underwear and pants. Good job! This should take a maximum of 5 minutes, but you'll get faster with practice.

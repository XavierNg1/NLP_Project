 Many people assume a plantain ripens the same way as a banana. While the fruits look similar, plantains look much different than bananas when ripe. While you can fry or bake plantains before they're completely ripe, if you intend to eat them raw you need to wait until they're ripe.Plantains are mostly black when ripe with a few yellow streaks.
Plantains that are completely black are still edible, but may be a little overripe.
 Plantains are best left unrefrigerated. This is especially true if they have not yet ripened. Refrain from refrigerating plantains until they're at your desired stage of ripeness.

Topaz comes in many varied colors with natural blue topaz being so light, it appears almost clear. Treated stones can come in a variety of blues and levels of saturation. Unless a stone is colorless, the assumption should be that it was heat-treated.
Heat treating involves heating the stones at varying temperatures and lengths of time to achieve blues that range from greenish to the more valuable London blue, which has a gray tint. The stones can also be almost aqua, sky blue or electric blue.;

Because rough topaz stones are available in such large pre-cut sizes, the stones cut by professionals should be practically flawless. If they are not flawless, they should be extremely inexpensive. Total clarity is the industry standard for the blue topaz. Light should travel unhindered through the stone, which should have a smooth and highly-reflective surface.
The value of the blue topaz often depends more on the cut than on the stone itself, so look for unique, striking cuts. A well-cut stone will shimmer when held to the light.



Blue topaz is a moderately-priced gem, so shop around to find the best deal. Prices for darker blue stones have gone up recently, mostly due to the lagging economy. To get the deeper colors the stones have to be treated for a longer period of time, which means they are held longer before they are sold.

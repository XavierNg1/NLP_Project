 You can slip a stitch knit-wise or purl-wise. (If no method is indicated, assume purl-wise.)

To slip a stitch knit-wise, insert the right needle into the next stitch from left to right, as if you were going to knit. Don't put the yarn over your needle, though; simply move the stitch from the left needle to the right needle. This method is more visible.
To slip a stitch purl-wise, insert the right needle into the next stitch from right to left, as if you were going to purl. Simply move the stitch from the left needle to the right needle. This method is nearly invisible.;
, Another variable to slipping stitches while knitting is whether your unknitted yarn stays in back (from where it is usually worked) or moves in front of the work. If you need to do a slip stitch "wyif" (with yarn in front), move the yarn such that it is between your needles and in front of the work. After the slip stitch, return it to the back position. If not otherwise noted, assume the slip stitch is "wyib" (with yarn in back).

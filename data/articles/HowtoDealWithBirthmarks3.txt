 There are a wide variety of cover-ups that you can purchase that will help cover your birthmark. Cover-ups can vary in tone and color, so be sure to choose one that matches your skin tone. Look for cover-up at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store and speak to an employee about which brands they recommend. Many cover-ups are also sold online, with blogs devoted entirely to reviewing their quality.


Ask questions like, “Which cover-up would you recommend for my skin tone?” or “Are there cover-ups specifically for covering birthmarks?”

, Cover your birthmark with clothes if your birthmark is on an area of your body that can be covered with clothes or accessories. Wearing concealing clothes is a cheap and simple way to conceal your birthmark without having to undergo extensive treatments. Try wearing clothing that extends to your wrists or ankles if your birthmark is lower down on your arms or legs.


If you live in an area where it is generally too warm to wear long clothing, try to keep concealing clothing in your bag or backpack so that you only need to wear it when necessary.
 There are a wide range of blogs online that detail how to cover a birthmark, the best products to purchase, and the most effective way to apply your solution. Most use a combination of products, from cover-up and concealer to blushes. Blogs will also provide you with many options that span a varying range of prices and availability, some being more expensive, others being significantly cheaper.


Try consulting sites like realsimple to see which blogs might be useful and what materials they might offer.

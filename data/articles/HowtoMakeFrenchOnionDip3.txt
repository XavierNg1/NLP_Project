 Simply heat the olive oil and the butter in a skillet over medium to high heat, and add the diced onions when the butter has melted. Stir or toss the ingredients to thoroughly combine them and then turn the heat to low and cook for about 10-12 minutes, continuing to stir as you cook. Here's what else you should do:









After cooking over low heat for 10-12 minutes, sprinkle 1/4-1/2 tsp. of salt onto the mixture and keep cooking for another 15-25 minutes, or until the onions are amber in color and begin to get translucent.
Add 6-8 cloves of garlic in the last 5 minutes or so. If you add them sooner, they may burn a bit.
You can even add 1/2 a teaspoon of brown or white sugar at the midway cooking point if you want to sweeten them up a bit.
 You can turn on your oven while you caramelize your onions since it will take some time for it to heat up.
 Use either an ordinary pie plate or an 8 x 8" pan for the cream cheese, Gruyere, Parmesan, and the caramelized onions. If you're not a big Gruyere fan, you can substitute it with regular Swiss cheese. You can also combine the ingredients in a bowl first and then place them on the pie plate if that's easier.
 Bake the ingredients until the dish is hot in the middle and golden on top. Check on it every few minutes to make sure that you haven't burned the onions.

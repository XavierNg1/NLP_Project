 Just as many constellations are associated with myths or legends, the stars within them were given their names for the myths they were associated with.


The constellation Gemini represents the twin sons of Queen Leda of Sparta who could not be separated by the death of 1 of them. The names of the 2 brightest stars in that constellation, Castor and Pollux, were the twins' names.
The 7 brightest stars of the Pleiades represented and are named for the 7 daughters of Atlas and Pleione pursued by Orion: Alcyone, Celaeno, Electra, Maia, Merope, Sterope, and Taygeta.
The proper name of the brightest star in the constellation Canis Major, Sirius, means "searing" or "scorching." This name derives from the ancient Egyptians' belief that when Sirius rose with the sun in early August, it added its heat to the sun's. (Sirius' nickname, the "Dog Star," is the origin of the phrase "dog days of summer" for this time period.)
A star's proper name may derive from a different myth than that of the constellation it is in. The star Alkaid was seen as the leader of a funeral procession and so named by the Egyptians, but the constellation it is found in, Ursa Major, was seen as a bear by the Greeks.;
, Many stars' proper names derive from their position within their own constellation or a neighboring constellation.


The bright star Deneb in the constellation Cygnus comes from the Arabic for "tail," as it represents the swan's tail. Likewise, the star Denebola in Leo represents the lion's tail, and the star Deneb Kaitos in Cetus represents the whale's tail.
ï¿½Betelgeuse" means "armpit" and "Rigel" means "foot" in Arabic; the stars Betelgeuse and Rigel are the right armpit and left foot, respectively, of the constellation Orion.
The name of the star Arcturus in the constellation Bootes means "bear driver'; it follows the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor as they orbit the Celestial North Pole.
 Some proper star names derive from properties astronomers were able to observe, either with the naked eye or crude lenses.


The star Algol in Perseus takes its name from the Arabic "al ghul," meaning "ghoul" or "demon." The star is an eclipsing binary that appears dimmer when the dimmer star is closer to Earth than the brighter star. (The star represents the head of Medusa, the Gorgon slain by Perseus.)
The star Mira in Cetus takes its name from the Latin word meaning "wonderful" (the same root as "miracle"). It is a variable star that changes in brightness over a regular period of time.
 While modern star registries allow people to give unofficial names to stars to honor themselves or their loved ones, a few official proper star names were given for similar reasons. The star Cor Caroli in the constellation Canes Venatici was named in honor of Great Britain's King Charles II; its name means "Charles' Heart."

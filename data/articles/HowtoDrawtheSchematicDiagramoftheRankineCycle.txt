 There are 4 major components in the Rankine cycle: boiler, turbine, condenser, and pump. In your paper, imagine the 4 cardinal directions (North, East, South, West). These positions are where you will draw the components, respectively.
 This is in the "North". Draw a rectangle and label it as "BOILER"., This is in the "East". Make a trapezoid where the bases are vertical. The longer base is on the right., This is in the "South". Draw a rectangle and label it as "CONDENSER"., This is in the "West". Draw a circle., Draw a horizontal line from the end of the boiler. Connect a vertical line and continue downwards until it touches the turbine. The vertical line must touch the turbine at the left portion of the trapezoid., Draw a vertical line that starts at the right portion of the trapezoid. Continue downwards and then draw a horizontal line and connect it to the condenser., Draw another set of horizontal and vertical lines to connect the 2 components. The connection to the pump must be a horizontal line that terminates at the center of the circle., Draw another set of lines. The starting line of the pump must be tangent to the circle.,, State 1 is the entry to the turbine, 2 is entry to the condenser, 3 is entry to the pump, and 4 is entry to the boiler., You may want to also learn how to draw the Temperature-Entropy diagram of the cycle since it will come in handy when analyzing steam power plants.

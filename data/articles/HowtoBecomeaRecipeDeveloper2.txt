 When you work for a company or publication, they may assign you a broader idea for an article. For instance, they may want you to create four distinct dishes for the holiday of Kwanzaa. This challenges you to create unique and distinct dishes and tests your skills as a recipe developer.


When you aren't working for a company, a great way to get inspired is to impose these criteria upon yourself. You may come up with some interesting results.
 Do your research on the ingredients and components within your recipe and determine things like how they taste and the most common methods to cook them. This knowledge will give you a better understanding of how to use these ingredients in a plethora of dishes. Research may also reveal commonalities in other recipes which enable you to deviate from the norm.For example, different apples have different textures and some, like Granny Smith and Fuji apples, are better for baking than others., Write down a recipe based on the research that you did and your experience. Estimate when writing down quantities of each ingredient. While it seems counter-intuitive to write the recipe down before you cook it, it will give you an outline to work off of after you cook your meal.
 Follow the steps and quantity of ingredients based off the recipe that you wrote. If you know that a step is out of order or that a quantity of an ingredient isn't right, adjust the recipe and alter it to your knowledge. Critically assess the recipe and make adjustments. This may be easier if you have other people who can also taste your food.Take note of whether your spice quantities are accurate and examine your recipe's cooking times. Alter your recipe based on your experiences during practice.


When choosing people to cook for, make sure that they enjoy the selected cuisine.
Change and alter your recipe based on suggestions and comments made by those tasting the food.

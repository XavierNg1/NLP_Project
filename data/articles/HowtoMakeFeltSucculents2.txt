 Start rolling from one of the long edges, and use a line of hot glue along the other long edge to secure the stem. Set the stem aside when you are done.Succulents are typically dark green or pale, green-grey, but you can make your succulents any color you want.
 Keep the bottom of the each leaf straight. You can make the edges curved or straight, however., Place the stem on top of it; make sure that it is centered and perpendicular to the leaf base (not parallel). The leaf should be about ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) up the side of the stem., Take your second leaf, and draw a line of hot glue along the base. Place the leaf over the stem, making sure that the two leaves align. Run your finger along the base of the leaf to seal the glue., Once the glue has set, gently grip the two leaves by their points, and pull them down so that they are perpendicular to the stem., Rotate your stem so that you see just the sides of your first set of leaves. They should be making a slight V-shape. Glue down your next set of leaves in a similar fashion, sandwiching the stem between them, then pull the points down., Keep about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) between each set of leaves. Remember to alternate the direction that the leaves are facing in. Your last set of leaves should be flush with the top of the stem. Pull them down so that they are perpendicular to the stem., These leaves should be shaped just like the others, but only ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) tall and wide., Make sure that the mini leaves are pointing in the opposite direction as the ones just below it. Do not pull the mini leaves apart.

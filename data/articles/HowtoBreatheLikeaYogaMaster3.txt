 To do this, practice contracting the vocal cords until you can produce a steady, drawn-out "h" sound.You should feel a slight contraction in your throat as you whisper the "h" sound. It should not be painful or uncomfortable., Draw in a long, deep breath through your parted lips. Focus on contracting the vocal cords while you inhale, so you produce a soft "ocean sound" as you breathe in., As you exhale through your parted lips, focus on continuing to contract the vocal cords to produce the sustained "h" sound associated with Ujjayi pranayama.Once you've perfected the exhalation through your mouth, practice breathing out through your nostrils instead. With some experience, you should be able to produce the "h" sound while breathing out through the nose just as you did through the mouth.

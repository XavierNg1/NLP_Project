 This contest is open to students in grades 9-12. The rules change every year, so make sure to look up the official rules for your current year.



You will need: 44 round, colored beads (blue for cytosine, yellow for guanine, red for thymine, and green for adenine) and 2 pieces of elastic.
Tie the pieces of elastic together at the end (about 5 cm in).
Add the beads as you want- except for one rule. Adenine (green) always pairs with thymine (red) and cytosine (blue) always pairs with guanine (yellow). You can do it in random order if you'd like, but it won't look as realistic.

 Using weights helps with speed, agility and power. Do significant work-outs around 3-5 times a week. Anything more could end up hurting you more than it does help you.;
, Things such as jumping rope, jogging/sprinting, and actually playing help increase your athletic ability and make you a better running back overall.
 It is just a game and it's not the end of the world if you don't get as good as you want to be. It may simply be that your expectations are too high.
 Straight line speed, acceleration, and lateral agility is crucial to dodge defenders and get to the endzone, or even just make it to the sidelines to stop the clock. It doesn't matter how big or small you are, if you can't get away from defenders, you'll never reach where you want to be.
 Tuck the ball as close to your body as possible. Give defenders as little chance to knock the ball away as possible. And if you have to catch the ball on a screen pass or if you have to return a punt, learn to catch the ball with both hands first before you are doing one-handed grabs for the camera.
 It doesn't matter how little you are, even if you are the fastest man on turf, you will still get tackled. You will get gang-tackled by 2 or 3 people trying to bring you down. Protecting the ball is more important, but being able to take the hits, lay a strong stiff-arm and shed tackles is just as important. Bulking up can help you become a better blocker as well, as running backs are sometimes used for extra pass-protection.
 It doesn't matter if you are trying to keep your knees from hitting the ground from the first tackle, or if you are trying to stay in bounds, you can avoid some injuries, too.
 You have to read the defense as well as your quarterback. Sometimes, you may even have to break up a supposed outside run and you must run inside (or vice versa).

 Facebook has a variety of built-in Smiley faces that you can quickly add to your Facebook chats by typing the correct code. These Smileys work in chats as well as comments and status updates. Note: It used to be possible to link to someone's profile image to use as a Smiley, but this feature has since been removed.

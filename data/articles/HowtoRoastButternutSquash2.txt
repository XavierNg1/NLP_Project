, Add dabs of butter evenly across each half.
 Sprinkle salt and freshly black pepper across each half. Toss the thyme sprigs here and there on the halves.
 Roast for 45-50 minutes, or until the squash feels tender to the knife point or a fork. At least some parts of the squash should appear golden brown in coloring.
 Carve the halves as wished. This dish looks nice if left whole when taken to the table, with a knife provided to encourage diners to carve off their own pieces.

 Whether you’re taking prescription medication or wanting to combine over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, consult a pharmacist or health professional to avoid any negative reactions.For example, if you’re taking antidepressants, sleeping pills, or anti-anxiety drugs, avoid over-the-counter medications containing antihistamines that make you sleepy. The combination can have harmful side effects and can also be lethal in some cases.;
, Not all over-the-counter medications will help you sleep better. Also, many sleep medications and pain killers help you fall asleep but reduce the quality of your sleep. Avoid cold and flu medications that contain pseudoephedrine or ephedrine.If you have to take these medications, take them 2 or 3 hours before you plan on going to sleep.
Take these decongestants when you know you will be awake and medicines that have drowziness-causing painkillers or antihistamines when you want to sleep.
 While nasal sprays can decongest your nose for 8 hours or more, they may also contain stimulants that make it difficult for you to sleep.Look for nasal sprays with oxymetazoline or xylometazoline to best open the breathing passage in your nose. Oxymetazoline and xylometazoline are not stimulants so they won't keep you up at night.
Nose strips mechanically open up the nasal passages, so thus they have no stimulating effect as well.
 While your appetite may decrease, ensure you don’t get dehydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. High-calorie drinks, like hot chocolate or Ovaltine, can signal our bodies to go into sleep mode.Research has shown that a hot cordial can aid in many cold and flu symptoms like sneezing and coughing.
 Get rid of distractions like a tv, computer, or other electronic devices. Also, regulate a comfortable temperature as keeping your room cool will aid with sleeping.Dry-humidifiers and vaporizers may help with your breathing while keeping the atmosphere of your room conducive to sleeping.

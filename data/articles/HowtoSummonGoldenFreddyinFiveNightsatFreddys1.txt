 Then open the monitor and go to CAM 2BÂ (West Hall Corner) and flip the monitor up and down until you see a poster of a close-up of Golden Freddy's face.


Note that this method does not work on Android devices.;
, You'll see Golden Freddy sitting in front of you.
 If you want him to kill you, just leave him there for a few seconds, but opening the monitor is the only way (besides completing a night) for him to disappear.

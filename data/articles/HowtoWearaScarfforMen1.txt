The ends of the scarf should hang down straight over your chest.
Both ends should be even in length.
The best type of scarf to use for this style is a short- to medium-length rectangular scarf. The ends can be square-cut or fringed, depending on your own personal style preference.
Note that this style is more fashion-oriented than practical. It is not an especially warm way to wear your scarf, so it may be better to save this look for a more tolerable day instead of a frigid one.;
, Draping your scarf over the front of your overcoat makes it the focal point of your outfit, while wearing it inside creates a more subtle effect.


To wear it on the inside, tuck the draped ends into the coat so that they cover the chest area exposed by the coat's neckline. Close your overcoat over the scarf and readjust the scarf as needed until it is even under your collar.
To wear the scarf on the outside, pop the collar of your overcoat up and place the scarf at the base of the collar at the back of your neck. Let the scarf hang down naturally over your coat.

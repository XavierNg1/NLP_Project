 Stopping and starting puts stress on the engine that can cause it to overheat, especially in older cars. Ease off the break and let your car roll forward slowly, knowing that you will likely have to stop again when you reach the next car's bumper anyway.Making checking your temperature gauge a regular habit at red lights and stop signs.
 The AC uses engine power to cool the air in the car, putting extra strain on the engine. The first thing you should do when overheating is to turn off the AC, but you should avoid using it at all if you fear your car might overheat for any reason.


If you are very late for an inspection, find a leak in your radiator, have unresolved AC issues, or are low on coolant, try not to use the AC at all., Old oil can lead to overheating, especially when coupled with low coolant or other issues. Whenever you get your car's oil changed, ask the mechanics to look at your fan as well -- spotting an issue now can save you a costly fix later on.


You should hear your fan whirring after you've turned you car off, as it is still working to cool your car off., Check your coolant reservoir and make sure that the levels are still where they need to be as indicated on the sides. If they are a little low, mix equal parts coolant and water and add it to the recommended level. This is especially important if you live in hot areas.When checking the coolant, take 2-3 minutes to search for any leaks as well. Coolant is usually green and smells sweet. Check under the car, around the engine, and on any hoses or radiator parts that you can see.

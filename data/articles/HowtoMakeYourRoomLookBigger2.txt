 Clear the clutter. Keep only what you use. If you haven’t used something in a year, get rid if it. Add wall shelves to free up floor space, use tables or ottomans that have storage compartments.


Add shelves or hooks in the closet. Place small items in baskets or boxes on the shelves. A bureau may not be needed.
Add a hook to the back of your door for your coats and accessories.
Get a storage bed. A bed that has alcoves for storage, or an elevated one that you can place storage boxes under is a great space saver. If you want, you can even add a bedskirt to hide the boxes further., Either keep your wall shelves and pictures closer to the floor, or put shelves closer to the ceiling. Don’t put things in the middle as this will split the height of the room.


If you place any art on the walls lower to the ground, it will give your ceiling the illusion of being taller.
Alternatively, placing wall shelves closer to the ceiling will have a similar heightening effect.
 Your ceiling is one of the largest spaces in any room, and is the most underutilized. While it’s not always possible, you can hang things or paint your ceiling to create more open space.


If you have bikes, you can hang the bikes from your ceiling with a pulley system, freeing up plenty of floor space.,


Wallpapering your ceiling creates an illusion. An illusion that attracts your eyes upwards and makes your room look taller.
Minimize hanging lights. One hanging light can draw focus, but too many will make your ceiling look lower. Opt for more floor lighting.

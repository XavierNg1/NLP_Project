 Minecraft is a sandbox game in which you can do anything you want to regardless of the version (Classic, Alpha, Beta, Full release).;
, The controls might be difficult to handle for some people, but you can always change them! If you want to look around, you need to move your mouse around. If you wish to destroy blocks, hold left mouse button until the block breaks. To place a block, click the right mouse button. You can interact with some blocks by pressing the right mouse button without a placeable block in your hand.
 When you feel bored in Minecraft, you can always explore other caves, install some mods, learn how Redstone works and build to whatever you desire. You could even create hidden corridors, gather even more resources, look for villages and trade with the villagers.

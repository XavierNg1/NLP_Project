"This phrase is almost identical in meaning and pronunciation to the Mandarin version of "hello."


Even in native Chinese script, the Mandarin and Cantonese versions of "hello" are both written as 你好.
The romanization of these two greetings is different, however, and there are slight variations in pronunciation between the two. The Cantonese néih hóu is somewhat softer than the Mandarin nǐ hǎo.
Instead of pronouncing the greeting as nee how, pronounce it more like nay ho.
 As with néih hóu, this telephone greeting is almost identical to its Mandarin counterpart in terms of meaning and pronunciation.


As in Mandarin, the native Chinese script is written as 喂.
The way to pronounce wái is slightly different in Cantonese. Pronounce it more like why instead of whey. It sounds kind of like way, but puts more emphasis on the "ay" and lower your voice a bit.

 Use dish detergent and hot water to scrub the jars and lids, especially if they were previously used. Make sure to thoroughly rinse them with running water to remove any soap.;
, Once the water begins to boil, turn the heat down so that it stays at a simmer rather than a rolling boil. Dunk the lids inside the water and allow them to remain there for about five minutes before removing them with jar tongs.
 Boil a large stockpot of water on the stove top over high heat. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, carefully dunk the jars into the water using jar tongs, moving carefully to avoid burning yourself or letting the jars clunk together. Allow the items to sit in the boiling water for ten minutes.


Alternatively, you can use a hot water cycle on your dishwasher to sanitize the jars, as well. Do not add dish detergent if you previously washed the pieces by hand. If you do add soap, make sure that the dishwasher goes through a full rinse cycle before pulling the jars and lids out.
Make sure that the washing and sanitizing occurs immediately before the jars are ready to be filled. Both the jars and lids need to be hot in order to safely hold the hot contents you will be pouring in.
 Use a clean dish towel or paper towels to wipe the jars and lids dry. Allowing them to air dry naturally may cause them to cool too much.

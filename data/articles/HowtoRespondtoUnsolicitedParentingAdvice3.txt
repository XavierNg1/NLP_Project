 You’ll have an easier time responding to unwanted advice if you’ve done your research ahead of time. Reading up on the latest parenting news and advice will give you the confidence that you’re doing what’s best for your baby, and if people try to tell you to do things differently, you’ll be able to back up your parenting decisions with facts., Often a debate isn’t worth the time or energy it requires. Save your sanity and decide ahead of time which issues you want to stand your ground on and which aren’t as important.


Many minor disagreements aren’t worth more than a nod and a “Thanks, I’ll think about it.” If your parents, in-laws, or other loved ones have different ideas than you about parenting, but those ideas don’t go against any of your strongly held convictions, consider humoring them when they’re around to keep family peace., If you know that you and your sister-in-law are never going to agree on a certain parenting issue, avoid the topic when you’re together. There’s nothing to be gained from an argument when neither person is going to change their mind.


If someone else brings the topic up, don’t engage – try to redirect the conversation to something neutral instead. For example, someone says “So, are you going to breastfeed?” If you know this will start a heated debate, simply say “Speaking of breasts, I can’t believe how large mine have gotten! I always thought that was exaggeration…”

, People who take it upon themselves to give you parenting advice are usually doing it because they want to help you, not annoy you. Have some real questions of your own lined up to make the advice-givers feel useful.


For example, even if you don’t need help with feedings, perhaps you’d love some advice on getting your baby to sleep through the night. Say “Gee, thanks! Although I’m not too worried about feedings, I’d like to hear your take on developing a good sleep schedule.”

Chrome reflects brighter, clearer, and with less distortion than other finishes, such as paint.
Decorative chrome plating electroplates nickel and chrome onto a target object, such as a wheel rim or a hood ornament.
The nickel is the source of the slickness, shine, and resistance in the chrome plating.
A very thin layer of chrome keeps the nickel from tarnishing, scratching, and rusting.;

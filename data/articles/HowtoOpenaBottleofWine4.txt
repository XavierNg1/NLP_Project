 Use a kitchen knife to score the foil just below the lip of the wine bottle, then remove the foil cap and throw it away.
 Sit down on a steady chair and hold the wine bottle in a secure position between your legs. The top of the bottle should be pointing downward, while the base of the bottle should be pointing up.
 Make sure you hold the bottle steady with your legs and one hand, and use the other to rap the base of the bottle with the sole of a flat shoe. With each strike, the cork should dislodge a little.


Strike the bottle firmly and evenly across the base. Don't hit it as hard as you can, and don't graze the edge, or the bottle may break. However, if it doesn't seem to be making progress, you may need to hit it harder.
Make sure the bottle is in a stable position. Don't just hold it between your thighs; use your free hand to grasp it, too.
 Take a look at the cork's progress, then continue striking the bottle until the cork has dislodged enough that you can grasp it with your hand and pull it out of the bottle.


If you try pulling out the cork and it's still firmly inside the bottle, turn it upside down and strike it a few more times before trying again.
Don't strike the bottle until the cork pops out on its own, or you may lose a few glasses of wine.

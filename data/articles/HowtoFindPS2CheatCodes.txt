 Before trying to find the cheat codes, you need to know what game you're actually going to cheat on. Websites that have cheat codes will have them for hundreds of games, not just your one. To save you the trouble of searching through that big long list of games, decide what game you want to cheat on in the first place.;
, A big giveaway as to whether or not cheats exist in a game is the menu that actually allows you to enter the cheats. This is usually found in the "options" or "settings" screen. If your game does not have a section to enter cheats, there's a chance that cheats do not even exist in that particular game. If this is the case, choose another game.
 A good place to start looking is the internet. Simply perform a Google search saying "cheats for PS2". Be sure to include the console that you want the cheats on too, the cheats are probably different on every console even if it's the same game. If a website that looks legit comes up when you do your Google search, click it to see if the cheats on there work in the game.
 The most common cheats are "cheat codes". These require you to enter an actual code or word into the game. This is where the cheat menu found in the "options" or "settings" screen comes into play. Simply type in the word and the cheat should be unlocked. Not all of these cheats work but if the code is not working, check your spelling. If your spelling is correct, the cheat may be fake. Don't worry about it, just move on to the next one. Other cheats require you to actually perform certain actions while playing the game.

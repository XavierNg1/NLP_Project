 Place 32 ramps that have been cleaned and trimmed on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of extra virgin olive oil over them, and season them with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss the mixture well so the ramps are well coated.You can season the ramps with any other spices that you like, such as cumin or crushed red pepper.
 To ensure that the grill is hot enough for the ramps, it’s important to preheat it. Turn half of the burners on to the highest heat setting, and cover the grill. Allow it to heat for at least 10 minutes.Make sure that the grilling grate is cleaned and oiled before you grill the ramps.
If you’re using a charcoal grill, use one full chimney of lit charcoal but arrange the coals on only one side of the grill. Place the grill grate over them, and allow the grill to preheat for 5 minutes.
 When the grill is preheated, use tongs to place the ramps on the heated side of the grate. Let them cook until they become tender and slightly charred along the edges, which should take approximately 2 minutes.Be sure to turn the ramps occasionally as you grill them to ensure that they cook evenly.
 When the ramps are finished grilling, transfer them to a serving platter with tongs. Pour a little more olive oil over them and serve while they’re still warm.Grilled ramp make a delicious side for any meat that you’ve grilled.
They are also a tasty topping for burgers and steaks.

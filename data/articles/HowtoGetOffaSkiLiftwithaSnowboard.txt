, Sit sideways so that your board is straight out in front of you to clear ramp. Stand up slowly when your snowboard can touch the ground.
 Allow the chair to push you from behind to give you a boost. While being pushed, lean your entire body slightly forward (the front tip of the board), about 3-5 degrees, just enough to actually put some of your weight forward. This will keep you from falling backwards while moving down ramp of the lift. Look UP and straight ahead. Do not look down at the floor, look where you are going. Donâ€™t try to move on your own. Go straight to clear the ramp.
 Don't hit your head on the chair. Duck a bit and move away from it. If you do fall try to move out of the way as fast you can.

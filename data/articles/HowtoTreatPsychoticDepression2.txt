 As a person having depressive or suicidal thoughts, potentially suffering from hallucinations and delusions, you should build up a strong network of social support. As the psychotic features become less severe, having a network that can help counsel you and identify your misconceptions, delusions, and hallucinations is very helpful.Look for support groups at local community centers. If you are unable to participate in groups in your community, look for online support groups.
 Invite family members to participate in support groups with you or to accompany you to a counseling appointment. This will help them better understand your experiences and feel more comfortable talking to you about your condition.


Family therapy is a great way to involve multiple family members with the guidance of a mental health professional.
 Join a local advocacy group for depression or psychosis to help you better understand your condition and effectively communicate with others. This will create networking opportunities and help you identify resources.


National Alliance on Mental Illness is a good place to start.

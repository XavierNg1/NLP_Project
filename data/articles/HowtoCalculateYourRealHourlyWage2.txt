 The easiest way to determine this is to start with the paid hours for your job every week. If you have a 40 hour per week job, you can annualize this by multiplying it by 52 (the number of weeks in a year). Estimate your overtime hours by using previous years as an example, or making an educated guess (for example, 1 hour per week on average).


Your annual work hours, for example, may be 2080 (or 40 x 52).
 If you commute one hour to and from work each day, add two hours to your total work time each day. Time spent going to and from work is technically time spent devoted to your job even though you are not getting paid, and it should be considered as part of your total work time.


One easy way to do this is simply to multiply the amount of time spent commuting every day by the number of days spent working, and then adding this to your annual hours spent working.
 If you spend time at home checking emails, doing projects, or doing any other time at work (for which you are not paid), include this, as these are hours devoted to work.


Ask yourself how many hours per week on average you devote to at home work, and multiply this by 52.

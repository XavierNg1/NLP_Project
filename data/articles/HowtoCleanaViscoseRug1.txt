 The nap or pile is the natural direction that the rug's fibers run. Running your hand across the surface of the rug will give you an indication to how the rug's fibers lay.Agitating the rug against the pile can loosen the rug's fibers and distort your rug.;
, High power vacuum cleaners and vacuums with beater brushes can damage the fibers in a viscose rug. Instead, use a non-electrical rug or carpet sweeper and run it along the direction of the rug's nap or pile. This should lift up any remaining crumbs or dirt stuck in the rug.You can go over the rug several times if it's still dirty.
 Do not go over the fringes on the rug with a carpet sweeper or vacuum because you could detach the fringes from the rug. Instead, use a broom or brush and brush the dirt and debris from out of the fringes. Use a dustpan to collect and dispose of the leftover dust., Test the dish soap on a small part of the rug before using it. If you notice discoloration or staining, don't use it. If there is a larger area that you need to clean, mild dish soap and water is a good solution. Saturate a rag with cold water and a drop of pH neutral dish soap, then rub the rag in the direction of the nap. When you're done, blot over the area with a dry rag until it's dry.Do not use detergents because they can stain and alter the color in your rug.
 Cleaning spills as soon as they happen will cut down on the size and severity of the stain. For especially tough stains, try spot cleaning the area with a mixture of water, white vinegar, and mild dish soap. Mix the solution together and skim the bubbles on the top of the solution with a rag. Use the rag with the bubbles on it to wipe down the stain then immediately remove the solution with a clean, damp rag.Do not oversaturate the rag in the solution or you may damage your rug.
You can also spray a fabric softener on the rug after spot cleaning it to keep it soft.

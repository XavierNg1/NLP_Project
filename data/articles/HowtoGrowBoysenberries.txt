 Boysenberries enjoy mild winters and warm summers.;
, Add a lot of well-rotted manure to the ground before planting.
 The best method for growing boysenberries is to place a two-wire trellis system in the planting area. Erect this prior to planting.


Tie the fruiting canes to the top wire of the two-wire trellis.
Use the second wire to train new growth that will fruit in the following year.
, The main difference is that boysenberries require a lot more vigorous pruning to prevent their growth from getting out of hand.
 A well tended boysenberry plant should produce fruit well for up to 15 years. Expect about 5kg of fruit each season from each plant.


Cut back the top growing canes (the ones attached to the top wire) at the end of the harvest. Cut them down to ground level. In turn, transfer the new growth canes to the top wire level in readiness for next season.
 Boysenberries can be made into ice cream, baked in cakes, pies, and crumbles, or enjoyed fresh on their own or with a dollop of cream or ice cream.

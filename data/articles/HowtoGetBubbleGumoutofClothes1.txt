 You will need to fold it small enough to fit into a plastic bag the size of your choice. Avoid spreading the gum to other parts of the clothing.;
, Seal the bag shut but make sure that the gum does not stick to the plastic bag.
 The gum should freeze entirely and become hard, making it easier to remove.
 Take the clothing out of the bag.
 Don't allow the gum to warm back up at all if possible. You can use any sort of blade such as a butter knife or paint scraper to remove the gum. If it does not come off, place it back in the freezer.

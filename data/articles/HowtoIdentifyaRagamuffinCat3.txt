 If you get a Ragamuffin cat from a breeder, be sure to use a reputable one who is well-known in the community or who is connected to various Ragamuffin support groups or breeding societies.Members of such societies typically have to adhere to a certain code of ethics, which means you can trust that your cat is a true Ragamuffin., Most certified breeders will be able to provide you with documentation proving that the cat is a purebred Ragamuffin. This document should be accepted by any Ragamuffin breeding society as authentic and allow you to show your cat, if you so wish.


This document should include the breeder’s information, as well as info about the ancestry of the cat – including its parents.
 Take the cat to your local veterinarian’s office and ask them about whether or not they believe this to be a Ragamuffin cat. The vet can inspect the cat’s physical features and personality traits in order to help you determine the breed.A vet may even be able to do a DNA test to confirm the cat’s ancestry and breed.

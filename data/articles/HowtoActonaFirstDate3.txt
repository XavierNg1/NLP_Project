 You don't want to go too deep too quickly, but you do want to open up a dialogue. Try some interesting questions.As an example, you could ask "What's your favorite book of all time? Why do you like it?" or "Where did you grow up? What was it like?"

, That is, don't hide truths about yourself if he or she asks. Everyone tells little white lies, but if you say you're a doctor when you're really only a nursing assistant, that will come back to bite you later.
 Becoming too intimate too quickly can scare people off. Keep it cool and casual for the first date., You wouldn't talk about every mistake you've made on the job in the past on a job interview. The same holds true for a first date. You don't have to lay out all your personal flaws and mistakes on the first date. In fact, it's a good idea not to. You just want to make a connection with the other person, and saying too much too soon can push her or him away., That is, your date does want to hear about you. Don't always deflect the question back to your date. Tell him or her about who you are.As an example, if your date asks, "What's your favorite type of movie?," don't just say, "Oh, you know, I like most movies." Instead, you could say, "I really enjoy a wide spectrum, everything from goofy musicals to horror flicks. In fact, last night I watched Hairspray and Woman in Black. What do you like?"

, Saying goodbye is the last impression you leave your date with. Don't just say a quick goodbye. Take a minute to give your date a hug, kiss, or handshake, and talk about plans for getting in touch in the future.As an example, you could say, "I really enjoyed our date. I loved talking about baseball with you. When can I get in touch with you again?"

 Either way, get there. You can also take the MTA subway line, if you aren't near this location but are in the vicinity of an NYC subway station.
 The E line is the most direct route, and for most of the route maintains an "Express" schedule. The route to the Huntington beach subway location, will make you take another line spurring off from Jamaica.
 The trip from the Jamaica station to the airport takes about 10 minutes. However, the location at the airport will depend on how many people arrive on the train with you and who gets on and who gets off at these intended destinations, so it could take a little bit longer.

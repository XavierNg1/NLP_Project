 You can help make your attic less inviting by removing easily accessible food sources from the exterior of your home and your yard. Keep your trash cans secured, avoid keeping any pet food accessible outside, and pick up any fruit or nuts that have fallen from trees in your yard., Contrary to what many think, these methods won’t get rid of animals living in your attic or keep them away, especially raccoons and mice.Additionally, mothballs are carcinogens that can cause a potentially harmful environment for humans when not handled properly., It may be impossible to eliminate squirrels from your property, especially if you live in a wooded area or value your trees, but you can provide a comfy alternative to your attic in hopes that they choose the nest that’s easier to reach.

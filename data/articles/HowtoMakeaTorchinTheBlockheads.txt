, A graphical user interface box will appear displaying the icon for a torch.
 Then tap on "craft".


You will need one stick for every torch created.
 The torch will be ready when the status bar is completed. The torch will be transferred to your inventory.


If the torch is not transferred to your inventory, this is probably because it's full. Clear something out or place something in storage.
 Tap on the torch icon in your inventory.;
, This will usually be a wall, including wooden walls. The torch will attach itself to the wall.
 The torch will usually rearrange itself on an adjacent block. If not, you'll likely find it in your inventory and you can simply reset it back in a new spot.
 While you can sometimes push this until your own eyes can't see into the darkness, your Blockhead won't appreciate it and will slow right down. A torch will brighten everything, place and mood!

 Patterns that involve multiple increases and other stitch variations can be a bit harder to follow. Make sure that you pay attention to the differences between rows in the pattern and count your increases to ensure that you are doing the correct amount of pfb stitch sequences., Stitch markers are small plastic rings that you can place on your needles before a stitch to indicate where you need to increase for each round. These can be a great way to simplify your increases and reduce the chances that you will skip one, or do one too many.

If you need to increase by a certain amount in each row or round, then place a stitch marker before the location of each increase to remind yourself.
 Using too much tension can cause purl stitches to pucker, especially when you are working two into the same stitch. However, not enough tension can result in a sloppy appearance. Check the tension on your working yarn as you do your pfb increases to make sure that the tension is not too tight or too loose.

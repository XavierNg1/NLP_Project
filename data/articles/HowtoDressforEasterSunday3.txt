 An Easter bonnet (or hat) is the traditional Easter Sunday accessory, but experiment with more modern accessories to create a look that reflects your style.


Consider jewelry, scarves, handbags and hair accessories when putting together an Easter Sunday outfit. When dressing for an Easter Sunday church service, opt for accessories that add to the elegance of your outfit. When selecting more casual Easter attire, consider bold accessories that add a pop of color or make a dramatic statement.
 Coordinate shoes with the style and colors of the outfit. Or for greater versatility, choose shoes in a nude shade that can later be worn with other outfits.


Consider sling-back pumps or patent leather heels for church attire, or strappy sandals or Mary Janes for more casual Easter attire.
 Men may choose a matching belt and shoes, such as a brown belt with a brown loafer, for a coordinated look. Dress shoes should be polished, especially for Easter Sunday formal attire.


Consider adding color to a suit with a tie and matching handkerchief.
 When choosing accessories for men and women, avoid prominent Easter prints, which are better suited for children.

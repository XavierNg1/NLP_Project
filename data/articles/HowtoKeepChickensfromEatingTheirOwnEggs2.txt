, If your chickens have a calcium deficiency, they will be unable to produce strong egg shells. If the shells are weak and crack when a hen sit or step on them, the hen will eat the broken egg. Once she discovers it contains protein and fats, and that the shell provides the calcium she needs, she will begin cracking and eating them intentionally.Other hens will observe her behavior and follow her lead.


Ground oyster shells or limestone are great sources of calcium for your chickens. Add 2lbs. (1kg) to every 100lbs. (45kg) of feed or provide a side-feeder with these supplements for the chickens to eat.
Give your hens a dish of fresh whole milk every day for several days to increase their calcium intake.Avoid using egg shells as a source of calcium for your chickens, as they may recognize them by sight or smell and begin eating them on their own. If you choose to do this, grind the shells into tiny pieces so the hens can't tell what they are.You may notice your eggs have softer shells when it's hot, as chickens don't retain calcium as efficiently in hot weather. Increase your chickens' calcium supplements on warmer days., Even if they have a balanced, calcium-rich diet, a lack of water can cause your hens to eat the eggs for their liquid content.Hens need more water than most birds, so check to make sure they always have fresh, clean water to drink.


You can add a vitamin supplement to the water to help your hens absorb calcium.

 Accounts that have administrative privileges can change any other user’s password. This will only work if you know the password for the administrator account (or another account with admin privileges.,, This will open a command prompt window.
 For example, net user Wiki * (if “Wiki” is the account that needs a new password). Make sure there is a space between * and the username as shown, then press ↵ Enter.
 You’ll be asked to confirm the password by typing it again. Once the password is confirmed, it can be used to access the account.

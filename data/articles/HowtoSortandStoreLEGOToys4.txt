 These types of containers are usually divided into several compartments, which makes it extremely easy to sort your LEGOs and keep them separated. You can store the boxes on shelves or tables, but they’re also portable, which makes them ideal for taking LEGOs on the go.A tool, tackle, or craft box works best for a small collection. If you have many pieces to hold, you may need multiple boxes.
Avoid boxes with removable dividers because they are usually flimsy, and your LEGOs may end getting mixed together when you move the box around.
 The containers used to hold dry pasta, loose cereal, and other food items can work well for holding LEGOs, and because they’re usually clear, you’ll be able to see exactly what’s inside each canister. You can also easily fit them on shelves, bookcase, and other furniture.If you have old Tupperware or other food storage containers that you’d like to recycle, they can work well for small collections of LEGOs too.
 When you’re short on space, a hanging shoe organizer is an ideal option for LEGOs because you can make use of wall or door space. The organizer’s pockets make it easy to keep your sorted bricks and pieces separated, and the clear plastic allows you to see what’s inside.

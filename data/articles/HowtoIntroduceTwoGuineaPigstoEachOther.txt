 Sex makes a big deal when it comes to how guinea pigs interact with one another. Before you introduce them, you must determine their sex. Pet shop employees often make mistakes, and if you're buying a guinea pig from a pet store the chance of error is even higher.You should examine your guinea pig on the floor or a very low table. This way, if they get away they will not injure themselves falling. Handle your guinea pig gently, but keep a firm hold around their chest and shoulders. Spread their back legs apart to examine their genitals.The distance between the genitals and anus is greater in males than females.The genital opening of male guinea pigs is shaped like a circular dot, while the genital opening of females forms a Y-shape.The genital region of male guinea pigs appears to bulge outward slightly, while it appears flat in females.;
, Certain pairs work better than others when it comes to guinea pigs. Two baby guinea pigs of the same sex get along the easiest. They start off on a more or less blank slate and then grow and change together.If you already have an older guinea pig, getting a baby of the same sex is a good choice. The adult will not feel as threatened by a baby and its dominance will not be challenged.Its best to neuter males before introducing them to females; however, neutered or not, never place more than one male in a group with females. They will fight over the female's attention.Adult females tend to get along more readily than adult males.Understand that if you house two unneutered guinea pigs of a different sex (one male and one female) together, you will end up with babies. Guinea pigs are rapid breeders.
 Male guinea pigs are very territorial, and if you're introducing two adult males take certain precautions.


A spacious cage is key to males living in harmony. Provide them with their own space to eat, hide, sleep, and play â€” provide two of everything.

On the floor of a closed off and small room, such as a bathroom, is a good option.Put veggies, treats, and hay in the center of the area to distract the guinea pigs from fighting as they get accustomed to one another's presence.

More room is preferred, and if you're housing three or more guinea pigs aim for at least 13 square feet.Rearrange and wash the cage so it will smell new and feel more like neutral territory for both guinea pigs.Gently rub hay from the old cage on the new guinea pig so he smells more like the rest of the herd., The first few weeks for guinea pig cohabitation can be rough, and you should expect some tension between your pets.

Guinea pigs may also gently nip one another if annoyed, and such behaviors are necessary to establish boundaries between the guinea pigs. Only intervene if the guinea pigs are biting hard enough to inflict wounds.If one guinea pig is constantly chattering his teeth, this is a sign of aggression that could grow serious. Watch carefully, but do not separate unless blood is drawn.Raised hair, especially around the neck, and feet stamping are signs guinea pigs are preparing to fight.

This is when they walk past each other waving their hips from side to side with their fur puffed out while making a rumbling sound.

Keep protective gear on hand in case the fight resumes., Some guinea pigs may simply not get along, even after you follow the proper protocol introducing them. You need to be prepared for this. It's a risk when introducing a new guinea pig to your pack.


Do not feel as if this is your fault. Nature simply works this way, and guinea pigs have different personalities. Some may be more independent and aggressive and therefore harder to introduce to a companion. Even when you do all the right things, guinea pigs are sometimes simply not compatible with one another.If the first introduction leads to an excess of fighting, you can restart the introduction process, beginning again with the quarantine period. This gives the guinea pigs time to cool off and forget any previous hostilities.
If guinea pigs are simply not getting along, you can always keep them in separate cages where they can smell, see, and hear one another but cannot physically interact. They get the benefits of some social interaction but without the stress of a hostile environment.

 To store strawberries in Tupperware, simply remove them from their original container and place them in a large, open Tupperware container. Line the container with paper towels to absorb any excess moisture from the strawberries. Don't crowd the container; leave room so the strawberries comfortably fit. You may need to use several containers for all of the strawberries.









Don't seal the container -- let the strawberries air out instead of being trapped under a lid.
Place the open container in your refrigerator until you're ready to eat the strawberries.
 To store the strawberries in a closed Tupperware container, just hull them to remove their stems and ends. Then, place them in a big Tupperware container, with the cut-side down. Line them up so that they don't touch each other, in one row, to make them last longer. Then, seal the Tupperware container with a lid, and mark the container with the date they were stored.








Place the container in the fridge and remove it when you're ready to eat the strawberries.
 Hull the strawberries, removing their stems, and then place them face-down on a baking tray, so that the cut part of the strawberries is facing down. Don't let the strawberries touch to make them last even longer. Then, place the baking tray into the fridge to store the strawberries for several days.
 A colander will allow the strawberries to breathe while they're being stored. To properly store the strawberries, just remove them from their containers and place them in the colander. Don't pack them together too tightly. Allow them to breathe instead.









Place the colander in the fridge and take it out when it's time to eat the strawberries.

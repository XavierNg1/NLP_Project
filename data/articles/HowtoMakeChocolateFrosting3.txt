 You'll need:


3 and 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract.
 In a medium-sized bowl, mix together cocoa and powdered sugar with a sifter, whisk, or fork. Continue until the mixture looks evenly combined, breaking up any lumps as you go along., Add the vanilla to the milk in a separate medium bowl, and stir until evenly blended.
 In a separate large bowl, whip the butter with electric mixer or whisk until fluffy and smooth.


Using an electric mixer is highly recommend since it'll make the process quicker and result in even fluffier butter, but you can use a whisk of an electric mixer is not available. Use room temperature, softened butter regardless.
 Add the vanilla/milk mixture and the cocoa-sugar to the butter, alternating between one and the other. Beat until well-blended and fluffy.


If the frosting is too thick, add more milk, 1 tsp (5 ml) at a time. If the frosting is too thin, add more sugar, 1 tsp (5 ml) at a time.
 Spread it on the cake or cupcakes, or save it in an airtight container in your refrigerator for two or three days.

 If you have a large enough press, you might be able to fit multiple cloves in at once. The force it takes to crush more cloves will be greater than the strength you will need to crush a single clove, however.
 Use a bowl with a large enough opening to catch the garlic that falls out of the press.
 Bring the handles together as firmly and tightly as possible. You should be left with garlic "mush" inside the bowl.
 If you sense yourself getting tired, you may want to consider taking a break. Otherwise, you could end up with garlic mush that is not as well-pressed as it should be.

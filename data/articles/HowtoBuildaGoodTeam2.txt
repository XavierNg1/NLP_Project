 Avoid putting yourself and your teammates down and lose the game. Get up and do what you were meant to do.
 If you're not up to par with people, you are stuck with a bad team. However, any bad team may be smart and win.
, They go far in little time and escape the attack zone fast to get back in safety.
 Don't do anything they would expect. Jump up when they think you dive. Don't go and do the same thing over and over again. It will get you caught.
 Yell for help or you will have no back up.

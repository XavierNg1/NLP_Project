 It’s important to try different methods when approaching a new math concept. You may find different ways or methods of learning work best for you.


Draw a picture. You may be a visual learner. If possible, try to draw a picture or make a visual representation of the math concept or problem. Try working in groups. Some people learn better working with other people. Just make sure not to get too distracted. Act it out. If you're physical learner, try to act out the math problem. Getting up and moving around the room will hopefully get the blood flowing and help you think of the problem in a new and different way. , Once you get down the concepts you’re currently working on in class, look ahead in your textbook to see what’s coming next.


Preview some new concepts. Though you may be confused at first, looking at upcoming material before it’s discussed in class may give you some questions when it’s introduced.
Try out some sample problems. Once you start to learn the new concepts, try some sample problems. Though you may get them totally wrong, it’s useful to try them out
Don’t get too frustrated. If working ahead is too frustrating for you, it’s best to stay with the class. Try not to get too stressed out when you don’t understand, since it’s part of the learning process.
 Helping others with math is a good way to learn more about what you’re doing.


Join a math club. Math clubs can be a great place to talk about math and to increase your ability in math. Volunteer as a math tutor. Once you have a handle on the math concepts, offer to help tutor fellow students. This will help you to learn more about math and will also look good to your teacher.
Talk to your teacher about other opportunities to help others with math. He or she will be pleased that you’re interested and may have some suggestions that you’ve never thought about.

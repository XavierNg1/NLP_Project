 Take the lid off and take all the trays out. Choose a bare, level surface to place the base. Make sure the surface is dry to avoid electric and fire hazards. Check each vent to make sure they are clear of any blockage., Use a tray with handles for your first load. Place your veggies on the smooth side of the tray. Make sure they do not overlap or touch to ensure quicker drying times. Then set the first tray onto the dehydrator’s base. For your next layer, use a handleless tray. Load it with veggies as you did with the first tray, and then set the second tray on top of the first.As you add more trays, continue stacking them with a handleless tray sandwiched in between those with handles.
 Replace the lid over the topmost tray once you have finished stacking them. Plug the base in. Refer to your dehydrator’s instructions for recommended drying times. If one tray’s veggies appear dry while others’ still seem moist, empty the dry tray and then return it to its place in the stack. Let the other trays continue to dehydrate until they feel crisp enough to break easily. Drying times will vary by method and equipment used, but expect windows of:Asparagus: 5 to seven hours

 Sure, you're probably thinking "I'm in public, in a game with over 10m people and I don't want to make myself look like a fool." Believe it or not but around 85 percent of MapleStory's top players asked for money, items, and even quest help. And just look at where they are now, at the Top Ranks in the homepage of MapleStory. So, it's ok to ask people for stuff, it's ok if you're in public doing it, you're in a game so you shouldn't be shy to do anything.

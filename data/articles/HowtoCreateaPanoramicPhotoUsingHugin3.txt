 GIMP or Photoshop, or anything else that can handle huge TIFF files and have a crop tool, will be fine., In the default nona stitcher, with the default TIFF output, you'll end up with large, transparent areas left over from where Hugin had stretched it. Crop all the transparent areas out.
Actually, you should be ruthless about cropping everything; anything that doesn't add to your photo should be removed from it.
 Again, if you ignored the advice about white balance and exposure locking, you'll need to correct this. Our photo didn't need this, but did need a kick up with the colour; exactly how this was done is detailed in How to Make Skies Beautiful with GIMP.
 Print it off, upload it places, and show it off to the world!

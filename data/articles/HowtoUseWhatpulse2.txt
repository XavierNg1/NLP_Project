 To see your rank and other things, right click on the icon and explore. In preferences, you can add a time limit for a pulse or other things.
 You might have found WhatPulse on Twitter with someone saying their WhatPulse stats. All you need to do is go to the WhatPulse site, login and then on the side you are going to press My WhatPulse and you can access things like Twitter and your password.
 On the home page it does mention you can team up. If you go to My WhatPulse you can click on the Teams tab and then create/join a team.
 If there are 2 computers you have and you want to record them separate, go to My WhatPulse and click the Computers tab. Type in the name of the computer and add it!

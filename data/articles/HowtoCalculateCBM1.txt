 You'll need to know the length, width, and height of the rectangular carton. Use a measuring stick to find all three distances and mark them down separately.


CBM is a measurement of volume, so you'll be using the standard volume formula for rectangular prisms.

Example: Calculate the CBM of a rectangular package with a length of 15 cm, a width of 10 cm, and a height of 8 cm.;
, For small packages, you may end up taking measurements in centimeters, inches, or feet. Before you can calculate CBM, you'll need to convert each measurement into its equivalent value in meters.


The exact conversion equation will vary depending on the unit used in your original measurements.

Example: The original measurements were taken in centimeters. To convert centimeters into meters, divide the number of centimeters by a conversion factor of 100. Repeat this process for all three measurements. The unit for the length, width, and height should be the same.

Length: 15 cm / 100 = 0.15 m
Width: 10 cm / 100 = 0.1 m
Height: 8 cm / 100 = 0.08 m



, Following the formula for CBM, multiply together the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism.Written in abbreviated form the formula you'll need to use looks like: CBM = L * W * H

Where L = length, W = width, and H = height



Example: CBM = 0.15 m * 0.1 m * 0.08 m = 0.0012 cubic meters

, The product of the original three dimensions will be both the volume and CBM of the individual package unit.



Example: The CBM of this package is 0.0012. This signifies that the package will take up 0.0012 cubic meters of space.

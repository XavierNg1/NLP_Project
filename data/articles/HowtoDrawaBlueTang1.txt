The oval should be horizontal.
Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat.;

For the tail, just draw a long triangle at one opposite end, with the point towards the fish body.
For the fin, just draw an elongated heart-shaped figure placed 1/3 across from the left.



For the anal fin, just add a long curved line from the belly to the tail. It doesn’t need to look perfect, just to add some textures to the fish.
For the pelvic fin, draw a skewed “V” that points slightly towards the tail.
Draw a circle for the face just so you know where to draw the gills. Also, draw 2 peaks for the fish’s beak.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The lineart might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add a line for the dorsal fin and you can make the eyes bigger or fuller.
You can also add extra lines to separate the color. I added some of those lines to the tail.

 A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another element within a compound. It generally takes the form of AX + Y --> YX + A or A + XY --> XA + Y. One reactant is always a single element and the other reactant is always a compound.In a single replacement reaction either the anion (negatively charged ion) or the cation (positively charged ion) is replaced.
For example: Cu + AgNO3 --> Ag + Cu(NO3)2. In this example the copper (Cu) replaces the silver (Ag).
 When looking at the equation, you can easily tell if a single replacement has occurred if one of the elements has switched places into the new compound. Using the general formula as guidance, you can identify the reaction.For example: ZnS + O2 --> ZnO + S

, Being able to quickly recognize a single replacement reaction takes time and practice. By looking at many different types of examples, you will improve your ability to identify this reaction without looking it up.Example 1: Fe + CuSO4 â†’ FeSO4 + Cu. Iron replaces the copper element in the compound.
Example 2: Fe + HCl --> FeCl3 + H2. Iron replaces the hydrogen.
Example 3: CaO + Al --> Al2O3 + Ca. Aluminum replaces the calcium.

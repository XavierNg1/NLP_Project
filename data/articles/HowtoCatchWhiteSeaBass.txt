 Starting around March, white sea bass are abundant near Catalina Island, San Clemente Island, and other nearby islands in California. Summer is the best season for fishing for sea bass in Southern California, but it can be caught into the fall and winter months. However, most people focus on other types of game fish during the cooler months.;
, White sea bass are very selective when it comes to what they will bite. Early spring white sea bass are typically caught with live or freshly dead squid. White sea bass caught in the summer or later months are not as picky and can be caught on almost any bait or jig.
, White sea bass enjoy larger amounts of food, and the 2-squid combination is hard for them to resist. This kind of bait oftentimes attracts larger white sea bass, so make sure you are using a line that can hold at least 40 pounds (18 kg).
 Using larger bait will prevent smaller fish from attacking your bait while attracting the white sea bass. Let the mackerel swim freely, and keep a close eye on it. Once the white sea bass is hooked, start reeling it in.
 This technique works best when attempting to fish for white sea bass during the spring and early summer months. You want to get the attention of the barracuda, which are often followed by the white sea bass. Mackerel works well in this situation because the barracuda will typically not try to feed on it. If a recently-caught white sea bass happens to swim by, this can be an opportunity to catch it in its weakened state.

 Your egg is only viable for 24 hours after you ovulate, but a man’s sperm can survive under proper conditions for up to five days. This gives you a window of about six days in which you are most likely to conceive.


You should mark or highlight these days on your calendar because they are your most fertile days.
 If you are trying to become pregnant, try to have unprotected intercourse on the days that you are most fertile. If you do not want to become pregnant, avoid having sex—especially unprotected sex—during these six fertile days.


If you want to be extra cautious about not getting pregnant, you should avoid having intercourse for a few days before and a few days after this six day window to account for any miscalculation on your fertility calendar.
 Although the fertility calendar shows you when you are the most likely to conceive, it does not guarantee that you will become pregnant right away. It could take several months or longer for you to actually conceive.


There are other factors that could influence whether you become pregnant or not. These could be related to your health or your partner’s health.
 If you do not conceive within a year of using the fertility calendar, you should have a consultation with you doctor to be sure that you and your partner are capable of having children.

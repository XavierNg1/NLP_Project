 Standing up will usually prevent you from falling asleep while smoking. Getting too tired? Put out the cigarette thoroughly in an ashtray or water-damp sink and go to bed. Do not smoke in bed - when you're in bed it's easy to fall asleep and drop your cigarette on the floor allowing it to set fire to the carpet. Cleaning out the ashtray? Place the ashes in the sink and dampen them, then scoop them up and place them in the trash can away from the house.
 Try not to do this unless totally unavoidable. Dry clothes by radiators, or outdoors if possible.
 Cover the flame with a wire cage to prevent something from falling or blowing onto the flame, and to prevent children and pets from coming in contact with the flame. Extinguish any naked flames when leaving the room, if even for a minute. After all, you'll be right back, and you can immediately relight the candle or lamp.
 Natural Christmas trees are highly combustible when they become dry, and old, damaged, or low quality tree lights cause many fires when combined with an under watered or otherwise dry tree. Watch a video of a Christmas tree fire. It is amazing how fast it can destroy a room, and a home.

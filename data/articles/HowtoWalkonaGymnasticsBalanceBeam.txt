 It may take many tries before you can consistently walk across the balance beam without falling. That's okay; gymnastics is a difficult sport.;
, He or she should stand on the ground while you are on the beam. They should place their hands on your waist or lower rib cage - not on your arms or legs - to help you keep your balance. Note: you should always have some sort of supervision (see Warnings).
 A good rule of thumb is to start at a height where you feel comfortable, and work your way up.
 People with small feet may be able to walk with their feet completely or partially next to each other, but it is better to practice putting one foot in front of the other. In addition to being good practice for more complicated moves, this reduces the likelihood that your feet will get tangled up or that you will trip.
 You might feel a little silly, but you will be able to balance much more easily.
 This means that you should be squeezing your muscles, but not so much that you cannot move. If nothing else, you should make an effort to keep your core (abdominal muscles) tight. If you are "loose," or your muscles are not tight, you will find you lose your balance much more often.
 Before you know it, you'll be able to walk across a beam like an Olympian!

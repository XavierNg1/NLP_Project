Mirrors can break up a wall without having to add a lot of artwork.



Do not place a small frame alone on a large wall.
A small wall can contain only one large picture frame or multiple small and medium frames.



Candles need symmetry.
Antiques are best designed in an overlapping way so in an asymmetry way.
Vases are also places asymmetrical.
 The perfect sized rug is essential for the classy look you are trying to achieve. Many luxury homes use rugs that are larger than the furniture's space because it allows the room to look larger.


The right rug can cause the right illusion.
Depending on the original flooring of the room, a rug could be plain or it could contain motifs as long as it goes well with the floor and the furniture.

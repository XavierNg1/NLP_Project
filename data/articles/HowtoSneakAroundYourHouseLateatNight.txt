 It's really loud and could wake your parents.;
, If you do, you won't make so much noise when you walk.
 If you rush, then your parents are more likely to wake up, but if you quietly walk off or just stand where you are, they probably won't hear you. And the sound is most likely not them anyway.
, Don't just sneak for nothing (that's the whole point of sneaking around). A few reasons to sneak around are for a scavenger hunt, or to get your phone, food, or something that you don't have in your room and left somewhere else.
 Like going to the garden pool (your local public pool is most likely closed) and swimming to the other side and back or sneaking to the room next to your parents' room and collecting something.
 If someone comes and your friends don't realise then make a signal like clapping your hands or banging your knees.
, This will help you if it is hard to make out shapes without a light.

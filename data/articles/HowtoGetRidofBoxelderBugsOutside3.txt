 Boxelder bugs are only attracted to female boxelder trees, so removing these and only planting male boxelder trees will usually fix the problem.


Boxelder trees that bear seed or fruit are female.You can also identify female boxelder trees by looking at the flowers. The flowers of female boxelder trees share one stalk, while those on male boxelder trees do not.
 The natural predators of the boxelder bug are the praying mantis and most types of spiders.Note that this is fairly risky move to make. Purposefully introducing a new insect into your yard's ecosystem can upset the balance, and you may find yourself with a praying mantis or spider problem after the boxelder bugs have been reduced.
You can place praying mantis egg cases or captured spiders in your bushes or trees. Alternatively, you can attract praying mantises to your yard by planting rose bushes and raspberry bushes. Plants that attract small "prey" bugs are also good at attracting both the praying mantis and many varieties of spider.



This will not kill the bugs and may not offer a permanent solution, but it will deter the boxelder bugs from gathering. As such, it proves most useful if done toward the beginning of an infestation.
 If the infestation is still small, you can literally squash the problem early by stomping on or swatting the bugs when you see them in your yard.


Alternatively, you can trap them in jars and release them outside of your yard. Wear gloves when doing this in case you are forced to touch them in the process.

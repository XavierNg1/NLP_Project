 This exercise is similar to performing basic crunches. Instead of placing your feet on the floor, you rest your feet on the top of an exercise ball. This engages your lower abdominals because you will have to work to keep the ball stable as you perform the exercise. However, this exercise primarily targets your upper abdominals.;
, To make this exercise more challenging, add individual leg lifts while you are in the plank position. You can also try the regular plank and the side plank as variations on this exercise.
 This exercise will challenge both your lower and upper abdominal muscles. As you gain control, try to keep your legs still. Use your abdominal muscles to pull yourself up rather than using momentum from your hip flexors and lumbar spine to roll your body into a sitting position. If you can’t raise yourself from the floor into a sitting position at first, place a small stability ball or a cushion under your back until you become stronger.
 These leg crosses will work your oblique muscles, which are the muscles that run down the sides of your abdomen. Keep your glutes and your hamstrings engaged throughout to give yourself added stability and to keep your movement fluid. You’ll also feel engagement in your lower abdominal muscles.
 Use slow movements during this exercise and engage your abdominals so that you don’t injure your back. Try to keep your arms and your upper body as still as possible while you rotate your lower body to either side.

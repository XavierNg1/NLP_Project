 Make a new map. Choose a size that is at least 192x192. Allied maps are very large. You need at least that for two teams (three is possible, but is a tight squeeze), and you need 256x256 for three or four.;
, Each player should have some mineral fields and a vespene geyser. Place them in close proximity to each other, but not too close. You still need space to create structures and move around.


Optional: Wall in the starting area like a fortress. Put in 1-4 exits, depending on the number of players and position of the fortress. Also put stairs up to the tops of the walls if you want. (For examples see maps such as "Crystal Castles", "Allied Fortress", or "Acropolis".
 If you want, you can separate the teams with a bridged river.
 Be sure to place ramps going up hills (unless you want the hills to be accessible only by dropship/overlord/shuttle).
 Check Allied, Allied Victory, and Shared Vision. Then name the forces.
 Be sure that the players who are in close proximity are in the same force.
 In that case, change them to their respective races.
 Be sure to add "Use Map Settings for Allied Play" and the number of suggested players at the top.

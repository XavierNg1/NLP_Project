 Using a mat or carpeted surface is more comfortable, but make sure it doesn't have too much cushioning.









For more resistance, you can try these on a declined bench.
Some people prefer to do crunches on a stability ball.;
, Your feet can be flat on the floor, or you can keep them suspended in the air during your crunches for a little extra crunch.
 You can also place your hands behind your neck or head, but many people tend to pull their head or neck up during the exercise, which can place extra strain on the spine. Your head and neck should be resting on your hands.









For increased resistance, you hold a weight on your chest or behind your head.
 It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. When your shoulders are off the ground, pause and hold that position for a full second (or more).










It can be tempting to move your head forward (tucking in your chin to your chest) because it makes you feel like you're lifting further, but you're not. It's a bad habit that increases your chance of getting injured. One good way to prevent this is to always try to keep looking up at the ceiling.
If you have your hands behind your head or neck, don't let your elbows come together. Keep them level with your ears. Letting your arms close in around your head encourages your head to tilt forward.
Exhale and contract your abs as you go up.
If you are learning How to Take a Punch, you can do what Muay Thai fighters do: have someone hit your stomach while it's fully contracted to condition your core to take hits.
 Don't just "plop" back down. Your control on the way down works your ab muscles as well.









Relax your abs before doing another crunch.

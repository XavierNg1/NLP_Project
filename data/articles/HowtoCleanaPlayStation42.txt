 Since the fan is inside your console, you’ll have to open it up to clean it. Understand that this will void the warranty. Typically, the warranty only lasts one year, but even so, expect a voided warranty to affect its resale value if you intend to sell or trade in your console later on.With that in mind, you will most likely have to clean the fan at some point. This should be done whenever it becomes noticeably louder than it was when you first used it. Ideally, this shouldn't happen until a year has passed. If it happens sooner, the fan should be cleaned despite the loss of warranty, in order to prevent the console from overheating.
 Unplug the console from its power source, as well as other cables so they’re not in the way. Then locate the four screws on the back of the console. At least two of these will be covered with warranty stickers, so peel those off. Then unscrew all of the screws with a T8 or T9 screwdriver and remove the bottom half of the console very carefully.
 Now that the internal components are exposed, use your compressed air very carefully to avoid spraying moisture. Hold the can upright with at least five or since inches (13 to 15 cm) of space between the nozzle and the fan. The fan is the most likely to need cleaning, so start with that. If necessary:








Also spray compressed air anywhere else you see dust, except for the disk drive. Doing so will very likely damage it.
 Don’t risk damaging components by wiping them with a cloth as you would with the exterior. At the same time, play it safe and assume that some moisture escaped your can of compressed air. Let the console sit as is for a half-hour (or longer, if necessary) so it can air-dry, just in case., Don’t worry if you didn’t give any single speck of dust out. Go ahead and put the console back together if you’ve gotten rid of the majority of it. As long as you gave it time to air-dry, it should be safe to plug back in and use again.

 This is the most basic and most useful check. Simply hold the stick in a basic two-handed grip and use your bottom hand to push the stick through your top hand, like a pool cue. This check can annoy and hopefully disrupt your opponent without making you lose body position. If you use one check, use the poke.;
, Just what it sounds like. Put your stick under their bottom hand and lift. This is a good check to interfere with passes and shots.
 Hit the attackman with the head of your stick, using a slashing motion. Be careful! This check is the most likely check to get you called for slashing, and it makes you lose body position.
 When your attackman is cradling with his back to you, hold your stick in a two handed grip, and wrap the stick around him while using your bottom hand to throw the end of the stick under your arm.
 Use the wrap, but throw it over their head, instead. Be careful not to hit their helmet, as a head check is a penalty and will make your defense man-down.
 Start by faking the overhead check, then when your attackman tries to roll under you, bring your stick down backwards on their stick/forearms.
 Constantly move your stick back and forth over your attackman's head, and when he brings his stick back for the cradle/pass/shot, bring your stick down as hard as you can.
 Choke up on your stick and hack at your opponent's stick with the end of your shaft.
 Choke up on your stick; then, keeping your stick perpendicular to the ground, bring it over the attackman's head and bring it down on their head.
 Hold your stick at about the middle and, keeping your stick perpendicular to the ground, throw your arms out wide across your attackman's face, hitting their stick.
 Get your opponent in the V-hold, and when they try to roll off, turn and throw a one-handed backhand check.

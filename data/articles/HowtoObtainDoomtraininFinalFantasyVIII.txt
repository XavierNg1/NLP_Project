 Once you get to disc 3 (where you gain access to the airship, Ragnarok), you'll need to make your way to Esthar using the airship.;
, You'll find it near the lower-right corner of the map. It's the same place you went to after leaving Edea with Zell.
 You need to get to the last area where there are square boxes of different colors (orange to blue) protruding from the ground.
 You should find the Solomon Ring underneath it.
 Do NOT enter Galbadia though; instead, head for the mountain regions that surround it.
 You may or may not get it the first time, but you’re looking for an enemy called the Wendigo.
 It carries a lot of Steel Pipes. You may need to take on as little as 2 battles to as much as 5 battles, depending on your luck in getting Steel Pipes from them.


Be careful with the Wendigos, especially if you’re a lazy level grinder; they're pretty strong.
, This time, head up the upper-right corner of the map.
 This is where the Chocobo Forest is located. Head out the airship after landing.
 They generally will be the only ones to drop Marlboro Tentacles, as the name implies.
 It’s recommended that you try to steal from them just to be sure you get at least some Tentacles as they sometimes don't drop the item.
, It doesn't matter which as long as there's a shop that sells remedies.
 Be sure to have some Gil as it will be pretty expensive to purchase 60 pieces.
 This will allow you to upgrade or refine health items, which, of course, includes Remedies.
 You'll need 10 pieces of Remedy to be able to refine it into Remedy+.


Once you have 6 pieces of remedy+, you're ready to summon Doomtrain.
, A message box will pop up in your menu.

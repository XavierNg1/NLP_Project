 It doesn't get any simpler than a warm, dense, deliciously yeasty beer bread, without having to go to all the trouble of letting it rise. Simply mix together 3 cups of white flour, a half cup of sugar, and a 12 oz can of beer thoroughly in a bowl. Pour the batter into a greased loaf pan, brush with melted butter, and bake at 375 F for 45-50 minutes. It's impossible to mess up and makes a great quick accompaniment to dinner.
 Soda breads can be sweet or savory, depending on your tastes and the ingredients available. For a simple one, mix together your dry ingredients: 4 cups of flour with a tsp each of salt and baking soda, then add several tablespoons of sugar (1 if you want savory bread, up to 4 if you want it sweeter). For the wet ingredients, mix together 2 cups of milk or buttermilk with four tablespoons of melted butter and combine everything in a bowl. Knead lightly and bake in a greased loaf pan for about an hour at 375 F.


Common additions include lemon or orange zest and dried fruits or nuts. Serve topped with marmalade or plain.
 Quick breads are cabinet and fridge cleaners: throw in whatever you've got and see if it's good. It can be a great way to use whatever you've got taking up space. Try making:

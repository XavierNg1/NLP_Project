 This is one of the most obvious asterisms in the sky, after the Big Dipper and the W of Cassiopeia. It's usually used to find the Andromeda galaxy.
 This is part of the constellation of Pisces. It's very faint, so use binoculars. There should be seven stars in the ring. As TX is variable, you may only see six. If so, come back tomorrow or even later in the night.
 Look on Wikipedia's star map of Pisces: it shows five stars in the ring. The white circle to the left of the line connecting Iota and Lambda is TX Piscium. If you can make out the colours of the stars in the sky, TX Piscium is among the reddest that can be seen.

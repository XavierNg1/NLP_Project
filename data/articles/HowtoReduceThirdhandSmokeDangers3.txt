 Scientific American defines thirdhand smoke as “tobacco smoke contamination that remains after the cigarette has been extinguished.” The contamination from tobacco smoke comes from the hundreds of constituents in tobacco smoke and deposits on walls, ceiling, furniture, clothing, and any object that has come into contact with the tobacco smoke.This contamination lingers long after the cigarette, cigar, or pipe is extinguished.There are over 250 toxins in cigarette and other tobacco smoke and we are only now beginning to learn what happens to those toxins once the smoke has disappeared., Some people are more susceptible to thirdhand cigarette smoke than others. Infants and children are at a significantly higher risk of contamination because they are smaller, breathe more rapidly, and are often physically much closer to contaminated surfaces like the floor.Additionally, infants and children are constantly putting their fingers, their hands, and any and all objects that they can into their mouths.
 Thirdhand smoke has been found to contain ammonia, arsenic, butane, cadmium, chromium, lead, cyanide, toluene, and radioactive polonium. These substances have been associated with cancer, birth defects, and learning disorders in children.

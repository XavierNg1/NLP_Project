 You don’t have to tell your friends all the details about why you’re grounded. This is, after all, between you and your parents. You can give your friends a generic reason to explain why you can’t go to a movie or why you’re not texting back. You can say something as simple as, “We had a misunderstanding.”


You can be honest with friends about why you’re grounded, but don’t use this as a time to gripe too much about your parents.
 Talk about how good it has been to get some “me” time. Talk about being grounded in a positive way by telling your friends that you got to do enjoyable solo activities that you don’t normally have time for.
 Your friends may have done something fun without you, but this won’t be your only chance to do something fun. Make plans to do a similar activity. Be sure to get your parents’ permission for this activity.
 Some friends may try to encourage you to sneak out or use the phone when you’re not allowed. Don’t give in to this type of peer pressure. Good friends will help you respect the rules so that you can finish your punishment and regain your parents’ trust.

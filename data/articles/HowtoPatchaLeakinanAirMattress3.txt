 Many manufacturers request that you only use patch kits, or you send the mattress back to them for repair. Though effective, DIY patches can lead you to lose your warranty on the mattress, so proceed with caution.


Duct tape can be a temporary fix. Though effective in the short term, the glue on duct tape is not made to permanently bind to plastic, and it will eventually dry out and fall off.
Never use hot glue to fix a leak. Hot glue will, in almost all cases, melt part of your air mattress and make the hole bigger.
 This fuzz, though comfortable, will prevent your glue or patches from completely binding around the leak, causing it to fall off shortly after applying. Take a wire brush or some sandpaper and lightly scrub away the felt coating until there is only plastic around your leak., If you’re out of professional patches or cannot buy one, you can still improvise a patch from things around the house. Tarps and shower curtains work well and are easily cut to size.Make sure your square is big enough to cover the leak, with at least one extra centimeter on every side.
 Cover the leak in a generous amount of glue at least the size of your patch. Do not try this with your child’s bottle of craft glue. You need a strong, reliable adhesive, such as superglue, KrazyGlue, or Gorilla Glue, to adhere your patch., Use strong, even pressure to press the patch into the glue. Smooth out the patch with your fingers and gently wipe away any excess glue around the edges of the patch.
 Use several heavy books, a weight, or similarly heavy objects and place them on top of the patch to keep the pressure up as it dries. When you return the patch should be firmly adhered to the mattress.

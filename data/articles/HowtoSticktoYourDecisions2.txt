 Remind yourself of all the ways you hope your life will improve by sticking to a particular decision. Try making a list and putting it somewhere you’ll see it often. You can also take a minute to write down your goals every morning.For instance, maybe you want to stop procrastinating so you’re less stressed at work. Make a list of ways this will benefit you, like speaking up more confidently in meetings, and put it on your office wall.
 Be realistic: you probably can’t overhaul your whole life at once. Pick just one important decision, and follow through on it before you start working on something else.For instance, if you’re trying to decide between two jobs, hold off on making any other important choices until after you’ve accepted one.
 If your motivation is fading, revive it by talking to yourself. Tell yourself how happy you’ll be if you follow through with your decision, and remind yourself of your qualities that will help you persevere.Talk to yourself in the second person. For instance, tell yourself, “You’ve done tough things before, and you can do this too.”
If you find talking to yourself too cheesy, imagine you’re advising a friend in your position.
 Don’t keep your decision to yourself – tell others about it. You’ll be less likely to give up or change your mind if other people are asking about your progress. Better still, find a buddy who will help keep you on track.For instance, if you’ve decided to eat healthier lunches, team up with a coworker who wants to do the same thing.
 Stop thinking of your choices as “good,” “bad,” “right,” or “wrong.” That will just leave you doubting yourself at every turn. Instead, focus on how your decisions are allowing you to live the best life you can.For instance, if you’re not sure whether you like your new job, focus on the positive aspects of it. Think about what you’re learning and how the experience will prepare you for better jobs in the future.

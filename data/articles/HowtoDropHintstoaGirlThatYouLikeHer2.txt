 If there is an opportunity for you to show your support for her, you should take it! Attend any performances she might be giving, such as dance recitals, concerts, and theatrical performances. It is a great chance to learn more about her, meet some of her friends and express your feelings for her.If she is performing a concert and shared a group invite with you on social media, go and show your support!
Don’t go to her performances or events if you are not invited. She may get the impression that you are a creep, so stick to the events that she actually invites you to attend.
 If you are at a bar or a coffee shop, try to remember what she orders. The next time you are at the establishment with her, you could order her the drink before she has a chance.

It could also be a mental note.
If she goes to the bar to get a drink, you could go with her and listen to her order. The next time she needs a drink, you’ll know what to order.

 Open any web browser on your computer. You can use Google Translate as a proxy from any web browser.;
, Since the site is blocked, you cannot just use a search engine to get to it. You have to know the direct link or URL to the website you want to access. As an example, use the WikiHow URL: https://www.wikihow.com/.
 Using Google Translate as a proxy means going through Google Translate to access the website:


Start with the link. Use this direct link to begin with using the WikiHow example given earlier: http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&tl=en&u=https://www.wikihow.com/.
Set the destination language. The destination language in the link should be set to the actual language of the website. If it’s in English, use “en.” Put this after the “tl” text in the link.
Set source language. The source language can be any other language except for the destination language. For instance, you can use “ja” for Japanese. Put this after the “sl” text in the link.
Input the site URL. The final piece of the link is the website you want to access. Put the URL of the website after the “u” text in the link. In the example above, this will be https://www.wikihow.com.
 Enter the full link in the address bar of your web browser, and hit Enter. You will be in the Google Translate main site, but the website you want to visit will be displayed right under it. You can now access it normally.

 Deadhead fading flowers by gently breaking them off or clipping them. Take care to only remove spent flowers, leaving stems and foliage intact.Deadheading your plants will keep them from wasting energy on producing seeds.
 After your plants bloom, keep their stems and foliage intact as long as they remain green. When they turn yellow or brown, cut the stems back so the plant can overwinter.Leaving green foliage intact as long as possible is vital, as it will keep producing energy that will help it overwinter.

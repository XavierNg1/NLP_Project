You could also line the baking dish with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper, but doing so may make it more difficult to spoon out the juices after you finish cooking the fish.
 Place the cod fillets in your prepared baking dish, positioning them so that they sit in a single layer.


Do not stack the fish in multiple layers. Doing so may prevent the fish from cooking evenly.
 Drizzle the lemon juice and olive oil over the cod fillets evenly. Finish by sprinkling the seasoning blend over the fish.


If you do not have seasoning blend on hand or would prefer a different spice, you can replace the seasoning blend with something else. Try 1/2 tsp (2.5 m) each salt and ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder and 1 tsp (5 ml) dried parsley, or 1 tsp (5 ml) paprika.
For more even flavor, season both sides of the cod fillets.
 Place the cod fillets in the oven and cook until the fish begins to brown and can be flaked easily with a fork.


If using frozen fish fillets instead of fresh or thawed, add another 5 to 10 minutes to the overall cook time.
 Remove the cod fillets from your baking dish and transfer them to individual serving plates. Use a spoon or pastry brush to drizzle the pan juices over the plated cod.

 No other browsers have Silverlight support as of spring 2017.Firefox ESR will retain Silverlight support into early 2018. You will need to take steps to prevent Firefox 51 from automatically updating to the current version.

If you already use Firefox, you can have multiple versions of Firefox on your computer, but you will also need to make sure you don't accidentally overwrite one version with another when doing installations. You can rename Firefox versions or install them in separate folders to prevent accidental overwriting.
If you're using multiple Firefox versions, you can also use Firefox's Profile Manager to create a separate profile for use only by Firefox 51.If you use a separate profile for Firefox 51, you can prevent automatic updating of Firefox 51 while maintaining auto-updating of your current version of Firefox.
Mozilla doesn't recommend downgrading to Firefox 51 because it will become increasingly less secure, so you should restrict using Firefox 51 to "safe" sites that need an NPAPI plugin such as Silverlight.More information about using Firefox 51 or ESR at websites requiring plugins such as Silverlight or Java may be found at How to Use Firefox ESR or Firefox 51 to Access Websites Requiring Silverlight or Java.;
, Once on the website, find the button on the left side of the screen that says "Create" and click that.
 If Silverlight is properly installed and you are using Firefox 51 or lower or Internet Explorer, a sample blue word cloud in the "Tagxedo Creator" default "South America" shape will appear.
 This brings up a box where you will type in your own words into the area labeled "Enter Text". Click "Submit" once the text you want is entered. Your words will appear in the default blue "South America" shape.
 The respin icons (round arrows) randomly change your choices of color scheme, font and orientation. You have two color respin options.

Choose a theme. Themes are color schemes.
"Color" changes the colors of words without changing the theme.
, This option is on the toolbar under respins. Orientation can be random, horizontal, or vertical.
 Shapes can add meaning to the words which you entered into the word cloud. You are able to select an image from the list provided or add your own image.

To add your own image

Find or create a black on white .jpg and save it to your computer - the jpg does not have to be very high resolution. By default, Tagxedo's image editor will put words in the black part of your jpg.
Choose "Add Image" from the "Shape" options dialog box. When prompted, upload the black on white jpg from your computer.
In the resulting dialog box many tiny copies of the word "Tagxedo" will appear in the area where your word cloud words will show up. Slide the threshold slider to the right if you need to sharpen the borders of your custom shape. Don't slide the threshold slider too far to the right or you will lose your custom shape altogether
Click "Accept" when you see "Tagxedo" in the right places
Your custom shape will be available (in red) from the Tagxedo shapes menu




















, More information about the many Tagxedo options can be found on the internet and at the Tagxedo blog and FAQ. A few possibilities:

If you want to make words that appear frequently in your list bigger, increase "Emphasis" under Word|Layout Options>Layout
To keep words in a phrase together, use a tilde, e.g., WikiHow~Rocks!
To make words fill the space around your shape rather than fill the shape's interior, click the "Shape" disclosure triangle under the options section of the toolbar. The "Invert" button on the bottom right (to the right of the "Classic Cloud" buttons) will do what it implies, put words around all the shapes in the menu, including custom shapes that you have uploaded. Click the inverted shape of your choice. Uploading a jpg with a white custom shape on a black background will also work and will give you better control over the size of your background.










If you want to make an image with a transparent background, decrease "Background Opacity" to 0 under Word|Layout Options>Advanced and save your image in .png format
If you need to include numbers and punctuation, make those changes under Word|Layout Options>Word
If you want to assign a specific color, orientation or font to a particular word, follow the directions on the Tagxedo blog post of July 10, 2010, "Customizing Individual Words -- Color, Angle, and Font"









, When you have finished, select "save" which is located near the top of the left-sided toolbar. You now have the option to save to your computer in .jpg or .png formats of various sizes or post to one of your social media accounts.

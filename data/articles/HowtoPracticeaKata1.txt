 Focus on yourself in the moment. Turn your attention inward. Tune out all distractions, whether they’re external or internal. Quiet your mind until the kata itself is the only thing you’re thinking about. , Resist holding your breath. Inhale fully for maximum lung capacity. Avoid full exhales since these will leave the body limp and vulnerable. Adjust your rate of breathing as the situation demands, timing it to match your movements. Avoid breathing at a uniform rate throughout the kata. , Concentrate on your posture, balance, and stability. Pay close attention to your hips, since they will help ground your center of gravity. Prioritize form over speed in the beginning and practice your kata slowly to ensure mastering the form before speeding up your movements., Pay attention to how the muscles in each part of your body work together in each movement; for example, when delivering a punch with your fist, pay attention to how your legs and torso lead into the punch. Maximize the force of impact by using all interrelated muscles efficiently.
 Imagine an opponent of equal height and build to yourself. Use your imaginary opponent as a point of focus for both impact and penetration.Pretend that this is a real fight that may prove lethal.
 Maintain an even speed from start to finish.When learning a new kata, start slowly to master its pattern, but as you improve and quicken your speed, achieve that speed from your first step forward to intimidate your opponent.

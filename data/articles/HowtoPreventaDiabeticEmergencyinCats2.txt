 Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can strike your cat quickly even when you make the effort to prevent it. Too much insulin, a change in diet, infection, increased exercise, or other diseases can bring it about. Look for the following physical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia:Muscle twitching
Seizures
Weakness
Inappropriate elimination (outside of the litter box)

, Sudden changes in your cat's behaviour may indicate a hypoglycemic attack. Symptoms like anxiety, depression, and restlessness are common, but may be too subtle to pick up on. Take note if your cat:Breaks out of its daily routine
Is irritable
Vocalizes more or less than usual
Avoids cuddling or being pet

, Lethargy and weakness are possible signs of an impending hypoglycemic attack. If your cat refuses to engage in play or move around for incentives like treats, take note and look for other signs of a hypoglycemic attack. Call your veterinarian to gauge whether emergency medical care is necessary.

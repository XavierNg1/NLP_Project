 Keep the star shape simple. You might want to use the template provided here to trace around; resize as needed.


The stars can be all one size or varying sizes, big or small, it's up to you to decide what final look you want for the garland. In some cases, you might like to make the stars large enough to write names or messages on them, especially for recognition purposes.

,, Then punch a small hole in the center of each star. Use either a hole puncher or simply push a sharp point of a pen, pencil or similar object through it.
 If you are going to decorate the stars, do it here. Draw, paint, write, add glitter, glue on feathers, etc. Do whatever you like. Also realize that it's perfectly fine to do absolutely nothing by way of decoration––the stars will have a rustic, simple quality if you don't do anything to them.
 Adjust all the stars to sit evenly across the string. The length of the string should be determined by where you're hanging or draping it, and the amount of stars being added to it.


If you are creating a size pattern, such as two small stars, one big star, etc., be sure to follow your pattern with care; it's harder to take off errors than to get them on in the correct order in the first place.
 Then hang the star garland wherever it's needed. Some ideas for using it include:


Drape over a Christmas tree
Hang across an office or classroom ceiling
Dangle over a stair banister
Pin up across a whiteboard or wall space
Hang over a curtain rod or across window space
Adorn a table setting with it.

 Sequin pants (for men and women) are good if you're playing party rock or glam metal. Long hair looks good for a show. Wear something that will stand out.;
, Some examples are Freddie Mercury, Ozzy Osbourne, David Lee Roth, and so on.. If you have play guitar, practice some of the moves with a Guitar Hero guitar/bass controller, to make sure you won't get hurt/break your instrument during the concert.
 The best instrument for this is drumsticks. Learn how to twirl them etc. There's also guitar tricks.
 This is what the crowd loves. If you jump and kick in the air when the guitar solo begins it will entice the crowd. These moves are interesting.
 By running onstage and yelling for the crowd to scream and cheer. Tell them to scream loud, jump as high as they can, and get ready for an awesome show. If you're not the frontman, make motions that will back up the singer's requests.
 All of your songs should be vibrant, but the first song is a first impression on the crowd. If it's a slow, boring song, people won't stick around.
 Shout and pump them up between singing parts. Good examples are "Is that all you got!?" "C'mon, I can't hear you!". For lead guitarists, get down on your knees at the edge of the stage and play the guitar solo right in their faces, they'll love it!

, Give them high-fives and such. When a fan holds out their hand, give them a hard high-five, it will be a memory. When a stag-diver climbs on stage give them a hand and push them off.
 And never throw anything that you will need during the concert like a drumstick or the lead singer's water bottle.
 A thank-you is always good.

 From primitive to deluxe, cabins can offer you a way to slowly ease into the camping lifestyle. That way, you’ll get some basic comforts that you enjoy, and your fellow camper can experience the fun of the great outdoors.


Tell your camping partner that you’re not ready yet for tent camping, but you are willing to start with cabin camping.
Explain that you get the benefit of being with nature without the hassle of bringing along all of your equipment.
Show your fellow camper the amenities offered at the cabin you’ve chosen. They can range from fireplaces to hot tubs., High-end camping, or “glamping,” is becoming more popular, and it may be a way for you to really enjoy your camping experience.


Options at glamping resorts range from staying in treehouses, to yurts, to multi-bedroom permanent “tents.”Butlers, spa services, and fine dining are also common at glamping destinations.
 Even though staying at a lodge is not technically camping, maybe you can convince your camping partner that it’s as close as you’re willing to get to camping for the moment.


Many state and national parks offer lodges that can be rustic or deluxe.
With amenities like swimming pools and game rooms, you’ll be able to enjoy some indoor activities while also being close to nature.

Each of the sites listed above rank servers by votes. The more votes a server has, the more popular it is. You can use this to rule out the less interesting ones and instead focus on finding the servers that are the most fun to play on.



Some servers don't show their IP Address and Port, instead their connect address looks like this: subdomain.domain.com. If it looks like this, simply note that down instead.



Alternatively: subdomain.domain.com

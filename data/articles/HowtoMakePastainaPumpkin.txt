, Cut off the top of the pumpkin using a large, sharp knife. Using a large, strong spoon, scoop out the flesh. Use a smaller sharp knife to ensure that you have removed as much of the pumpkin flesh as possible.


Discard the seeds (you can roast them separately).
 Set aside.
 Bake for 45 minutes to an hour. The inside should begin to soften.


The pumpkin can be placed straight into the oven on the racks. Or, place on a baking sheet first.
 Pour the olive oil into the pot. Add the onion, ginger and pumpkin cubes. Fry for about 10 minutes, stirring now and then.
 Cook for three minutes.
 Add seasoning to taste.
 Reduce the heat and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, while the pasta cooks.
 Add the yogurt (if adding) and fresh basil and stir through.
 Spoon in as much of the filling as possible. You may have filling left over; that's okay, it can be used as a salad, served as an additional amount or reheated tomorrow in or as another dish.


The lid can be placed back onto the pumpkin for display and to retain heat. The first diner is the one to remove it, which is all part of the fun.
 This dish is best placed in the center of the table with a large ladle, having diners help themselves to individual portions. Serve with crusty bread and a side salad for a complete meal. Bon appetit!

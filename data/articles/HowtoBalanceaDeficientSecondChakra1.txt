 Your second chakra, when balanced, will allow your emotional energy to flow through your body and help you feel deep personal, creative, and sexual pleasure.Like the other six chakras, a deficient sacral chakra can be either excessive (overly expressed) or blocked (inadequately expressed). An unhealthy or deficient second chakra can have the following effects on an individual:


Inflexible in mind and body
Strong feelings of guilt, shame, or fear
Overwhelmed by anxiety and worry;
, A blocked sacral chakra will have symptoms opposite those of an excessive sacral chakra. If your sacral chakra is blocked, you will feel emotionally frigid or have trouble expressing yourself creatively and sexually.A blocked sacral chakra may have these symptoms:


Lack of emotional pleasure; emotional rigidity
Lack of sexual desire or sexual frigidity
Pessimism, depression, and a lack of creativity

, The consequences of your deficient chakra will show up in day-to-day life. If you know what youâ€™re looking for, chakra-related deficiencies are easy to notice.Look for daily symptoms like:


Inhibited sexuality. A deficient sacral chakra is likely to blame if you are less sexually active than normal, are receiving less enjoyment from sexual acts than you normally would, or are experiencing guilt or shame related to your sexuality,.
Chronic dissatisfaction. Your sacral chakra is tied to pleasure and enjoyment; if the chakra is blocked, you will find yourself dissatisfied, frustrated, or fed up with people and activities that usually bring you pleasure. This dissatisfaction can diminish your participation in activities with friends and family, and reduce your satisfaction when performing work, recreational activities, or exercising.
Lack of energy and ambition. A functioning sacral chakra will fuel you with energy and help you stay focused on personal ambitions. If your chakra is blocked, you may feel listless, uninspired, or unmotivated to pursue things that are important to you.

 When you launch the game, you will see your available lives inside the heart on the header menu.


You can have a maximum of five lives. If you still have five lives, you won’t be able to add more.;
, If you’ve run out of lives, click the plus sign beside the heart on the header menu. This will bring out a window for “Get more lives,” and the options for getting more lives will be listed. Here, click the “Ask friends!” button.
 Your Facebook friends will be listed. Tick the check boxes for the friends you’d like to request a life from.


You will have a higher chance of getting a life from a friend that plays Bubble Witch Saga 2 too, so click the Bubble Witch tab to filter only friends that play the game.
Click the “Send” button to send out your request. A friend can give you a life once a day.
 Requesting for lives can take some time. Some people give, some people don’t. Not everyone is generous in giving away free lives.

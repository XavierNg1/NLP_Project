 Find your apps then click on Messages+. If you don't have Messages+, buy it from the app store then open it up. Click on the chat you want to design.
 In the upper left corner, there are three lines. Swipe it to the right and it'll show some options. In the options, if you scroll a bit down, you'll find the word "Backgrounds". Click on it., Where you usually type, there'll be some choices. They'll have an art sign. If you click on the art sign you can choose a background and header color. There also is a plus sign. If you press on the plus sign, you can choose an image for your background, whether it's from the internet or you've captured it.

Click on the image then for a test you can see how you like it as the background. If you don't like it, you can always go back and change it.
 In the options on the left side under background, it says "Conversation bubble." Press that. Now there's a bunch of choices you can choose.

You can choose default, colored, rounded, shiny, hollow round, hollow square, sketched, or feed. You can also change the color of your conversation bubble. They'll give you choices of colors.
If the chat you're designing only has yourself and somebody else you would be outgoing message bubble and they would be recipient 1. There'll be a bunch of other colors that say "recipient #_" so you drag that message box to either your outgoing message bubble or recipient 1, and the color will be changed.
If you have a group chat and you want to change more conversation bubbles then follow the drill with more recipients. For example, you might have 7 people in the group chat so you change the colors all the way through recipient 1-7.

 This will be a piece of paper and a pencil. Or a dry erase board and markerâ€”basically anything you can write on and something to write with., This intermediate step gives the tens digit of the final answer.

Notice that the digit you record (the tens digit for your answer) is 1 less than the integer number you are using to multiply 9 by.
The general expression for the list you are forming is 9*n=n-1.
 Continue until you reach 10., The tens digit from the partner row will be the ones digit for the other row. In this case, you have the first row: 9*1=0 and the last row 9*10=9. You will take the 9 from 9*10=9 as the units digit to give 9*1=09.

Similarly, you will take the 0 from 9*1=0 as the units digit for its partner to give 10*9=90.
 The process is the same: Take the first and last unsolved rows as a pair. Then the tens digit from the partner row becomes the units digit for the row you are solving.

The sum of the tens digit and the units digit for each answer will always be 9. So, knowing the the tens digit is for 9*6=5, will enable you to write the corresponding ones digit as 4 (9-5)

 A “fasting” blood test means one that is done after 8 hours or more of not eating.If you are getting your blood sugar tested at your doctor’s office, find out whether you need to fast the night before or not.


If you are supposed to fast for your test, do not eat the night before or the morning of your appointment. Drinking water is okay. Most fasting tests are scheduled for first thing in the morning so you don’t have to go hungry all day long.
 If you get your blood sugar tested at your doctor’s office, they will take a blood sample from a vein.Your healthcare provider will clean the area with alcohol, usually the inside of your elbow, and tie a tight band called a tourniquet around the top of your arm. They will use a syringe (medical needle) to take a blood sample, which may feel moderately uncomfortable like a bee sting. Once the sample is taken, the tourniquet will be removed, and a band aid will be put on the area.


You might feel some mild throbbing afterwards, or get a small bruise.Usually the procedure is not very painful, and it’s over in about a minute.
If you tend to feel nervous or get lightheaded around needles, bring a small snack with you for after the sample is taken. If you get nauseated or pass out after having blood taken, it’s just your body’s response to feeling scared. A small sugary snack can help you feel better.
 You will either receive a call or have a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your tests. Ask the doctor or nurse any questions you may have, such as "What do these results mean?"; or "Is this a good result?"; or "Is my fasting blood sugar at a healthy level?"; or "What should I do next?".


Normal results for a fasting glucose test is under 100 mg/dL. Before meals, your blood sugar should be in the range of 70 to 99 mg/dL.Results of non-fasting tests will vary depending on when you last ate, and what you ate. “Postprandial” readings are taken two hours after you last ate, and should be under 140 mg/dl.

 There are a variety of free programs available online that can transfer the music from your iPod into your iTunes library. Some of the more popular programs include:


PodTrans
iFunBox
SharePod;
, Be careful when installing the transfer program, as most will try to install other programs at the same time that you may not want. Be sure to review each screen of the installation process and ensure that any extra programs are unchecked.
 Loading the program first will help prevent iTunes from starting automatically and syncing your files, which would delete the songs off of your iPod.
 Use the connector cable that came with your iPod to plug it into your computer’s USB port. The transfer software should load your iPod’s information automatically.


If iTunes attempts to open, close it before the Sync starts.
 Using the transfer program, open the Music folder. The process varies from program to program, but generally there will be a Music button or tab that you can click to access all of the music files stored on your iPod.
 You can select all the songs, or pick and choose the songs that you want to copy. Press and hold the Ctrl/Command key and click the files that you want to select.
 Once you’ve selected your music, you can copy it to the computer by clicking the button specific to your program. It may be labeled “Copy to PC”, “To iTunes”, or something similar., If you are copying a lot of files, the transfer could take a while. Some programs will ask you where you want to copy the music to on your computer, while others will automatically place it in your iTunes music folder.


If the music gets copied to a folder that isn’t in iTunes, this guide will show you how to add it to your iTunes library.

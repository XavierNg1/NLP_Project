 This might seem shallow, but that's society for you.


Always be clean. Take a shower twice everyday, when you wake up and before going to sleep. Brush your teeth, too. Also, is good to smell nice. Try to use deodorant and perfume.
Try to be fashionable. You don't need to spend too much money on clothes, because you can usually find stylish things for a good price. Read fashion magazines and watch TV so you can have a basic idea of what to wear, but you don't have to wear exactly what everyone else is.
Have nice hair. Take good care of it, and get a haircut that looks good on you.;
, This is probably one of the most important steps. Hold your head high, don't slouch, make eye contact with whoever you are talking to, and just feel good about yourself.
 Formulate your opinions and ideas, but remember the world, and world events, change. Try to keep your ideas updated, so you'll pretty much be able to have a conversation with anyone about anything.
 You have to be articulate, and say your ideas in a way people can easily understand. This way, you can sound educated, but don't use too many complicated words.
 Charisma is a way with words, so speak well. ALWAYS speak with conviction, even about the simplest things. This way, you can charm and intrigue anyone you speak to!

 If your cat has any of the symptoms of inflammatory disease, you should have it seen by a veterinarian. Tell the veterinarian about your cat's symptoms and allow them to do a thorough examination of your cat. They will give you a diagnosis and they will discuss treatment options.

Dexamethasone
Triamcinolone

, Getting a cat to take medication can be difficult. You can try to hide it in their food and hope that they will eat it when they are eating. If that doesn't work, you may need to restrain the cat and force it to swallow the medication.

Restraint may be uncomfortable for the cat but it should never injure the cat or cause pain. Using a towel to wrap up the cat is usually the easiest, and least traumatic, way of restraining a cat.
 When you give your cat medication you should be sure to read and follow the directions included. This will include how often the medication should be given, whether is should be given with food, what the daily dosage should be, and how long the medication should be given.If you are unsure about any of the directions on the packaging, as your veterinarian to clarify.

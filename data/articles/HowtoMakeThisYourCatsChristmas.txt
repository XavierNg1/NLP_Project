 To do this, hang no easily-breakable ornaments on the lower half of the tree. Place a tree in a room you are often in to avoid catastrophes. Put some of your cat's toys near or under the tree, and also a blanket or so under the tree, so your cat can enjoy sleeping there when you're in the room.;
, Ideas include:


A new chew toy, which makes tons of noise. This will give your cat lots of pleasure!
Some fancy food, or special cat milk.
A new bed
A new scratching post.


Buy presents according to your cat's personality, whether he or she is lazy or playful. There are also many ways you can make homemade toys that your cat may enjoy even more; see further How to make cat toys.
 You might want to buy or make some special food once or twice a week while it's December, so that your cat can feel the holiday spirit and joy. Make Christmas Eve the most exciting and special, offering a good piece of meat or fish for dinner.
 Play with your cat. He will have loads of fun and after all the fancy food could probably use the exercise. Let your cat snuggle up next to you in the couch and bed when you're watching TV or reading on Christmas day.
 Certain seasonally-common plants can cause illness or even fatalities in cats if chewed and/or swallowed. If you can't imagine your Christmas without these, consider purchasing silk versions.


Plants to beware of if you have a cat include: Poinsettia, ivy, mistletoe, holly berries, Christmas rose, Christmas berry and yew.
 Cats may be tempted by tinsel or string. If consumed, it can wreak havoc with their digestive systems, requiring emergency treatment. Although it is tempting to give Fluffy some of your Christmas leftovers, many Christmas dinner and snack items (see Warnings) can be hazardous to your cat's health. Keep tidy at Christmas -- you could save your pet's life!

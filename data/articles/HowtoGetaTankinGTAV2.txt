 Scroll down until you locate the Warstock Cache & Carry store. The tank is priced at $3,000,000 in the story mode and $1,500,000 in the online mode., The tank can now be found at the Los Santos International Airport. If you are playing in the story mode, it is located at the hanger associated with the character you bought it with. If you are playing online, it will be located at the hanger you purchased.


In order for the tank to spawn here, you will have to wait a couple hours for it to spawn in online mode and one in-game day in story mode.

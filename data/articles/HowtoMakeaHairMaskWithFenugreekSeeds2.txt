 Add 1 tablespoon (11 g) of fenugreek seed powder, 5 to 6 tablespoons (90 to 108 g) of plain yogurt, and 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 ml to 30 ml) of olive or argan oil. Mix the ingredients well with a spoon to ensure that they’re fully combined.You can grind your own fenugreek seeds, but store-bought powder works just as well.
For the mask, full fat yogurt usually works best. It delivers protein to the hair to help strengthen it and heal damage.
Add more of the yogurt and oil if you have long and/or thick hair.
 When the ingredients are combined, cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap. Next, let it sit for 2 to 3 hours to allow the mask to thicken up.If the mask is too thick after it’s sat, you can add up to ¼ cup (59 ml) of distilled water to thin the mixture.
 Once the mask has thickened for a couple of hours, apply it to your hair and scalp. Allow the mask to sit on your head for 20 to 30 minutes.It’s not necessary to cover your head because the mask won’t drip. However, placing a shower cap or plastic wrap over it can help warm the mask so your hair absorbs it more easily.
 When it’s time to take off the mask, rinse it away with warm water. Next, use your usual shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair, and allow it to air dry.You can use the mask once a week for soft, shiny hair.

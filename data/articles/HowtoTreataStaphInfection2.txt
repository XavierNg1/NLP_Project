 Staph gathers on the skin, including under your nails. By washing your hands, you are more likely to avoid introducing it to a scratch, scrape, or scab.When you wash your hands, you should scrub for 20 to 30 seconds with soap and warm water; using a throwaway towel afterwards is best. In addition, turn off the faucet with a towel so you don't touch the germy surface after washing your hands., When you get a cut or scrape, it's important to cover it with a bandage once you clean it up. Using an antibiotic ointment is also good practice. Doing so will help keep staph infection out of the wound., If you're working on someone else's cut or wound, it's best to put on clean gloves if possible. If not, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards and try not to touch the wound itself with your bare hands. You can do things like put the antibiotic ointment on the bandage before placing it over the wound to keep from touching it., You can pick up staph infection in the gym, hot tub, or steam room, so make sure to shower after you exercise to help wash it off. Always make sure the shower area is clean, and don't share shower supplies, such as razors, towels, and soap., Toxic shock syndrome is a form of staph infection, and it is often caused by leaving a tampon in for longer than eight hours. Try to change your tampon every four to eight hours, and use the lightest tampon you can get away with. If you use a tampon that is too absorbent, it can increase your risk of a staph infection.If you're worried about toxic shock syndrome, try sticking to other methods to manage your period, such as pads., When doing your laundry, wash your linens, including your towels and sheets, in hot water. Hot water can help kill off the staph bacteria so it doesn't keep infecting you.

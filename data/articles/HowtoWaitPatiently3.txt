 To really learn to wait patiently and avoid becoming anxious when you are waiting for something, it’s helpful to think about the different waiting times we experience. It is generally thought that an uncertain wait prompts more anxiety than one you have a clearer timetable for.


Uncertain waits can feel longer than if you know how long you will have to wait for.
For example, if you are told you will be seen in 30 minutes, it can be easier than if you are just told you will be seen soon.If you're facing an uncertain wait, try to find out a clearer timetable so you have a better idea of how long you'll have to wait.
If you can't get any extra information, try to relax or occupy yourself and accept that there is nothing to do but wait.
 Sometimes you will expect to be able to see your doctor at a set time and you arrive only to find out that there has been a problem and you will now have a lengthy wait. This situation can prompt heightened impatient because it was unexpected and it contradicts what you understood would happen.


If you find yourself in a similar situation, recognise it and try to relax and shrug it off.
Consider finding out the reason for the wait, perhaps somebody is unexpectedly off sick, or has been held up in traffic.
This may help you to understand that there is nothing you can do to change it and then wait more patiently., Everyone gets impatient, but it’s important to understand that getting frustrated and restless will only increase your impatience. Try to relax as much as possible and take things in your stride. If you are queuing at the supermarket and you are anxious because your line is moving slowly as all the others go quickly, your wait will likely seem longer than it actually is.Treating these situations more lightly, and trying to maintain a good sense of humour about all the waiting around you have to do, can help you wait more patiently and happily.

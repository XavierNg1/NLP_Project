 Continue mixing until the spices and herbs seem evenly distributed and the entire mass of turkey burger meat seems sticky and compact.


Ground turkey tends to be drier than ground beef, but the mayonnaise can add enough tackiness to the mixture to help hold it together better.
You can vary the spices as desired. Keep in mind, though, that most turkey burger patties have more spices than most beef patties do. Turkey has a slightly blander, milder taste than beef, so the additional spices help punch up the flavor of your turkey patties.
 For standard size turkey burgers, separate the entire bulk of seasoned meat into four even 1/4 lb (115 g) portions.


Note that you could technically form larger or smaller burger patties. Even though it's a less common practice with turkey patties than it is with beef patties, there is no reason why it should not work.
 Use your hands or a burger mold to form the portions of turkey meat into flat burger patties.


Since these burger patties tend to be a little stickier to the touch than beef patties are, forming the patties with your hands can be easier than using a burger press. If you are comfortable enough with your patty mold, though, you can still give it a shot and likely have success. Make sure to line the mold with plastic wrap before pressing the turkey patty meat into it.
 You could cook these turkey burger patties immediately, but if you wrap them in plastic wrap or a plastic bag and refrigerate them for 20 minutes or so, you might find that the patties cook more evenly and stick less during the cooking process.

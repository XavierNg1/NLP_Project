 For the most part, these are sharp instruments and deserve respect.;
, Be gentle. And be careful - the blades are very sharp.
 If the blade on your bonsai shears has sap on it, use a little soapy water to remove it. Neglecting to remove the sap will likely cause your bonsai tools to rust.
 Specially made cleaning oils such as Tri-Flow will also help loosen stains and add lubrication to help the blades resist rust between gardening jobs.
 Wipe your bonsai tools dry with a clean rag, and then spray a lubricant on them to protect the metal from corrosion, especially if you store your bonsai tools in a damp garage or basement. Tools subjected to constant humidity fluctuations will corrode at an accelerated rate due to moisture condensation.
 Be sure any residue is carefully washed and rinsed away.
 Once the rust is removed, apply a coat of oil to the newly exposed steel to stop the oxidation process in its tracks.

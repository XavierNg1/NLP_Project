 Get out one pint of fresh figs. There should be about 12 fresh figs. Wash them and carefully slice an "X" through the top and down towards the bottom of each fig. Ensure that you don't completely cut to the bottom or you won't be able to stuff the figs.Look for figs that are still slightly firm. This will make them easier to slice and fill.
 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (175 C) and get out a rimmed baking sheet. Spread 1/2 cup (62 g) of walnuts across the pan and put them in the preheated oven. Bake the walnuts for 10 to 12 minutes. They should smell toasted and look a little golden. Chop them and let them cool before you mix them with 4 ounces (113 g) of goat cheese.It's important to let the toasted walnuts cool completely before combining them with the cheese. If you add hot walnuts to the cheese, it may melt.
 Use a small spoon or teaspoon and scoop a bit of the goat cheese walnut filling. Gently push the filling into each sliced fig. You may need to use your index finger to scrape the filling off of the spoon.Avoid over stuffing the figs, because this will make them harder to eat and you may run out of filling.
 Measure out 4 tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar into a small mixing bowl. Use a small whisk or fork to vigorously stir together the syrup. The honey should dissolve in the vinegar. Slowly drizzle it over the stuffed figs and serve them immediately.Try to use high-quality honey and balsamic vinegar. Since there are few ingredients in this stuffed fig recipe, you can really taste the honey and vinegar.

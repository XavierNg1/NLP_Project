 If you have an iPhone, check its serial number and verify it on its website.


To get an iPhone’s serial number, go to Settings > General > About phone.
Once you get the serial number, input it here: https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do. It will check your phone’s warranty period.
If the system says “We're sorry, but this serial number is not valid. Please check your information and try again,” it is likely that your iPhone is fake.
 For Android and other handsets, the IMEI can be found on the back of your handset. If the sticker has been tampered, you can find it in Settings > About > Status. The IMEI information is there too.


You can also dial *#06# on your handset to display your IMEI.
Once you get the IMEI, go to Imei.info. Input your phone’s IMEI in the box and hit “CHECK.”
The system will verify the phone’s information. If it displays information different from the handset, then your handset might be fake.

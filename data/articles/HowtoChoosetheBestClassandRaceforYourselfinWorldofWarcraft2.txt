 The class you choose will depend on what function you want to perform within the group. There are several classes specific to each role:



Tank: Tanks are the players with a lot of armor and hit points that take all the damage on them when fighting several mobs at once or a very powerful mob (bosses or elites). Choose:

Protection Warrior
Blood Death Knight
Protection Paladin
Guardian Druid.



DPS (damage per second): DPSes are the players that wield a lot of damage and do the main killing in dungeons or battlegrounds. Choose:

Arms/Fury Warrior
Feral/Balance Druid
Beast Mastery/Marksmanship/Survival Hunter
Arcane/Fire/Frost Mage
Affliction/Demonology/Destruction Warlock
Frost/Unholy Death Knight
Retribution Paladin
Shadow Priest
Assassination/Combat/Subtelty Rogue
Elemental/Enhancement Shaman



Healer: Healers are those who heal other players (especially tanks) in dungeons and battlegrounds. They're the players you really need to count on during battle. Choose:

Discipline/Holy Priest
Restoration Druid
Holy Paladin
Restoration Shaman



Jack of all trades: These are the versatile classes that can play all 3 roles.

Druid (switch between animal forms and talent trees)
Paladin (switch between talent trees)



Pet Classes: These players not only have many versatile abilities for controlling and damaging the enemy, but who have a summonable ally for use in off-tanking and aggro mitigation as well as additional DPS. While the individual characters may not be extraordinary themselves, their pets and minions often wield considerable damage and may well have more armor than themselves. Learning how to control a Pet and not have it cause problems in groups may be a fun and exciting challenge, but when soloing these classes are never truly solo. Choose:

Hunter
Warlock
Unholy Death Knight.

 Your doctor may prescribe a course of ursodiol to dissolve your gallstones without surgery. These treatments are essentially bile acids in pill form. Ursodiol, in particular, is a popular treatment because it is one of the safest common drugs available.

Oral dissolution therapy is most likely to be successful in treating small stones (less than 1.5 centimeters in diameter) with high cholesterol content. About 30 percent of gallbladder patients are candidates for this treatment.
If you are suffering from pigment stones, you will likely need to pursue other treatment.
This treatment tends to be less successful for obese patients.;
, This therapy is often used in combination with oral dissolution therapy, although laparoscopic surgery is now so readily available that shock wave therapy is rarely performed today. This therapy, also called lithotripsy, uses sound waves to break gallstones into more easily dissolvable pieces.This treatment works best on gallstones under 2 centimeters in diameter.This treatment is somewhat rare, as it is only available in a few locations.
 Gallstones return in a majority of patients who pursue dissolution treatments. As a result, these treatments are no longer common. Typically they are used for patients who are physically unable to tolerate surgery.

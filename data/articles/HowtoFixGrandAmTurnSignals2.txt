 Remove the 7 #10-Torx screws from the multifunction switch. A straight screwdriver can help because it is difficult to reach with a driver & socket Torx set. There is a small catch-tab on the windshield-washer handle side (#8).
 Clean the grease off the contacts and copper switch plate (q-tips and rubbing alcohol work well). You will probably notice that the grease has bridged the some of the slots in switch plate. You may wish to re-grease the plates, but it is somewhat optional. The grease may help the parts slide a little easier, but grease also attracts dirt, so it is a difficult choice.
 Be careful of the spring. It must go onto the metal peg and into the deep plastic well (shown in the previous photo) when snapping the top and bottom pieces of the multifunction switch back together. This is the spring-loaded horn-ring contact pin (E shown in the first photo).

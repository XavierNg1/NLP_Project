 Determine if a blaster is right for your needs. If your paint covers a large area, then a blaster may be a better choice over a paint stripper solution. One form of blasting is soda blasting, which uses baking soda as the scouring agents. Soda blasting is also much more environmentally-friendly than using chemicals, and will not damage the concrete underneath.
 To soda blast, you will need a pot blaster. Your local hardware store may be able to rent them to you. You will also need special sodium bicarbonate. The baking powder that you buy at the grocery store is too fine to use in a soda blaster. The proper powder should be available where you rent the blaster, but can also be ordered online.









Most standard sand blasters cannot work with soda. You will need to obtain a specialized soda blaster in order to use sodium bicarbonate.
 Work slowly, holding the nozzle about a foot and a half away from the ground. Be sure to wear a respirator to avoid inhaling particles. Move the nozzle evenly across the painted area to make sure that no paint gets left behind.









If blasting near vegetation, be sure to avoid getting excess particles on plants. The high pH soda can cause browning and death in flowers and bushes.
If you have a lot of paint to remove, consider hiring a professional blaster. The amount of blasting material needed and the size of the blasting unit will most likely be far too much to afford on your own.

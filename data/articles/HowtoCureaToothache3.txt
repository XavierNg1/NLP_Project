 This is a home remedy that is said to cure or at least ease the pain of a toothache until it goes away on its own. Rub a few drops on the affected tooth several times daily until the ache goes away. Clove oil can be found at most drug stores.
 This time-worn home remedy eases the pain of a toothache, but it probably won't cure it. Still, it's a useful trick when the ache is caused by a blow or a mild infection that will go away after a few days. Pour some whisky or vodka on a cotton ball and apply it to the affected tooth. If the gums become red or irritated, then stop using this method.
 This procedure will clean the area, and can help to ease the pain. Be sure to rinse your mouth with water, and absolutely refrain from swallowing the peroxide.









Dip a Q-tip in hydrogen-peroxide, ensuring saturation.
Apply the peroxide liberally to the affected area.

 With your thumb, press the point on the back of your other hand where the base of your thumb and your index finger meet. Apply pressure for about two minutes. This helps trigger the release of endorphin, the brainâ€™s feel-good hormones.
 Swish 1 tbsp of coconut oil in your mouth for 15-20 minutes. There are claims that this reduces the amount to harmful bacteria in the mouth. When you swish the oil, the bacteria get 'stuck' in the oil. This is how the bacteria, as well as plaque caused by bacteria is removed. After 15-20 minutes spit out the oil into a garbage can. Do not swallow it...you will be swallowing the bacteria in the oil if you swallow it. You also should not put oil in the drain, as it can harden and cause it to clog.

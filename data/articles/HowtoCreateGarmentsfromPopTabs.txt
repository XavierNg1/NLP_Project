 Write down the shapes and sizes of each piece you're going to make. For example, a good vest design consists of four pieces: one rectangle across the back, from neck to below arms, and across shoulders; a second from under arms to waist, across sides and back, and two more from collar to waist, side to center front.;
, In addition, add an inch to each measurement. These will be used for the weaving. It uses the same method as in weaving placemats. You will need around 3 vertical strips for every 2 inches (5.1 cm) horizontally, and 2 horizontal strips for every vertical inch. The strips should be about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.
 Make it so that the untaped ends face right. One should be just above the other on the board.
 The number of tabs should be 3 for every 2 inches (5.1 cm) of length. The top strip is strung through the top hole of the tab from the front. The bottom strip is strung through the bottom hole from the back. The tabs should be close to each other, but not touching.
, The rows should be close, but not touching.
 These go under the top of the tab, over the horizontal strips and middle of the tab, then under the bottom of the tab. These should connect the two rows.
, This is done by pinning and sewing the loose ends to a separate strip of fabric about an inch thick.
 The rest is up to your tailoring skills. You may have to do some trimming and sewing to make it look and fit right. When you're done, show it off proudly. You've got some very unique shiny wear.

 Place the softened cream cheese, sour cream, and taco seasoning into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer set to medium-high speed, beat the three ingredients together for 1 to 2 minutes, or until evenly and smoothly combined.Note that the cream cheese must be softened to room temperature before you begin. The mixture will likely retain more lumps if you use cold cream cheese.
You can use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of homemade taco seasoning or one 1.25 oz (35 g) package of dry taco seasoning.
For a "skinny" version of this dish, use reduced-fat cream cheese and sour cream instead of the full-fat versions.;
, Evenly spread the seasoned cream cheese mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch (23-cm) square or round serving dish., Transfer the dish to the refrigerator and let the cream cheese mixture chill for roughly 15 minutes, or until it becomes slightly firm.You can technically skip this step if you're in a rush, but chilling this bottom layer before progressing to the next part will help keep the layers separate and distinct.
 Open 16-oz (450-g) can of refried beans and spread the beans evenly over the cream cheese layer in your serving dish.


Spread the beans lightly. The key is to create two distinct layers, rather than mixing the beans and cream cheese into a single combined layer.
 Add the shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, green onions, shredded cheddar cheese, sliced black olives, and tortilla strips to the top of the taco dip, following that order.


You may omit any toppings you do not enjoy. Similarly, you can also substitute or add other vegetable toppings as desired. Popular optional additions might include diced bell pepper or diced chile pepper.
 You can serve the taco dip immediately or chill it for 30 minutes prior to serving it. Enjoy the dip with tortilla chips or corn chips.


Cover the leftovers with plastic wrap and keep them in the refrigerator for up to 3 or 4 days.

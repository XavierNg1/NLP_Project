 Choose a song people know. If people can sing along in their heads, they like you more. Choose a song that relates to your age level. Don't choose a song that has to do with inappropriate things for your age. To tell if it is an appropriate choice, play it in front of your parents. If you feel weird to play it in front of your parents, reconsider. Also choice a song that does not have high or long notes you can't do. Think small and don't overdo it.;
, Remembering lyrics are critical to you winning. If you forget them, it's embarrassing and can ruin your flow. Just keep reviewing them and listen to the music video all the time. It also helps to write the lyrics down over and over.
 Delve into what the meaning is. Loss of a love, pain, depression, etc? Once you understand it, think of when you felt that way. If you feel uninspired, watch the original artist sing live in a video. Look at how they move and how their facial expressions look.
 Make sure you've practice a great deal and have all your equipment/clothing ready. Get a good night's rest and try to relax before the event.


Wear something modest. It is hard to believe pain if you are in a tank top and frilly skirt. If you are a girl, wear dark colored eye shadow and lipstick. Once you are ready sing the song over and over until its you turn.
 Try to remember the feelings the song evokes for you. Sing the song with emotion and try to make the crowd believe you. If possible make yourself cry, nothing moves people then tears.

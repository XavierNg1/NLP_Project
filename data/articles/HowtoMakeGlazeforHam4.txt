 Combine an 8-oz (225-g) can of crushed pineapple and its juice with the apricot preserved and freshly minced ginger in a saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally, until the glaze reaches a boil.


Boiling this glaze is important since it causes the sugars in the apricot preserves to break down and mix into the rest of the ingredients, creating a thick and consistently blended product.
Since you need to boil and cool this glaze, it's best to prepare it before you start cooking the ham. You can prepare it up to five days in advance.
 Transfer the contents of the saucepan to a blender. Process on medium speed until a smooth glaze forms.


This step is technically optional. If you'd prefer a glaze with chunks of pineapple in it, you can skip the blending process and move directly into the next step.
 Allow the glaze to sit out at room temperature until it cools down.


If you don't plan to use the glaze immediately after cooling it, transfer it to an airtight container and store it in your refrigerator for up to five days.
 Bake the ham as usual, and brush this glaze over the surface of the ham once the ham only has an estimated 30 to 40 minutes left of bake time.


Quickly stir the glaze again before you apply it.
This glaze may burn if you apply it too early, so it's best to use it near the end of the cooking time.

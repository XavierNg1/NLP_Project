 This can't be stressed enough. You are juggling 6 or 7 subjects (a planer will be helpful) at a college course level here, so for goodness' sake, keep your notes for each separate, organized and well written so that you can refer to them when it comes to exam time.
 Ask questions. Take well ordered notes. Follow up anything that you don't understand, as soon as possible.

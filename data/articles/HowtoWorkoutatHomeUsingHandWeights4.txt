 Have toned shoulders can be very attractive and really well toned shoulders can even be seen through clothing. Impress your crush with some rocking shoulders.








Stand up, holding dumbbells in both hands. Hold the dumbbells at shoulder level. Your palms should be facing each other.
Extend your elbows until they come close to locking. The dumbbells should get raised straight into the air--hold them in this position for a moment.
Slowly lower your arms so that the dumbbells are back at shoulder level.
 Sit on the edge of a chair, bed, or workout bench.









Lift the dumbbells so that they are at shoulder height with your palms facing forward.
Push the dumbbells straight in the air. Your elbows should come close to locking but do not lock.
Hold the dumbbells in the air for a moment and then slowly lower them back to your shoulders.
 Lateral raises are a great standing exercise to buff up and tone your shoulders. You can also do them while sitting but instead of holding the dumbbells in front of you, hold them down by your sides.








Hold a dumbbell in each hand and hold your hands in front of your hips. Your palms should be facing each other.
Lift your arms out to your sides until they are almost parallel with the ground. Hold them in this position for a moment and then release them back down to your hips.

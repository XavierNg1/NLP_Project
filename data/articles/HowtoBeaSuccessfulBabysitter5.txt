 When parents come home to a clean and tidy house this is a great bonus. They will likely be grateful of the added care you took while in their home.Tidy up after each game or activity to keep on top of the mess.
Clean up food and dishes after meals and snacks. You might not have time to fully do all the dishes, but you should try to tidy up and rinse the dishes.
 The more you are able to fit with a family’s schedule and are okay with taking on additional time the more likely you will be hired back.For example, if parents aren’t sure of the exact time that they will be home and you are flexible to stay between a time range (i.e. they will be home at some point between 9:30 and 11:00pm), that can be very helpful.
 It is reassuring to the parents when you are able to tell them what you and the kids were up to while they were out. This shows that you were actively engaged and paying attention to the children.You can also provide feedback on their child’s behaviour, whether positive or negative.
You should also inform parents of any problems or incidents, including injuries, even if they were small.
 There are little things that you can do to set yourself apart. This could include things such as, helping kids with their homework or looking after pets while you babysit. Parents will recognize these helpful additional tasks you do while babysitting and see you as an exceptional babysitter.

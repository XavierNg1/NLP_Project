 All but the newest pocket watches will run on time for between 26 and 30 hours per wind at most. Even the latest models only last about 46 hours. Regardless of what type of pocket watch you own, plan to give it a full wind every day.


The best time to wind your watch is in the morning. You can make it part of your daily routine, and the watch almost always gets wound at the same time each day, ensuring reliability.
 A soft, dry chamois or microfiber cloth is suitable for gently lifting skin oil and dirt off of metal surfaces. Use a tiny bit of metal cleaner if needed. Clean your watch every time you are done wearing it.


If you wear your watch most days, clean it two to three times weekly, or as needed.
Don't forget to periodically wipe down the inside faces of the watch with your dry cloth.
 Use a polish designed for the metal of your watch to keep it shiny. Apply a bit of polish, per the directions on the package, every few months or as needed.


If you need to remove tarnish, avoid products that require submersion in liquid. This can damage or loosen the delicate inner pieces of a pocket watch.
Use the same polish on your chain, assuming it's made of a similar material.
 Always make sure the watch fob or chain is securely attached to the watch at one end, and an item of clothing at the other.


Attach your chain to an item of clothing you don't plan to remove. Avoid jackets and other such layered coverings.

 Add oats and a little extra water to your pancake batter to get a wholesome, filling pancake recipe with extra antioxidants.
 If you have time for traditional oats, cook them yourself. Otherwise, plain (unflavored) instant oatmeal packets or quick-cook oats can be an excellent morning source of antioxidants, particularly if you choose your toppings from among the other breakfast antioxidant sources listed here. Add cinnamon for an extra antioxidant boost.
 Buy whole grain oat bread or make oat muffins. These bread products are packed with fiber and nutrients in addition to antioxidants.

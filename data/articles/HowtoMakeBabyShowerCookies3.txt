Mix the dough and chill it.
Roll out the dough and cut out your cookie rounds.
Place the cookies on a baking sheet that has been covered in parchment paper. Be sure to leave enough room for the lollipop sticks or skewers that you will insert.
Do not bake the cookies until you insert the lollipop sticks or skewers.


Push the sticks or skewers at least halfway up the center of the cookie.
If you use wooden skewers, make sure that you soak them in water for 1 hour before you use them. That way, they wonâ€™t burn or ignite when you bake them.
 Allow the cookies to cool completely., Allow the decorative icing to dry completely., The larger the pot, the more cookie lollipops you will have to use for your centerpiece.,

Make a taller lollipop cookie in the rear center of the display by poking the lollipop stick only slightly into the foam.
Surround the taller cookie with shorter lollipop cookies by poking the lollipop sticks further down into the foam.
, At the end of the shower, draw names and give the centerpiece away to a guest.

 Think color when it comes to eyeshadow. Pinks, blues and purples were popular. And don't be afraid to color outside the lines.
 Wear thick black eyeliner on both your top and bottom lids. Draw cat eyes or smudge it a little for a real rocker finish.
 Apply rouge heavily and visibly. Accentuate those cheekbones.

 It only works if you store books in more than one place (different shelves on a bookcase doesn't count, but different bookcases does. You may also have other book storage places). This is also similar to desktop organisation, but for the whole room.


Decide where you read the most
Organise all your books by how often you will (or when you will next) look at them. For example, if you intend to start reading a book as soon as you have finished your current one, move it closer to your reading area. However, if a book is a book you will only occasionally use / aren't going to read until you have read numerous other books, you may want to move it further away.
Remember that this technique can be used with other techniques.

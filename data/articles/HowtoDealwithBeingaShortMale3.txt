 One unfortunate aspect of being a short male is that people may mention it a bit too often. These comments have more to do with the speaker's insecurity than they do with you. Next time someone mentions your height and it bothers you, pause a moment, remind yourself that they’re acting immaturely, and see if you can simply let it pass., Sometimes, a response is warranted. The type of response, however, is up to you. Usually, refusing to acknowledge a tasteless comment is the best route. However, if the comments continue, it’s best to confront the person in a direct, non-aggressive way.Perhaps the best way to do so is by looking them in the eye and asking, “You’re not trying to offend me, are you?” This provides them an out to laugh it off, while sending the message that you don’t appreciate their comments.
It is often completely fair to say something like, “Hey, I can joke about height with the best of them, but this is getting kind of old. Will you stop cracking jokes at my expense?”
Most importantly, stay calm, and avoid responding with insults of your own.
 Again, this is easier said than done. That said, if there’s someone in your life to whom your height seems like a big deal, it’s likely worth addressing. Say something like, “It seems like my height is a big deal to you. It’s not to me, so I’d prefer it if you quit bringing it up.” If they don’t get the message and insist on viewing you in terms of your height, you may do well to avoid them altogether.

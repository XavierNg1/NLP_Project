 Although no man-made imitations exist, be aware that other naturally occurring materials are sometimes passed off as peridots. Always look into who you’re buying from before making a final purchase. Research their history by:Checking customer reviews and ratings.
Joining online forums and asking about sellers to avoid.
Favoring those with warranties, return policies, certification of products, and other forms of buyer protection.
 Check to see if the seller includes this in their product description, whether it’s in-store or online. If not, ask them directly how they have treated the stone while it’s been in their possession. Know that:Peridot should only be cleaned a couple of times a year at most.
It should only been cleaned with mild soap and water and a brush with soft bristles.
Unlike other stones, it should never be cleaned with ultrasonic cleaners.
 If you are looking to buy a specific piece from a private owner, rather than a seller, be extra diligent about judging how they treat their jewelry. Ask if they have any certification from the seller they bought it from originally. Also keep in mind that peridots are soft stones, which means they can be damaged easily. Make sure the owner:Keeps their jewelry in a temperature-controlled environment, since fluctuations in temperature and prolonged heat can cause the stone’s color to fade over time.
Stores their peridot in a soft padding, such a pouch or a box lined with cotton or velvet, to protect it from scratches.
Cleans their peridot appropriately, with soft soap and brushes, no more than once or twice a year.

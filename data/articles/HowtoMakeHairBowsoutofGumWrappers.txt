 Make sure your gum wrapper is clean and doesn't have any gum stuck on it. Fold the sides of the wrapper back into the same shape as it was when the wrapper actually had gum in it. Then, fold it in half, as shown on the right.;
, Fan the sides out with your fingers so it looks more like a bow. bow.
 Find glue (preferably something like hot glue or super glue, a kind that will hold strongly), a hair pin (bobby pin, clip), and some kind of bead or button (this embellishment is optional).
 This will make it harden just a little.
 Alternatively, slide it onto one of the sides.(this depends if the bead is big).
 Now you've got a cute hair accessory that was cheap to make but looks really cool.

 Start the address line in the middle front of the envelope. It may be more business appropriate to add an honorific prefix, such as “Mr.” or “Ms.” before the name of the person.
 You should write this directly below the name of the person.
 This may include an apartment or unit number, followed by a hyphen and then a street address.
 Canadian addresses have specific postal and province codes for different parts of the country. Before writing out the address, you must find out what the specific codes, including the correct abbreviation of the provinces, are.


If the person or business you are writing to hasn’t already given you this information, you can find out by visiting USPS websiteor the Canada Post website, Place 1 space between the city and the province and 2 spaces between the province and the postal code.
 The country name should always be the last line of the address, unless you are already sending your mail from Canada, in which case this line is not necessary.
 In the upper left hand corner, write out your return address, following the same format as the recipient’s address.
 When writing or typing the address, be sure to leave 15 mm (0.6 inches) of space on each side of the envelope. There must be 40 mm (1.6 inches) of space from the top of the envelope and 19 mm (0.75 inches) of blank space from the bottom of the envelope.


Write all business addresses in uppercase letters. If possible, you may want to use a computer to simply type and print the address as this can decrease the processing time.
If you have a graphic or logo on your envelope, it must be placed to the left of the address. You must ensure you have the same amount of space left from the edge with the logo included.

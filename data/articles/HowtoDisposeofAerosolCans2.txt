 It may not seem like a big deal to throw a partially full can of hairspray or cleaning product in the garbage, but it can actually be very dangerous. Because aerosol cans are pressurized, they explode if they are exposed to high heat or flattened. This could even happen in the garbage truck, which could cause injuries., The easiest way to get rid of the aerosol can is simply to use the product until the can is empty, and then dispose of the can in the recycling or trash.


If you canâ€™t use it yourself, consider donating it to someone who will use it. For example, cans of spray paint may be used by local artists or students. Your friends or family members may also be able to use your products.
 When you bring a partially full aerosol can to a hazardous waste collection site, they may puncture it to remove the contents and allow the can to be recycled. While this can be done by trained professionals with specialized equipment, it should never be done at home! Puncturing an aerosol can can cause an explosion, so please leave it to the experts., You can locate a collection facility near you by searching on your city's or county's website. You may need to pay a small fee to safely dispose of your aerosol cans, but it should not be significant.Many towns have events where people can bring in their hazardous waste and get rid of it for free or a reduced cost.
You may find a local business that needs the product inside. They may be willing to take them for you.

 The first thing you want to do is delete all the fusion coils and plasma batteries that are on the map. Then, drive one of the elephants out to a flat open area. Next, stack every single fusion coil in the middle of the bottom floor, but spread them all over the middle or else it won't work, and don't forget to set the respawn time to 10 seconds and the maximum/minimum time to the highest number.;
, Set the times for respawn just like the fusion coils.
 It will do flips and rise up really high, then fall down and rise up again, and it usually makes its way around the map, unless you do it a certain way.
 What typically happens is called "LAG" which is when you have to much stuff together and causes the elephant to "LAG" into the ground. After awhile the game will get angry or whatever and make your elephant barrel roll, but in the more severe cases, the lag can send your elephant across the entire map. This is considered to be a relative to the "Bump", which is the annoying "bump" that items do when you try to form objects with turret cases and stuff like that, and it usually screws everything up and makes it all fall down.

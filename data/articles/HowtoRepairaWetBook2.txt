 If the book is entirely waterlogged, remove water by placing the book on its head atop an absorbent sheet of paper or a towel. Allow the water to drain and drip. Replace the absorbent fabric each time it becomes soaked through. If the book is only damp, you can shake it from side to side., If there is a lot of water remaining in the pages, it has not been drained properly. Place the book back on its head, and place absorbent paper inside both the front and back cover. This will help expedite the drying process and keep the spine intact.Avoid any absorbent paper (paper towel, newspaper, etc) with lettering or designs, as these may bleed onto the book.
 Place the damaged book into a plastic bag, and seal it. Do not perform a vacuum seal, however; you want some air to be able to reach the bookâ€™s pages, and some space to be between the texture of the bag and the book itself. A simple kitchen storage bag will work., Place the book on its spine in the freezer. If possible, keep food separate from the books, and give them their own shelf to facilitate air flow., This process takes quite some time before it works, so give your book 1-2 weeks, depending upon the length of the book. A longer book will require more time, while a shorter book may only need 4-5 days. If the book is still wavy and waterlogged, give it another couple of days before you remove it.

Done properly, this method will prevent tearing and bleeding ink.

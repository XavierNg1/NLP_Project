 Point towards the front of the room (tendu) using your outside foot. Lift your inside arm slightly and use it to help you pivot. Point the outside foot to the side and put weight on it. You should now be facing the side.
 Your arms should be facing the wall like you're about to give it a hug.
 While doing this, close both of your arms so the palms face your belly button.
 This means that you must pick an object such as a dot or clock on the other wall that you are turning towards. Keep your eyes on the object while you are turning and once you can't keep your eyes on it any longer, turn your head and find that object again.

, Turn it on and insert 'The Sims 3' into the disc drive.
,, Avoid driving.
 100 Catfish is foolproof, but you only really need 90 catfish. Make sure they are three star Catfish, or it will not work. Also make sure they are plain Catfish and not Alley Catfish.
 It doesn't matter if there is anything else in your fridge. Make sure you put every single one of the Catfish into the fridge.
 Buying the Catfish at noon and then sleeping until about midnight should be enough.
 Put them all into your backpack.
 They will be worth over 17,000 Simoleons each and if you sell all of them, you will earn 999,999 Simoleons, which is the limit that you can have. This will also achieve the lifetime wish of 'earn a family net worth ofÂ ??? Simoleons', if your Sim has this wish.
 You will be able to afford the most expensive mansion with furniture and all of the extensions. If your Sim had the lifetime wish mentioned above, they will also have lots of happiness points to spend.

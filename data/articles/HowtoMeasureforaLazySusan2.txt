 Half-round (also known as half moon) Lazy Susans are designed specifically for these cabinets, which are quite long. These are the kinds of cabinets that have only one door occupying half of their length. The half-round Lazy Susan is typically attached to the door, sliding out as it is opened.


Keep in mind that if your kitchen cabinets have face frames, you’ll need to allow more leeway in the below measurements for the Lazy Susan to open properly.
 Stretch it along the underside of the cabinet, from the left wall to the right. Set it in place, lock it and record the measurement.


For the best fit, you’ll typically want a Lazy Susan with a total length one or two inches shorter than this measurement., Placing your tape measure at the cabinet’s opening, extend it until it touches the back wall. Record this measurement and compare it to the radius of the Lazy Susan you plan to order. You’ll want the Lazy Susan’s radius to be a bit shorter than the depth of your cabinet, usually between 3 to 4 inches., Stretch a measuring tape over the opening and note the measurement. Make sure it is slightly larger than the radius of the Lazy Susan.This will ensure the Lazy Susan has sufficient space to swivel out as you open the cabinet doors.
 While half-round Lazy Susans come with a metal shaft that adjusts to various cabinet heights, they usually have a minimum and maximum height. Measure the inside of your cabinet, bottom to top, and ensure it falls within this range.

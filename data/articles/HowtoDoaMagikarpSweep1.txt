 Basically, a Magikarp sweep is an epic strategy used by some Pokémon trainers that defeats the entire opponents' Pokémon team using Flail when Magikarps' Attack is maximized. How does it work? When Magikarp is holding a Focus Sash, it will endure a potential OHKO. And when you switch in a Smeargle, your Smeargle will use Belly Drum and then Baton Pass to your Magikarp. Magikarp will then use flail and KO the other team. It's not as confusing as it seems!

 You donâ€™t need to purchase a special cloth to clean and polish your sterling silver. A soft, lint-free cloth made of a fabric like flannel or microfiber works well. Using a nonabrasive cloth will prevent scratches on your sterling silver.Never use an old t-shirt. Printing and ink on the shirt can damage the silver.Avoid tissues and paper towels, as they can scratch sterling silver.
 Gently polish the surface of the sterling silver. Make long strokes that go along with the grain of the silver. Avoid rubbing the cloth in circles, which can magnify existing scratches., When the area of the cloth you are using to polish the sterling silver turns black, begin using a new section of the cloth. This will ensure you do not place the tarnish you are removing back on the silver., If you find it difficult to reach tiny, detailed areas of the sterling silver, try using a cotton swab. Make sure the swab is one hundred percent cotton, as other materials may scratch or dull your sterling silver.

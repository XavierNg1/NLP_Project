, Before anything is signed, have your forms reviewed by a courthouse facilitator. Most courts in Oregon have a courthouse facilitator program, which helps people with family law cases. Most facilitators offer document review services, either for walk-ins or by appointment.You can find detailed information for facilitator services in each county at http://courts.oregon.gov/OJD/docs/OSCA/cpsd/courtimprovement/familylaw/FacilitatorsList.pdf. Facilitators do not represent you or give legal advice, but they can review your forms and help you with any questions you have about the process.
 Make copies of your forms and take them to the court clerk. The clerk will stamp the original and the copies as "filed" and retain the original document. Filing your forms initiates a court case. The clerk will contact you to give you a hearing date. There is no filing fee., When you return to court for the hearing, the judge will ask you questions about your petition before he or she grants your request. The child's other parent will have the opportunity to deny any allegations of abuse or neglect. Bring any evidence and witnesses you can use to demonstrate that it would be in the child's best interests to be removed from the parent and placed in your care.
 Have the affidavit, motion, and signed order from the judge served on the other parent. You cannot serve the other parent yourself, but you can have the sheriff's office, a professional process server, or someone who is over 18 and not part of the case serve him or her for you.


If you cannot locate the other parent to serve him or her, check with friends, family, employers, former landlords, the tax collector's records, the DMV, and the post office. You can even hire a private investigator.If all else fails, ask the court clerk how to request permission from the court to give "constructive notice" by publishing notice of the case in the newspaper.
 Have the person who served the other parent complete an Affidavit of Service, which is available at http://courts.oregon.gov/OJD/docs/osca/cpsd/courtimprovement/familylaw/affidavitsrv16aver02_000.pdf. By signing this form, he or she verifies that the other parent was served. Then you must file the affidavit with the court clerk.

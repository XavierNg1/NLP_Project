 To prepare your skein of yarn for dying, you'll need to soak it in what's called a "mordant" - a compound that helps the dye to set into the material. The most readily available substance to use as a mordant is regular distilled vinegar.


Place the entire skein of yarn into a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix about 1 part vinegar to 3 parts warm, clean water.






Pour the vinegar mixture over the skein of yarn. Ensure that it is completely submerged, and allow it to soak for about 20 minutes.

, Any type of coffee will work well for dying yarn, and you can brew it using your usual method. The coffee can be brewed at regular strength, although a stronger brew can be prepared to achieve a darker color dye.
 Drain the vinegar mixture from the bowl of yarn, but do not rinse the residual liquid away. Immediately pour the coffee over the yarn in the bowl, again submerging it completely.
 To allow the dye to penetrate and set into the yarn, you will need to heat the mixture. The quickest and simplest way to do this is by using a microwave oven.


Place the bowl of coffee-soaked yarn in the microwave. Heat it on the highest setting for about 3 minutes, or long enough to just bring the coffee to a simmer.






After the initial heating, use a set of tongs to flip the yarn over in the bowl to ensure that it will be exposed to the dye evenly. Microwave the yarn for another 2 or 3 minutes, and then let it rest in the coffee until it returns to room temperature.
 After the coffee has cooled to room temperature, pour it out. Place the skein of yarn under a faucet and rinse it thoroughly until the water runs completely clear.
 When the yarn is rinsed completely of its coffee dye, you should hang it to air dry before using it. A convenient way to hang your yarn is to drape it over the faucet that you used to rinse it.

 Gboard is a custom keyboard that enables integrated Google Search and Android-style glide typing. Search for Gboard in the App Store and press “Get” to install. Upon launching, follow the explicit instructions displayed to get set up.
 Open the Gboard app and tap “Search settings”. In the search settings menu, turn “Contacts Search” on.
 Tap the text field in the app you are using to compose your message. Tap and hold the globe icon on the keyboard and select Gboard.


Alternately, simply tapping the globe icon on the keyboard cycles through your available keyboards in sequence.
 The Google icon (multicolored "G") activates Gboard’s search feature. A search bar will appear directly above the keyboard.
 Enter the name of someone from your contacts list into the search bar. Their contact card will appear in the predictive search.
 Tap the name in the search results to bring up the contact card. Tap share at the bottom of the contact card and their contact info is automatically copied into the text field.
 When you are ready, tap the send button to share the contact.

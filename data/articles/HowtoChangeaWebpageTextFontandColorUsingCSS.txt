 For example:

<span style="(css)">Text</span>

Almost any HTML tag can include "style," such as

p

or

div

What goes in between the quotes is the CSS part.;
,, For example:

<span style="font-family:times, georgia, serif;">Text</span>

will cause "Text" to use the Times font. If times is not available, Georgia will be used. If neither Times nor Georgia are available, a generic serif font will be used.
 You can use any valid HTML color name in the place of "red." You can also use a hex code. For example:

<span style="font:#FFFFFF;">Text</span>

will cause "Text" to be white.

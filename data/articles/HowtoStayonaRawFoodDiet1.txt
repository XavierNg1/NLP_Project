 When you go to the grocery store to purchase your fresh fruits and vegetables, donâ€™t go near the foods that you're tempted by. If you find that you're constantly craving chocolates, stay away from that aisle altogether. You're less likely to give in to those temptations if they're not right in front of you.


If you can, try to avoid listening to commercials and other advertisements for unhealthy foods until you become accustomed to your new lifestyle. In particular, visual cues can be the hardest to resist, so be careful with TV and online ads.

, If you give in to temptation, it will have potentially negative effects on your body and undo the gains managed thus far. A raw food diet is especially good for your body and even though you may enjoy the taste of cooked or processed foods, indulging in them will not be worth the bloating, gas and other likely unpleasant results. Not only will your health pay the price, but you're likely to have emotional consequences as well when you are faced with the realization that you've not exercised your willpower.
 If you do slip up and eat something that doesn't classify as raw food, write down how bad it made you feel after you ate it. Include both physical symptoms and emotional effects. Go back and review the journal the next time you feel the urge to cheat. This can be a great help in staying on track by reminding you of unpleasant side effects of slipping back.
 A little fruit is a great substitute for a sweet craving. When you're feeling tempted by a sugary, processed sweet treat, fill the craving with a handful of berries, which are some of the healthiest fruit sources available. Nuts can also be a great substitute if you're craving something fatty (but avoid peanuts as you might not be able to stop eating them), while tomatoes are known to help curb a salt craving that might otherwise lead to eating processed foods.

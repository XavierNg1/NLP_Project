 Although it is very mild compared to other abrasive cleansers, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) can still scratch up your sink. Use it only if you canâ€™t take off the dirt with soap and water or lemon juice., You can use a repurposed sugar shaker, or make your own shaker by punching a few holes in the lid of a jar. Shake on a generous quantity of baking soda.Make sure the sink is only slightly damp when you apply the baking soda. Baking soda dissolves quickly in water, which makes it ineffective as an abrasive.
 Use a slightly damp (not soaking wet) scrubber to gently rub away the dirt. The baking soda should form small clumps that take the dirt with them as they come up.Use a non-scratch scrubbing sponge.
Avoid steel wool or pumice stones for this purpose, as both can do a lot of damage to ceramic or porcelain sinks.
 Run some cold water into the sink and rinse away any remaining dirt and baking soda. Wipe down with a clean, dry towel or rag.

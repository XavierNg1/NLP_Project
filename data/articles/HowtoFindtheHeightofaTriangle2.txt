 An equilateral triangle has three equal sides, and three equal angels that are each 60 degrees. If you cut an equilateral triangle in half, you will end up with two congruent right triangles. In this example, we will be using an equilateral triangle with side lengths of 8.
 The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right triangle with sides of length a and b, and hypotenuse of length c: a2 + b2 = c2. We can use this theorem to find the height of our equilateral triangle!, Side a will be equal to 1/2 the side length, and side b is the height of the triangle that we need to solve.


Using our example equilateral triangle with sides of 8, c = 8 and a = 4.
 First square c and a by multiplying each number by itself. Then subtract a2 from c2.


42 + b2 = 82

16 + b2 = 64
b2 = 48

, Use the square root function on your calculator to find Sqrt(2. The answer is the height of your equilateral triangle!


b = Sqrt (48) = 6.93

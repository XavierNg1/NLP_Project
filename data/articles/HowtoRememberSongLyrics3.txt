 Sit down with a piece of paper, a pen, and the listening device of your choice. As you listen to the artist’s original track, write down the lyrics. You may wish to pause the song every so often so you can keep up., Print out the lyrics or pull them up on a tablet, computer, or phone. Copy the lyrics onto a separate piece of paper. As you feel more confident, flip the lyrics over and try to write them down from memory.


You could add doodles and drawings too. Connecting the lyrics to drawings may help you remember the words better., After you’ve practiced the song for a while, remove the prompts and test your memory. While you sing or hum the song, try to write out the lyrics. Again, you may need to take pauses to catch up or slow down the song to keep up.

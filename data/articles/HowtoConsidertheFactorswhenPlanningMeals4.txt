 Take into account how much time you have each day to cook. For instance, if you work 8 or more hours per day, you’re going to have less time available for preparing meals. Plan meals that are faster and easier to prepare.


Invest in a crock pot. You do a quick prep the night before, toss everything in the crock pot the next morning, turn it on and you're done! When you arrive back home later that evening, your meal will be waiting for you.Cook large batches and freeze portions for later meals.
Use canned items, like beans, for a quicker meal prep. No hours of soaking required.When you're short on time, use frozen vegetables instead of fresh. Frozen veggies are still nutritious, and you'll save tons of prep time.Explore new recipes that incorporate baking, grilling and sauteing. Baking casseroles, for example, generally requires a short prep time and once you pop it in the oven, you don't have to babysit it.
 Be certain that you have the cookware, utensils, dishes and other items required for the meals you’re planning on hand before you buy all of the ingredients to make them. If you are planning large meals with the intention of having leftovers, make sure you have enough storage containers and Tupperware to accommodate everything.
 Also avoid recipes that require gourmet ingredients or any other hard-to-find items.


If you’re planning large meals, make sure the ingredients you need can be easily obtained in large quantities.
 If you’re cooking alone, don’t plan elaborate or complex meals that require a lot of preparation. Plan meals that you can easily handle yourself, unless you have people around in your house that can assist you.

 Traditionally, the bridesmaids and groomsmen are introduced to the guests during the entrance. In addition to their names, the MC should also state their relationship to the couple and their role in the wedding. For example, “Please welcome Anne Webster, Maid of Honor and sister of the bride.”If you have a flower girl and ring bearer, it is traditional to include them in the entrance. You might want to have an adult escort them, as they could be nervous.
 If your wedding is somewhat formal, you might be going for a more sedate entrance. Make sure to communicate your wishes directly to the bridal party. You don’t want to start your reception off on a bad foot by having an entrance that you don’t like.

You might send an email describing the entrance you want. You could say, “I know lots of entrances include fun dances, but my wedding is going to be more formal. I’d appreciate it if you could just walk sedately and smile.”

, The key to your big day going smoothly is careful planning. This doesn’t mean you have to run yourself ragged checking every little thing, but it’s a good idea to make sure you have the entrance planned exactly the way you want it. A few days before the wedding, make sure to:

Give your MC the list of names and pronunciation guide.
Ensure you are comfortable with your choice of music.
Follow up with the bridal party members to make sure everyone knows the plan.
If you are using a wedding coordinator, check to make sure they know your specifications.

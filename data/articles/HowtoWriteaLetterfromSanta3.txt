 You can find many free templates online for how to write a letter from Santa Claus.Many sites have customizable letters. They will provide the template, and you personalize the letter by adding identifying details about the child, such as his or her name and hometown. Some of these sites are free, and some will make you pay.There are also many sites that will allow you to download Santa stationary to write your own letter on, so the letter is more believable to the child., Many museums, for-profit companies and non-profit organizations allow a child to receive a letter from Santa if the child writes one first. These letters can seem believable to a child because they are designed to respond to specifics in a letter the child wrote.
The letters often arrive in the regular mail, making the child convinced you didn’t send it (especially if it has a stamp or postmark from the North Pole).
 The letter will look fake if you just print it off the computer. So, you should use stationary instead of plain white paper, and let it look a little rumpled.


Handwritten letters are more convincing as long as they don’t match your own! Have a co-worker or neighbor pen the letter.
Don’t forget a North Pole return address. Make sure you sign the letter from Santa Claus.

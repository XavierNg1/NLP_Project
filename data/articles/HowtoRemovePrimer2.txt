 Any drips, lines, or globes of primer should be removed with the use of a single-sided razor blade.


Hold the blade at an angle, positioning it so that the sharp edge is nearly parallel and just slightly tilted toward the surface.
Scrape down the drip, working from top to bottom, until most of the primer has been lifted away.
Adjust the angle of the blade as needed to get at the primer. An angle that is too shallow won't scrap anything away, but an angle that is too severe can damage the surface you're working with.
 For spills or smears, you will need to use sandpaper or a sanding sponge to sand away the excess primer.If you use a sanding sponge, make sure that the sponge is labeled for use with the type of surface you're working on (wood, plastic, or metal).
Before sanding the primer away, you should also put on a safety mask to avoid breathing in the primer dust.
Start with a medium-grit and sand in one direction. Don't be discouraged if you don't see much initial progress; you'll need to sand for about five minutes, applying firm pressure the entire time, before any notable improvements show.
 Use a clean, damp rag to wipe away any dust and debris from the working surface when you finish scraping and sanding.


Dry the area with a second rag immediately after wiping it down with the damp rag.
 Check the surface in bright light and look for any traces of primer. If some still remains, repeat the process until the stain disappears.


Experiment with different sanding grits. Be careful, though, since some surfaces might become damaged if you sand them with a heavy-grit or sand them down too much.
You should be able to use this method with most hard surfaces, including walls, wood furniture, and hard floors.

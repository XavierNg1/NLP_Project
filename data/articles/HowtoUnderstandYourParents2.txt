 Living in the same house as your parents is very different from spending quality time with them. Instead of watching TV together or just hanging out in the living room, ask your parents to do an activity with you.Here are some suggestions that might help you find something fun to do:


Go out to eat.
Go bowling.
Play mini golf.
Play a board game.
Do an arts and crafts project, like painting pottery.
 Your parents probably have things that they love to do, whether it’s playing the guitar, taking spin classes, or gardening in your backyard. Spend some time doing what your parents love with them. Taking an interest in their passions will help you get to know them on another level. Here are a few examples of things you might like to do with your parents:


Cooking or baking
Hiking
Biking
Listening to a book on tape
Playing musical instruments with them
Traveling

, Sometimes the smaller moments, like going to the grocery store with your dad or helping your mom water the plants, will help you understand more about what your parents’ day-to-day lives are like (especially if you don’t live with them). Here are some examples of little things you can do with your parents:


Give your dog a bath
Cook dinner
Water the plants
Garden

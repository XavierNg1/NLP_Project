 Marijuana plants, male and female, will be identical in the first 6 weeks of life. It is only after they've begun developing their sex organs later on that you'll be able to differentiate them.


You can purchase "feminized" seeds as well, which usually create close to 100% female plants. However, there are occasional errors, and you should still keep a close eye on your plants to make sure there are no rogue males., If you're trying to sex mature plants, one of the easiest indicators is how bushy they get. Male plants have thicker, sturdier stalks and very few leaves. A female of the same strain will be shorter and bushier, with more leaves, especially near the top.
 Once the plant has matured enough, a female will begin flowering. At the joints where the branches meet the main stalk, you'll see small, translucent hairs, known as pistols, coming out of a small, tear-shaped bud tucked in the joint. Frequently, there will also be "growth tips," which are new branches and groups of leaves, growing as well.


Male plants will have the small buds (pollen sacs) but will not have the associated hair growing out of it.Plants can grow both pollen sacs and pistols. If it does, it is hermaphroditic and should be treated like a male.
 Only female plants will produce enough THC to be used as medicine, but they won't create much if they become fertilized. The pistol is meant to attract pollen. If it gets it, it will create a seed, and all the plants energy and nutrients will be spent making seeds, not making big, THC-full buds. Your female plants are the only ones that will produce a crop, but only if they stay away from the males.

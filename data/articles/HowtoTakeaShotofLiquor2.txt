 You have many different options for taking a shot. Most shots are taken with an 80 proof (40% alcohol content) liquor such as rum, whiskey, tequila, vodka, or gin.If you are trying to avoid having a hangover the next day, choose a clear liquor like vodka, gin, or some tequilas.Dark liquors (e.g. rum, whiskey, bourbon) contain larger amounts of congeners. The increased amount of these congeners can make you have a more severe hangover.Dark liquors tend to have a stronger flavor compared to light liquors. If you do not have a preference, you may want to take a shot of a clear liquor.
 A typical shot in the United States is 1.5 ounces, but shot glasses come in various sizes. If you are ordering your drink at a bar, ask for a single shot. A double shot at a bar is typically 2 ounces. If you are preparing the shot yourself, use measuring spoons. Three tablespoons or nine teaspoons is equivalent to a 1.5 ounce shot.If you do not have measuring spoons, you can use a Solo brand cup. The bottom line of the Solo cup is 1 ounce.
A small medicine cup that comes with a bottle of cough syrup can also be used. These cups are usually 1 or 2 ounces and have measurement lines on them.
 Taking a shot is more enjoyable when you do it with other people. If you are taking a shot with your friends, order all of the shots at once and wait until everyone has their shot before you take it. If you are at a bar alone, ask if anyone wants to take a shot with you. The bartender may even take a shot with you.


Make a toast and have everyone raise their glasses.
If you are drinking with other people, do not feel pressure to drink as much as they do or pressure others to drink more.

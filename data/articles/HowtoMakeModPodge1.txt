 You will need a clean jar with a tight-fitting lid that can hold 12 ounces (355 milliliters). The jar can be made out of glass or plastic.


If you plan on making glossy or glittery Mod Podge, you will need a slightly-larger jar.;
, You will need about 8 ounces (225 milliliters) of white, liquid glue—the sort kids use in school. If your bottle already contains 8 ounces/225 milliliters (or close to it) then you will not need to measure it out. If your bottle contains more glue, however, then you will need to pour the glue into a measuring cup to make sure that you have the right amount.


Consider using an acid-free scrapbooking glue. It is more durable and less-likely to yellow than regular glue., You can simply rest the glue bottle over the rim of the jar and let the glue drain on its own, or you can squeeze it out. If the glue is thick and will not come out easily, you can pour a little bit of hot, boiling water into the glue bottle, close the cap tightly, and shake. The hot water will help loosen the glue. Open the glue bottle again and pour it into the jar—it should come out easier now.


Consider warming the glue in a microwave for about 30 seconds (or fewer, depending on the strength of your microwave). This will help the glue bottle empty easier and faster.
 Once the glue has completely drained, pour 4 ounces (112.50 milliliters) of water into the jar and stir to combine it.
 Your Mod Podge will be matte by default, but you can make it shiny by adding 2 tablespoons of a water-based gloss or varnish. Simply add the gloss or varnish after you have added the water., If you wish to make glittery Mod Podge, add 2 tablespoons of glitter into the mixture. This is most effective when combined with the water-based varnish or gloss., Once You have added everything into the jar, close the lid tightly and shake it to mix everything together. If any of the Mod Podge seeps out from under the lid, simply clean it off with a damp cloth.

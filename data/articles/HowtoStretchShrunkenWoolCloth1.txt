 Find a clean basin or bucket and fill it with enough lukewarm water to fully submerge your shrunken wool garment or cloth. You can also use a clean sink if you don’t have a container large enough to hold your wool item., Mix in about ¼ to ⅓ cup (59.14 to 78.85 ml) of hair conditioner or baby shampoo to the water bath. Use your hands to stir the water so that the conditioner or shampoo is mixed in.Both regular conditioner and baby shampoo work to relax and loosen the fibers of the wool so that the wool can be stretched out.
 Place the shrunken wool inside the bath of baby shampoo or conditioner that you prepared and let it soak for 10-30 minutes. Make sure that the wool is fully submerged in the water., Take the wool cloth or garment out of the basin and gently squeeze it to remove excess water. Then pour the contents of the basin down the drain.]


Do not rinse the wool with water, as retaining the baby shampoo or conditioner in the fibers will help it to stretch out.
 Lay out a clean towel on a table or counter and place the wet wool on top of it. Roll the towel beginning from one end and rolling toward the other end with the wool inside of it. Then unroll the towel and take out the wool item.Rolling the wool in the towel will absorb more of the excess water.
 Spread out another clean, dry towel and place the shrunken wool on top of it. Use your hands to gently stretch the wool section by section. You should see that the wool is more elastic than usual., After stretching small sections of the wool, take the wool by the bottom and top and pull. Repeat this process, this time pulling from the sides. Continue until the wool article looks like it is back to its original size.
 Once the wool item is stretched to its original size, leave it to dry on a dry towel. Don’t worry that you have not washed out the shampoo or conditioner, as this will not harm the wool or affect its texture.

 The main characteristic that distinguishes a hero from a villain is his moral compass, his compassion, and the fact that he cares deeply about something (such as saving his beloved, rescuing his city, or winning a war.) Determine what your hero will care about, what his ethical code will allow him to do, and what his moral compass might prevent him from doing. , A very important characteristic of an epic hero is a “tragic flaw.” Most often, this is a personality trait, such as pride, impatience, or ingratitude. However, you may choose to interpret this as a physical weakness or shortcoming. The most dynamic heroes will have one of each. This tragic flaw will be something your hero learns about himself through his journey., Above all, an epic hero must be courageous. Even if you position your hero as an underdog character, at his center must be unparalleled bravery. After all, regardless of upbringing or looks, courage is what ultimately makes a hero a hero. Your hero may not begin with epic bravery, but this will be revealed to him, unlocked, and developed in time., Archetypes, sometimes called “universal symbols,” have long been used in both storytelling and psychology to help define the characteristics of a person. The “hero” is already itself a kind of archetype, but perhaps your hero is also a prince, a mystic, an innocent youth, or a scapegoat. Chances are, you can think of examples of each of these throughout literature. You can use these instances to help flesh out details about your epic hero., A true epic hero is one that is willing to sacrifice in order to save someone else. Create a situation for your hero in which your hero must make a choice between something he needs for himself (perhaps his own life) and the safety or protection of his beloved, family, or country. This will display his true heroic nature.

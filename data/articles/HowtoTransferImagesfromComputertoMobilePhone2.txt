 In order to connect your Android device, you will need to have Windows Media Player version 10 or higher installed on your computer. This will install the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) that will allow you to transfer files to and from your device.


Launch Windows Media Player while connected to the internet, and it will prompt you if it needs to be updated. This step is most relevant for Windows XP users.
 All Android devices connect via USB cable. If you are using a PC, you may see an installation bubble appear on the screen. Allow the PC to complete the installation.
 Android 4.0 and later will default to an MTP connection when it connected to the computer. This will open the phone in Windows Explorer.


Your screen cannot be locked, or your device’s contents will not show up. If nothing appears in Windows Explorer, unlock your screen.
 This is where you will be copying your images to. Leave this window open for now.
 Open the folders containing the pictures you want to transfer to your device. Copy and paste, or drag the pictures to the phone’s Pictures folder. You can copy over folders and they will appear as albums in your Gallery app.
 This may take a few minutes depending on how many pictures you are copying. Once the process has finished, you can safely disconnect your device.
 Your new photos should load into the gallery for you to view. If you copied a lot of pictures, they may take a moment to appear.

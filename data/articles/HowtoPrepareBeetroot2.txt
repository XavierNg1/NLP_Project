 Use a vegetable peeler to peel the skin off the beetroot. Stand over the sink as you work to allow the peeled pieces to fall into an easy-to-clean spot. Be careful where you lay your beetroot as raw beetroot can stain virtually any surface.If you donâ€™t want the roots to stain your hands, wear gloves while you handle them.
 First, thinly slice the beetroot, discarding the top section attached to the stem and the pointy tip. Next, toss the beetroot slices with the juice of one lemon and a teaspoon of Chile powder. Arrange the beetroot on a plate and garnish with extra Chile powder.Experiment with different spice blends to find one you love. For example, consider substituting cayenne pepper for Chile powder.
 For example, shredded beetroots can be added to any coleslaw recipe to improve the nutrition and flavor. After peeling the skin, use a cheese grater or vegetable shredder to grate the root into a plastic bowl. Prepare your favorite coleslaw recipe, either adding shredded beetroot or replacing the cabbage completely.


If the recipe you prefer uses a lot of sugar, wait to add the sugar until the beetroots are fully incorporated. Then, add sugar to taste.
Shredded beetroot can also be added on top of any salad or into a dip.

Line up the glass (This is especially important with bay window-style windshields, because the curved glass has to fit the frame just right.), then have the person outside the vehicle press the glass firmly into place. Set the bottom part of the seal in the frame first as it is the hardest part to get right.
The second person on the inside needs to grasp the rope and begin pulling inward. That should pull the inner lip of the rubber seal over the edge of the window frame and begin seating the window to the vehicle. As you pull the rope towards you inside the van, the window should suck into place. Use a silicone spray lube to soften and slip the seal into position
Make sure the person outside continues to apply firm pressure and keep everything lined up as the person on the inside pulls the rope towards them. Again, there are special tools that do the same thing, but rope works well and is just about free.
Have a thin putty knife without sharp edges on hand to help with any trouble spots or snags the rope may hit.
 Once the last of the rope is out and the window is in, make sure the seal is in place all the way around. Fix any areas that might have folded under with the putty knife by running it between the frame and the rubber.


Press the window firmly from the inside to make sure it is well seated, but make sure your helper is ready to catch it on the outside in the event you pop it all the way out.
 Maybe even treat it with rubber preservative so you won't have to do this again too soon.
 They earned it, and saved you a bunch of cash. A lot of glass places will charge upwards of $100 just for the labor (that's with you supplying the glass and seal).

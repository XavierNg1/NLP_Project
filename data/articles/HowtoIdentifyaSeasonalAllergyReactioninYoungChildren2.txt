 The biggest difference between allergies and a cold is itchiness – colds generally do not cause itching. Red, itchy eyes are usually symptoms of allergies, not colds. Runny noses will happen in both cases, but drainage from allergies is usually watery and clear, while drainage from a cold can be thicker and colored yellow (or sometimes even green).Children get colds all the time, but if the sneezing and other symptoms last for over 10 days or worsen after being outside, it’s more likely to be allergies., Try to notice when your child experiences their symptoms. Is it worse in the spring and summer? Do they have worse symptoms after being outside? Try to get specific, and narrow down the possible cause of the allergy. The most common causes of seasonal allergies are pollen, dust, and fungus or mold.Dust might accumulate in your house more in the winter when windows are closed and the air is still.
Pollen is present in most seasons from different trees and bushes, but the child will have worse symptoms after running through grasses or weeds, or spending time in a garden.
Mold and fungi grow best in the spring and late summer, but kids with allergies might have reactions from jumping in piles of dead leaves in the fall.
 If a child has seasonal allergies, it’s likely that one or both of their parents has seasonal allergies. Allergies are often inherited, so that can be a clue to recognizing allergies in young children. However, children and parents aren’t always allergic to the same thing – parents pass down the “I’m allergic” trait, but not the “to what” trait.

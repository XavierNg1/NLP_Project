 The nutrients in the food you eat can help strengthen the hair follicle and promote growth. Eat foods rich in protein, vitamins B, C, D, and E, and zinc. In general, try to include more fresh fruits and vegetables, seeds, nuts, and whole grains to thicken your hair naturally.


Examples of hair-fortifying foods include: walnuts, spinach, flax seeds, lentils, and blueberries.
 It’s not just an idiom when we blame thinning hair to high stress levels. Whether you’re ‘pulling your hair out’ or it’s simply falling out, your stress levels are likely to blame. Take steps to reduce your stress and you should notice a significant change in the health of your hair.
 One of the best ways to naturally relieve stress? Exercise. Keep your follicles healthy and stress-hormone levels down by getting your heart rate up at for at least 30 minutes daily. You’ll experience a great number of subsequent health benefits in addition to thicker hair.
 It’s not always easy to get all the nutrients that your hair needs to grow thickly, so help your body out by taking supplements. Several have strong ties to growing hair faster, thicker, and longer. Try taking biotin, Viviscal, or fish oil daily for better hair over several months.
 Although not always the cause, some medications that create hormonal imbalances can cause hair loss. The most likely culprit for thinning hair is the birth control pill, but any prescription medication that changes your hormone levels could be to blame. Talk to your doctor and see if there is a substitute to your hair-damaging meds.

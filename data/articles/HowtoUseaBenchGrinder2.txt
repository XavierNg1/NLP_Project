 Move the metal back and forth across the grinder until the chunk of metal is gone. Holding the metal against the grinder in one place for too long will warm it up, and could damage the piece.



Hold the metal on the tool rest and turn it gently until the grinder comes in contact with the spot you want the cut.
Keep turning the piece until it breaks in half. Make sure you hold each end. Dip both hot ends in water when you are done.



Touch a piece of metal to the grinder at the spot where you want it to bend. Use a back and forth motion, as you would to grind a part off.
When you see the metal turning orange, it is warm enough to be pulled away from the grinder. Use both hands to bend the metal to the shape you want. Dip it in water once it is the right shape.



Rest the piece on the tool rest and hold it securely with both hands.
Slowly push the blade into the grinder, angling it slightly up or down so the grinder cuts metal away to create a pointed, sharp edge. Use the same forward-and-back motion, rubbing the blade across the bench grinder to prevent cutting into the blade or warming it up too much.

 Finding commonalities is an important part of clicking with others. Begin connecting with new people by talking about something others can relate to.Ask your co-worker about a common aspect of your work. You could say, “Ann, I really enjoyed reading your last report. Do you have any tips on the final editing process?”
If you find yourself with new friends at a football game, try saying, “Our team is really talented this year. Do you think we’ll make it to the championship?”
Connect with your new classmates by talking about the coursework or readings. For example, you can ask, “What did you think about the book we read this week?”

, Sometimes people are hesitant to open up, and asking questions opens up the door for connecting. Ask open questions that will help you learn about the other person, rather than closed questions that can be answered with a yes, no, or short response.Try asking, “Why did you choose to become a teacher?” instead of “Do you like being a teacher?”
You could ask, “Why do you want to study abroad in Spain” instead of “Are you excited about studying in another country?”

, Listening to others helps us obtain information, understand, and learn.Pay careful attention to what the other person is saying without becoming distracted by what’s going on around you.
Don’t think about what you will say next while the other person is speaking.
Show that you’re listening with a nod.
Provide feedback by asking questions to clarify specific points the other person brought up.
 Be authentic and take a genuine interest the people you are trying to connect with. People will sense if you are not authentic in your interactions. If you’re not genuinely interested in who a person is or the type of work they do, don’t pursue the connection.

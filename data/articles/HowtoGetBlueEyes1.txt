 Just like your hair and skin color, the color of your iris’ is genetic. That means that unless you break down your genetic code or cell structure, your eye color cannot be changed permanently. The color of your eyes is determined by the amount of melanin that your iris’ contain: very little melanin gives blue eyes, while lots of melanin gives brown eyes.


All babies have blue eyes when they’re born, because their body hasn’t created very much melanin yet.
There are genetic mutations which cause some people to have two different colored eyes or both eyes with multiple colors.;
, If you notice that your eyes are changing color on their own - especially from brown to blue - you should seek medical attention immediately. Changing eye color is a symptom of many illnesses, some of which may cause damage to your eyes leading to blindness. Although it may be exciting to have a new eye color, you should always contact an eye doctor if the change happens naturally., Although there are few surgeries available in some parts of the world that claim to change eye color, there is no strictly permanent way to change it. As a result of being genetic, you can only truly change your eye color by using superficial means. Surgery may alter it, but studies haven’t shown how long it actually lasts, and what the long-term health effects are.


Before taking any ‘permanent’ measures, you should always take some time to seriously consider the pros/cons.
Test out non-permanent blue eye options before doing something drastic, such as surgery.

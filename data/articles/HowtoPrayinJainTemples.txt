 Along with the darshana, chant the most fundamental prayer, the Namokara Mantra nine times. The Namokara Mantra is dedicated to Pañca-Parameṣṭhi (Sanskrit for "five supreme beings"), a fivefold hierarchy of religious authorities worthy of veneration. The Namokara Mantra:Ṇamō Arihantāṇaṁ- I bow to the Arihantas (Omniscient beings)

Ṇamō Siddhāṇaṁ- I bow to the Siddhas (Liberated souls)

Ṇamō Ayariyāṇaṁ- I bow to the Acharya S ("Preceptors")

Ṇamō Uvajjhāyāṇaṁ- I bow to the Upadhyay (Preceptors of less advanced ascetics)

Ṇamō Lōē Savva Sāhūṇaṁ- I bow to all the monks;
, The eight qualities of Siddhas are:infinite faith or belief in the tattvas or essential principles of reality.
infinite knowledge
infinite perception
infinite power
fineness
inter-penetrability-It means that the liberated soul does not hinder the existence of other such souls in the same space.

agurulaghutva – literally, neither heavy nor light. Due to this quality of agurulaghutva, the jīva (soul) continues to manifest through its form, complete and perfect.
infinite bliss

"I bow to the Lord, the promulgator of the path to liberation, the destroyer of mountains (large heaps) of karmas and the knower of the whole of reality, so that I may realise these qualities."


You can also say special prayers. For this, see the symbol below the image to identify the Tirthankara to whom the image is dedicated. For example, if the image is dedicated to Tirthankara Mahāvīra (symbol-lion), you may say the following verse:


Namāh śri Vardhamāna-e nirdhutakalilātmane
Sālokānāma trilokānāma yadā-vidyā darpanāyate!
Tr.- I bow to Śri Vardhamāna Mahāvīra who has washed off the impurities of karmic filth from His Soul, In Whose Perception scintillate the three Worlds and the infinity of Space, as in a mirror.
 After darshana, you can sit and do meditation. You can also use a rosary (present in all Jain temples) to chant the sacred mantra, the Namokara Mantra.

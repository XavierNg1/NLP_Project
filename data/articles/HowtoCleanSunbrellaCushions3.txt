 Outdoor cushions are going to get dirty – there’s no way around that. However, you can limit how dirty they get by brushing loose dirt from the surface whenever you notice it. This will prevent the dirt from becoming deeply ingrained in the fabric., To limit staining, try to wipe the spilled substance from the cushions right after it happens. If that’s not possible, get rid of the spilled substance as soon as you notice it. The longer it sits on the fabric, the more ingrained the stain will become., When a liquid spill occurs, use a clean cloth to blot the substance up. Never rub the spilled liquid, since this will force it deeper into the fabric fibers. After you’ve soaked up as much as possible, proceed with the spot cleaning technique.Don’t forget to sprinkle the corn starch on oil-based stains first.

 Scrap canvas is a clever way of working on uneven fabric using a "temporary grid" formed by the scrap canvas. This can be a great way to add an embroidered design to something made of heavier fabric, such as a canvas backpack. This is done by selecting single weave canvas and basting it onto the uneven weave fabric.


Work the design following your pattern over both the scrap canvas and the uneven fabric. When you have finished embroidering the pattern onto the fabric, remove the basting from the scrap canvas.
Carefully trim the scrap canvas away. Do not cut any cross stitches.
Move from one corner first and carefully draw out the strands of scrap canvas in a single direction. Once all of these strands have been removed, move to the opposite corner and pull out all of the strands that run in the other direction.
This requires delicate finger movements and small scissors, so if you don't feel as if you can do it without cutting the thread, either ask someone else more nimble to finish it off for you, or use a different method outlined here.;
, You can purchase even-weave fabric from spools at craft stores and these can be purchased in any lengths desired. While still even-weave, these provide a different creative approach to your embroidery project by offering a very limited canvas space that can be applied to a very wide array of existing items, such as pillow cases, sheets, hairbands, towel edges, face washers, bibs, clothing, curtains, aprons, etc.
 This might include shirts or jackets with an Evenweave pocket or sleeve edges already sewn in place but awaiting embroidering. Bibs are often done in this style when sold in craft stores.
 Gingham is great for adding cross-stitch designs because it has squares in place as the natural formation of the fabric. Work the stitches using a chart, following the squares of the gingham as guidance. Naturally, smaller gingham squares are far easier as the size of the stitches will be determined by the size of the checks.

 Navigate to the folder where the file you want to edit is in. Tap on it to open its respective Google app (that is, if it’s a document, Google Docs will open; if it’s a spreadsheet, Google Sheets will open; and if it’s a slide, Google Slides will open).


If it is a file format other than Google’s, you will be prompted to choose an installed application that is compatible with the format. For example, Microsoft Word documents can be opened by an app like OfficeSuite.
 Changes made in files made with the Google applications (Docs, Sheets, and Slides) are automatically save as you go.
 If your file is made by other applications (like OfficeSuite), you will have to save your changes manually. Tap on the “Save” icon (diskette), normally located at the top of the page, and a toast notification at the bottom of the screen will say “Changes Saved”, or something similar, saving the changes permanently.

 Before you begin swinging your toddler, make sure the area is clear of other children. Additionally, make sure older children know not to start swinging until the front and back area of the swing set is clear of children.While your toddler is young, help them become aware of moving swings and the dangers of standing too close. Let them know that if they stand too close to a moving swing they may get hurt.
 When you place your child in the swing, also place their hands around the swing's straps. Tell them to hold onto the straps tightly at all times.If you see your toddler let go of the straps while you are swinging them, then stop the swing immediately and place their hands around the straps again. Let them know that you cannot resume swinging until they are holding onto the straps.
 While your child is a toddler, you should always be nearby when they are swinging or playing on the swing set. This way you can prevent accidents from happening, as well as socialize them on the appropriate swing set behavior.

Try to place the swing set in an area that it is visible from your living room or kitchen window. This way, you can supervise your children from afar once they are old enough to play on the swing set by themselves.

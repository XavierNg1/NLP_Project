 Anatomy and physiology classes cover a large volume of information in a short time. Lectures may go by quickly, and if you arenâ€™t prepared, you can easily fall behind. Set aside time to read the upcoming chapters or sections before each class. Take notes on relevant information, and bring them to class with you., Many of the structures in the body have names that are difficult to associate with the functions they serve. One way to help you keep track of different structures and systems is to create diagrams, or sketches, of each structure you study. These diagrams do not have to be drawn perfectly, but you should label all parts and make notes about the content of the picture.
 Some people can listen to an instructor give a lecture and retain nearly all of the information presented. Most people, however, struggle with this. Aside from taking class notes, you should join into any class discussions. The interaction will help solidify the information in your brain. Some ways you can contribute to a class discussion are:Ask questions if you do not understand something.
Answer sample questions given by your instructor.
Provide an argument to support your answer when appropriate.
 Anatomy and physiology labs will help you to relate the information you learn in class to real organisms. Choose a lab partner that is serious about doing well instead of picking a friend that you can goof off with. Split the work evenly, and make sure that each of you understand the lab in its entirety.

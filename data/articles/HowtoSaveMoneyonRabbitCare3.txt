 While it may seem counter intuitive, spending money on preventative veterinary care can save you a lot of money in the long run. Get your rabbit regular checkups so that any medical issues can be caught before they become serious issues. This will hopefully save you the cost of expensive surgery or veterinary care in the future.For example, having your rabbit's teeth checked regularly will reduce the risk of overgrown teeth, which is a serious health problem for rabbits as it impacts their ability to eat properly.
 If your town or city has a veterinary school, they may give treatment at a reduced rate at a low-cost clinic. Call the school in your area to see if they do low-cost appointments or search online to see if one is nearby.Be sure to take your rabbit to an accredited school that gives students proper training and supervision when treating patients., If you are in a financial situation in which you cannot afford to get your rabbit veterinary care, there are some organizations that may help you by offsetting the cost. Search online for these organizations, either through the website of a local or national organization that works to help animals.

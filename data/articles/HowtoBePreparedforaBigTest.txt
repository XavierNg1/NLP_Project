 Use around half an hour every or every other day to study, especially if you are going to take multiple tests.;
, Who asked your best friend out won't help you on your test, so spend your time studying, not texting.
 Studying is so boring, drop the books and find a fun website for studying. If you can't at least crank up some tunes, don't make this music distracting though! Try listening to French or instrumental music to help you focus and have fun. Another great thing to listen to while studying is rain storm and thunder sounds. It is actually really very calming and helps you think.
 You have the rest of your life, so two hours aren't anything compared to that. Find a quiet place to study. Don't study in front of the TV or near where your sibling is practicing her flute etc.
 Write down some things that seem important but DON'T use these during the test: it's cheating. Only write the important information, like dates, names, formulae, or things you might easily forget. Extra details distract your brain.
 Try not to watch TV or check your e-mail because it will distract your brain and get you sidetracked.
,, Eat a protein filled breakfast, like eggs, especially if you have ADHD or ADD.

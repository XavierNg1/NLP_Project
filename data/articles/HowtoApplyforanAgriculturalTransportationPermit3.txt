 Some states have reciprocity agreements with other, neighboring states, that waive registration requirements so long as certain criteria are met. If you are traveling in a small number of states, check with those states to get an idea of what agreements are in place. For example, Oregon has an agreement with Washington and Idaho agreeing to waive registration fees so long as the Oregon vehicle is operating within 50 miles of the Oregon border., If you do not travel to other states states often, you may not have an IFTA license. If you do not have an IFTA license but you need to travel to other states, you might be able to get a temporary fuel tax trip permits. These temporary permits can be obtained at various on-site locations. For example, in California, you can obtain temporary permits at specific truck stops. In Nevada, you have to call the Nevada Motor Carrier Division in order to obtain the correct permits. In Idaho, you can get a permit at various truck stops and ports of entry., If your state does not have reciprocity with the state you are traveling to, you will need to comply with that state's requirements. Call the motor carrier division of every state you are traveling to to get more information. If you are going to travel to these states often, you may have to comply with federal interstate permitting and licensing requirements.

 A good time to sow is early autumn, to catch the warm soil. Sow to a depth of about two to three times the seed's width (or follow the packet instructions).Legume seeds are the best choice - look for alfalfa, clover or lupins.


Generally good seeds for green manure crops: Alfalfa, cereal rye, agricultural mustard and Banner fava beans.Specialized seeds: Alsike clover (for very deficient soils); fodder radish (for deep nutrient retrieval and a huge amount of green manure); wooly pod vetch (hardy, good in dry and drought or for poor soils); foul maddummas beans (good with heat).Food producing seeds that double as green manure: Barley, oats, hard red spring wheat, etc.Seeds suitable for cool season sowing: Fenugreek, fava bean, oats, lupin, woolly pod vetch and subclover.Seeds suitable for warm season sowing: Millet (French white or Japanese), mung bean, buckwheat, cowpea, lablab and soybean., This may depend on the seed or your preference for working through the area when ploughing (plowing) it back into the soil. If broadcasting, don't toss all the seeds at once; toss with care, then keep some seed back to infill gaps.
 Firm down the soil. (If wished, tamp down with a flat board, to remove air spaces in the soil).Then water thoroughly.

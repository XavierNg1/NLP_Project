 Shuffle the pack, then let a spectator pick a random card. Le's say it's the ace of spades. Tell the spectator to return the card to the top of the pack.;
, It wasn't. This is a false overhand shuffle that brings the top card (their card) to the bottom of the deck. Hold the deck like you would for an overhand shuffle. Quickly peel off the top card and shuffle the rest the the pack on top of it. Their card should now be at the bottom.
 We'll use five again. When you ask the spectator that question, execute the glide (tutorials will be posted).
 Start dealing out cards above the glided card. When you get to their number, ask what their card was. As you ask this, use your little finger to push back that glided card. When they say "ace of spades," or whatever their card was, dramatically deal out their card and show it to the audience. Take a bow.

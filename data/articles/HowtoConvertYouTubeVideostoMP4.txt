 Find the movie that you want to download and convert, then copy and past the URL, which will be be Youtube.com/watch followed by a string of random numbers and letters. You'll need this string to get the video.If you're on a mobile device, open the clip in your web browser, not the YouTube App.;
, Search for "convert YouTube to MP4" and you'll find a lot of free sites willing to help out. Some of the most reputable options include OnlineVideoConverter, ClipConverter, YouTubeInMP4, and YtdDownloader. You can use whatever site you want, but stay away from sites that have the following hallmarks of scams:


Demanding personal information. Most sites will require nothing but the YouTube URL.
Numerous pop-ups.
Payment requests. The sites should be free.
Forced download of programs or converters. While there are programs you can download to get YouTube videos, sites without downloads are much safer.Note: Mobile users can do this too, using apps like YouTube Downloader, TubeMate, or Titan Downloader.
 Usually this is brought to you by a drop down menu or a bubble you can click under the link.
 Most sites let you input the artists, the name of the video, and any other information you might want to help sort the file when you download it. Change it to your liking, then edit the video quality to fit your desire.


The higher the video quality, the bigger the resulting MP4 file.
 Make sure the button you are pressing is part of the site and not a pop up. To be sure of this, make sure it looks exactly like the other buttons on the site, and hover over it with your mouse: you should see the website you're using appear as a URL in the bottom of your screen.Some sites require you to click another link after start labeled "Download File." Again, make sure you're downloading from the site, not a pop-up.
 Now that you have the video, it can be viewed whether you are online or not. You can also use iTunes or another media library program to put the MP4 on your phone or mobile device.

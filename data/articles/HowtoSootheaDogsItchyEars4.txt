 One common problem is a foreign body such as a grass awn or foxtail getting into the ear canal. You may notice the sudden onset itchiness after your dog went for a walk. Or, he might have been fine, gone for a walk and come back tilting his head to one side, frantically scratching his ear.


A foreign body, like a grass awn can migrate down your dog's ear canal, causing intense irritation. Your dog will tip his head to the side which has the foreign body.
 You probably won't be able to see deep enough into your dog's ear to find the foreign body. This is because the ear canal is "L" shaped and foreign bodies worm their way deep down. The vet will need to look deep into the ear using an otoscope (which is an instrument that is part magnifier and part light). The vet will remove the irritating object using special long graspers called alligator forceps.Removing the foreign objects shouldn't take long or cause your dog any pain.

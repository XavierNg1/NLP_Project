 Store red wine at room temperature, then place in the fridge 15 minutes before serving. White wine, which is generally served a bit cooler, can be stored in the fridge, then removed 15 minutes before serving and placed at room temperature. This method isn't perfect, but will achieve temperatures that most wine drinkers will enjoy.;
, If you have extra time, you can chill wine to a more desirable temperature. From room temperature, full-bodied red wines require about 40 minutes of chilling in the refrigerator. Light-bodied white wines will need a full 2Â½ hours to reach serving temperature.
 From room temperature, white wines will need about 15 minutes of chilling, or 20 if they are light-bodied with low alcohol content. Medium-bodied reds will be ready after 10 minutes, and full-bodied reds can take as little as 5. Set an alarm if you are likely to forget about the wine, as it could freeze if left in too long.


The ice bucket method described below is even faster.
 If you want to maximize your control over the wine's temperature, use an infrared thermometer or contact thermometer from a kitchen supply store. Wine aficionados determine the optimal temperature to serve wine at based on its body, or the feel and apparent alcohol level in the mouth:Light-bodied white wines should be chilled to around 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius). This includes Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, and all sparkling wines.
Medium- to full-bodied white wines, such as Chardonnay and Sauternes, should be chilled to between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 13 degrees Celsius).
Light-bodied red wines like Pinot Noir and Merlot should be chilled down to between 55 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 15 degrees Celsius).
Full-bodied red wines like Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, and Shiraz should be served at about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).

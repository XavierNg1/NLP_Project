 Remove the cookie dough from the package and roll it out until it's flattened.;
, Use a tablespoon and heap it with the cookie dough. Drop it onto the cookie sheet, leaving lots of space on top for Mickey's ears.
 Fill a teaspoon with the cookie dough and put one on the top left of Mickey's face. Fill up another teaspoon with cookie dough and drop it on the top right of Mickey's face.
 Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the cookie sheet is full. Keep in mind that cookies expand in the oven, so they will come out bigger than they seem.
 Place the cookie sheet in the oven. Set the timer for the number of minutes that the recipe calls for.
 Take out the cookies from the oven. Leave them to cool for about 10 minutes, until they're fully cool, to avoid the 'ear's breaking off the 'face'.
 Spread the bottom of the cookie red, only covering half of the cookies, to make the 'pants'. Frost the ears and head black. Using a frosting pipe, pipe two small white circles to resemble 'buttons'.
 Place the cookies on a serving plate and serve with a glass of milk if desired. Enjoy!

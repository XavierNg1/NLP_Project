 The colors and patterns can be random and eclectic, or you can be very careful and match colors according to a pattern or theme, such as varying shades of purple or green, or rainbow hues, or ribbons with spots, etc. You'll need quite a few ribbons, but the exact amount will depend on how bulky you'd like the final necklace to appear.


The ribbons can be in all sorts of lengths, as you'll be knotting them together to create the desired lengths. One thing that is important is that you must be prepared to cut the ribbons used, in order to ensure a nice mix of different ribbon lengths.
 This will determine how long each knotted ribbon length will need to be.


To work out the length, get a piece of string and hold it around your neck. Stand in front of the mirror and keep moving the string length until it is of the length you desire, then this string forms your length template.
Just be sure to add a small amount extra for making the end loop when the lengths are joined together.
 Choose differing lengths and colors or patterns of ribbon and begin knotting them together to make the length that you've chosen for the necklace.
 It's recommended that you make at least five lengths, so that there are enough lengths for the necklace to look interesting. You can have many more lengths, as wished.
 At one end, tie in a neat loop and knot, joining the ends together permanently. On the other end, stitch a large button to the other end, layered one on top of the other. The stitches will keep this end intact.


The button must be large enough to not fall back through the loop but not so large that it doesn't fit through the loop with a bit of a push.
 To wear, bring the necklace together around your neck and put the button through the loop to hold it in place.

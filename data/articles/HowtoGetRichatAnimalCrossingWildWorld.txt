 This is the any of the fruits that were not in your town when you originally started your town. There are four ways to get fruit that doesn't come from your town:


First you can wait for your mom to mail you-this rarely happens, so don't expect this to work. Sometimes she might send you a fruit that doesn't come from your town.
Another way is to go to a friend's town and take some of their fruit if it is different than your native fruit.
The third and easiest way is to mail a couple of people in your town. Attach your native fruit, and most likely they will send you a reply with a non-native fruit attached.
And the fourth is to wait for one to wash up on the beach, this is usually a coconut, and they are hard to grow. (Non-native fruit sells for 500 bells. Native fruit sells for 100.);
, If you play the game on December 31, Mom will mail you 10,000 bells. Many people set the time to 23:59 for this to work.
 Some of these bugs and fish are worth lots of money when you sell them to Tom Nook.
 If you bought something and changed your mind about it, sell it. You might not get much, but everything helps.


Find as many fossils as you can then sell them: Golden Shovel (rare); axe (available at Nook's store).
 Every month, you will get interest.
 A good money cheat is to put all your money in your savings account, turn it up 100 years and you will get to keep tons of interest.

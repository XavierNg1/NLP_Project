 Since you're adding this bow to a wreath, pick out ribbon that will contrast with the deep evergreen color of the foliage. Red, silver, and gold ribbon all work well for this purpose. Cut a length at least 12 inches (30.5Â cm) long.
 Hold the tail end of the ribbon against your palm, using your thumb to keep it in place. Wrap the ribbon around the back of your hand and bring it up over your palm. Keep doing this until the entire ribbon has been looped around your hand.
 Be careful to keep the loops in place, stacked on top of one another, when you slip them off of your hand.
 Hold the folded stack of loops in one hand so that the center fold is facing up. Use scissors to cut the the two corners off of the center fold. You've now created the place where the bow will be cinched.









Be careful to cut through all of the ribbon layers using a good sharp pair of scissors.
Don't cut the corners too close to the middle of the ribbon, or you'll cut it all apart.
 Use a second ribbon or piece of string to tie the cinch between the notches you made. Use a pretty piece of twine or florist wire for a decorative touch.
 One by one, fan out the loops from the center and twist them toward you. Arrange them so that they create a circular pattern reminiscent of petals.
 Use a little more florist twine to attach the bow to the bottom of your wreath.

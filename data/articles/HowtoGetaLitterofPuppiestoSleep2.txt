 Puppies need sleep for healthy development. If the puppies are sleeping, you should let them sleep. If you need to clean the box, you can wake them temporarily, but try not to disturb them too often. Also, if you disturb the puppies too much the mother can get touchy and may move her pups., This will help ensure that the puppies are getting the quiet they need. It will also help the mother feel safer about her pups. A kitchen is not an ideal place, but an out-of-the way pantry or laundry room may be better., If you have children, this might mean reminding them that there are sleeping puppies in the house. You’ll want to avoid having large social gatherings or lots of guests during the first few weeks of the puppies’ lives. This will help them sleep soundly and stay healthy.

 Look at a few cats rather than just one, and get a feel of which cat you're leaning to.;
, After you have looked at 3 or more cats, decide which cat to get.
 Before getting your cat, check for any sickness. Check the eyes, to be sure that their eyes are healthy, they should be nice and bright, and the ears the should not smell or have a black substance inside of them. Check the nose for any signs of wheezing, and then check the cat's fur for fleas or ticks. Any harmful bug should not be in their fur.
 You will need to fill out paperwork and may need to provide information about your living situation. You will have to pay a small fee (usually under 50 dollars) and take your cat home.
 For about a week, keep your cat in a room that's safe for him or her. A shelter cat can be harder to take care of; since it may have been abused in its old home. Make sure to be kind to your new friend. Take your cat to the vet the first week to make sure he or she is healthy and does not have any disease from the shelter.
 If you have other pets like a dog, get him or her in a cage, and also get your cat in a cage and shut the doors. Put your cat and your other pet facing each other in their cages for a little while so they can get used to one another. Do one pet at a time if you have multiple pets.
 When you adopt a new pet, they should be your friend for life!

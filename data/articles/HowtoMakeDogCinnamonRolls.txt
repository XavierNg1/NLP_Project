 Have 2 bowls, one for liquid ingredients and one for non-liquid ingredients for best results.
 In a separate bowl, pour 1/2 of water into the separate bowl, then add egg and canola oil and stir. Slowly pour non-liquids into liquids. If properly mixed, it should become a dough ball that is not very sticky., Roll out the dough and try to shape it into a rectangle. It should be the size of a normal piece of paper, but the long sides are longer. After rolling, pour the cinnamon into different spots of the dough then rub it gently so it will not tear. If you'd like, pour the 2 tbsp of honey on it. Then roll the long side of the dough like rolls of toilet paper so it looks like a real cinnamon bun. Cut out the circles to about 1/2 inch., Put the rolls on the pan. Then carefully put in oven and they should be done in 15-20 min. If you want them crunchy, 25-30 min. Allow to cool completely before storing or feeding. They should be stored in a fridge or airtight container.

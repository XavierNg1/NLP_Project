 When you start becoming a tennis coach, there is a possibility that a lot of people will ask you to play with them for fun. You don't have to be rude about it but be sure to let them know that your time on the court is valuable and it's how you make your living. You can always offer them a discount on the first lesson or something of the like to keep that person as a client.
 Saying no to lessons is the fastest way to lose clients. Even if the client seems unsure about whether or not it's something he or she wants to do, offering a discounted first lesson might be enough to sway the client in your favor.


Be prepared to teach both children and adults. This will open up as many opportunities as possible for you. Children tend to be fast learners but can be less motivated, especially if their parents "made" them do it, so you'll need some good motivational strategies, as well as making sure you pace the lesson to the child's attention span.

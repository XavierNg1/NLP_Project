 GSPs do best when they are around people, so housing your GSP indoors is ideal. Make sure that your GSP has a soft bed and that his sleeping area is free from drafts. Due to the short coat of these dogs, they can become cold in the winter., GSPs are athletic tracking dogs, so there is always the chance that your GSP will run off if he catches an interesting scent. To ensure that your GSP is returned safely to you, make sure that your GSP is always wearing a collar with tags that provide your address and phone number.


You may also want to consider having your GSP implanted with a tracking chip so that he will be identifiable even if he loses his collar., As with all dogs, it is important to take your GSP to see a veterinarian at least once per year for a check-up and to get vaccinations and tests as needed. If you do not already have a veterinarian for your GSP, then find one as soon as possible and take your dog for an initial check-up. Your GSP will need to get vaccines and medicine for:


Lyme disease
Rabies
Heartworm
Fleas and ticks

, If you don’t plan to breed your GSP, then you should have your dog spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering help to control the pet population and it can also prevent your dog from developing some negative behavioral issues. Spaying and neutering may even protect your dog from certain types of cancer and some other health problems.Spayed female dogs are less likely to get certain types of cancer and infections.
Male and female dogs that are not fixed are more likely to roam, be aggressive, or engage in other territorial behaviors., GSPs are healthy dogs, but they are susceptible to a few diseases. These include hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, von Willebrand’s disease, entropion, and gastric torsion. To keep your GSP healthy, your veterinarian may perform regular tests on your GSP, but you can also request them. These tests include:thyroid test
hip exam
heart exam
eye exam

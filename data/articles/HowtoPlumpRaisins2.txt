 Place the raisins in a microwave-safe plate or bowl, spreading them out so that they lie flat in a single layer.


The raisins need to be in a single layer instead of being stacked on top of each other. Keeping the raisins in a single layer will ensure that they absorb the water more evenly during the heating process.
 For every 1 cup (250 ml) of raisins used, pour 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water over the dried fruit.Spread the water out as evenly as possible.
 Cover the dish and microwave the raisins on high until the raisins appear to absorb the water.


If the container has its own lid, verify that it is also microwave-safe before using it. For any dish that does not have its own microwave-safe lid, consider covering the container loosely with plastic wrap or a paper towel.
Keep the dish slightly vented on one side to prevent pressure from building up inside.
Note that the liquid will not be completely absorbed when you pull the dish out of the microwave. The raisins should begin to look plump, but the rest of the absorption will occur upon standing.
 Stir the heated raisins and replace the cover. Let them stand out at room temperature for 2 to 3 minutes after that.


If you would prefer the raisins to be somewhat dry, pat them gently with paper towels after they have had a chance to absorb the liquid and cool down.
 By the time you reach this step, the raisins should be somewhat plumper and ready to enjoy on their own or use in other recipes.

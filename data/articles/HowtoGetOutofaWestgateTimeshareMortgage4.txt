 Most timeshares sell for a pitiful fraction of their original cost on the resale market. And that is if they sell at all. There are hundreds of listings for timeshares onÂ marketplace websites such as eBay, some going for as low as one penny.
 If you do want to resell your timeshare, be very wary of timeshare resale companies. They are notorious for scamming unwitting timeshare owners by charging upfront fees, then disappearing.

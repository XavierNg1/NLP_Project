 This step is obvious, but it's necessary.;
, 'The Basics' include what a Pokémon Center/Poke Mart is, what they look like, choosing a starter, Berries, held items, and battling. You only need to tell them this much so far. Stuff like catching more Pokémon will come later.
 Watch as they name their character and rival and such, and tell them if they have any questions, ask you. Be there for them and answer any questions they have.
 They are only playing the game and asking questions about it because they are interested in it, so don't treat them like they are stupid and yell at them if they make a mistake. You were new to Pokémon once, too, and you also made mistakes.
 It is okay to demonstrate things to them, but if they want to do it themselves, let them. They may even learn faster by doing the task themselves and not being shown.

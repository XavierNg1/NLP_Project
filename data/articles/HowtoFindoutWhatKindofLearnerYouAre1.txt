 When spelling, do you try to see the word, sound it out, or write it down to find out if it feels right? When you are at school or work, do you like descriptive scenes, do you prefer verbal instructions, or do you prefer to jump right in and try?Try to take note of these things. When you can, write down the most comfortable way you understood a concept or idea; write down exactly what made that concept click. Was it a graph, a word, or a sound? This will help you determine what kind of learner you are.;
, As you apply learning strategies to tasks, you should continuously check the the effectiveness of the process by evaluating your progress in a given task. Evaluate your progress by asking yourself, "Can I put this information into my own words or explain it to someone else?" or "How am I doing in this task?" By asking yourself these questions, you can determine if the way you are learning something is the most effective way.If you are unable to answer these questions, then ask yourself what other strategies might work more effectively to help you answer these questions.
 Oftentimes, talking out loud with someone will help you figure out a solution. Talk with a friend or teacher about their learning styles. Ask them how they learn best. This will help you think about and explore your own learning style.


Ask your friend or teacher what helps them retain information. Ask them if they are more likely to remember images, what someone said, or how they felt when presented with new information.

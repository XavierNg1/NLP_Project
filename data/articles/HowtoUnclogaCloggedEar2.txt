 A blocked Eustachian tube (also called ear barotrauma) can be the painful consequence of a difference in pressure between your middle and outer ear. Most people experience it at some point. Here's what you can do to stave it off:








Fly smart. Don't sleep while the plane is descending. Instead, chew gum and try to yawn frequently. Allow small children to nurse or sip on a drink during the descent.
Dive slowly. If you're going scuba diving, descend and ascend at a slow rate. Give yourself plenty of time to readjust to the new pressure. Avoid diving if you have a cold or respiratory infection.
 Popping, or equalizing the pressure between your middle and outer ears, can relieve the pain. Try these remedies:









Chewing gum.
Yawning.
Sucking on candy.
Inhaling deeply, pursing your lips, holding your nose shut, then exhaling suddenly.
 The membranes in your Eustachian tubes, which connect your ear to the back of your throat, are the same as the membranes in your nose. As such, they can swell quickly and severely when you have a cold or seasonal allergies.








Take a decongestant or antihistamine. It should ease up the inflammation of the membranes. You can take it orally or in a nasal spray.
Rest up and recover. Doing everything you can to combat the cold will help your Eustachian tubes open up more quickly.
 Lie on your side, and put a washcloth soaked in hot water or a heating pad over your ear. It should help ease the pain.








Put a towel between the heating pad and your ear to avoid burning your face.
Don't sleep with an electric heating pad over your ear — it can be a fire hazard.
 Barotrauma can lead to long-term complications if it's severe and left untreated. If you're experiencing the following symptoms, seek medical help immediately:









Severe pain that lasts more than 3 hours.
Discharge or bleeding from the ear.
Fever.

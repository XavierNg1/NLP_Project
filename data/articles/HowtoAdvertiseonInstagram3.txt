 Instagram does not allow you to post clickable links in actual ads. Therefore, make sure you include a link to your website in your company's bio. In the text of your ads, tell users to click on the link in your bio for more information.Update your links regularly as your website changes.
 Make you use language in posts that will entice users to stop and read your ads. Clearly and concisely describe what your product is and use words that draw attention. For example, something like, "Incredibly savings - up to 50% off!" can grab a users attention., If you're trying to get users to take a specific action, download a Call To Action button. This takes them to a website after it's clicked, where they can do things like purchase your products or download your apps. This can be a great way to make your ads effectively translate to sales.Use the right language in your button. For example, if you're advertising a hotel, have a Call to Action button that reads "Book Now."
Find the Call to Action button through your Instagram business account settings.

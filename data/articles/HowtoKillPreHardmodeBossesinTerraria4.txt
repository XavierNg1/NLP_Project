The King Slime is essentially a house sized Slime, and it's an easy fight. The only setback is how high the Slime can jumpâ€”seventeen blocks.
Build an twenty by twenty room, with platforms spanning across the entire thing.
 Either:

Wait for the Slime Rain event (Desktop only), and defeat one hundred and fifty Slimes. After this, the King Slime spawns.
Make a Slime Crown with twenty Gel and a Platinum or Gold Crown.


The King Slime is one of the easiest bosses in the game. You probably don't even need any armor. Just hack away, making sure to avoid any sudden jumps he makes.


Once he's dead, collect his dropped Gel, as this will be useful later in the game.

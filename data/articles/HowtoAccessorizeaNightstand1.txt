 Strike a balance between geometric and organic shapes. If you plan on stacking a few rectangular books on a square nightstand, try offsetting them with a circular alarm clock and curvy lamp base. You could place the books at either end of the surface and put the lamp and clock in the center as the focal points., Keep most of the colors on your nightstand within the same family as the bedding. Vary the color tones to keep the arrangement interesting. For example, if the dominant color in your quilt is red, you could choose a maroon lamp or bouquet of pink roses for your nightstand accessories.

Color coordination includes contrasting hues, too! If you have a variety of reds on your bed and nightstand, try adding a green alarm clock or picture frame., Think of space as a complementary element to the objects on your nightstand. This will allow you to keep the number of objects to a minimum. Place two or three objects in the center, leaving the surrounding space open. Alternatively, you could put some space in between the objects.

Don't limit your notion of space to horizontality. If you don't have much space by your bedside, try going vertical by using a bookshelf as a nightstand. You could place your alarm clock and reading material on the shelf closest to the bed. Lesser used accessories can go on higher or lower shelves., Include the wall space above your nightstand in your accessorizing. Hang a painting or print at a point that's neither too high nor too low. If you have a small bedroom, install a mirror to create the illusion of added space. If you use your phone as an alarm clock, hang an analogue or digital wall clock in this space.

 Use a broom with straw bristles or a carpet sweeper to do the initial cleaning of your rug.Sweep in one direction from end to end. Don't rub your broom back and forth because you could end up damaging it. Once you're done sweeping the entirety of the rug, repeat the cycle and go over it a second time.


Electric carpet sweepers use static electricity to pick up dirt and are the safest method for quickly cleaning an antique oriental rug.
 Lay out your rug in an empty area and vacuum over the rug slowly to remove excess abrasives, hair, and dirt that can damage your rug over time.Repeat this process three or more times to get all the dirt and debris from the rug.Avoid the rug's fringes because they can become stuck in the vacuum's sweeper.Once you're done vacuuming, flip the rug over and repeat the process on the other side.


When cleaning an expensive or antique rugs, make sure to use the carpet tool because a revolving brush can damage your rug and hurt its value., If you can pick your rug up, you can take it outside and shake it to remove embedded dirt and other particles. If your rug is too big to shake, hang it on a clothesline and beat it with your hands. You should see the dust and dirt come off of the rug as you do this., It's best to tend to spills as soon as they occur because if they dry it will be much harder for you to get the stain or smell out of your rug. As soon as the spill occurs blot up as much of the liquid as you can, with a paper towel or clean rag.Once you've soaked up the spill, dampen a rag and use cold water to blot the stain again.


Do not rub back and forth on the spill because you could end up rubbing the stain deeper into the carpet.

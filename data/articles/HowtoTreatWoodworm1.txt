 Woodworm refers to the damage caused by wood-destroying insects that start out as eggs on the surface of the wood, and spend most of their lives as larvae under the surface.Identify woodworm by scanning the surface of the wood for a series of tiny holes on the surface, resembling pinpricks; these occur when the insect matures and exits the wood. Small heaps of powdery sawdust are also a sign;make sure to inspect the entire surface since the condition may only affect one small section of the wood.


Look up pictures of woodworm to be sure that you are diagnosing the problem correctly.;
, In many cases, woodworm damage is found along the upper layer of the wood, while the heart and surrounding layers remain untouched. When this is the case, the wood item will still be strong and salvageable. If the wood crumbles or breaks off with ease when handled, this is a sign that there is not much hope of saving the item, even after a treatment.
 Before attempting any other treatments, try to dry out the affected wood; moisture is required to sustain the life of woodworm larvae, so drying the wood may solve the problem on its own.Place small pieces of furniture on a radiator or in the oven, and place larger items in a closet or small room with a space heater. Aim to heat to 140 degrees F and keep at this temperature for 24 hours to kill eggs, larvae and fully grown insects.Monitor items carefully while heating to avoid overheating wood or upholstery.

 When you start out the game, the first thing you need is Healing Salve then 2 Bracers. They are very cheap and strong and are located at Recipe Shop 1.;
, If you have money after that, buy a Mask of Death for 900.
 The first Skill you should get is Empowering Haste. It will give you about 14+ damage already if you are level 1.
 If you are in a lane with an enemy Ranged hero, do not try to fight him or the creeps. If you gain a level, get the Greater Bash ability. If you are level 3, get Charge of Darkness. Level 4, Greater Bash. If you see a pattern in the abilities you should get, follow it.
 If you have enough money, upgrade your Mask of Death into a Mask of Madness. This item is very good with your Greater Bash ability. To activate the Mask of Madness, just click on it.
 If you upgraded your Bash ability, your Nether Strike should do about 175 damage. If you want to kill your enemy heroes, first use Charge of Darkness. Then activate your Mask. If he has low HP, use your Nether Strike and he should be dead.
,, If your enemies kill you quickly, go ahead and upgrade the Hyperstone into the great Assault Cuirass at the Recipe Shop 5. You should notice this hero is mainly used for his Stun/Bash.

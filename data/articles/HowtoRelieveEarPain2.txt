 In some cases, serious symptoms may indicate that you need to seek immediate medical attention for ear pain. Some situations where immediate medical attention may be required include:hearing loss
severe pain
dizziness
stiff neck with a fever
redness, swelling, and/or pain around the ear
not being able to move the facial muscles around the ear

, Ear tubes are often advised when ear infections continue to come back. For example, if someone has more than three ear infections in six months or more than four ear infections in a year, then ear tubes may be necessary. Ear tubes are implanted during an outpatient surgical procedure and some will come out on their own after six months to a year. Some kinds of tubes require surgical removal., For a severe ear infection, antibiotics may be necessary. Doctors are often cautious about prescribing antibiotics for simple, first time ear infections, because they will often resolve on their own and/or are caused by viruses, and therefore the increased risk of antibiotic resistance is not warranted.Ask your doctor if you think antibiotics may help you, but try not to pressure your doctor to prescribe them if he or she thinks they are unnecessary.

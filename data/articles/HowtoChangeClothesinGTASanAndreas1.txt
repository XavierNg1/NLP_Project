 Press the Pause button on your controller and select “Map” from the list of menu options you see on the main menu screen.;
, There are several shops placed all over San Andreas. Clothing shops are marked with a T-Shirt icon on the map, so it’s very easy to find.
 Once you do find a clothing shop near your area, ride a car (or walk) to the place marked with a T-shirt icon.
 Once you get to the clothing shop, enter through the front door and walk towards the dressing room you’ll see inside the store. Dressing rooms look just like they do in the real world.


You’ll see a red circle floating in front of the dressing room, notifying you that you can use it to change clothes.
 Once you enter the dressing room, a pop-up menu will appear on the game screen. Select the outfit type you want to change from the pop-up menu. You can choose from hats, shades, shirts, jackets, pants, shorts, and shoes.


Once you’ve selected the outfit type you want to change, a list of available apparel to wear will be shown on the pop up menu. Choose from the list of items and press the “Try On” button to see how it would look like on your character before buying it.
If you want to pick other clothes to wear, simply press the “Back” button to go back to the list of clothing choices.
 If you like how the clothes look on your character, press the “Buy” button to purchase it. Your character will change its clothes to the one you bought, and the item will also now be permanently available from your safe house’s wardrobe.

 Although you'll want to look your best on your holiday, making the most of your space can make your travel smoother and prevent an overfilled bag.


Make versatile choices. Choose clothing items that are multi-purpose and can be plugged into a number of outfits. This helps keep your bag light and also helps simplify the packing process. Shoes can fill up a bag quickly. Rather than lugging five pairs of shoes, choose a couple comfortable ones that match all of your clothes.
 You'll want to have everything you might need during a flight close by.


Keep your medicine handy. This is especially true if you have prescriptions that you might need. Also, plan ahead for any stomach or pain medication you may need while flying and have these handy.
If you have a laptop, tablet computer or any other valuable electronic, keep these near for personal use and protection.
 If you are going to be somewhere for more than a few days, you'll need enough clothes and essentials to last. By checking your bag you'll still be able to travel light and make sure what you packed will be at your holiday destination when you arrive.
 Besides packing light, how you pack can make sure you get the most out of your space.


Roll your clothes instead of folding. This not only helps reduce wrinkles but you'll be able to fit more. Put things in your shoes. Since shoes already take up a lot of room, by putting socks, underwear, or jewelry inside your shoe, you make the most of your space.
Utilize unexpected spaces in your bag. Luggage often has pockets or zippers where you can stow away small items without taking up space from the main compartment. , If you have a particular pair of shoes or jacket you really want to take with you, wear them onto the plane and save space in your bag.

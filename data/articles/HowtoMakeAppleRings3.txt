 You can dry your apple rings in either a dehydrator or in the oven. For the dehydrator, arrange the apples on the dehydrator trays. For the oven, arrange the apples on metal cooling racks and place these onto baking sheets. This will allow air to circulate under the apples so they’ll dry more evenly.


Lay the apple rings side by side, but make sure they don’t touch or overlap, otherwise they won’t dry consistently.
If you're drying your apples in the oven, preheat the oven to 150 F (66 C). Set your dehydrator to between 110 and 135 F (43 and 57 C).With a lower temperature, the rings dry more consistently and thoroughly, but will need longer to dry.
Use metal cooling racks because other types, such as non-stick or coated ones, may not be oven-safe.
 Turn the dehydrator on or put the apple rings in the oven. Prop the oven door open slightly so that air can circulate.Let the apples dry for 10 to 14 hours in the dehydrator, checking them every hour after the 10-hour mark.In the oven, dry them for five to eight hours, or longer if necessary, until they reach your desired level of dryness.You can stop drying the apples at any time, depending on your personal preference. For juicier apples, dry for a shorter time. For crispier apples, dry for longer; and for leathery apples, dry them for somewhere in the middle.
 When the apples are done to your liking, remove them from the dehydrator or oven and allow them to cool to room temperature.


Whatever you don’t eat or use immediately can be stored in an air-tight container for up to a year.

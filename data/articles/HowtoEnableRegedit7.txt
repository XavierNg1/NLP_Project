 In Windows XP, you cannot open the registry editor unless you have the file ACLUI.dll. If you get an error message about a missing folder, a virus may have deleted it to prevent you using regedit. Confirm you do not have the file Windows/System32/ACLUI.dll., Look in the folderWindows/ServicePackCache. If you see the file ACLUI.dll, right-click and copy it, then paste it into the Windows/System32 folder. This should allow you to open regedit., If you do not have the ACLUI.dll file in either location, search for that file online. Download it from a reliable website and save it to the Windows/System32 folder.

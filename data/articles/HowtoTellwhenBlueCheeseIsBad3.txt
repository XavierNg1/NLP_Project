 If you want to store your blue cheese in the freezer, you must cut it into pieces that are no larger than a ½ pound each. For crumbled blue cheese, divide it into portions that are a similar weight. Use a food scale to weight each slice or portion before you prepare it for storage.You can freeze blue cheese that you've already opened or served. Just make sure to cut the remaining cheese wedge or divide crumbles into the ½ pound portions as directed.
 Whether you plan to store blue cheese in the refrigerator or freezer, it needs to be wrapped properly to ensure that it will stay fresh as long as possible. First, wrap the cheese in wax or parchment paper. Next, place plastic wrap or foil over the paper to ensure that it won’t dry out.If you are freezing the cheese, place the double wrapped piece into a plastic freezer bag to protect it from freezer burn.
If you’re concerned about the cheese picking up the scent or flavors of other items inside your refrigerator, you may want to place it in an airtight container after it’s been wrapped for additional protection.
 The colder that blue cheese, the longer it will stay fresh. Because the lower section of the fridge is usually the coldest, you want to make sure to keep it in on the bottom shelf to preserve for as long as possible. If your refrigerator has drawers at the bottom, that's an ideal place to store blue cheese because they likely won’t be opened every time you look in the fridge, so the temperature will remain stable.

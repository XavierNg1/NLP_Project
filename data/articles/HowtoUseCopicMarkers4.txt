 Each marker comes with a letter that tells you which color family it belongs to and a number code that represents the color saturation.


An example of the color family codes is the letter “B” - any codes that begin with a "B" belong to the blue family.
The number code representing saturation is a 2-digit number code. The first digit represents the vibrancy, and the second digit represents lightness. A marker with a "05" code would be a vibrant mid-tone, while a marker with a "99" code would be very dull and dark.
 Luckily, these markers are simple to store and are not easily ruined. Keep the caps on them when they are not in use, store them either vertically or horizontally, and try to keep them in a cool, dry place.


If you accidentally leave your markers on a really hot window ledge or in a cold car, it is okay. The caps on each marker are airtight, so they are not easily destroyed by extreme temperatures., Both ends of the marker get ink from the same reservoir, so it is only necessary to add the ink to one end.The broad end is a larger surface for the ink to seep into, and this angle will help the ink drip down into the marker more efficiently.
Be sure to refill your markers over a protected area. Cover the surface with paper towels, newspaper, or any other thick, disposable paper.
 Allow each ink drop to absorb into the marker before adding the next drop. The ink will run down the tip and into the marker.


Be sure to add the correct color of ink to your marker.
If you accidentally overfill the marker and the ink begins to run over, absorb the excess with a tissue or paper towel.

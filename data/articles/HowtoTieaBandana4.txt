 Fold the bandana into a triangle. From there, start folding the bandana in increments of the same width you'd like your bracelet to be. Make sure that the folds are crisp and even.








To ensure clean lines, iron the lines in as you fold the bandana.
 When you're done folding and you're left with a long strip of material, wrap it around your wrist. Leave about a finger's worth of space between your wrist and the bracelet to ensure that it isn't too tight. Continue wrapping it around until there is approximately one inch of material hanging from each side of the bracelet.
 Tie the bracelet in a square knot. To ensure that it stays put, double the knot or add a safety pin to secure it. Tuck in the loose ends of the bandana on the underside of your wrist.

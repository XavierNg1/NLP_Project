 Do the mirror test. Looking in the mirror sideways, see if you can draw a straight line from your earlobe through your shoulder, hip, knee, to the middle of your ankle. If you can draw this line, your posture will make your breasts look bigger and perkier, as well as making you look slimmer and taller.;
, This is by far the least expensive and fastest way to make your breasts look bigger. Do the mirror exercise several times a day to correct your posture. It is more important to build "muscle memory" so that you unconsciously and naturally maintain correct posture without fatigue.
 Increasing the bulk of the muscles beneath your breasts will make them appear firmer and more rounded. Regular push-ups are one way to achieve this; build up slowly until you can manage to drop and do 15 push-ups all at once. There are also many weight training exercises you can do to build chest muscles.
 Slimming and shaping your core (the muscles around your waist and ribs) will make your breasts appear larger by comparison, without actually adding any breast tissue. Try yoga and pilates exercises that can help you burn calories while simultaneously strengthening your core muscles.


Note that losing weight cannot make your breasts smaller. So, don't worry about it.

 Mackenzie would make a big deal if she broke a nail. However, if you're too dramatic, people will begin to think you're a loon. You can be dramatic, but if you're too dramatic, who knows what might happen?


In Dork Diaries Book One, Mackenzie made a big fuss when she got a bruise on her leg.
 But if you overdo it, it gets very annoying. This should happen only on rare occasions.
 Talk about yourself a lot, but not too much unless you want to be very bratty. However, people might think you're too self-centered, so don't talk about yourself all the time, or else people won't like you as much. Avoid being selfish.
 You can copy this if you want to, but some people may find it annoying. Mackenzie is known for giving ruthless insults to people. It is not recommended that you do this, but if you choose to, be very careful.

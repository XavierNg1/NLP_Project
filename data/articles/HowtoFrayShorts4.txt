 Use a fabric pencil or piece of chalk to outline the desired shape of your patch into your shorts.


This method works well if you plan on fraying a patch into your shorts in a particular shape. If you do not want to create a specific shape, you do not need to draw an outline or use fray glue around the edges. Simply cut horizontal slits into the material using a utility knife.
Possible shapes to consider include hearts, stars, or initials.
Consider placing the outline over a pocket. If you place it over the fabric next to your skin, you risk making a cut that will cause your underwear to peak through once you slip the shorts on.
 Apply a light but consistent line of fray glue on the outline you just drew.


Fray glue prevents raw edges from fraying beyond a certain point. If you do not use fray glue along the outline of your shape, the shape will become distorted after you wash and wear it.
 Use a stitch ripper or utility knife to cut away the individual threads around your shape.


Only cut away the vertical threads. Do not cut the horizontal threads.
If cutting blue jean shorts, the horizontal threads will be white while the vertical threads should be blue.
Use your seam ripper or fingers to slowly pull the fibers out from the inside to the outside, revealing the white strands and creating a "frayed" look.
Note that this can take considerable time to do, but when done right, it can be well worth the effort.
You may want to apply a bit more fray glue around the edges before washing them to ensure that the shape you cut into the material does not become distorted in the washing machine.
 Wash and dry the shorts as you usually would.


You do not need to rely on the washing machine to fray your shorts further. As a result, you can just use a standard washing and drying cycle with your standard detergent.

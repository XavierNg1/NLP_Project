 You are basing this trick in the probability of your volunteerâ€™s answers. There is no manipulation. Be prepared because it does not work all the time but does work the majority of the time you attempt these tricks., Statistics gives you the most probable answer your volunteer may give; however, there is also the less likely probability that your volunteer may give another answer. In this case, do not get flustered. Play it off as part of the trick.


For example, when your volunteer does not give you the answer you are looking for, say something similar to, "Of course that's not the number you're thinking about because it's the number that she's thinking about," and point to another person in the crowd.
Alternately, you can also joke and say that your volunteer mind may be blank and say you'll try to help with another suggestion. Then, move on to another magic trick that you're confident will work 100%.

 If you place big rocks on top of the soil all around the plant, then the cat can't get to the soil. You can still water around the rocks. Plus, you can just pick up rocks from outside if you have some in your backyard., An easy way to keep a cat away from plants is to build a tower of plastic cups in front of it. When your cat tries to reach the plant, the tower will topple, giving the cat a fright. Once the cat's been startled a couple of times, it will likely leave the plants alone., Hanging plants are much more difficult for your cat to get to, particularly if they're not near a tall structure (such as a bookcase). If your cat can't get to the plant, it can't dig in it., If you don't leave a space on the flat surface for the cat to jump on to, it may not climb into the plants. Try crowding several plants together on a windowsill, for instance., Start by making sure the plant is in a pot that's not too big for it, as that leaves space for a cat to dig. If the pot is too big, you can use the rock trick or you can even place other plants with their small pots on the soil of the big plant, leaving little room for your cat to get in., A plastic scat mat is a mat with spikes that stick up. You place it on the soil to keep the cats out. However, don't worry; the spikes are flexible, and they won't actually hurt your cat. They're just annoying enough to keep your cat out of the soil.You may need to cut mats to fit your plants.
 This trick only works if you have open space around the base of the pot. You add fly paper or two-sided tape to the surface, and the cat won't want to walk on the area (since cats don't like the feeling of it on their paws).

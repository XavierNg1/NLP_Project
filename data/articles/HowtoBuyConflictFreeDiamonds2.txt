 If you're still unsure or uncomfortable about buying a diamond, you might want to buy a lab-grown diamond or lab-grown gemstone like moissanite that looks just like a diamond. Choosing a lab-grown stone will guarantee that your jewelry came from a conflict-free source.Moissanite is almost as hard as a diamond so you can wear it without fear of scratching or tarnishing it.
Synthetic stones are usually less expensive than diamonds.
 You may decide that you don't want a diamond or synthetic diamond. Instead, you choose a colorful or clear gemstone or precious stone. You might want to buy an emerald, ruby, turquoise, or lapis lazuli if you want a pop of color or a piece of jewelry that's as unique as you are.Be aware that softer stones like opals and pearls will tarnish and scratch easier than harder stones. If you buy a softer stone, you may want to wear it only occasionally.
 Remember that even though your stone isn't a diamond, it probably came from a mine. Ask your jeweler to give you details about where the stone was originally mined. The jeweler should be able to give you specifics about where the stone was mined and under what conditions.


Some companies advertise fairly traded gems so it's worth asking if the gems are certified.
 Don't forget to check the material that supports your diamond, especially if it's gold. Current gold mining practices can be environmentally destructive, leaching mercury and cyanide. Ensure the health of the workers and the environment by choosing recycled gold. You can also purchase fair trade gold.Again, you need to ask your jeweler where the gold is mined. Fortunately, several large companies have begun pushing for mining regulations and investment in mining communities.

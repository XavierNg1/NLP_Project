 Deep conditioner helps tame extra-curly or frizzy hair. It’s especially good for treating damaged hair! Make sure your deep conditioner is made for curly hair--the best deep conditioners for your hair will have ingredients like shea butter, avocado oil, keratin, argan oil, and coconut oil. You can also buy deep conditioners with proteins to treat badly damaged hair--look for ingredients like hydrolyzed collagen, Panthenol, soybean protein, or glycoprotein., Work from the ends to the roots just like you do with regular conditioner.
 This is an optional step, but heat will open up the cuticles of your hair, allowing the conditioner to penetrate more deeply. Using blow dryers on your curly hair can damage it, so instead wet three or four hand towels with cold water, wring them out, and microwave until hot, about 1–2 minutes. Wrap the towels around your head and leave on for 5–10 minutes.
 Rinse your hair thoroughly with cool water to remove the conditioner. You can detangle your hair with your fingers or with a wide-tooth comb., Wash your hair as usual, with shampoo made for curly hair. Be sure to wash your hair in a downward motion before rinsing--this prevents tangles! You can use a regular conditioner afterward to help lock in the deep conditioning, but it isn't required., If you have long hair, divide it into 6–8 sections for more convenient handling. Detangle your hair with your fingers or a wide-toothed comb if necessary, but be gentle since wet hair is more vulnerable to damage.
 If you plan to use rollers, hair styling products, or a leave-in hair mask, go head and put them in now before letting your hair air-dry.
 Deep conditioners aren't made for everyday use, but you should be using them regularly. If your hair is very damaged, deep condition every week. If it's not, once a month is fine!

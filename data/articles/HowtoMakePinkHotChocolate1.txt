 Once you have the hot chocolate warm on the stove, add the red food dye to the drink. Use natural food dye if you are worried about the artificial colorings in regular food dye. You can find natural food dye online or at health food stores. Start with one teaspoon of dye and add more until you get a pink color you like. Stir the food dye around with a spoon to ensure the color is mixed in well.


For a slightly vanilla flavor, you can also add in vanilla extract at this point, if you decide to use it.

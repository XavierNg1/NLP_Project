 To keep track of your child’s growth, his pediatrician will use a growth chart. Try to tell your child to stand up straight and not squirm around so that the doctor can take accurate measurements. There are four basic growth charts that your pediatrician uses depending on the sex and age of the child. These are:


Boys Growth Chart from Birth to 36 Months.
Girls Growth Chart from Birth to 36 Months.
Boys Growth Chart from 2 to 20 Years.
Girls Growth Chart from 2 to 20 Years.
 It should be remembered that growth charts are used to see a pattern of growth in your child and not as a tool to compare his results with other kids his age. If the pattern your child presents has always been more or less the same since he was born, then your child is growing normally. Growth charts help the doctor and yourself to recognize when something suddenly changes in your child’s growth pattern.If a change in growth does occur, the doctor will most likely order an x-ray to be taken to examine your child’s skeletal age. Skeletal age is the measure of your child’s bone development.
 While you may want to keep track of your child’s growth, try to let the doctor do this for you. Children between the ages of 6 and 18 months have a tendency to fluctuate in growth; this is absolutely normal. A parent keeping track of their child’s growth at this time might become needlessly worried.


Fluctuating growth patterns generally stop when the child reaches adolescence.

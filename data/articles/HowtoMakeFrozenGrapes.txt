 It's always a good idea to rinse any fruit before you eat it. Washing fruit helps to remove pesticides that are dangerous to your health. Place the grapes in a colander or bowl or on a plate and pat them dry with a paper towel. Give them at least 15 minutes to dry as much as they can.

, You can also use Tupperware or another resealable container. Spread out the grapes as much as you can so they don't touch each other. This is done so that the grapes don't stick together when they freeze. Even after draining and drying them, any excess moisture can turn the fruit into a giant fruit block.









If you want your grapes to be extra sweet, then you can sprinkle them with a bit of sugar, stevia or artificial sweetener before you put them in the freezer.
If you want to get creative, you can make "frozen grape skewers" by placing the grapes on a skewer or a few skewers before putting them in the fridge.
 The more grapes you have, the longer it will take to fully freeze them. You can freeze them overnight, too, but you don't want to freeze them for too long or they may lose some of their delicious flavor and texture.
 Take them out and place them in a bowl and get ready to snack away.
 If you want to be more inventive than simply eating the grapes as they are, there are a variety of ways to spruce up your ordinary frozen grapes:









Use them as ice cubes for a refreshing glass of water, or a mimosa or another alcoholic beverage.
Place them in yogurt and rice pudding to add an extra pop to your snack.
Sprinkle them with sugar for an extra-sweet treat.

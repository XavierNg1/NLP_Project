 Choose your prefered colour of ribbon from your arts and craft store or fabric store. You will also need a sewing machine, scissors, a wire and foil paper. Choose wire that is very flexible., Fold the foil paper horizontally several times over a piece of wire. Create a band about 1.5 - 2 cms thick. You need the band to be thick enough so that it holds it shape as you spiral out to create your flower., Wrap the band vertically by holding one end of the ribbon at one of the band with your thumb and pulling the length of the ribbon up and around the band. Repeat the process until the entire band is covered and the ribbon overlaps about â…“ of its width each time you loop it around the band. The band should now look like it is scaled by the ribbon.Keep the wrap as tight as you can.
 Gently slide the paper off the wire and the wrapping by pinching one end of the wrap and wire with one hand and pinching only the foil paper with the other hand. Sew the side you are pinching closed once you have removed the paper completely. Make sure that the ribbon is tight and none of the scales are loose making the wire visible., Keeping the ribbon tight, roll the ribbon as tightly as possible as you keep the open side at the center. Be sure to gently but firmly pull the length of the ribbon each time you create a new layer of the spiral. Pinch the center to keep the spiral tight with each new layer., Create a subtle stitch to secure the end of the ribbon onto the rest of the spiraled bloom. You may only stitch the bottom of the final scale or outer layer of the spiral to keep it inconspicuous. Once secure, you may also play with the petals to spread them out along the wire to create the appearance of a more open bloom.You may use a hot glue gun instead of stitching to keep the flower together.

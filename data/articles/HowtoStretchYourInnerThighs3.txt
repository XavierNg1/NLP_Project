 Be able to freely move your body, stretching is next to impossible if you’re wearing jeans or some other restrictive material. If you’re alone you can go ahead and do it in your underwear, just wear something that doesn’t restrict the mobility of your hips and legs.
 Being only in socks can make you slip and pull a muscle. Especially when you’re pressing both feet against each other or trying to hold a certain stance while standing up, it’s better to have sturdy footing. Lose the socks.
 Don’t expect to fix everything in two minutes. Commit at least 15-20 minutes to doing a variety of stretches, and try to keep that up every day.
 Especially if you have a lower back injury, this can exacerbate the problem if you don’t give your body time to warm up a little bit. Wait at least an hour after waking up before you start.

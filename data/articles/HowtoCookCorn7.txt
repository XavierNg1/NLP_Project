 Fill the lower part of a steamer with water and heat, on the stove, over medium heat until the water steams and starts to simmer.


Do not boil the water.
Do not fill the steamer high enough for water to slip up through the holes of the steamer basket.
If you do not have a steamer, you could use a stockpot and a metal colander with fine holes. Make sure that the colander fits over the lip of the stockpot without falling in.
 Spread the kernels out into a single layer.


Canned corn kernels can also be used, but they will finish cooking in a much shorter amount of time. They may also be soggier once finished.
You do not need to thaw frozen corn kernels before use.
 Allow the corn to steam for 9 to 10 minutes without covering it. Drain once finished.


Canned kernels will only need to steam for 3 or 4 minutes.
 Steamed corn can be served with butter and salt as well as other seasonings.

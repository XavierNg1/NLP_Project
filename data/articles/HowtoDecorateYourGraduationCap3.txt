 To make your own stencil, draw out your design or lettering on a simple piece of printer paper. After laying down a protective top to your table, such as cardboard, lay the printer paper right side up. Use an exacto knife to slowly and carefully cut out your design.Once satisfied with your cut job, voila! Your stencil is ready to go.


Many pre-made stencils are available at your local dollar store.This allows you to skip both the drawing and cutting of your stencil. Another option is to print your desired image directly onto your paper, so it only needs be cut.
Up your stencil game by laminating your paper before cutting. This allows your stencil to have a smoother edge and prevents bleeding into the rest of your cap after painting.
 Lie up where you want your stencil to be placed and play with different locations.Once you’ve decided on the spot, tape the stencil down taut against your cap. The tape will prevent the stencil from shifting while you paint.
 Using a smaller paintbrush for more control, gently paint within your stencil. For a precise edging, hold down the stencil firmly to the cap while painting the edges.Be careful to not overdo it, as any excess paint runs the risk of bleeding.


If you can, use fabric paint. Specifically formulated for fabric, fabric paint will age with grace.If you don’t have the option of this, stick with simple acrylic from the dollar store.
Add some school spirit to your hat by stenciling in your school’s logo or colors.This can be a simple but effective way to add excitement for your peers and teachers during your drawn out, boring grad ceremony.
 It is better to be cautious and wait overnight for your paint to dry. Waiting longer will mean your paint is solidified and the stencil will pull away cleanly. Once you are confident the paint is solid, you can lift the tape and gently pull the stencil away.Waiting will also ensure any wet paint on the stencil does not rub off onto your hands or the rest of your cap.

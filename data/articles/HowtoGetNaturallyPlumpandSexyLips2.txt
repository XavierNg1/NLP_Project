 There are tons of makeup tricks you can use to create the illusion of bigger lips, the most popular being lip liner. To create the illusion of fuller lips, start by applying a natural pink, rosy lipstick. Next, apply a lip liner that is slightly darker than the lipstick around the edges of your lips. Top it off with a shiny lip gloss to give your lips some extra plump., Dark colored lipsticks and glosses tend to make your lips look smaller â€“ especially when they are used without a lip liner. If your lips are naturally smaller, drawing attention to them with dark lipsticks isn't a good idea. To create the illusion of plumper lips, choose a lighter shade of lipstick with a shiny, glossy finish. This will cause light to bounce off of your lips and create the illusion of fullness., Changing the shape and size of your lips with makeup is a great way to create the illusion of plumper lips. Apply a highlighter or a nude/white eye pencil just above your top lip (the "M" shape right in the middle of your upper lip). After you've applied your highlighter, lightly blend it in. You can also use a slightly darker lip liner or eye pencil under your lower lip to create a shadow. These tricks will enhance the appearance of your lips.

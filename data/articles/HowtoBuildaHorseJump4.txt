 Horses look at jumps from the ground up, so a ground line helps the horse work out where the jump is.
 If necessary, you can bring the end of the pole forward. Proper wide wings help guide the horse into the jump and avoid running out (the horse going around the jump instead of over it.) False wings do the same.
 Colourful fillers also help desensitize the horse to the type of jumps he might see at competition. An old carpet over the jumps can make it look very solid too.

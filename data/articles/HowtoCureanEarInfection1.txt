 In general, children are more likely to get ear infections than adults. This is because the eustachian tubes (tubes running from the middle of each ear to the back of your throat) are smaller in children and more prone to fill with fluid. Children also have weaker immune systems than adults and are also more prone to viral infections such as colds.Anything that blocks the eustachian tube can cause an ear infection. There are other risk factors for an ear infection, including:Allergies
Respiratory infections such as colds and sinus infections
Infection or trouble with the adenoids (lymph tissue in your upper throat area)
Tobacco smoke
Excess mucus or saliva, such as that produced during teething
Living in a cold climate
Changes in altitude or climate
Not being breastfed as an infant
Recent illness
Attending daycare, especially a larger daycare with many children;
, A middle ear infection (acute otitis media) is the most common type of ear infection and is caused by a virus or bacteria.The middle ear is the space just behind the eardrum that contains the small bones that pass vibrations to the inner ear. When the area becomes filled with fluid, bacteria and viruses can get in and cause an infection.An ear infection often occurs after a respiratory infection such as a cold, although severe allergies may also bring one on.Symptoms of a middle ear infection include:Ear pain or an earache
Feeling of fullness in the ear
Feeling ill
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Hearing loss in the infected ear
Tinnitus
Dizziness
Ear drainage
Fever, especially in children

, Moisture is a common culprit for this type of infection (hence the name), but scratching or inserting things into the ear canal can also leave you prone to infection.Symptoms may begin as mild but often worsen, and include:Itching in your ear canal
Redness inside the ear
Discomfort that worsens if you pull or push on your outer ear
Ear drainage (begins clear and odorless, may progress to pus)
More severe symptoms include:

Feeling of fullness or blockage
Decreased hearing
Severe pain that radiates outward to your face or neck
Swelling of neck lymph nodes
Fever



, Young children may display different symptoms of ear infection than older children and adults. Because young children often cannot communicate how theyâ€™re feeling, look for the following symptoms:Tugging, pulling or scratching the ear
Banging the head around
Fussiness, irritability, or incessant crying
Difficulty sleeping
Fever (especially for infants and very young children)
Fluid drainage from the ear
Clumsiness or balance problems
Trouble hearing

, Most ear infections can be treated at home, and many go away on their own. However, if you or your child experience certain symptoms, you should contact your doctor immediately. These symptoms include:Blood or pus in ear drainage (may look white, yellow, green, or pinkish/red)
Continued high fever, especially if it is over 102F (39C)
Dizziness or vertigo
Stiff neck
Tinnitus
Pain or swelling behind or around the ear
Ear pain that lasts more than 48 hours

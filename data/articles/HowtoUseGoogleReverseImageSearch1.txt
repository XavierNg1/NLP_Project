 Open a new browser tab or window, and access the Google Images website. You can use any web browser to visit the website (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.).;
, On the Google Images website, you will be able to see the search box, the camera icon in the search box, and the search button. Click the camera icon found at the right corner of the search box. When you click the camera icon, Google will take you to the page for searching the web using an image instead of text. This page has two tabs: “Paste image URL” and “Upload an image.” The “Paste image URL” tab is selected by default.
 Select the “Upload an image” tab and click “Browse.” A file explorer will appear where you can browse your computer for the image you want to upload. Once you find it, select it and click “Open” for the image to be uploaded to the search engine.
 When you click “Open,” Google will do two things at once. It will upload your image and will automatically search the web for similar images. When done, Google will direct you to the Google Images page with the list of results. At the top of these results, the image you uploaded will be selected. Right in front of it, you will see Google search box and search button, which is blue in color. If the results returned by Google are not close to your expectations, you can type a hint in the search box and click the search button for Google to do the search again.
 When that is done, the search engine will return similar results to the searched image and hint text entered.

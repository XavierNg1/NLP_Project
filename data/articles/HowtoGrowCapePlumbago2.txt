 Cape plumbago likes moderately rich soil. It must be well-drained soil, as the plant does not like wet roots.

It is recommended that well-rotted manure is added to the soil to enhance it.
 Whether you're planting in a garden bed or in a container, mulch will help retain the moisture and reduce the growth of weeds.

 Youth theatres, amateur organizations and school productions need your support! There are hundreds of ways to get involved, whether you're designing posters, sewing costumes or selling tickets.


Organize and help set up at festivals and fairs. Just helping a bunch of artists and crafters get their stuff unpacked and set up, or helping to organize an event that they can all show up to helps them big time!
Help promote local arts events by posting about them online, blogging them, making flyers or stapling flyers up.
If your town or city has an arts committee, find out what they need volunteers for. If it doesn't, consider trying to form one.
Some types of local events you can help organize or prepare for are concerts, live performances including outdoor ones, art fairs, studio tours for artists, book signings and poetry readings, any of the arts can benefit from a public event and its exposure. If the artists have any recordings or physical things to sell, be sure the event's rules allow them to sell their works even if the performance or show is free.
 Be sincere.


Take classes in humanities or art, music or literature appreciation at your local community college. Some local community charges have a much lower "audit" fee if you attend the class but don't take the tests, get a grade or college credit for it. When you're attending just to improve your appreciation of the arts, auditing is just as good as taking the class to get in the right number of Humanities credits and leaves you more in your budget to buy real art, pay local musicians, get tickets, etc.

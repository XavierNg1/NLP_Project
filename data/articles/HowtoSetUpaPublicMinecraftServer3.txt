, Now inside the folder please run the Minecraft server.exe you download, now you may be thinking what's happened? don't panic just go into the EULA file it generated and change "false" to true the save the text document and re-run the java file.(please read the terms andÂ conditions of the EULA before typing true)., Now look for your IPv4 address under your used network adapter and copy your IPv4 address into the IP address setting in your text document called server., (If you have 8GB of RAM, don't exceed more than 4GB of RAM taken in for use in RAM.)., This is what you want to choose for your server so if you want 1GB only copy everything before the 2GB of ram same applies to the higher GB's.Bat Server Commands:1GB RAM:@echo offjava -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar minecraft_server.1.8.1.exe guiPause2GB RAM:@echo offjava -Xms2048M -Xmx2048M -jar minecraft_server.1.8.1.exe guiPause3GB RAM:@echo offjava -Xms3072M -Xmx3072M -jar minecraft_server.1.8.1.exe guiPause4GB RAM:@echo offjava -Xms4096M -Xmx4096M -jar minecraft_server.1.8.1.exe guiPauseOnce chosen how much you want go and save the text document as a bat file just by typing ".bat" at the end of the named text document. Now instead of running the Minecraft server.exe run the bat file instead. And type stop when you want to end the server.(if this tutorial is out of date from Minecraft 1.8.1 change the bat command to whatever version it is), Once you have your default gateway type it into your web browser and you will access your routers' settings. However you will need a username and password for this so go to:http://portforward.com/default_username_password/and find your routers default username and password and then type it in. When done you will have access now, so look for something called "port forwarding" or "port triggering" and click onto it. Then now we can add our own custom service so click something like "add custom service" and name the service whatever you want to, change the service type to TCP/UDP, and change the start and finish port to "25565".Now look for something called "firewall rules" or "internal IP address" or "outbound services" and "inbound services" once found change the "internal IP address" to your IPv4 address., So now your in you may ask " how do my friends join?" well go into your browser and type "IP" and this number is what you give to people you trust not strangers ).So give the public IP to your friends.

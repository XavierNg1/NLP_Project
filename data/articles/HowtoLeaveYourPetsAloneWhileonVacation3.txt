 Caged animals such as hamsters, guinea pigs, rodent, reptiles, and amphibians can be taken to a friend's or sitter's home. Create a document that outlines the feeding and water needs, cleaning schedule, and temperature control. Pack all of the things that mimic your pet's environment at your home such as bedding, heated surfaces, and decorations.If the cage is not mobile, someone will need to come check on your pet daily.
 A rabbit, ferret, or guinea pig is live bait in the wild. Relocating your pet to a home with canines or young children can be stressful and dangerous for your pet. If your pet is used to being in a quiet home with only adults, find a place that mimics that.The relocation environment is extremely important. Your pet can become disoriented and possibly sick from sudden lifestyle changes.
 Birds and cats enjoy being in consistent, familiar environments. Birds may become restless and pluck their own feathers in unfamiliar environments. Similarly, cats can become distressed in different environments. It's best to find a sitter to stay in your home or stop by your home every day.


If you have a bird, make sure that the sitter is comfortable and knowledgeable about birds.
Cats should not be left alone at someone else's home. They are likely to wander, escape, and try to return home.
 A kennel should be the last resort for this type of pet. Make sure the kennel you choose caters to your pet. If your pet will be at a kennel that also houses dogs and cats, it is best if it will be housed in a separate area. Always check out the kennel before you allow your pet to stay there.


Ask your veterinarian about boarding options for this type of pet. Some veterinarians provide boarding services as well.

Short ribs are cut from the short plate section on the steer. This area is near the bottom of the animal, and the short ribs are cut from near the flank and brisket areas. These ribs are much shorter in length, usually around 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. They have much more meat attached to them compared to the longer back ribs, but unless they're braised they're nearly impossible to chew.



Short ribs are often available boneless. Boneless short ribs have the benefit of having less connective tissue and sinew, but they lack the flavor that comes from being on the bone. Boneless short ribs can also be more expensive, though you're getting more meat for your dollar.



All short ribs are not created equal. While most short ribs have a good layer of meat on them, those toward the flank end of the steer have less meat. Butchers slip 1 or 2 of these lean bones into each package. Inspect the package carefully to ensure that each bone has a good portion of meat on it. Boneless rib packages should not have excess layers of fat on the meat.



Allow 3 to 4 very meaty short ribs per person, slightly more if they are not especially meaty. For boneless short ribs, you should allow about 6 oz. (170 g) per person.

 Use new soap, one that has a scent you find pleasing. Find suitable fabric (scraps are great provided they're large enough), such as cotton, satin, velvet, gingham, etc. You'll also need scissors to cut the fabric.;
, The fabric should be cut about 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4" wider than the soap on each side. This is important because each of these sides will be tied up.
 Cut a good length to start with–it is easier to cut the fabric shorter rather than to discover you haven't used enough fabric. Alternately, don't cut the length on the fabric bolt or larger piece of fabric, until after you have rolled in the soap and you're sure of the length required.
 Keep rolling until you reach the end. Try not to make the layering too thin or too thick; finish rolling when the layering feels just right (this will be dependent on the fabric type). The fabric used here was a shiny stretch fabric that has a lot of give and is satiny soft; it was wound over about four times.
,, Use ribbon, string, raffia, etc. to hold in place tightly.
 Finish off by making a neat bow. Cut off any extra lengths. If using ribbon, cut diagonally to prevent fraying.

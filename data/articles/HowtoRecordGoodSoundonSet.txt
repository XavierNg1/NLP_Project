 Even on the tightest of budgets you should always have a sound man.;
,, Never use an on board mic. An affordable recorder is the zoom H1. Sync up later using plural eyes.
 Keep levels at about 2/3rds, if unsure it is better that it is slightly quiet rather than distorted.
, You cannot do much with poorly recorded sound.
 Use a boom pole to get the microphone near the subject.
 At the end of a shoot in a location record room tone and any other sounds you can't get from a sound archive.

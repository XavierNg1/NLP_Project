 In addition to “regular” snacks like cheese and crackers, look for simple recipes that reflect the cuisine of a particular region, country or setting in the book. For example, if the story was set in Italy, you might serve bruschetta and Italian wine.Additionally, you could emphasize the theme of your club meeting by including some decor that evokes a character or setting from the book.For instance, if you’re reading Alice in Wonderland you could purchase some themed items (including coasters, candles, or decorative art) that refer to Alice and her adventures around the meeting space.
Don’t forget to offer some beverages to help wash down the snacks. Wine, water, coffee, tea, and soda are the easiest options.
 After deciding on the theme, ask for suggestions from book club members regarding what snacks they’d like, if any. If your meeting does not have a specific theme, simple snacks like crackers, cookies, and crisps are popular options.Some book clubs are happy without snacks of any kind. Others leave it to each group member to bring their own snacks. Still others leave it to the host to prepare snacks or hors d’oeuvres.
When hosting a book club, be sure to ask about food allergies and dietary preferences before preparing a snack.
 Instead of selecting a specific book-related theme for your book club meeting, you might want to introduce general book-centric paraphernalia to set the mood. If you’re hosting the club in your home, there are many options available for sprucing up a regular living room or other space with book club-themed items.For instance, you might be able to obtain pillow covers or pillows embroidered with images of books.
You could place some bookish art (such as art printed on book pages or paintings of people reading) around the meeting space.

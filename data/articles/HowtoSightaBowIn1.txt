 You will want to spread your sighting in over a few sessions. This is because fatigue will affect your accuracy and power, and your form will most likely shift. Spreading out the sighting over a few days will result in greater overall accuracy.;
, Bow sights come in many styles and should be chosen to meet the preferences of the archer. Bow sights are available at sporting good stores and specialized archery supply outlets. If you're just planning on hunting with the bow, you can use a simple sight that should only set you back around $40. Competition sights can cost 5 times this or more.


This guide is for sighting in a fixed-pin sight. It is the most common sight and is recommended for hunting and recreation.
 Follow the instructions provided with the sight for proper installation. Most sights are attached to the riser and are secured by a couple of screws. Most bows have pre-drilled holes for attaching sights. Do not overtighten the screws, as you could damage the bow. The sighting pins of the sight should be lined up vertically with the bow string.


The bow sight should be at a right angle to the bow.
After installing the sight, let it settle overnight. You may have to tighten it further after it settles.
 This will give you maximum room for adjustment in either direction as needed. An Allen wrench, available at hardware stores, will be needed to adjust the sighting pins.
 Ideally you will want to be able to mark off every 10 yards (9.1 m) from the target, at least up to 40 yards (36.6 m). Use a range finder if possible for accuracy. Range finders are available from hunting and outdoor supply stores.


Try to use a durable target that can take a lot of arrows, as sighting in the bow can take some time and a lot of repetition.

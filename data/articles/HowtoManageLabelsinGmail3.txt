 This will provide a pull-down menu.
 Use either one of the default labels provided (Work, Personal, Receipts, Travel) or select “Create New” to enter your own. Once you’ve selected a label, it will be applied to all selected conversations. Any new labels created will then be available under the “Labels” pull down menu for future use, along with the defaults.

 Chew toys help satisfy the puppy’s urges. When new teeth are putting pressure on a puppy's gums, chewing is a natural reaction. If you don't provide a chew toy, your puppy will look for something else to chew, including furniture, shoes and other things you value.


The best chew toys are made of sturdy materials. Toys made out of hard nylon, thick plastic, or durable rope are best.Good toys include KONG toys, chewing ropes, interactive puzzle toys, hard plastic bones, and teething sticks.
Choose a toy that is appropriate for your dog’s size. A small breed may not be able to chew a large toy while a large breed may choke on a small toy.;
, If your puppy is hesitant to chew their toys instead of your furniture, you can put a little peanut butter on the toy. A small spoonful is enough. Do not put too much on the toy, or it may keep your dog from eating more nutritious food.
 Freeze a clean dishrag after dipping it in water and wringing it out. Twist the damp dishrag into a tight, rope-like shape and let it freeze that way. When your puppy starts chewing, offer the frozen rag to temporarily numb their gum pain. When the rag warms and softens, you can rinse it out and refreeze it., Toys made out of thin material or even edible products like rawhide are not recommended for puppies. You do not want to give the puppy items that they can chew to pieces. They may choke or cut themselves on the sharp edges.Some things you should avoid giving the puppy include:


Rawhide bones
Cooked bones
Plastic balls
Stuffed animals
Toys stuffed with foam

 Bad days are just part of our existence. Things happen. Let them.;
, While spilling your guts to a whole IRC chatroom is not recommended, perhaps you have developed a wikiHow circle and someone you just 'let it all out' to. Also consider talking to someone in real life. There is a lot to be said for face-to-face conversations.
 When you encounter someone having one of those days, please remember to be a little kinder in your interactions. Granted, with digital communications, it can be hard, but if you know someone well enough, it's possible to figure it out.

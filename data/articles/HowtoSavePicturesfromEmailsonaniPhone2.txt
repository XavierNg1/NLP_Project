 Depending on which app you prefer, open either the Gmail or Inbox app on your iPhone.
 Locate the email message with the picture you want to save and tap to open it.
 Doing so opens the photo in full-screen mode.


If the photo is not an attachment but, rather, embedded into the text of the message, you may not be able to open it.
If you're unable to open the photo, a screenshot is your best option â†“.
 It looks like an underlined, downward-pointing arrow in the top-center of the screen. Your picture has been saved to your iPhone's Camera Roll.


If the app asks for permission to access your photos, tap Allow.
If you'd like to save the image to your iCloud Drive, tap the "Share" icon in the upper-right corner (a rectangle with an upward-pointing arrow), scroll left on the "Share" menu and tap Add To iCloud Drive.

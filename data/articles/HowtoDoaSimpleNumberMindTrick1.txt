 Tell a friend that you are performing a math trick. You will ask her to do some calculations secretly, then read her mind for their answer.;
, Pretend to think hard for a moment, then write down the number 3 on a piece of paper. Fold the paper in half, without letting anyone see the number.
 She should pick this secretly and keep the piece of paper.


We'll go through an example, where your friend secretly picks the number 4.
This trick works with any number, but keeping it between 1 and 20 makes it less likely that your friend will make a mistake.
 Warn her not to give you any sign, not even moving her lips. All you need is your mental powers.


For example, if she chose 4, her new number is 4 + 1 = 5.
 Have her take the last number she had, and multiply it by 2.


5 x 2 = 10.
 Put your hands to your head and concentrate, then tell her to add 4 to her last answer.


10 + 4 = 14.
 Tell her you almost have it, but the number is too big for you to see. Ask her to divide it by 2 to make it easier.


14 รท 2 = 7.
 Ask your friend to look at the piece of paper she used to remind herself what the original number was. Take the last answer she had and subtract that original number.


7 - 4 = 3.
 Tell her you've finally read her mind. Ask her to announce the last number she ended up with. Once she has, unfold your piece of paper and reveal the 3 you wrote down. No matter which number she started with, her answer will be 3.

 In real life, you wouldn't want to jump off a cliff without checking for a safe place to land. Similarly, your game shouldn't require the player to jump to a platform that can't be seen onscreen. That doesn't mean you can't surprise the player; just avoid "leaps of faith.";
, At no point should it be impossible to complete a level. If you want the player to fall into a "trap," make it possible to continue the level (without perishing!). That means no inescapable obstacles or enemies that can't be defeated.
 Put enemies in places that fit the level design and add to the challenge in a specific way. It might seem tempting to put a bunch of enemies in one place, but don't - it's been done way too many times already. Instead, use enemies in clever ways, or to create a puzzle for the player to solve.
 Don't put coins or bonus items in places that can't be reached or that lead the player to an inevitable death. The player should be able to theoretically collect every power-up in the level, even if it is difficult to do so. So don't put doors, coins or power-ups in arbitrary places - it will only make the player frustrated.

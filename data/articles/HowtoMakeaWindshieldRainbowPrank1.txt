 Donâ€™t try this prank on a someone who is likely to totally lose it and never do it to someone who is learning to drive or uncertain about driving. Choose that good buddy who will totally enjoy the prank.


Consider creating the rainbow to cheer up a friend or someone who has been sad or depressed. It might be a fun, sunny way to let that person know that everything will be okay.;
, It's probably best to do this on a day when you know it might rain (so that the windshield wipers will be necessary). However, avoid days where the rain is bucketing down; it's a fine balancing act to get a day with light rain!

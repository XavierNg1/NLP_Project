 Choose a ribbon that is thin and pliable, with no wire. Your beads can be of any size and style, as long as the holes are big enough to fit the ribbon. Consider also adding a charm bead to hang from the end of your ribbons.
 Use scissors to cut your ribbon to 42 inches long. Use a match or a lighter to cauterize the ends of the ribbons to keep them from fraying.
 Add the cluster of beads you want to have hanging from the bottom of your bookmark. If you chose a charm, add it to the center of the ribbon and then fold the ribbon in half, threading your other beads over both tails.


If you donâ€™t use a charm, place a single bead in the center of the ribbon (threading it over only one tail), and then fold the ribbon in half and insert both tails through the remaining beads to make it secure.
Tie a knot at the base of these beads when you have added all the ones you would like.
Leave about a 10 inch space, and then tie another knot with both of the ribbon tails. Add any beads you would like to the top of the bookmark, and then tie one more knot to keep them from falling off.
 The fold in the center of the ribbon should have created a loop-like space between the two pieces of ribbon. Slide this over your book so that on ribbon is placed on the page you want to mark, and the other is placed on the front cover. This will keep your bookmark secure.

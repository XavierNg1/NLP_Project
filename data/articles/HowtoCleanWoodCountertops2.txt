 Cut a fresh lemon in half and rub the stain with the juicy inner side of the lemon half. The acidic nature of the lemon juice should help remove the stain from your wooden countertops.Consider sprinkling lemon juice on the stain and scrubbing with a sponge if you don’t have any fresh lemons.
You can add a dash of salt for extra abrasion when scrubbing with the lemon.
 Empty your iron of any water that might be left inside and turn it on to the lowest possible setting. Place a clean dishrag, or any other type of thin, clean cloth (like a clean, old t-shirt), over the stain. Apply the iron to the area of the cloth covering the stain and leave it there for a very brief moment.Be careful not to leave it for too long, as this could create a burn mark on the surface of your wood countertops.
 Use a piece of 120-grit sandpaper to gently sand your wooden countertops. Remember to sand with the grain, not against it. After giving it a good once over with the 120-grit paper, switch to a piece of 180-grit sandpaper and sand the countertops, again keeping with the natural grain of the wood.This should help remove any tough stains on the surface of the wood.
Once you finish sanding, you’ll need to apply mineral oil and rub it into the wood grain with a clean rag. Let it soak into the wood for about 30 minutes, and then wipe away any excess mineral oil residue with a paper towel.
Be sure to choose a food-safe mineral oil. You can also use walnut oil for the same effect.Avoid using culinary oils because they can oxidize and become rancid over time.

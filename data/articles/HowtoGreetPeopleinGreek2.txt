 Greek culture makes use of body language during greetings, and a handshake is an important part of this. You should shake hands with everyone to whom you’re being introduced: men, women, and children alike. Give a firm, brief handshake.It’s common to shake hands again when leaving the group of people to whom you’ve been introduced.
 Although not likely when meeting individuals for the first time, Greek men and women often greet close friends with a hug and a European-style kiss on both cheeks.If you are hugged while being introduced to someone, reciprocate the hug, and reciprocate the cheek-kisses if offered. Instead of kissing, male friends may pat one another on the shoulder or back.


In general, expect Greek individuals to stand quite close to you. This is not meant to be invasive or confrontational; individuals from Greek culture maintain a smaller circle of personal space than most Americans.
 In Greek culture, the American “OK” signal made by touching the tip of the thumb to the tip of the index finger and holding out the middle, ring, and pinky fingers is considered very rude. To avoid unintentionally making this vulgar gesture (the equivalent of a middle finger in America), signal “OK” by giving a thumbs up.The thumbs up gesture carries the same meaning in Greece as it would in America or Great Britain.
 To signal “yes,” nod your head slightly downward. To signal “no,” bob your head slightly upwards.Avoid mixing these two gestures. An enthusiastic up-and-down nod of your head will carry no meaning in Greek culture, and will likely confuse Greek individuals.

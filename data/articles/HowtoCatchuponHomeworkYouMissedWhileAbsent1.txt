 If you know that you're going to be gone for a long period of time, get your homework and books beforehand if possible. This will insure that you have nothing to worry about when you get back.;
, If you don't, you will forget. If your school/class has a homework website, check it to see what homework you missed. If possible, ask a friend to collect your missed work for you.
 Talk to your teacher(s) about the homework you missed, as sometimes the teacher will expect you to do it, and other times, if the assignment is a minor one, you may not have to make it up at all. If you have multiple teachers, it's strongly suggested to talk to all of them, as they all have different expectations. For example, some teachers will give you as many days as you were gone to get your homework in, whereas others will not.
 Start by sorting your homework from bigger assignments to smallest. Finishing bigger assignments first assures that if you have good study habits, your homework will be done in no time. Also, keep in mind the due date of each assignment. It's better to finish the homework that's due tomorrow than the homework that due in a week.
 Instead of going home and watching TV or going on Facebook, finish your homework. Make a deal with yourself, such as each assignment done gives you 1 hour on the computer, etc. This process of rewarding yourself motivates you to do your homework. Remember that even though you're on a tight deadline to get everything in, that you should put time and effort into doing your assignments.
 Some teachers expect you to come to them to make up tests and quizzes, because they would like you to learn responsibility.
 Every day you get assignments done, make sure to turn them in. Do that so you don't have loose papers filling up your work space. If you're going to finish the work, you might as well turn it in, right? Late marks are better than no marks at all.

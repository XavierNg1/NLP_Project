, Using this report, you can go to Customers -> Receive Payments in QuickBooks. You will receive the payments against the invoices in the normal fashion, but instead of having the payment go to the normal “ Undeposited Funds ” account, you will have to post it to a new Other Current Asset account called “ Due from Factor .” This process will reduce the actual receivable (because it’s paid) and increase the “ Due from Factor ” account therefor showing that money is owed to you from the Factor.
 This process will increase the bank account and decrease the “ Due from Factor ” account therefor reducing the amount of money that is owed to you from the Factor. If you then double click on the “ Due from Factor ” account, it will have a running balance just like a bank account so you can see the balance owed to you from the Factor.

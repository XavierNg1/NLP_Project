 Microwaves can only boil the milk for a brief time before the milk overflows. This will still kill some microbes, but not enough to treat raw milk or milk stored at room temperature. Heat these over the stove instead.
 Avoid mugs with metallic paint, which are not microwave safe.
 Place a wooden spoon or chopstick in the mug. Use a utensil long enough that it can't fall under the milk. This lets steam escape up the handle instead of causing a foamy explosion.
 Between each "zap," take out the milk and stir it for 5â€“10 seconds. This cautious method minimizes the risk of overflow.

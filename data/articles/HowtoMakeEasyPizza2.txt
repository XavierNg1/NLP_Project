 The dough is great if you've got it, but let's face it â€” it's often a hassle to make, and it can be finicky to cook. If you want to reduce pizza down to it's most basic elements and don't mind cheating (or improvising) a bit, try using naan bread. Naan comes pre-cooked and makes for an excellent pizza base. If you don't have naan, try any of these options:









Pita bread
English muffins
A piece of toast
Tortillas

, If you've got it, pizza sauce works great. But pasta sauce tastes almost identical, and ketchup or barbecue sauce works in a pinch.
 For this super-easy pizza, think kitchen-leftovers. Start with a vegetable or two, like roasted bell peppers and sauteed mushrooms. Maybe add some pepperoni or salami. Top it off with a condiment like black olives. If you want to experiment with some other classic pizza combinations, here are some ideas:









Chicken breast, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and black olives
Caramelized onions, sausage, and fennel
Walnuts, prosciutto, and blue cheese

, Mozzarella, asiago, and Parmesan make for a classic pizza taste, but any cheese will do.









If you're using a strong cheese like Gorgonzola or a crumbly cheese like feta, plan on adding a little bit less to your pizza. Too much of these cheese can overwhelm the pizza.
 For bread-based pizza crust like naan, a toaster oven is ideal. Toaster ovens take a shorter amount of time to heat up compared to ovens. Plan on toasting at medium high for 5 minutes to start and then check in every minute thereafter.









If you're not using pizza dough and you're really crunched for time, you can even cook your pizza in the microwave. Microwaves are excellent at getting the cheese and toppings piping hot, but be prepared for a soft, squishy crust, rather than a baked, crunchy crust. Plan on cooking for 2 minutes to start and then checking in every 30 seconds thereafter.

 The forward email is created and the content of the previous email is now formatted into text in your composition.
 Click and drag the mouse cursor to highlight the names and email addresses you wish to remove.
 Press ← Backspace or Delete or go to Edit > Cut to remove whatever text is highlighted.


Keep in mind when forwarding a conversation or a previously forwarded email that names and addresses may be displayed on multiple lines of the forwarded text.
 Add your own message above the forwarding text, enter your recipient(s), and press “Send”.


If this message has been forwarded to you from someone else, you may want to clean up the subject line. A “Fwd” tag is added every time the message is forwarded, which can make the subject line look cluttered.

 Since the Supreme Court’s rulings in Citizens United v. FEC and Speechnow.org v. FEC, there are more organizations than ever to donate to.You can donate to the candidate directly; to a candidate’s PAC; to a state, national, or congressional party; or to a super-PAC that is working on behalf of a candidate. The following information applies to Federal elections only. State candidate’s limits are set by the states.Donating directly to the candidate’s campaign is the most conventional way to make a donation. If you were to donate at a campaign office or on the candidate’s website, this is probably what you would be donating to. The limits on contributions are $2700 per election—so $2,700 for the primary and another $2700 for the general election.
If you donate to a candidate PAC—a political action committee—you can donate larger amounts, but candidates have more discretion to share the funds with other candidates. The limits for individuals donating to PACs are $5000 per year.
You may donate $10,000 per year to a state party and $33,000 to a national party committee, but there’s no guarantee that your money will go to your specific candidate. The parties have discretion.
A super-PAC—a nonprofit that advocates for political positions without explicitly endorsing a candidate (although they can criticize candidates) can accept unlimited contributions. Super-PACs are usually affiliated with a candidate., Since a candidate may have to stand in a primary election in addition to the general election, you should think about when to time your donation. If the primary is going to be very close, you might want to max out your donation then. If the general is going to be closer, it might make more sense to donate after the primary.
 You can donate by check, money order, or credit card. If you donate to a party, a PAC, or a candidate, you will have to disclose your address and profession.

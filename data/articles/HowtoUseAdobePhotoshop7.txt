 You will want to begin saving your work fairly early on in the creation process. This will keep you from losing data in the event of a crash. Save the file from the menu much as you would in any other program. This will bring up the usual save window, at which point you will need to choose the file type you wish to save it as.


If you are still working on a file, save it as a PSD or Photoshop Document, as this will keep all of the editing capabilities of the file intact. It will also preserve layers.
If you want to save the file to be uploaded to the web or added into another program, save a separate copy as an image file. The most common option will be a jpeg, though you will want to save as a gif if you wish to preserve transparencies.
There is also the option to save as a PDF. This is helpful if the image is largely text-based or is intended for printing on standard paper.
 If you intend your image to be used on the web, you may wish to save using this menu instead (found towards the bottom of the main menu). This will allow you to further compress the image or alter gif options.

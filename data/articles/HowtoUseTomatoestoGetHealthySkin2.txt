 Take half of a tomato, and carefully pour ½ teaspoon (2 g) of fine granulated sugar over the cut side of the fruit. Spread the sugar evenly so as much sticks to the tomato as possible.If you don’t have granulated sugar, you can substitute brown sugar.
 Once the sugar is on the tomato, massage it over your face. Work in circular motions to gently exfoliate your skin, keeping the pressure light.Be careful not to scrub too hard with the tomato and sugar or you may irritate your skin.
Rub the tomato and sugar over each section of the face no more than twice.
 After you’ve scrubbed your entire face with the tomato and sugar, use warm water to carefully wash the residue from your skin. Follow up with your usual serum, acne treatment, and/or moisturizer.You can use the tomato sugar scrub once or twice a week.

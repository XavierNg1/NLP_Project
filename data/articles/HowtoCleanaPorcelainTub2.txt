Scrub harder on areas of your tub that are stained. Continue to soak your sponge in the solution and return to clean the tub.


For harder stains, soak the area with hydrogen peroxide for five minutes before scrubbing it with your dish soap and water solution.You can use a rag as an alternative to a sponge.
Porcelain enamel is sensitive to harsh chemicals like bleach and vinegar., Thoroughly rinse the tub until all of the suds go down the drain. You can use either a bucket with clean water, or the showerhead to rinse everything off.

 This app allows you to view, create, and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files from your iPad. The apps are available for free, but require an Office 365 subscription in order to be able to edit and create files.
 This is available on iPhones, Android phones, and Windows phones. Office Mobile is free.


Creating and editing files is free for home use if you sign in with a Microsoft account.
The Office Mobile apps do not have as many editing and formatting options as Office for iPad.

 Teach them the basic stuff like talking, then walking and then potty training., Make sure your toddler is in a good mood so you won't have to stop and waste time feeding/changing diapers. Go to the parent's profile and click the toddler, then click 'learn to talk.' Keep going until a comment comes up saying "(name) just learned to talk! Next up: teaching (name) to stop talking!" Another way to tell if you're done is watching the blue bar above your toddler's head. Once it fills up times, you're done., This is pretty much the same as teaching your toddler how to talk. Let your toddler sleep in between learning how to talk and walk so you don't have to stop in the middle., Make sure you have a potty chair (in the kids section). It doesn't matter if they don't have to go to the bathroom. Just put them on there! Do this multiple times. Every once in a while, you will have to stop and empty the potty chair, otherwise it will overflow.

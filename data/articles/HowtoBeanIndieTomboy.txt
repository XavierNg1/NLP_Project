 You can do almost anything when it comes to hair. Side-swept bangs are really indie and can be tomboyish, too. Just decide what you feel comfortable with and what suits your face shape. Stay natural when it comes to hair colours—its not very tomboyish nor indie to have crazy blue hair with red and neon pink streaks in it.;
, Wear little or no makeup because neither style is big on makeup—they're both natural styles.
 A t-shirt paired with a vest or hoodie worn over is a great example, or wear a babydoll tank top with an unbuttoned shirt over the top. Pastel colours are very nice.
 Baggy pants are very tomboyish but not very indie, so try light or dark-washed skinny jeans—maybe ripped ones, or even high-waisted shorts.
 Fortunately, it's pretty hard to go wrong with shoes. Avoid heels, pink shoes or styles that everybody else wears. Converses in dark colours or red are good unless they are very trendy where you live.
 Pink dangling Hello Kitty earrings don't go well with the indie tomboy style. Long necklaces and scarves are very indie but don't go overboard with these, as too many accessories can make you look preppy and girly.
, Above all, be yourself and don't try to be someone that you are not!

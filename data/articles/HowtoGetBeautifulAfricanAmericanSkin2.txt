 If you're dehydrated, your skin is dehydrated, and by the time you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated. Your skin is likely prone to ashiness if you're not moisturizing your skin properly, and drinking water is a big part of it. Make sure you are getting enough water throughout the day. The old standby is 8 glasses of water, but make sure you are drinking enough that you don't feel constantly thirsty.Tea and juice are a part of your water intake, though be aware that juice can add empty calories.
Try adding slices of fruit (such as grapefruit or orange) or veggies (such as cucumber) to make your water more refreshing.
 It's important to moisturize after you wash your skin, such as when you get out of the shower or when you wash your face or hands. Pick one that's right for your skin type. If you have oily skin, look for one that is labeled for oily skin. You may also have "normal/regular" skin or dry skin. Read the labels to see which lotion is right for your skin.If you have especially dry skin, you may need to apply an oil or cream-based lotion at night.
You may need a separate moisturizer for your face and body. For your face, make sure to pick one that says its non-comedogenic, as that's less likely to clog your pores.While everyone benefits from a good lotion, dry skin can be more visible on African American skin. Being vigilant about apply lotion is especially important to achieve beautiful African American skin.
 In the dry winter months, it can be beneficial to make your home more humid, also to help keep your skin from getting dry and ashy. Consider adding a humidifier to your bedroom to soak up the benefits of more humid air.

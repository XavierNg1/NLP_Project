 Unlike newer models of the Samsung Galaxy, the S5 relies on a Widget menu to open the Flashlight function. You can unlock your Galaxy S5 by clicking the "Lock" button on the right side of your phone to wake up the phone's screen, then swiping your screen up or to the right.

You'll need to enter your passcode (if you have one) after tapping the Lock button. You can also use a fingerprint scan or a pattern entry to unlock your phone.
 This will prompt a menu with several options:

Wallpapers - customize your wallpaper settings.
Widgets - access technical apps (e.g., the Torch).
Home screen settings - customize your Home screen settings.
 This will open the Widgets menu, from which you can activate your Torch function., This may be toward the bottom of the menu., You've successfully activated Torch! To disable this app, simply tap its icon again.

You can also turn Torch off by swiping the notification menu down from the top of the screen and tapping the "Torch" option.

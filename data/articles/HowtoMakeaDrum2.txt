 You'll need a heat gun or torch, a sharp box cutter, a metal can, and PETE plastic. That's it!


PETE plastic will be labeled on the bottom of plastic items, usually next to the recycle number (which will be a 1). Disposable water bottles are usually made of PETE, as are many cheap juice containers.
 Cut both ends off of the metal can and the plastic bottles. You will then want to cut a single line in the tube of the plastic bottles so that they can be flattened out. A single hole made with a nail in the side of the can is also necessary. Anywhere on the side will work.
 Trace the opening hole of the can onto the rolled out piece of plastic using a marker. Leave at least half an inch of extra space all around the can as you trace the line, since the plastic needs to be bigger than the opening. Cut out the pieces when you're done.
 Place the circle of plastic down on a surface that can be exposed to high heat and then place the can down on top of it. Apply the heat evenly around the edges of the bottom of the can and you will see the plastic shrink up to grip the sides of the can.


If you see the edges turn white, you're over-heating it.
 The ends of your drum should now be covered. If you used ridged plastic, you'll need to apply the heat over the surface in order to smooth it out but it will become completely smooth. If you used smooth plastic you still need to apply a small amount of heat to the head to get it nice and tight and get the proper sound.
 Enjoy your new drum.

 If the number you have attempted to call is busy, tap on the red "End Call" button to hang up the phone. You can only redial a number after hanging up the phone.


Note that this technique will only work with the iPhone. It does not work with other smart phones or standard mobile phones.
Additionally, this method will only work with numbers you have dialed from the keypad. It does not work with numbers you have dialed from your Favorites, Recents, or Contacts.
 Tap once on the "Phone" icon to open the application.


If you just hung up, the "Phone" app should automatically reopen to the keypad. If it doesn't open the keypad, however, you will need to navigate to the keypad before continuing.
To open the keypad, simply tap on the "Keypad" icon on the bottom phone menu. You only need to tap on the icon once to open the keypad.
 Tap the green "Call" button once from the iPhone keypad. The last number you dialed should be displayed at the top of the screen.


Verify that this number is the number you wish to redial before you continue.
Note that there is no time limit regarding redials, so you can redial a phone number you called weeks ago if it still remains the last number you dialed from the keypad.
 With the phone number displayed at the top of the screen, tap the "Call" button once more to call the number.


If the phone number you are trying to reach is still busy, you can hang up and repeat the process as many times as necessary until the other party answers.

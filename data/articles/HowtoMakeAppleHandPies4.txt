 Before you glaze the pies, use a knife to cut 2 small slits in the top of each. That will prevent the pies from bursting when they bake.If you prefer, you can create an “x” shape in the top of the pies instead of slits.
 Add 1 large egg and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of water to a small bowl. Whisk the two together until they’re fully blended.You can substitute 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of milk for the water to give the pies a shinier finish.
 Use a pastry brush to apply a light layer of the egg wash to each pie. Next, sprinkle a pinch of sparkling sugar over each pie for garnish.You can omit the sugar if you prefer.
 Place the pies in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake until the crust is slightly puffed and golden brown. It should take approximately 20 to 25 minutes.Halfway through baking, rotate the pans to ensure that the pies bake evenly.
 Remove the pies from the oven, and transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Let them cool for at least 10 minutes before serving them.You can serve the pies warm or at room temperature.

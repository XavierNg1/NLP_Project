 Leave it for later, just before the test.
 Two good options include Rusen Meylani's '15 Realistic Tests for the SAT Subject Test Math, Level 2' or  Dr. John Chung's SAT II Math Level 2. The former is extremely hard compared to the real test, and if you get 800 in 60 mins there, you are guaranteed to get 800 on the real test. The latter is a little bit harder than the real test, and can help you to get around 780 if you are nervous during the test.
 It does almost everything you need for the test!

, All of the aforementioned books will help you get a feel not only for the areas of math covered, but also for the structure and typical wording on SAT math questions.
 If the knowledge goes beyond what you've studied in math class so far, you may need to get specific help. If you're a self-learner, you can go it alone, but if not, an SAT-focused tutor can provided the assistance and a game plan to get you on track.
 Before the exam, relax, have a good sleep, and know that you can always retake it - this can help you not to be very anxious.

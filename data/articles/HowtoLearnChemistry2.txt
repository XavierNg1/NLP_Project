 Don’t go for a book because it seems like it is an easier text. You may just feel like you have learned chemistry without really understanding the essential principles. To find a good textbook, take a look at some university bookstores and see which texts their professors prefer.
 Practice your problem solving skills by solving textbook problems as you come to them. These problems are inserted to solidify your understanding of the text. Work the problems until you can get the right answer and understand the steps that got you there. , You need to understand the principles. If something doesn’t seem right, take the time to figure it out. Use the index to help you find answers to things you don’t understand.


If you're still having trouble, try to find a tutor or a friend who's better at chemistry to help you out.
 Memorizing the formulas won't help you to apply them properly in lab or during exams. Ask yourself the following questions when learning a new formula:What system or change does this formula describe?
What do the variables mean and what are their units?
When and how should this formula be applied?
What is the significance?

 The people that you surround yourself with have a very large impact on you and your life.
 New people will bring new experiences into your life. Join a local club or group that you share an interest with.


Many cities offer adult sports clubs that are much more relaxed than traditional league sports. You may be able to find options like kickball and dodge ball in your area.
 Your personal relationships will have the biggest impact on your mood and motivation. Find someone who complements your personality, and challenges you to be a better person.


If you’re with someone already, work to rekindle the spark that brought you together. Go on a date that recalls an early experience. Take a romantic weekend away with your significant other. Reestablish the magic and you will find yourself motivated in other areas of your life.
Relationships are a two-way street. You will need to invest yourself emotionally in order to receive the support of the other person.
 Friends will come and go, but your family will always be there. You don’t have to have a close relationship, but take the time to connect with your family and relatives on a regular basis. A few loving words from a family member can give you just the boost you need.


If you’d rather not talk to family over the phone, even emails or social network posts are a good way to keep in touch and stay connected.
 Having an unbiased person to talk to about your problems and concerns can be very beneficial to your mental well-being. Many therapists offer sliding scale payments, allowing those with lower incomes the ability to afford services.


University counseling programs often have student-run counseling at a fraction of the cost of professional services.

 If possible, ask a member of the bridal party about the color scheme. If you can't do that, then dress in traditional fall colors- browns, reds, and yellows are always a safe bet.
 A wedding is a formal event, and you are expected to dress for it. Be sure to wear formal clothes, like you might wear to an office job.
 While getting ready for a wedding is exciting, don't go so overboard in your outfit that you take away from the bridal party. Remember, this is their special day.

 Open you image and place your text on the page. It doesn't matter what you write, as any amount or type of text can be put in the dead center of the image., This method will center everything in the layer you have selected. So, if you have five different layers you want to center, you'll either have to do it by hand or put them in one layer. For now, just work with one layer.
 This is the second highest tool in your tool bar, the little dotted square with a little triangle in the bottom corner. Once selected, click and drag from the top-left corner until the entire canvas is selected.
 This is simply the normal cursor, and the top tool in your toolbox on the left of the screen. Not how the screen at the top of Photoshop changes with each tool -- the centering tools are in this menu.
 To the right of "Show Transform Controls" are a set of lines and boxes. These are alignment tools. Hovering over each tool will tell you what each does. You want to pay attention to two of them in particular:



Align Vertical Centers: The second button -- two squares with a horizontal line through the center. This makes the space above and below the text even.

Align Horizontal Centers: The second to last button-- two squares with a vertical line through the center. This makes the space to either side of the text even.
 Clicking and dragging text makes it almost impossible to hit the center. If you've centered multiple text blocks or images, but still need to space them out, use the arrow keys to move things along perfectly straight lines. If you only press the down arrow, for example, you'll preserve your horizontal centering.


Use Ctrl-click (PC) or Cmd-click (Mac) to move the text by even smaller, more precise increments.
These movements are always even. If you click the down arrow twice, clicking the up arrow twice will bring you back exactly where you started.

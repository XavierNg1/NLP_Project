 You can make them however you want.;
, You can kill them however you want, depending on the ghost colour. One favourite is drowning (build a pool, make the Sim get in, delete the ladder and build a wall right at the edge of the pool) but there are many other ones.
 It takes about 5-7 days, although it can be faster sometimes. When it comes, you should get a phone call on your Sim's mobile. Accept it.
, Click anywhere on the ground inside of the building and when you're done making your ghost Sim, a message should pop up saying something along the lines of it didn't go according to plan. That means it has worked!

, The ghost Sims are exactly like normal Sims; they can even have ghost babies, get jobs, etc.

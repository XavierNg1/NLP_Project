 Greens deplete the carrot of both moisture and nutrients. Use a cutting board and sharp knife to cut the greens from the carrot. Always use caution when handling sharp knives.;
, Use the bubble wrap with the small textured bubbles. The bubble wrap will enable the perfect amount of moisture to stay close to the carrots, but the texture of the bubble wrap will prevent that moisture from gathering right on the surface of the carrots. The bubble wrap will add up to two extra weeks of freshness to your carrots. Plastic bags lead to rotting.
 It is best to use carrots within one to two weeks, as this will provide you with the best nutrients and taste value.
 A little snow covering will keep them from freezing and in the spring you will be able to pick some lovely crisp carrots.

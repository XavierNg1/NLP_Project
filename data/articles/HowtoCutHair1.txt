 In the same way that an artist starts with a fresh canvas before painting, you want to start with clean hair before cutting. Hair that's dirty or full of product will not allow you to see a true finished product when your haircut is completed.


Use a shampoo and conditioner made for the specific hair type. There are products to fit every need--color-treated hair, dry hair, damaged hair, thinning hair, hair that lacks volume oily hair, normal to dry hair, and natural hairâ€”so pick the one that's best based on hair type and needs.
If hair is prone to knots or tangles (such as chemically treated or bleached hair), use a de-tangling conditioner or spray on a de-tangling product. You don't want your comb to get stuck when you run it through hair that has mats or tangles.;
, You can best see how the hair naturally falls when it's wet. Also, it's easier to follow cutting guidelines on wet hair so your cut is more precise.









Note that this is only the case with straight hair. Cutting curly or wavy hair properly when it's wet can be difficult, as the water will cause the hair to temporarily lie flat and straight. Unable to see the normal curls/wave pattern, you may inadvertently cut it improperly; creating uneven texture (you'll end up cutting some curls in half and some completely off, resulting in bits of hair sticking straight out unevenly).
If you are cutting African American hair, then make sure to dry the hair completely before cutting it.Wet hair sticks together, which helps it stay in place while you cut.
Keep a bottle of water with a spray nozzle nearby so that you can dampen the hair if it begins to dry while you are working on it.
 Make sure hair is dry if you plan to use clippers or if you want to carefully thin the hair to make sure you don't remove too much fullness.


Do a dry cut if you're simply trying to remove split ends; they're easier to see when the hair is dry.
If you're pressed for time, a dry cut saves the need for washing and drying.

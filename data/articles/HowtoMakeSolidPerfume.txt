,, Put about an inch of water in a small saucepan, then rest the jar or bowl containing the wax in the water. Bring the water around it to a boil. The wax will melt gradually.
, A thin stirring stick is used because the wax will start to form a solid on whatever you do your stirring with — your goal should be to find something that has as little surface area as possible so you lose less of the end product, and also something disposable so you don't have to clean it off. Mix thoroughly.
 In about 30 minutes, it will be cooled, solid and ready to use. This will yield about one half ounce (by volume) of solid perfume.
 To use the perfume, simply rub a finger around on the surface of the waxy perfume, then rub that finger on the area you want to smell good — the inside of your wrists and behind the ears works well. You can also use solid perfume in many other ways:









Make a simple cedarwood perfume to rub on dog collars. The scent of cedar repels ticks, and smells good too!
Make a cedar or cypress rub for feet — this prevents fungus and bacteria-related foot odour.
Make a calm and relaxing scent using chamomile or lavender essential oils.
Apply sparingly on business cards — this Japanese tradition makes your card unique and memorable.
Rub on the inside of your wallet to get rid of dirty money smells.

 It is impossible to tell the gender or sexual maturity of your fish before it has grown to three inches or eight centimeters in length. This is when the sexual characteristics of your fish begin to develop.This will typically occur after one year of age, although fish in aquariums may take longer to mature., If you are looking to breed your goldfish, you should watch for the development of breeding characteristics. These will begin to appear around one year of age.


Males will develop small white spots on the operculum (gill cover) and the pectoral fin. These white spots are called breeding tubercles.
A female’s abdomen will become fuller and rounder when it is ready to breed.While it is impossible to accurately sex your fish before it has developed these physical characteristics, in general, males tend to be smaller and slimmer than females., When it is time to mate, male fish will chase the female fish around the tank. It will swim close to the female’s abdomen, and you may notice it bumping into the female’s stomach area.If you notice hundreds of clear, spherical eggs, your female fish has laid eggs. This is a definite sign of sexual maturity.


Some breeds, such as the Black Moor or Shubunkin goldfish, mate only in summer while the common goldfish can mate at any time of year provided it has proper tank conditions.Goldfish that live in ponds will typically mate in spring.

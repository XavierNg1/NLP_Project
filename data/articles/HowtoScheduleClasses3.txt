 Your 8th grade year will greatly influence your 9th grade schedule. You will have more options on what classes you are going to take just by taking 1 or 2 honors classes.
 While college may seem an eternity away, it's really only a few more years. You should start to think about whether you intend to go to college, or if you want to start working right out of high school. If you don't want to go to college, see about any vocational opportunities available for you next year, or even this year if your middle school is big enough. If you intend to go to college, think about programs that might be able to help you. If you come from a low income family or are a member of a minority group, there may be programs at local colleges to help you.

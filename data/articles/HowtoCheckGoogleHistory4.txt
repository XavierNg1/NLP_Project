 If you use a Mac and the Safari browser, you can check your Google search history just like if you use Internet Explorer or Firefox. As with the other browser methods, this technique only shows you what you have searched for on Safari on your Mac.
 Once you have opened Safari you can simply click on "Show History" in the History menu. Alternatively you can use the short-cut keys. Just press the key combination Alt-⌘-2 to bring up the browser history., As with the other browsers, this will reveal all of your web history that is stored. You can use the same simple method to narrow down the results and focus on your Google search history. Just type "google” (with your country’s internet code) into the history search window. The search results will show your Google search history for Safari on that Mac.

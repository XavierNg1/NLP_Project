 This allows you to plate the food right away once it's finished cooking.;
, Add the onions and a few pinches of piment, and sauté on medium heat until onions are transparent in color.
 Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes (be sure to stir every now and then when sautéing ingredients).
 This may take 15 to 30 minutes (give or take) depending on the strength of your stove. Make sure to keep an eye on the vegetables while they simmer, you don't want your onions to burn. Stir as needed.
 Cover and simmer on low heat until tender. Let it simmer for a good 20 to 40 minutes. This allows the white wine to permeate the vegetables and creates a nice flavor.
 While the water is coming to a boil, place the couscous in a bowl.
 Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the couscous has absorbed the water. When the water is absorbed gently fluff the couscous with a fork. While the couscous sits, add the zucchini to the vegetable sauce, and heat 1 - 2 tablespoons of olive over high heat in second skillet.
 Add the fillets to the pan skin side down, and reduced to medium - low heat. Cook the fillets for approximately 7 minutes until cooked 3/4 of the way through. Turn fillets and cook for 3 minutes or until slightly pink in the center.
 Begin by serving a portion of couscous on each plate.
 Be sure to give each plate an equal amount of sauce and vegetables, but don't drown the couscous in sauce either!

, Place each fillet of salmon over the sauce and couscous, and center nicely.
 Serve and enjoy!

 Coat the insides of the jars with nonstick cooking spray or vegetable shortening. Make sure that the jars you are using have wide mouths and straight walls. Set the lids aside for now., Place the butter into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the sugar, then beat the two together. Keep beating them until the butter turns light and fluffy. You can do this by hand, or speed things up with a mixer or food processor., Add in the first egg, and beat the batter well. Add in the second egg, and beat the batter again until no streaks remain. Stir in the vanilla extract last., Pour the flour into a small mixing bowl. Add the baking powder and the salt. Whisk the three together until they are evenly combined and no clumps remain., Pour half of the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Whisk it in well, then stir in all of the half-and-half. Whisk in the rest of the flour mixture., You can pour the batter into the jas straight from the bowl, or you can ladle them out using an ice cream scoop or soup ladle. Be sure to wipe the mouths of the jars clean when you are done. This ensures that they seal properly later on., The baking sheet will make it easier to take the jars in and out of the oven. It will also keep them from tipping over. The cakes are done when they spring back slightly when touched in the center.Make sure that the jars are not touching on the baking sheet.
If you want to seal the jars later, boil the lids in a large saucepan while the cakes are baking., Let the cakes cool for 1 to 2 minutes, then seal them with the lids. The heat from the cakes will cause the lids to automatically seal when you put them on.You can skip this step if you plan on serving all of the cakes on the same day.
 If you plan on serving the cakes on the same day, be sure to let them cool first, about 10 to 15 minutes. Top them off with some chocolate sauce, whipped cream, or anything else you'd enjoy on a cake.

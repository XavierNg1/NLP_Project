 Before you can install pavers you need to excavate the area 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm).
 Take a large square rod and run it over the excavated area to ensure that it is flat and level. If you feel it rising and falling you will need to readjust the soil surface to make it even., You can rent a compactor machine from your local hardware store. Run it over the ground to make sure that it is solid, flat, level and compacted., Your gravel base goes on top of the excavated area and needs to be 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) deep. Run your rod over it again to make sure the base is level then compact it., You can now arrange your pavers in the desired pattern and be as creative as you like., Use the compactor machine again and this time run it over the pavers to make sure they are compressed down into your base and that there is no breakage., The sand filler will help to hold the pavers in place and keep them from moving. Simply pour it on top of your pavers and sweep it in. Now your pavers should be level and won't move.

Candies for eyes and smile.
, Place the pudding bowl cake in the center of the serving plate or board., These will be positioned as feet shortly., Cover it completely in the green frosting., Also frost the head., Ensure that they are all positioned at even intervals, to make it look like turtle feet. Do any touch-ups needed from handling the cupcake halves., While still wet, push candies in place for eyes and a candy smile (or you can simply draw a smile using a skewer)., Cover with chocolate frosting., Use a skewer to draw on arch-shaped shell imprints across the whole shell part of the cake. If wished, use the skewer to also add claw shapes to the turtle's feet., The turtle cake is now ready to join the party.

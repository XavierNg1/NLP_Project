 Baby acne is a common condition. Though they don’t know why it occurs, experts believe it is linked to the mother’s hormones. Usually, baby acne will go away on its own. This may take up to four or five months. A doctor will probably not recommend any treatment if your baby is under five months old and the case is not severe., Make sure that you keep your baby’s face clean. To do this, wash their face each day using warm water and a gentle baby soap. Don’t use harsh soaps or acne washes on your baby’s face if they have acne.Make sure you don’t scrub your baby’s face when you wash it.
When drying your baby’s face, make sure to pat dry very gently. Don’t rub your baby’s face.
 If the acne is bad or lasts much longer than four months, your pediatrician may prescribed a topical medication. The most common medication is a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion. Use this cream exactly as prescribed by your doctor.Before using this on your baby, you should put it on a small test area on the arm to see if your baby has a negative reaction over the next 24 hours before applying it all over your baby’s face.

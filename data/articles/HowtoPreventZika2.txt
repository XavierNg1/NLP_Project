 Even if you are inside, it is possible to be bitten by a mosquito that has entered your home. Try to prevent mosquitoes from getting into your home by using air-conditioning or window screens instead of just opening windows.


If you are travelling to a high-risk area, then try to stay in hotels that have air conditioning and/or screens on all of the windows.If possible, run an air-conditioner when the weather is warm instead of opening windows and running fans.
If you do not have an air-conditioner, then put up window screens on all of the windows in your home. Make sure that there are no holes or tears in the screens through which mosquitoes may enter.
 Inspect your mosquito net to make sure that it is free from holes or tears. Also, make sure that it touches the ground and goes all the way around your bed.


Some mosquito nets are even treated with permethrin, which offers even more protection from mosquitoes during the night.
 Mosquitoes breed and lay eggs in standing water, which can increase the mosquito population in your area and increase your chance of contracting Zika. Make sure that you remove any items that might collect water, such as buckets, old tires, or flower pots.Fill in small puddles with sand or dirt to eliminate this potential breeding ground as well.
 To prevent the Zika virus, you may want to consider postponing travel to areas where there are outbreaks. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to avoid high-risk areas due to the risks that the virus poses to unborn babies.Countries with recent outbreaks of Zika virus include:


Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, Barbados, Saint Martin, Haiti, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Samoa, and Cape Verde.

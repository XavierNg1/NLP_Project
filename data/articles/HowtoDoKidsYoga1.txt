 There are many forms of yoga and it can be easy to injure yourself. A yoga teacher can also help you to get into more advanced positions. Getting the right teacher who can serve as a positive role model can make a big difference in your yoga practice.Try to find a class that is kid friendly or ask someone who does yoga often to help you learn.;
, Yoga is not a race. It is about working with your body to relax and strengthen it. If you go too fast, then you may injure yourself.Remember to take deep, long breaths while you are doing yoga. If you notice that you are rushing or having a hard time focusing, then take a minute and just concentrate on your breathing.
If you feel pain or discomfort at any time, then stop and try modifying the pose so that it is less intense. For example, you can use a yoga brick if it is hard for you to reach the floor.
 Yoga is meant to be done every day of your life. Consistency helps you to develop a habit. Yoga gets easier with repetition over time. If you don't keep it up, you'll never see the benefits.


Try to do your yoga at about the same time every day. For example, you might want to do some yoga first thing in the morning, during recess, or right before you go to bed at night.
Keep in mind that it is also okay to do one long session or short ones throughout the day.
 There are some fun yoga videos online. These are meant for kids and may help you learn how to create a yoga practice. Take some time to search on the web for kidâ€™s yoga videos and follow along with one.


Feel free to pause the video or rewind parts if the pose is difficult or if you just want to be sure that you are doing it right.

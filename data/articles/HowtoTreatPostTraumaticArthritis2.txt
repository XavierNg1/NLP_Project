 One option to try is Acetaminophen (Tylenol). Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle, which is normally 500–1000mg every four to six hours as needed.


Another option is an NSAID such as Ibuprofen (Advil). Again, follow the dosing instructions on the bottle, which is normally 400–600mg every four to six hours as needed, with a total dose for 24 hours to be no more than 4000 mg., Ask your doctor to try a corticosteroid injection and see if it helps you. The improvement in pain will normally last for a few months, at which point you may need another injection. Having a few corticosteroid injections is okay, especially if you are finding them helpful with pain relief; however, if you find them minimally helpful and if it requires several to make a difference, your doctor will likely recommend another mode of treatment.


There is a limit to the number of cortisone injections given in one area, and the side effects include atrophy of the tissue, discoloration and infection., Injecting hyaluronic acid into the joint affected by post-traumatic arthritis can help to alleviate the pain as well as to lubricate and smooth out the motion of your joint. Speak to your doctor if you are interested in receiving this treatment.
 Surgery is generally reserved as a last resort; however, in many cases, it can be very successful at alleviating your pain.

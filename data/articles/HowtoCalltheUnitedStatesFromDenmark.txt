Although 00 is the exit code for Denmark and most of Europe, other countries may require different exit codes. For example the United States, Canada and all other countries in the North American Numbering Plan use 011 as an exit code.
If you're traveling to Denmark and using a roaming international calling plan on your mobile phone, you must still dial the Denmark exit code to place an international call while in Denmark--no matter what your country of origin.;

The country code stays the same no matter where you're calling from. You'd dial 1 to call the United States from anywhere in the world.



You can't place your call without the area code. If you don't know the area code, visit nanpa.com/area_code_maps/ac_map_static.html and click on the appropriate state to pull up a map of its area codes.
United States mobile phones are usually assigned a 3-digit area code according to the area in which service was first activated. But mobile phone users can choose to keep their mobile number, including area code, when they relocate. So a mobile phone's area code isn't always representative of where the user lives.
If the 3-digit "area code" is 800, 888, 877 or 866, this doesn't signal anything about the location of the phone you're calling. Instead, it signifies that you're calling a toll-free number which could be routed anywhere in the United States, or even to another country.



All United States phone numbers--mobile and fixed--total 10 digits: the 3-digit area code and 7 following digits. There are never any leading zeroes to drop from United States area codes.

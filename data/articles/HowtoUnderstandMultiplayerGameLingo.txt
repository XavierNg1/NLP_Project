 See if you can find anything that could prevent you from saying things. What age group is the game geared to? Young children, or older teenagers? This can define how heavily the chat is filtered. (Keep in mind: most games have common curse words, sexual talk, and drug/violence references automatically banned.);
, If you were having a conversation about videos, and the person mentions something like "U Cube," you can figure it out. "U Cube" = "YouTube"... because you can post videos on YouTube! (Many website names and links are banned, so people get creative- Google becomes Goggle, .com becomes Dot Cm, and so on.)

, If the person/avatar is dressed in a pink dress and looks pretty young and new, when they say "Fudge," they are probably talking about a chocolate dessert, fudge. But if they're old, punky, and rebellious-looking, you can bet they're cursing creatively.
 These kinds of people evade every corner of even the most innocent games with their vulgar and R-rated words. You can guess what sx, Shmexi, boo, etc. mean. Avoid these people!

, If someone says something that looks like a jumble of letters- try figuring it out with the context. Example: Someone is angrily yelling and then they scream, "DGAG!" Use your brains, and you'll figure out.. "I don't give a *darn*!" Usually, real-life scenarios and movies can help with this.
 ASK! Just ask the person, "What does that mean?" Odds are they'll tell you in a simpler way- or at least help you figure out the answer.

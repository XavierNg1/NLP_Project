 Turn your gas grill on to medium heat. If you have a charcoal grill, heat the coals and dump the coals in the center of the grate. Sprinkle the pork loin chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Squeeze juice from half a lime over the pork chops and brush them with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.While you can season the steaks with salt and pepper ahead of time, avoid squeezing the lime juice over them until right before you put them on the grill.
 Ensure that the grill's grate is clean and place your seasoned pork loin steaks on the grate. If you're using a charcoal grill, place them over direct heat (right above the coals). If your steaks are about 3/4" thick, cook them for 4 to 6 minutes.


If your steaks are thicker (around 1 1/2"), cook them longer. They'll need closer to 10 minutes for the first side.
 Use tongs to carefully turn over the steaks. Once you've flipped the steaks, let them finish cooking. Grill the 3/4" steaks for another 4 to 6 minutes or grill the 1 1/2" steaks for another 10 minutes. Check the steak temperature to see if they're between 145 degrees F (60 C) and 160 F (70 C). Let them rest for 5 minutes before you serve them.If you'd like to get decorative grill marks, consider turning the steaks at a about a 90 degree angle during the last few minutes of grilling. This will give your steaks cross-hatches.

 Have your child stand up straight against a wall. The ground should be flat and uncarpeted to get the most accurate reading. Make sure that your child’s heels are together and touching the wall.


If you have not done so already, remove your child’s shoes so that they do not affect your child’s height. You should also remove any hair ornaments or braids that could get in the way of the measurement.;
, You can use a hardcover book or a stiff ruler to do this. Position yourself so that your eyes are about level with the top of your child’s head. Gently press the flat object against the top of your child’s head, being sure that the object makes a right angle with the wall.
 Use a pencil to make a small mark on the wall where the underside of the flat object touches. Remove the book and then repeat the measurement. The marks should be no more than ¼ of an inch apart.


If you don’t want to mark up your walls, you can also tape a piece of paper to the wall and make a mark on that instead.
 Have you child hold the end of a tape measure on the floor level and measure up to the marks you made.


Make sure to hold the tape measure straight so that you are not measuring at an angle.
 Keep track of the measurement so that you can use it for comparison the next time you measure your child. Try to record the measurement to the closest 1/8 inch or 0.1 centimeter.


Take the average of the two marks that you made.

 A duet is when any two people sing and share a song together, They could be having a humorous time together, or more serious. Make sure that each have solo parts. Unless you try to freestyle harmonize, layer or echo lyrics, do not clash roles, trip up lines, or 'cross lanes'. That means that if you sing lower than your partner, remain there. The limit would be if you are both singing the same note. Stay consistent.;
, If you are not doing karaoke, and you do know the lyrics, you can lip-sync lyrics while not singing to make sure you can prompt your partner if he forget the words or for you to keep track of when to join in.
 The more you practice however, the less often you will need these actions.

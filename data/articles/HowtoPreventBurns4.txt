 Take breaks often in the shade or indoors, especially during the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., which is when the sunâ€™s rays are most intense. As a general rule, if your shadow is shorter than you are, it is time to seek shade., It is best to apply sunscreen 30 minutes before going out in the sun. Reapply the sunblock throughout the day, at least every 2 hours, and always adhere to the directions.You should be especially vigilant with children and young ones. You should not put sunblock on babies under 6 months old, but do discuss sun protection with your baby's doctor.
 Rash guards, t-shirts, or cover-ups can be worn to protect skin from the sun. Make sure that you, and your children, also wear hats and sunglasses to protect the face, eyes, ears, and neck from sunburns.

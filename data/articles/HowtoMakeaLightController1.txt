 In this example we'll use the CUSB 22-R.;
,

Find 3 wires inside, one green, one black, and one white.
Splice all three wires.
Hook up the green wire to the CuSB where its labeled "FG", which is frame ground.
,


Black and White wires do not have polarity, so you can put either or onto the CUSB labels, N and L.

Leave these wires unscrewed or loose for the moment.

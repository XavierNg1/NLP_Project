 Pounds are the U.S. standard unit for measuring mass or weight.Most standard scales in the U.S. will weigh you in pounds, including scales at your doctor’s office, and personal scales you can buy.

For example, you might weigh 165 pounds.
;
, One stone is equal to 14 pounds. So dividing pounds by 14 will give you your weight in stones. For example, 16514=11.79{\displaystyle {\frac {165}{14}}=11.79}. So, 165 pounds is about 12 stone. Specifically, it is 11 stone, 11 pounds, since 165 divided by 14 is 11, with a remainder of 11.
 To do this, you need to do the opposite of what you would do to convert pounds to stones. That means you need to multiply the number of stones by 14. If the weight is given in the number of stones and pounds, multiply the number of stones by 14, and add the pounds to the product. Otherwise, just multiply the whole number or decimal by 14.

For example, to convert 10 stone, 8 pounds, you would calculate:10×14+8{\displaystyle 10\times 14+8}=140+8{\displaystyle =140+8}=148{\displaystyle =148}So, 10 stone, 8 pounds is equal to 148 pounds.

 On game consoles, hold the right trigger or R2 button while facing a tree to turn it into wood. In Pocket Edition, hold your finger over the tree. You'll need at least three blocks of wood.
 All players start out with basic crafting ability. Here's how to access it:Xbox: Press X.
Playstation: Press Square.
Xperia Play: Press Select.
Other Pocket Edition: Tap the three dots to open your inventory, then tap Craft.
 Select the wooden planks recipe and turn all your wood into planks.


Console owners have the option to use the more advanced crafting system from the computer version of Minecraft. See the section above for instructions if using that system.
 Next, select the Crafting Table recipe to turn four planks into a crafting table. This gives you access to many more recipes.
 You'll need to place your crafting table in the world before it gives access to the expanded crafting menu.Consoles: Cycle through your quick slot with the D-pad or L1 buttons until you've selected the table. Place it with the left trigger or L2.
Pocket Edition: Tap on the crafting table in your quick slot, then tap on the ground to place it.
 Return to your crafting menu. You should now see a much larger list of options. Select the Sticks from the Materials tab. You will need two wooden planks.
 Now select the Wooden Pickaxe recipe from the Tools tab. As long as you have three planks and two sticks, the pickaxe will appear in your inventory.
 When you select the quick slot bar with the pickaxe in it, it should appear in your character's hands. With this equipped, you can break down stone into cobblestone and coal ore into coal. Don't try to break down more valuable ores without making a better pickaxe first, as described below.

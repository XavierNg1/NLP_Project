 Be aware that light bulbs are very fragile. Thus, you don’t want to just toss them haphazardly in your garbage can. If the bulb breaks, the shards can cut someone.


Wrap the old bulb in the new bulb’s package before throwing it away. You could also wrap the old bulb in a newspaper or old magazine.
Throw the bulb away in places that children can’t reach. Make sure to recycle the bulb if possible or required in your area.

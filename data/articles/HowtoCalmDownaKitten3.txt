 When you bring a new kitten into your home you should take the time to kitten-proof your home. Kittens are hyper and don’t yet understand what they can and cannot do. Preparing your home for an inevitable disaster will protect your belongings and help teach your kitten good behaviour.Remove breakable or delicate items from tables or lower-level shelves.
Tie up the strings attached to blinds and curtains.
Remove or change curtains that a kitten may be tempted to climb.
Rearrange furniture such that there are no spaces where a small kitten could get stuck behind or underneath things.
 When introducing your kitten to her new home, it is best to start by placing her in a small space, and then allowing her into more of the house as time goes on. A bedroom or a bathroom is a good place to start.As you introduce your kitten to new areas of your home, supervise her actions until she’s comfortable.
 If your kitten wakes up in the middle of the night and then tries to wake you up, the most important thing you need to remember is NOT to react. If your kitten wants to play, or wants something to eat, do not give in to her demands. Giving into your kittens demands will teach her it’s okay to wake you up to get what she wants.If night time disturbances are a problem, you may need to close your bedroom door and not allow your kitten inside your bedroom at night.

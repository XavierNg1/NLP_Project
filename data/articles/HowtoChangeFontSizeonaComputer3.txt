 You can do this by opening any folder or by selecting Finder from the Dock.
 You can click "View" → "Show View Options" or you can press ⌘ Command+J.
 This will apply to all Finder windows, but you'll need to re-apply the chan ge for each of the different Finder views that you use (Icon, List, Column, etc.).
 Even though you've increased the font size in Finder, this won't affect any sidebars. You can adjust the sidebar size separately:


Click the Apple menu and select "System Preferences."
Click the "General" button.
Use the "Sidebar icon size" menu to adjust the size of the sidebar. This will change both the icon size and the text size.
In iTunes, open the Preferences menu and select the "General" tab. Select "Use large text for list views."

, If you use the Messages app a lot, you can adjust the font size for it independently:


With Messages open, click the Messages menu and select "Preferences."
Select the "Messages" tab and then click "Set font" for either your sent messages or messages you receive. These settings will only affect how you view messages on your computer.

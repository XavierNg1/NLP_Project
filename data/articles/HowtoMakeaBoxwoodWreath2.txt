 You can find it in spray and garland form. How much you get will depend on the size of your grapevine wreath. Plan on using one garland or about four sprays of faux boxwood., Simply pull the stems off of the garland or the spray.If you'd like, you can sort them by size.
 Keep the sprig parallel to the wreath. Place a glob of glue just below the stem, and set the next sprig down. Keep doing this until the outermost edge is covered. Make sure that the sprigs are all pointing in the same direction and that they are overlapping.Your grapevine wreath can be any size. Keep in mind that the bigger the wreath, the more faux boxwood you'll need.
 Make sure that they are all going in the same direction and that they are overlapping. You do not want the bare part of the sprigs to be visible. Save the smaller sprigs for the inner ring. You do not have to cover the back of the wreath.
 Go over your wreath carefully and note any gaps. If you see any, fill them in with extra sprigs of faux boxwood. Once again, you do not need to cover the back.
 Go over your wreath, and pull off any strands left behind by the hot glue. This will give you a neater finish. Consider fluffing the boxwood out. This will give your wreath a fuller, more organic look., Cut a long piece of ribbon. Thread it through the center of your wreath. Tie both ends together into a knot or bow.
 Faux boxwood can last a very long time, but it is still delicate. Keep the wreath away from rain. The rain won't hurt the glue or the boxwood, but it may cause the grapevine to rot.

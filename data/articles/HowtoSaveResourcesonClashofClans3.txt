 If there is an unusually large amount of tombstones in an area, that means there were deactivated traps there. Other players have used up the traps, which means you can spawn your troops there without fear of traps. Another tip: If you can spawn troops inside of a village, be careful. They can place a spring trap there or a Giant Bomb, so place a single troop to activate it, then throw in everything.

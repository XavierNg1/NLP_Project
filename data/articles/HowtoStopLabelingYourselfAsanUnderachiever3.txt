 You can set yourself up for success, and zap feelings of underachievement, by setting realistic goals and breaking them down into achievable sub-goals. Setting goals is motivating, and fulfilling even small sub-goals can eradicate feelings of underachievement.Think about a specific goal you’d like to achieve. What could make you feel like you’re achieving your potential?
Break this goal down into 3 to 5 steps, or sub-goals. In a logical, step-by-step way, think about what needs to happen for this goal to be accomplished.
 Very often, poor organization and/or poor planning can lead to feelings of underachievement. Alongside breaking your goals down into smaller components, create due dates and deadlines for your goals and sub-goals, as well as an overall timeline for your goals.Find a planner that you enjoy using (digital or paper).
Determine an end-date or deadline for your goal (or goals). Is there a specific time when this needs to be complete?
Figure out due dates for each sub-goal. Consider how many actual hours it will take to accomplish each individual task.
Write down all due dates and deadlines for your goals and sub-goals.
Check in with your planner daily! Take small steps toward your goals every day.
 Another culprit that can sabotage your success and lead to feelings of underachievement is the habit of over-committing yourself. Particularly if you’re feeling like an underachiever, you may be compelled to take on more than you can handle! Learning to say no to some projects allows you to succeed in the ones most important to you.Before you take on a new project, return to your planner and review any existing due dates or deadlines.
Break the proposed project down into sub-goals with deadlines, keeping in mind how much actual time it will take to reach each of the sub-goals.
Without sacrificing sleep and other time you need for yourself or your family, ask yourself realistically, do you have the time to take on this new task?

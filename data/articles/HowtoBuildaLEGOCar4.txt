 The design in this part creates a “dragster”-style car that is very light and has a low, stable center of gravity. You can design your own car, but try to keep it lightweight and low to the ground.


For this design, you will need 2 rectangular axles, 4 tires of equal size, 4 2x8 bricks, 8 2x4 bricks, 2 1x2 bricks, and a thin plate at least 2x4 (but a longer plate is better). You will also need one small party balloon., Each row should be 2x16 now. Snap a 2x4 brick to the top of each row to connect the 2x8 bricks.
 Snap the thin plate to the bottom of both rows so that they are connected.


Attach the tires to the axles. Place an axle at each end of the car.
Turn the body over. You should now have a car body that is 4x16 with the two 2x4 bricks on top and wheels on the bottom.
 Snap this column to the back of your car body. Make sure the bricks are connected snugly, but don’t press too hard or you might break the car body.


Snap the 1x2 bricks to the top of the 2x4 column. Place one at each end to create a little hollow in the middle.
Attach the final 2x4 brick to the top of the column. You should have a small hole in the middle of the column near the top.
 In order to propel your car, you will want the body of the balloon to be placed over the body of your car. Slip the neck of the balloon through the hole, but don’t pull the balloon all the way through.
 You may find it easier to blow up the balloon if you pick up the car and hold it close to your face while you inflate it. When the balloon is inflated, pinch the neck with your fingers to keep the air in.
 Release the neck of the balloon. Your car should speed away from you as the air pushes out of the balloon!

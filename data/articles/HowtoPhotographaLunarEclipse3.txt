 This technique combines the star trail and wide angle technique by capturing multiple individual pictures and combining them into one photo. The details for the multiple exposure technique are different depending on what type of camera you use. Whichever camera you use must have an ability to shoot double or multiple exposure., A tripod is necessary because multiple exposures are being taken, which requires a smooth shot. Make sure to use a steady tripod or makeshift tripod., Like the star trail technique, this technique will capture the path of the moon. Make sure the camera will capture the full path of the moon during the eclipse.Calculate the positioning of the moon by determining where the moon is one or two nights before. A lunar eclipse that starts at 11 p.m. will be in the same position at 9:50 p.m. two nights before.
 A film camera captures multiple exposures on one frame on film. Your final photo upon development will have multiple exposures compressed into one picture., A digital camera captures multiple exposures and saves them as separate image files. To complete the photo, multiple photographs will have to be layered into one image in Photoshop., The first exposure needs to be taken when the lunar eclipse begins. From there, an exposure will need to be taken every five to ten minutes.Make sure to be consistent with your time intervals so that the eclipse will be documented evenly., The moonâ€™s brightness will change throughout the lunar eclipse. Because of this, the exposures will need to be changed for the duration of the eclipse.An initial ISO setting of 400 at f/8 would call for a shutter speed of 1/1000 second at the beginning of the eclipse. From there, the shutter speed would be 1/500, 1/250, 1/125 and 1/60 second.

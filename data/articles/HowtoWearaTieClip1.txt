 A metal tie clip in plain silver or gold is generally a safe, stylish choice. You may opt for a colored, textured, or embellished clip to add a little panache to your look. Consider how the clip could influence your outfit: a pattered clip can make a plain outfit more interesting, while a simple metal clip may tone down a busy-looking tie.Try to match the clip to the metal details of your outfitâ€”a watch, jacket buttons, cufflinks, belt buckle.If you don't have any metal to match (maybe you are skipping the jacket, so no buttons or cufflinks), go with silver. It compliments just about every outfit and complexion.Keep the occasion in mind as well. A loud tie clip probably isn't appropriate for a sombre event like a funeral.
Tie clips should not be worn with a vest, waistcoat, or buttoned cardigan. These items of clothing already hold your tie in place, making a clip redundant.;
, A pinch clasp will ensure everything stays securely in place, but may cause a skinny or lightweight tie to wrinkle, and it may not lie flat against your shirt.Instead, opt for a slide clasp to keep your skinny tie smooth and flat. With wider and heavier ties, a pinch clasp will work best., Never wear a tie clip that is longer than the width of your tie. It's considered a major fashion faux pas.This is one of the only real "rules" when it comes to accessorizing with a tie clip.


A traditional tie is about 3-3 1/2 inches at its widest point. Look for a tie clip that is about 1 3/4 inches long.A classic skinny tie is usually between 2-2 1/2 inches wide. Your tie clip should be between 1 1/2 -1 3/4 inches.Super skinny ties are between 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 inches wide. Choose a clip no longer than 1 1/4 inches long.Try holding the clip against your tie where it falls at the third or fourth button of your shirt. If it looks too long, you'll need a different clip.For a retro look, you can get away with a tie clip that is the exact width of your tie, but no longer.

 Are you disorganized in the morning? Do you tend to want to talk one more minute with friends in the morning before school? Do you underestimate how long it takes to come to school? If you can figure out where you're going wrong, you can fix it.;
, Go to bed on time. Most children, teens and young adults need at least 8-10 hours sleep; if you don't get enough, it will be difficult to be alert in the morning. Get an alarm clock.
 Figure out what you need, and have a place for everything. Know where everything is. You won't waste time searching for your homework if you always put it your backpack when you are done.
 What takes 15 minutes the night before can save you a lot of time in the morning. Pick out your clothes. Make sure that you have everything you need for the day in your backpack/bag.
 How long does it typically take you to get prepared, and/or travel to school? Just because it once took you 10 minutes to get ready for school one time, doesn't mean that's how long it usually really takes. Over a week, time how long it takes to get ready for school, or bike to class, or whatever. This will give you a more realistic time frame.
 If you have classmates who tend to make you late, wait until later in the day to socialize with them. Classmates who arrive on time can be a reminder that you need to get going to class.
 Not until free period, lunch, or the end of school, anyway. If your friends ask, then tell them that you can't afford to get anymore tardies. If they are your real friends, they should understand.

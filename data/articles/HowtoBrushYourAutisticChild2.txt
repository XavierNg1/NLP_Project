 Run the brush over your arms and observe how it feels, so you can describe it to your child.
 Explain that it feels nice, and how it will help them calm down. Hand them the brush and let them touch it and try rubbing it on their own arms (if they want to try). Then offer to brush them.
 If you watch them carefully, you will start to see when they begin to have difficulty processing all of the sensory stimulation going on around them. If you can see sensory overload starting, you can likely stop tears, opposition issues, and meltdowns before they start.
 Brushes can help children deal with transitions and schedule times (e.g. before school, airplane trips, bedtime, a birthday party).


Have brushes in multiple locations, so you won't need to search long for a brush.
Keep one in your bag or purse. This way, you can duck out to a public restroom, spot outdoors, or other quiet place to brush your child if they become upset. (Choose the quietest place you can, preferably in a corner or by a wall.)
Ask if they would like to keep one in their backpack at school.
The brush may become a comfort object for a child, and simply letting them hold the brush could help them calm down.
 Chat about your day, and ask them questions about theirs. If they are nonverbal, you can still tell them all about your day, just like you would with a friend. If your child associates brushing with relaxation and fun, brushing sessions will calm them even more.

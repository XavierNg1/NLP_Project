 Open the App Store on your iPhone. You can do this by directly selecting the App Store icon on your phone.


This icon is blue and contains an image of a ruler, paintbrush, and pencil forming the shape of the letter “A” within a white circle.
Another way of finding this app is to swipe downward on any screen to reveal a drop-down search query. Using this query, you can search for any app on your iPad.
 Once you have opened the App Store, you can search for the app that you’d like to gift to a friend. This can be done by typing in the name of the app in the search box in the top righthand corner of the screen.
 Once you choose an app to gift, click on the title of the app. This will bring up a pop-up screen. On this screen, in the top righthand corner, is an icon of a square with an arrow pointing upward; this is the share icon.
 Selecting the icon in the top righthand corner will give you a number of choices for sharing the app. One of the options is “Gift.”

,, At this point, you may or may not be prompted to sign into your iTunes account. This depends on if you have already logged in during your current session. If not, you will be asked to log in the same way as when you’re purchasing an app.
 After logging into your iTunes account, you will now have to fill out some information for sending your gift. Here you’ll be required to provide the email address of the recipient, and you may choose to write a note to accompany the gift.


Caution: The recipient’s email address should be the same as their iTunes login address. As such, you should inquire as to their appropriate email address before beginning this process.
 When you click “Next” at the bottom of the screen, you will be asked to confirm your gift. After confirming, your gift, message, and a link will be sent to the recipient’s email along with instructions on downloading their gifted app.

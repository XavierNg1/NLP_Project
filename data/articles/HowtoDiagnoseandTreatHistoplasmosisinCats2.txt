 Your vet will have to perform a variety of tests to distinguish between histoplasmosis and other conditions. These tests might include a chemical blood profile, a blood count, or a urinalysis. They will have to do this to determine the proper treatment – and intensity of treatment – for your cat., If your cat hasn’t had Histoplasmosis for long, or has not suffered overly severe effects, your vet will probably recommend medication and outpatient care. This medication will usually take the form of anti-fungal drugs like fluconazole or itraconazole, which you will give to your cat orally.Be sure to follow the specific directions for the drugs your vet prescribes your cat.
This medication may be need to be administered for up to six months.
 Your cat may need inpatient care for histoplasmosis. This is most likely if your cat has become dehydrated or malnourished as a result of their illness. Your vet can tell you if this is the case and how long that care will last.

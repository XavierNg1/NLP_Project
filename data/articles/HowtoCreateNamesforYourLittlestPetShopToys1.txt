 What colour are they? What kind of things do they like? Write these things down along with your pet's species.;
, For example, if you have an orange LPS, you could get fire from orange and from fire you can get Blaze, Flame, Spark, Ash, Cinder. If you're stuck with this type of thing, consider the other options.
 Colours are really helpful in a naming situation. If your pet has blue eyes, you could look up some shades of blue. If you find a nice sounding name for a shade of the colour of your choosing, you could give it to your LPS as their name.Â Google some other shades of colours.


Some shades of blue are- Azure, Ocean Blue, Sky Blue and Cyan.
Some shades of purple are- Violet, Indigo, Grape and Lilac.
 I have named my pink horse Lotus. Think of your pets personality- if it were snappy, you wouldn't call it Petal, would you? It would more likely be Thorn or Thistle than Petal. Don't know any plants or flowers? Search some up or go outside.
 You could use objects such as a piano or cushion or a book to help give you inspiration for pet names, but don't use anything silly like a toilet or a fish tank (well, maybe if it's a fish or something).

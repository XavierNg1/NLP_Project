 The circuit breaker is a metal box often located in your basement, hallway, or storage room.

Make sure the floor and your hands are dry before touching the circuit breaker panel. This will help you avoid electric shock.;
,

Do not touch or attempt to fix the circuit breaker yourself if you see bare wires or signs of burning upon opening the circuit breaker panel. Instead, skip to step #7 and contact a professional electrician for further assistance., If this resolves the problem and the breaker stays on, the circuit breaker is in good working condition.

Proceed with the following steps if the circuit breaker trips and returns to the “Off” position.
 Most breakers are labeled accordingly, and will tell you which circuit is being controlled by the breaker. For example, a breaker labeled “kitchen” controls the circuits and electricity for all major appliances in your kitchen., This helps identify whether the problem is due to an overloaded circuit, which is when a circuit has more amps flowing through it than it can support. For example, if the circuit is for your living room, unplug all lamps, television components, computers, and any other appliances plugged into living room outlets.,, If the circuit breaker is in good working condition, you will hear a loud, definite “click.” If the switch trips immediately, emits a burning smell, or flops back and forth easily without clicking, it’s possible the circuit breaker is faulty.If the circuit breaker works for a few minutes or hours, then trips again later on, the circuit may be overloaded. If this happens, move electrical components from the faulty circuit to another circuit to distribute electricity more effectively.
 A professional electrician will take the necessary precautions to fix the circuit breaker and any wiring problems in your home.

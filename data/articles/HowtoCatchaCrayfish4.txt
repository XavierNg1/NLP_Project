 It's unethical to catch and kill a crayfish that is breeding. This can diminish the population. Make sure you throwback any breeding females you catch.


Crayfish hold larvae under their tails. A crayfish with a large tail may be a breeding female and should be thrown back into the water.If you're uncertain if you have a male or female, look at the crayfish's front claws. Larger front claws are indicative of a male crayfish., Some states may require a license to catch crayfish. You should double check your state's regulations before catching crayfish. You should be able to find this information on your state's Department of Natural Resources website. If you're having trouble finding the answer, try calling a DNR office during office hours to ask for clarification.
 Crayfish do claw and bite when frightened. You can minimize your risk of injury by wearing gloves.In the event you are nipped by a crayfish, wash the wound in water and soap. Then, seek medical care to make sure you do not need further treatment. While many crayfish bites can be treated at home, it's a good idea to be safe and have it looked at by a doctor.

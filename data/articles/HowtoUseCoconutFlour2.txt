 Coconut flour works well as a binder in recipes where you'd normally use ingredients like cracker or bread crumbs, such as meatloaf. However, you will need to double the liquid in the recipe because the coconut flour will absorb so much of it., Some people have good luck using it to thicken sauces, while others do not.In fact, some cooks recommend not trying it at all.However, you should experiment and see what works for you. You may find it works well as a thickener for your purposes. Don't forget that coconut flour will absorb more liquid than wheat flour, though, so only try a little bit at a time.
 If you want to make coconut chicken or shrimp, coconut flour makes a good base. Simply dip the meat into an egg wash first (whisked egg), then dip it into the coconut flour. You can also season it with salt and pepper. Next, dip it back into the egg, then roll it in coconut flakes. Finally, fry the meat as normal in oil.

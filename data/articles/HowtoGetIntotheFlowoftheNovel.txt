 You can't get a lot of writing done if you're too tired to stay at your computer. You don't want to be forced to take a break while you're still in the flow of your novel.;
,


For most people this means writing in the morning. If that's not possible try meditating, going for a walk or doing some other contemplative activity.
It may help to make sure your home is relatively clean before you start, so you won't be bothered by the fact that you need to do laundry or wash dishes.
 Every time you stop to answer an email, pick up the phone or check your Facebook status, you take yourself out of the flow. If you can't eliminate distractions in your home, take your laptop to a library and work there. Some writers even create short "writing retreats" during which they leave home for several days in order to write.
 Most writers are tempted to write a few sentences then go back and rewrite them, taking themselves out of the flow. Do your editing at another time, never during your writing time.
 Conduct research, work out your plot details and make sure you have all the supplies you need, including something to eat. If you have to stop to look something up or run to the store, it's doubtful that you will be able to continue writing afterward.
 Don't give yourself any time to reflect on what you're doing, ask yourself if you're getting anywhere or wonder what you're missing while you're writing. Write as if you have a deadline to meet and you're thousands of words behind. Also, don't stop to consider word choice. For the first draft, always assume the first word is the right word. You can go back and punch up the text later - your goal here is to get as much of your ideas out onto the page as possible.
 Decide which days and times you will get into the flow of your novel. Over time, it will take less effort to achieve flow and you'll be writing more than you ever thought you could.

 Write them down.;
, They probably don't want you to go and they might help for arguments.
, If you're being unreasonable, your parents are never going to listen to you.
 If the move has something to do with the schools or something of the sort, prove to them that it's a safe, fun environment to learn in. They'll see for themselves.
 If the move is voluntary, swear that you'll do all your chores and homework and schoolwork from then on if they don't move. Promises of their child's good behavior might convince them.
 If you're at their ankles, whining and pleading, they won't listen. Always be calm and rational.
 This doesn't mean throwing a fit because it's "not fair!" Have a talk with your parents and tell them how you feel. If that doesn't work, subtly be a little upset in day-to-day life. For example, writing in your journal that you really don't want to move and leaving it out, or just acting a little sad around the house. If your parents can pick up on it, they will feel bad.
 It's really not the end of the world. If you automatically think it's going to be terrible, you'll never grow to like your new house.
 For example, ask your parents if you can visit your friends over Christmas break if you get all straight A's.
 Write to them, telling them about your new life and ask them to write about themselves as well. You'll both feel like you never left.
 You won't be disloyal if you do. It's not going to help anything if you're stuck in the past. Not to mention, you'll grow so attached to your old friends that no one at your new school is going to want to be friends with you.

 Prawns hatch in shallow coastal waters. They also tend to stay in large, shallow bodies of water with tide pools or bays. Fish in these waters instead of deep bodies of water.;
, Veterans always fish for prawns when the tide runs out. This is because prawns will naturally come up toward the surface of the water as it becomes shallower.This makes it easy to skim them out of the water with a hand-held net or with a two-person trawler net.
 Plant material makes up a good part of a prawn’s diet.If you see a tide pool with green seaweed, you’ll have a better chance of finding a prawn eating and hiding in it. However, you should be prepared for a lot of hunching over. Prawns tend to hide in awkward spots.
 July to September is the best time for prawning. This is when the water reaches its warmest temperatures.It is also when many species of prawn have completed the mating season and are more likely to be closer to the shore., Many species of prawns are sensitive to light, so fishing at night is one of the best ways to fish for them. Try to plan fishing trips on evenings when the moon is full. This will maximize the light reflected on the water's surface.


Use a flashlight to help you see the prawns’ eyes. Shine it in an arc over the surface of the water.

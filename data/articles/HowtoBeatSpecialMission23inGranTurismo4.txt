 The challenge needs advanced slipstreaming technique. You start with the lead car roughly 13 seconds ahead, with the remaining 4 cars bunched up in a pack about 10 seconds behind the leader.;
, When you start, you veer ever so slightly to the left, so correct this ASAP. Catch up to the pack, and take the lead round the first corner by going round the inside. Then go to the outside of the track until the corner ends. Wait to be slip streamed, gain speed one of 2 ways (Bump, or slipstreaming the opposition again), and go round the corner to the outside. Repeat until the end of the race.
 You just won 10,000 credits, 250 A-Spec points, and possibly a Pagani Zonda Race Car (provided you finished the other slipstream challenges).

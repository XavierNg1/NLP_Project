 Brushing your dog several times a week can help cut down on the amount of hair they shed throughout your house. Brush them daily, if possible, with a brush that is recommended for their type of coat.Whenever possible, brush your dog outside to keep loose hairs from your grooming session off your carpet and furniture., Unless your dog has gotten into something smelly, it usually only needs to be given a bath once every two to four months. Use your judgment in figuring out when a bath is necessary—does your dog smell or look dirty? Has it been spending an extra amount of time outside or rolling on the ground a lot lately? How often it needs bathed will vary from dog to dog.


Use only a shampoo formulated especially for dogs. Human shampoos can be too harsh and mess up the pH balance of your dog’s skin.Keep a dry shampoo on-hand to use in between baths. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation on a good dry dog shampoo., Do your best to prevent your dog from getting into especially smelly situations when you can. For example, if you notice a particularly muddy portion of trail on your walk, take your dog out and around it. Also, try to keep it away from anything smelly it might roll in, like dead animals or other animal waste. Preventing odors on your dog before they happen can reduce the amount of clean up you have to do later.


Remember that dogs will be dogs and you won’t be able to prevent your dog from getting messy once in a while. Do what you can to keep it clean, but don’t keep your dog from following their natural instincts.

 If you have forgotten never fear; you can buy ready-made cakes in a store.;
, If you have kids get them to write out a list for you. That way you know what they most desire. You do not have to buy everything on their list; just get a few of the items and the rest is up to you. Also a good tip for Christmas shopping if you have children is to leave them with a trusted adult. If you do this make sure you tell the adult what they are to eat in case of any allergies.
 Most parents buy nothing but toys for their children, and by Boxing Day the kids want something else, so make sure you buy them things such as clothes, vests, socks, handkerchiefs, pajamas, combs etc.
 To prevent this, wrap their gifts, lock them in a secure cupboard and make sure the key(s) are always with you.
 Also keep your receipts so in such a case you can replace the damaged item. If the toy needs to be assembled then as to avoid the hassle on Christmas day and the possible injury of your children due to them fiddling with dangerous tools, assemble them before they get wrapped.
 There is nothing worse than receiving a present that you badly wanted and then discovering that you can't use it because you have run out of batteries.
 Also buy each of your kids a set of decorations and tell them that they are theirs to put on the tree wherever they want. This will make them feel special and included.
 So on Christmas Eve arrange some relaxing activities for the kids to do all day while you prepare for the busy day ahead.
 Instead have some healthy water, juice and fruit snacks laid out on a table for them so that you won't have to get any snacks for them which means interruption.
, Christmas is after all the most wonderful time of the year!

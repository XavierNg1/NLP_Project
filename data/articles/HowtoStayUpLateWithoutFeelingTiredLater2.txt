 Make the most of your limited sleep after staying up late by blocking out LEDs and standby lights from your electronics, which may diminish your quality of sleep. Cover lights on your laptop, modem, and other gadgets by putting masking tape over them, or by placing other things in front of them (e.g. a large book). Alternatively, wear a sleep mask to block out all distracting light., For the best sleep that you can get, adjust the temperature of your bedroom to 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 15-20 degrees Celsius). A room that is warmer than this can cause insomnia, which will leave you feeling depleted after an already late night. If you are uncomfortable in the cooler temperature, dress warmly for bed or bring a heating pad or hot water bottle to sleep with you., Improve your chances for a great sleep by removing distractions. Turn your phone on silent and turn off notifications and alerts to prevent them from distracting you. Make sure that your TV, radio, and other entertainment media are turned off.If outside noises or other sounds distract you, try playing soft, ambient music in the background or purchase a white noise generating app for your phone.

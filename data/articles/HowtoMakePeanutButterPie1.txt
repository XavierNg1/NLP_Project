 An easy way to do this is to simply pulse them in a food processor. You can also add the Oreos (or your preferred chocolate sandwich cookies) to a sturdy plastic bag, then smash them with a rolling pin or the bottom of a pan. Don't remove the white filling from the cookies before you crush them — the recipe accounts for it.


As noted above, you'll want to preheat the oven to 350 degrees F for this recipe.
You want the crumbs to be quite fine for this recipe.No noticeable chunks of solid cookie should remain.
If you're making a graham cracker crust, just pulse the graham crackers and sugar together to make fine crumbs. The rest of the recipe is the same.;
, Butter helps the crumbs stick together while also giving the crust a richer taste and a more satisfying texture. Melt the butter in a separate bowl in the microwave, then pour it over the crumbs and stir with a fork to combine.


If the crust isn't sticking to itself after mixing, feel free to melt more butter and add it in one tablespoon increments. You may need to do this if you used extra cookies.
 Spoon the crumb mixture into the center of a greased pie pan. Spread it around the bottom and sides of the pan. Use the edge of a measuring cup or glass to press the crust into the pan, spreading it evenly.
 Set the crust (without any filling) in the oven for about 5-7 minutes. After, take the crust out and check for firm, "done" texture.
 This is important — the crust should be room temperature before you add the filling. If it's not, it can affect the texture of the filling. If you need, you can let it cool in the fridge to speed the process up.


When the crust is cool, you can add the filling and proceed as normal, following the instructions above.

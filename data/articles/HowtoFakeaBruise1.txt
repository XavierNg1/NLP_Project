 A dark color of eyeshadow on your skin can look like a very realistic bruise, as if you were just given a nasty bump. See if you can swipe a parent's makeup pallet, or ask permission.


If you want it to look really real, try a combination of dark blue, dark purple and even black to make it look just right.
The makeup should be matte, not sparkly. If your bruise sparkles, it won't look real.;
, Wet the brush very lightly, and color the brush with a thin layer of eyeshadow.
 It's important to go slow and light on the makeup at first. You can always add more. Work the makeup into your skin in a circle, blending it as you go.


Smaller fake bruises usually look better. Go for a bruise about the size of two coins.
Use the brush on the edges of the bruise to smear out the makeup a little and make the bruise look realistic. Don't go too heavy, or it'll look fake.
 Depending on what kind of story you want to use to explain your fake bruise, you might want to add some extra details to the bruise to get it to look real. You can add little cuts, scrapes or extra coloration to the bruise.


Try rubbing some red blush around the edges for a raw, reddish look after you've achieved the level of darkness you want. This will look like you grazed yourself against something rough.
Add a little yellow around the outside if you want it to look like an old bruise.
Cuts are usually harder to pull off. Use a fine-tip red pen if you want to try.

 Tourette Syndrome has been portrayed as a rare disease, but the fact is that 200,000 Americans have the most severe form of TS, and one in 100 show milder forms.;
, A formal diagnosis is given after verifying that the patient has had both motor and vocal tics for at least 1 year.
 If you have a mild form of Tourette Syndrome, you probably won't need any medication, since tics don't typically cause impairment. If the tics do affect your daily life, there are medications available, such as Neuroleptics, used for tic suppression.



TS is sometimes linked to other conditions, such as ADHD or OCD. If this is your case, consult with your doctor on which medications you should take to lessen the effects. There are no universal medication for Tourette Syndrome, so you'll have to discuss with your doctor which option is the best fit for you.
 Psychotherapy is highly recommended. Tourette Syndrome is not caused by psychological problems, but it make result on these due to the social and emotional problems that it might cause.
 You might have special needs when studying, such as untimed tests or oral examinations. Speak to your teachers about it, as a tolerant feedback will highly reduce the stress that coping with TS may carry.

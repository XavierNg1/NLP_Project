 Make sure the pots have drainage holes in the bottom and that they have a diameter of at least 8” (<<). Your herbs can become root bound if you plant them in too small a container. Choose lightweight pots because you may have to move them around occasionally. It’s also safer to use lightweight pots if you plan to use some of them in hanging baskets.;
, You can also place a medium-sized empty plastic pot upside down in the center of a large pot. “Filling” your pot partway will reduce the amount of soil you need. Too much soil will cause your herbs to spend their energy on developing a root system instead of producing leaves.
 Using dirt from your garden may introduce pests into your home and the pests might destroy your herbs, and garden soil is usually quite dense and won’t drain well.
 The soil in potted plants dries out quickly; depleting the nutrients, so mixing in organic fertilizer will help keep your herbs healthy.

Follow the seed package directions to make sure you have the right depth and spacing for each type of herb seed.
For transplants, make a hole deep enough to contain the roots of the herb.






Place the plant in the hole and firmly tamp down the soil around it.
 Make sure each pot sits in a tray or shallow bowl so that the drainage water doesn’t damage anything.
 Sunlight is the magic ingredient that helps herbs manufacture their essential oils. If your herbs don’t get enough sunlight, you must supplement the natural light with grow lights or fluorescent lamps.

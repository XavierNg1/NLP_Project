 Place two rubber bands around an aerosol can.


You can use a can of Axe, hairspray, whatever.
 Place the wall bracket (that should already be bent into a 90-degree angle) under the rubber bands so it's held onto the can somewhat securely.
 Break off a bit of that plasti-tak and put it on the bottom of the candle (you can also use a lighter).


Alternatively, you can use chewing gum.
 Attach the candle to the wall bracket using the plasti-tak or other sticky substance.
 Line up the candle wick with the sprayer tip on the aerosol can.
 Be careful.
 Don't spray towards anything flammable. Be careful.

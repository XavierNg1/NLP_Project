Put the string through the bridge. You want it going from the inside to outside. You will probably need 4-5 inches (10-12.5cm) of string through the bridge.






Loop the string around once. You want it going under the other half of the string.






Tuck it under the loop once.






Hold the string down against the soundboard. This is important because if you do not hold the string down, it will be sticking up. This will make it loose and it will probably come undone.






Tighten it up. Do this by pulling the string from both sides.You want it as tight as you can get it.






Repeat with the 5th and 4th strings. The 6th, 5th and 4th strings are done in the exact same way, but the last three strings are done slightly different. It's mostly the same but you wind it around a few more times.

Loop the string around once. You want it going under the other half of the string.






Tuck it under the loop three times. This makes the string tighter and more secure, which means it's less likely to come loose.






Tighten it up. Do this by pulling the string from both sides.






Repeat with the 2nd and 1st strings.

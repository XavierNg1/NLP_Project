 You can buy one from a store, or you can make some space on your bathroom counter. Look for something with drawers to store away items you don't use often or items that need to be kept out of light. Some products, such as anti-aging creams, deteriorate when they come in contact with sunlight.Old desks make great bases for vanities!
Thrift shops and garage sales are great places to piece up vanities at decent prices. Don't worry about the color; you can always repaint it!
Can't find anything? Get two sets of drawers that are the same height, and place them 2 to 3 feet (60.96 to 91.44 centimeters) apart. Place a matching tabletop over them and secure with industrial-strength glue.;
, If you bought a piece of furniture at a thrift shop of garage sale, it might need a fresh coat of paint. You can repaint an old vanity using interior paint or spray paint following these easy steps:Take the vanity apart and take the pieces outside or into a well-ventilated area.
Lightly sand the vanity down and wipe the dust off with a damp cloth.
Apply a coat of primer and wait for it to dry.
Apply 2 to 3 coats of paint. Wait at least 20 minutes before applying each coat.
Take the pieces back inside and re-assemble the vanity. Add new knobs, if desired.
 You can use glass, Plexiglas/acrylic, or even mirror.Make sure that it is the right size for your table, or have a framing shop trim it down for you.
 A simple, cushioned stool would be ideal, but an upholstered chair or stool will be the most luxurious.You can also use a simple chair if you don't care for fancy tings. If the chair does not have a cushion, but you want it to be more comfortable, you can always buy a small cushion for it.


When buying an upholstered chair or stool, choose one that matches your decor.

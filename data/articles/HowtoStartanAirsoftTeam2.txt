Squads should be composed of snipers, support, assault and squad leaders. Depending on the size of the team, the team leader may or may not function as a squad leader.

If a leader of a fire team, squad, or platoon needs his unit to use a tactic like flanking or leapfrogging, it is much easier. He can simply tell Team A to do X while Team B does Y. This eliminates the need to designate specific people each time tactics are used, which would take up valuable time.

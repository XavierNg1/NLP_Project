 One way a tweet that somebody else has written may end up on your profile is if you manually re-post their tweets. This happens when you copy and paste a tweet from another user into a tweet of your own and then post the tweet. These are technically not retweets and the process of removing them is the same as it would be for a regular tweet, so what follows is an explanation of how to delete tweets from your Twitter profile.
 The way you find your profile depends on whether you're using Twitter on your computer or on your phone:


On the mobile app, do this by tapping the avatar at the bottom-right corner of your screen that says "Me".
On a web browser, click on the picture of your avatar at the top-right corner of your screen. Click on the name of your Twitter handle as it appears in the drop down menu.
 Scroll through your profile to see the full history of your tweets, until you come across the tweet you would like to delete.


If you remember what the tweet said, you can type keywords from the tweet into the search bar at the top-right corner of your screen to search for a specific tweet (although this method will give you results from other users, too).
 A list of options will appear.
 The tweet will be removed from your profile!

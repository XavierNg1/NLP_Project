 The oval will be the base of L.S.P's body. Make the oval going up and down, but make be fairly wide. The size varies depending on how large you want L.S.P to be. When deciding the size, think of the size of your canvas, and any other details you will add to make it all fit.;
, L.S.P is known to have 2 lumps on her left and right, and one lump on the top of her head. To add lumps, simply draw even circles that are split in half by the outline of the oval you made earlier. Again, the size of the circles depend on how large she is going to be. If you need help deciding the size of the circles, compare a picture of L.S.P to your drawing.
 L.S.P has a very simple face. She has two black dots for eyes, and she usually has a frowning face, as she is a teenage girl. For the eyes, again get a picture of L.S.P and compare it to your picture. The picture of her should tell you how far apart the eyes should be. The mouth should be fairly close to the eyes. To make the mouth, make a small curve with a similar shape to the curve on your finger pointing downwards, and add a small, slightly curved line on the right of L.S.P's mouth to add a touch of detail.
 L.S.P has a small, yellow star located at the top of her head, just above the middle of her eyes. To draw the star, try making five triangles connected by a pentagon in the center. Once you have made even corners, erase the details in the center.
 Go back over your drawing and look for any unwanted details. Remember to erase the inner half of the circles you made to add L.S.P's lumps, and the line that split the circles in half.
 This step is optional. To color L.S.P in, use a lavender or light purple colored pencil to shade in L.S.P's body. The use a bright yellow to fill in the star.
 You should have now, drawn your own L.S.P. Enjoy!

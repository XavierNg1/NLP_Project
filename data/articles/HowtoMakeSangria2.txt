 There is really only one rule when choosing fruits for sangria -- you want one citrus and one non-citrus. Apple and oranges are the classic combination, but far from the only one. Try out:


Peaches
Plums
Pineapples
Strawberries.
Blackberries
Blueberries

, White wine makes incredibly refreshing sangria, especially when paired with a nice bubbly finish. In place of brandy, use a light liquor (apple, lemon, peach schnapps, vermouth.). That said, white wines tend to do better with different fruits than those used for red sangria. Try out:Apples
Lemons and Limes
Peaches
Grapefruit
Fresh mint
Raspberries
Pears
Strawberries
Kiwis, Sangria is not supposed to be complicated or set in stone. Knowing this, chefs and bartenders across the world are considering new bases for their drinks, including:



Ros√©: The bubbly pink drink mixes well with fruit and delivers all the bubbles right off the top. Be careful not to let it go flat before serving, however.

Cava: Again, the bubbles are key, but this light and refreshing wine goes great, in particular, with blood oranges.
 The addition of brandy traditionally complements a red sangria lightly, but it is not the only liquor that can pull it off. You want to choose a drink that has natural notes of fruit, or a light floral scent to it. Don't try something strong that will distract from the refreshing fruit notes. You could think about:


Suze
Cointreau
St. Germain
Schnapps
Triple Sec, Instead of chopping all of the fruit, juice oranges, lime and lemon in a small saucepan; add 2-3 tablespoons caster sugar, a pinch of nutmeg, and a ground cinnamon stick and heat just until is steams, removing immediately and letting it cool before adding the wine.


Heat liquid (whilst stirring) until steam rises from surface - do not simmer.
You place the pot in a larger pot filled with cool water in order to cool the juice faster.

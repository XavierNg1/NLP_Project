 This method only works on desktop computers. Make sure that the computer is turned off. Remove the case from your computer so that you can access the motherboard. Unplug power cable from the back of the computer so that no power is reaching the desktop.


Be sure that you ground yourself before touching anything inside your computer, otherwise you might short a component.
 The CMOS battery is round and silver, much like a watch battery. Carefully remove it from its housing. Wait for 5-10 minutes so that all of the power stored in the capacitors on the motherboard can discharge.


You can bypass the wait time by moving the CLR_CMOS jumper to the 'clear' position while the battery is removed. If you do this, it will automatically discharge the capacitor that is storing backup power to the CMOS chip.
 All of the BIOS settings will be reset the next time that you turn the computer on. You will need to reset the time and date in the BIOS setup menu.

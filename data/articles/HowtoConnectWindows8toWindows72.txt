 In order to share folders, you'll need to enable sharing on the system level.
 If you are using Category view, select "Network and Internet" and then click "Network and Sharing Center".
 This is located on the left side of the Network and Sharing Center.
 This is the profile for your Home network.
 This will enable the computer to share folders with other computers on the network. Click the Save changes button.
 Once you have turned on file sharing, find the folder that you want to share with the other computers.
 Click the Sharing tab.
 Select "Everyone" from the drop-down menu and click Add. If you want other users to be able to write to the folder instead of just read from it, click the arrow next to "Read" and select "Read/Write". Click Share to save your changes and allow Windows to index the folder.


If the Share... button is grayed out, then you are trying to share a protected folder. Instead, click Advanced Sharing..., check the "Share this folder" box, and then click the Permissions button. You can check the boxes if you want the other connected computers to be able to write to documents or make changes to the folder.
 Ensure that the second computer is connected to the same network and open Windows Explorer. The shared folders can be found in the Network tree in the left navigation frame.
 Each folder will need to be shared individually.

 Take the time to groom your cat and look over the state of its body while you do. This gives you the chance to look for injuries, infections, and pests. It also allows you to identify areas that are sunburned and need some care, which can be given by applying a thin layer of aloe vera to the burns.Your cat's paws can get damaged from walking on hot concrete all day. Look at its pads and make sure they are in good shape. If they look damaged, you should take your cat to the vet so the damage can be treated.
Cats are usually more active outside during the summer and this means that they interact with other animals more during that time of year. This interaction can lead to fights and injuries. Checking over your cat's body can allow you to spot injuries that, without treatment, could become infected and turn into abscesses.
 If your cat is not properly hydrated and has been exposed to high temperatures, it can get heat stroke very quickly. Signs that your cat has heat stroke include:Panting
Drooling
Red tongue or gums
Weakness
Vomiting

, If your cat appears to be having extreme symptoms of heat stroke you should take it to a veterinarian quickly. You should be concerned and take your cat in if it is panting a lot, its gums have turned red, and it appears weak or disoriented.

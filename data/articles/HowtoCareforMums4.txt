 If you don't have an area that gets a full 8 hours of sunlight everyday, put them in a place where the mums will get at least 5 hours.If you have an option to choose between morning or afternoon sun, opt for morning sun.
 Mums don’t do well with ‘wet feet’ so try to avoid soil that retains a lot of water.For in-ground planting, choose an area of the yard that doesn't accumulate too much water.
 Placing them against walls or other structures, or placing them too close to other mum plants could hamper their growth or cause root competition. Mums should be planted 18 to 30 inches (45.7 to 76.2 cm) apart so that they have room to grow.
 Moving your plants helps to prevent pest problems and reduces the risk of disease. (See the Dividing and Transplanting section for more instructions.)

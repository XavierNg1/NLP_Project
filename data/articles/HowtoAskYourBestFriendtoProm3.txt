 If you don’t feel comfortable with asking your friend directly or ornately, you might find a way to ask them with a bit more finesse and ease. Begin this by asking if they are going with someone already. If so, you might want to reconsider asking them., If they don’t have a date yet, tell them that you are looking for someone to go with. Doing so will remind them that you are available and they may also begin thinking about the possibility of going with you.


You might say something like “Yeah, I don’t have a date either. I really want to go with someone who I know I’ll have fun with.”

, You can also begin to throw little hints about the two of you going to prom together. You can say things like “My mom asked if we were going to go together” or “Everyone keeps saying you and I should just be each other’s dates.” Their response will allow you to assess how they feel about the idea.If they immediately shut it down, then perhaps consider asking someone else.
 After you have tested the waters, you can begin making statements about what it would be like to go together. You can talk about how much fun you would have, what colors you would wear, what songs you would get the most hype to, or anything else you two would enjoy together.Use this as an opportunity to present the pros. Talk about how little pressure it would be compared to going with someone else.
 Finally, you should ask your friend. Though you do want to present the idea to them subtly, you still do want to see how they feel about it officially. Say something like “So what do you think? Do you wanna go to prom together?” If they say yes, then great! If not, then at least you tried.
 Be sure not to take their answer personally if they say no. If you feel comfortable doing so, talk directly about it with your friend to find out their reasoning and situation in a non-judgemental and respectful way.

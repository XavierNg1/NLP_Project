 Using the username and password of the account you would like banned, log onto Animal Jam. If you wish to keep any items, send them to a backup. Daily activities are not necessary to complete.
 Decide how far you would like to go, and where you want to get banned. Choose a populated area(such as Jamaa Township), or somewhere where you will cause trouble(such as a party).
 Do inappropriate actions or say bad things. Try to get people to report you. The more reports you get, the quicker you get banned. Eventually, you will either get banned or suspended.

 When you recognize a creative block, it’s time to give your mind a break. Do things that allow your subconscious mind to take over.
 If you’re trying to write, take a gardening class. If you need to paint, sign up to take a wood-block printing class. Let a different type of art inspire you.
 If you’re stressed, fill your home with blue colors. If you are unmotivated, paper a room with red to inspire your passion.Purchase big sheets of colored paper or cover your area with colored material if you don’t want to make a permanent change.
 Choose an exercise with “flow” like yoga, tai chi, dancing, hiking or boot camp. The bigger the distraction and momentum you gain, the better.


Exercise improves circulation and brain function.
 One study found that natural settings, like those seen in hikes, improve creative reasoning skills. They found that three days is the ideal time to increase these benefits, but even a half hour hike might improve your problem-solving skills., Move everything into a dramatically different position. Then, see if the change helps open up creative channels for the next few weeks.

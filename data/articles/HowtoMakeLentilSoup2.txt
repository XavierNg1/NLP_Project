 Place 1 lb. of green lentils, 1 US-quart (950Â ml) of vegetable broth, 4 cups of water, 4 diced celery ribs, 4 diced carrots, 1 diced onion, 3-4 minced garlic cloves, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 tsp. of dried oregano, 3 sprigs of fresh thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1 pinch of cayenne pepper, and salt and pepper to taste in a large crock pot. Stir the ingredients well to combine them.
 Cooking times vary slightly depending on how long it takes the lentils to soften without becoming too soft, and how long it takes for the soup to thicken. When it's ready, turn off the heat.
 Stir in 1/2 lb. of spinach and let it sit in the pot for a few minutes until it's completely wilted. You may think that you're putting in way too much spinach, but as the spinach wilts, it will get much smaller.
 Give this soup just a few minutes to cool down and then enjoy it on its own or with a slice of French bread. If you want it to be really creamy, you can even add a teaspoon of sour cream.

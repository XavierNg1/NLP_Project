 Some toy stores have a supply of aquatic creatures or action figures, such as a scuba diver, that you can easily place in a diorama. This will increase the ease with which your diorama is built.
 Draw fish, whales, crustaceans or people onto paper and cut them out. Trace the shape onto a thick piece of cardboard and cut the cardboard piece out with scissors or a utility knife.


Glue the image onto the cardboard. When it is dry, glue it onto the back of your diorama. As long as you use thick cardboard, it will create a 3D look to your scene.
If you are not very good at drawing creatures, then you can find them online. Search in the Images section of your search engine to find and print out animals you would like to use.
 Repeat the same process of making cardboard backed creatures, but glue an image on either side of the cardboard. Use a needle to poke a hole in the top of the cardboard creature, then poke the needle through the top of the diorama and tie a knot.


You can also hang plastic toys from the top of your diorama. Tie a piece of thread around them, thread the needle and poke the needle through the ceiling of the diorama.
Hanging parts of your ocean scene is a great way to create a lifelike foreground for your diorama. Things in the foreground can appear slightly larger and have some movement to them.
 Choose a color, like black, that will distract the viewer from your diorama.
 Write it on construction paper and cut it out or print it out on a word processing software program. Affix the title to the top or 1 of the front edges of your diorama.

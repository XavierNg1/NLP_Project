 Draw the shape of your wings on colored paper, tissue paper, or white paper. Each wing should be on a different sheet of paper. Make sure to use a sheet of paper that will be large enough for the wing size you want. Use scissors to cut out the paper.


Use any wing shape you desire. You can have rounded tips or pointed tips. They can be large like angel wings or narrow like dragonfly wings. This is up to your imagination.
 Using gauge wire (or any kind of other thin wire), outline the wings. Place wire along the top of the wing, the bottom of the wing, and along any veins you want in the wings.


The wire should extend beyond the edge of the wings. Tape the wire down to hold it in place.
Bend the wire so that it follows the contours of the wings.
 There are a couple of ways you can connect the wires to the paper. Cover the wires with tape to keep them in place. An alternate way to adhere the wires is to use Fimo gel.


Fimo gel is a craft adhesive. Squirt it onto the wings so it seeps beneath the wire, or use a sponge brush to dab under it. Just don't lift the wires. Try to get the Fimo gel under the wires. Start with the outer wires and set that. Then, spread it over all of the wing.
Use an embossing gun to set the gel. Fimo gel has to use heat to harden. Usually, Fimo gel is put into the oven, like when it's used with polymer clay. Since you can't put paper in the oven, use an embossing gun instead., After the wings cool, take needle nose pliers and twist any separated wires together near the base. Use wire cutters to cut the end of the wires that extend beyond the paper.


Add any embellishment to the wings. You can use glitter, paint, flowers, beads, or anything else to decorate the wings.

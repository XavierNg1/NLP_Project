 If sugar or high fructose corn syrup are at or near the top of the ingredient list, then the food gets the majority of its calories from sugar. According to Volumetrics guidelines, you should avoid or limit your consumption of these foods because of their high calorie density.
 For instance, if adding brown sugar to a bowl of a whole grain cereal like oatmeal will persuade you to eat oatmeal, then go ahead and add a teaspoon of brown sugar to your oatmeal. Keep the sugar addition small so that the calorie density of the oatmeal stays low.
 If you don’t like to eat fruit on its own, try some of these ideas:


Drizzle fruit with liqueur or sprinkle it with a small amount of shaved chocolate or chopped nuts.
Eat fruit desserts that are lower in calorie density, such as frozen fruit pops or sorbet made with real fruit.
 Use sugar substitutes as a tool for eating less sugar and not as an excuse to consume large amounts of foods that contain few nutrients.


Instead of choosing to eat a processed sugar-free package of cookies, choose to eat fruit. The fruit contains more nutritional value and a lower calorie density, which means that you can have more to eat.
Don’t consume too much diet soda just to feel full. Instead of drinking multiple sodas, eat nutrient-packed foods with a low calorie density to fill yourself up.

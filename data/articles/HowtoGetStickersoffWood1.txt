 Use a blow dryer or heat gun on the lowest setting. Heat the entire sticker for a few seconds, then point it at one corner. Keep heating as you continue to the next step.


Keep the blow dryer two inches (5 cm) away from the wood, and the heat gun at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) away. Heat for no more than 10–15 seconds.Too much heat can damage wood finish, or cause the sticker to leave a stain.;
, A plastic credit card or scraper is safest for the wood. If the wood isn't valuable or antique, you're probably safe with a putty knife, artist's palette knife, or non-serrated, thin butter knife. Scrape the edge of the sticker gently to lift it, at the corner being heated. If it doesn't work, move on, but keep the tool handy.









If you are handling a valuable or antique piece of wood, use your fingernail instead.
If your knives are too thick to get under the card, cut a square of plastic from the middle of a plastic container lid.
 Once you have one edge lifted, grasp it with tweezers or needle-nose pliers. Bend this 180º and gradually pull the sticker. For fragile wood, pull across the wood grain to avoid picking up fibers. Angle the blow dryer as you do this, softening the glue as you go. Do not try to rip the sticker off, or you could end up with a more difficult paper backing stuck to the table.

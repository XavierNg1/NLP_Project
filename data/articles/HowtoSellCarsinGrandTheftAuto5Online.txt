 While inside the game, press the “Pause” button on your controller to open the In-Game Menu. Here, select the “Online” tab on the rightmost side of the menu screen to go access Grand Theft Auto Online.;
, The character you’ll be using to play the online mode is different from the one you’re using to play the story mode. Use the directional keys to choose the character you want, and press the “Select” button to proceed. You’ll be directed inside the game after.
 Stroll around the city and find a car you want to sell. Basic cars can be sold for around $1,000 to $2,000, while sports cars can run up to more than $9,000. When you see a car you want to sell, enter the car and drive it away.
 This is the in-game car tuning and modification shop. In GTA 5, you can only have your car repaired or painted by the shop, but in GTA Online, you can actually sell the car you’re driving. There are two Los Santos Customs in GTA online: one in Los Santos and another in Harmony. To easily find it, simply open your map, and follow the “spray paint” icon.
 Once you get to the Los Santos Customs shop, park your car in front of it and its garage doors will open.


Keep in mind that if you’re wanted by the police, the garage doors won’t open. Lose the heat first by driving around the area prior to entering the shop.
 Once your car gets inside the shop, a menu prompt will appear allowing you to choose whether to repair or repaint your car, or sell it. Move the Down key on your controller to highlight the “Sell” option, and press the “Select” button to view the price of the car.


Press the “Select” button again to confirm selling. The cash will be added to your funds displayed on the top right-hand corner of the screen.

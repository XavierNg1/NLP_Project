 Every gym has a chin-up bar, which is a horizontal bar positioned above shoulder height. If you aren't a member of a gym, you can buy a chin-up bar and install it in your house. Place it in a tall doorway and make sure it's positioned above your shoulders.

, Whereas a pull-up would begin with your palms facing away, a chin-up begins with your palms facing your body. Grip the bar comfortably but firmly, with your hands spaced a few inches apart.








The proper chin-up grip has the hands spaced close together. A pull-up requires that the hands be spaced further apart.
 Use your upper arm strength to lift your body toward the bar, stopping when your chin is above the bar. Your elbows will be fully bent. Bend your knees or cross your feet to distribute your weight more evenly.
 Using a slow, controlled motion, lower yourself until your arms are straight. This is the complete range of motion for a chin-up.

 Have each player get in a line, and count each one. (Don't forget to include yourself.) If you have an even number of players, pick 2 directors. If you have an odd number of players, pick 1 director. Split the remaining people into 2-4 teams, depending on your personal preferences. Then, each team should go to a separate corner of the room/area that you are playing in.;
, Have the director(s) discuss or think about a topic or word for the skits. When it is decided, the director should announce the designated topic to the other players. Then they should inform the players on what kind of skit they are expecting (comedy, horror, drama, etc.)

, The director should now set a timer for 1-2 minutes, and shout go! Players should immediately begin planning a skit that circulates around the topic. They must work quickly and efficiently to get this done.
 The director should announce when the timer has stopped. All players should stop what they're doing and sit down in their corner, whether they're finished or not. The director chooses a team to go first. This team performs their skit, improvising all props. Skits should only be 1-5 minutes long.
 The director will think about the performance. If there are two, the directors will discuss it. There are five skills the directors will consider:


acting
how closely the people followed the theme
creativity and originality
fun
overall


, 0 means bad, 1 means OK/average, and 2 means excellent. By the end, the team should have a score from 1-10! They should remember this score. Repeat this same procedure with each group.
 The director should review each group score. The team that received the highest score, wins! The director shall then pick his/her/their favorite actor (or 2 actors) from the group to take his place. Then, if you want, the game can begin again with the new director(s)!

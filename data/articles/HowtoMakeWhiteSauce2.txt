 Add your butter and olive oil to a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Heat over low-to-medium heat until the butter is fully melted but hasn't begun to smoke or brown.
 Add your minced garlic and heavy cream to the saucepan and stir until well-mixed. Add pepper (to taste) and heat to a low simmer. Stir often.
 Add your cream cheese, parmesan, and asiago. Stir to incorporate, making sure that all cheeses have completely melted before proceeding.









This step affords you a great deal of freedom - feel free to fine-tune your mixture of cheeses to find one that better suits your taste. Some chefs, for example, like to substitute mozzarella or add a dash of sharp white cheddar for added flavor.
 Add just a dash of your dry white wine to your sauce, then stir to incorporate. After the wine has been absorbed, sample your sauce. Depending on how you like the flavor, you may want to add more wine to your sauce as you see fit. Keep in mind that adding a great deal of wine will give you a somewhat watery sauce, meaning you'll have to allow it to reduce for longer.
 If it isn't still simmering, bring your sauce up to a low simmer, then allow it to gradually reduce, stirring frequently. Frequent stirring is essential - since it will be relatively thick, Alfredo sauce is susceptible to sticking and burning. You want your end product to be thick, creamy, and flavorful without being gummy or solid. When you've reached a good thickness, immediately remove your sauce from heat and serve with pasta. Serves 4-6.

 Most modern tillers are motorized. A small motor powers metal blades to break up and aerate soil. This can make it easy to till more sod than you intended. Some stakes marking the boundaries for your sod removal project will prevent this from happening.


For especially long distances, or if you only have a few stakes, you could stake the corners of your project area and run string between them to outline your sod removal., The blades of your tiller can sometimes kick up dangerous debris, rocks, and plant matter. For this reason, you should wear proper protective gear, like gloves, goggles, long pants, and boots while using a mechanical tiller.


If you live in a dry region, you may kick up a great deal of dust over the course of your tilling. You may want to wear a dust mask to prevent breathing in dust., The blades of your tiller will turn over the grass while breaking up its roots and mixing it in with the soil. This can be especially good if you're turning your sod area into a garden. Mixing in organic matter, like grass or leaves, can enrich the soil with nutrients.


Follow the use and care instructions for your tiller for best results. These kinds of machines can be dangerous if used incorrectly.
Keep loose clothing and body parts, like your hands and feet, away from the blades of your tiller when it is running.
Hold your tiller firmly while it's running. The force of your blades trying to break up soil can cause your tiller to buck erratically. Losing hold of your tiller could result in damage or injury., Tilling too frequently can be harmful to the micro-organisms that live in the soil beneath your sod. If you are making a garden where you once had sod, over tilling could negatively impact the soil health of your plot.Generally, your sod will only need a single day of thorough tilling before it is ready to be used for your purposes.

 Before requesting that the dealership or previous owner pay for a VHR, demonstrate that you are a serious buyer. Devote your attention to one car instead of several cars on the lot. Talk to the salesperson about the vehicle and your financing options. Take the car for a test drive. Have the car looked over by a trusted mechanic., Dealerships often subscribe to a VHR service. This allows them to run VHRs economically on every car in their inventory. After demonstrating your interest in a vehicle, express your interest in the car to the salesperson and indicate that you have a few reservations. Indicate that the dealership’s willingness to pay for the VHR would ease your remaining concerns about making the major purchase.When talking to the salesperson, you could say: “I really love this car but I have a few reservations. My last car was in the shop all of the time and I want to make sure this vehicle doesn’t have a long history of repairs. In order to commit to the car, I need to see a detailed vehicle history report. This would really ease my concerns. Would you be willing to provide me with one?”
Wait until you are close to purchasing the car to request a VHR. A dealer is unlikely to run these reports on a number of vehicles.
 If the salesperson willingly runs the VHR for you, thank the salesperson! If the salesperson refuses to run the VHR or hands you an outdated VHR, proceed with caution. These red flags indicate that the dealership is hiding something about the car’s history. Walk away from the sale or pay for a complete VHR.

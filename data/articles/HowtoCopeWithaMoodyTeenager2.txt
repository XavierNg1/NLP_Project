 Hormones can render teens emotional instead of logical. They may even feel unsettled by the intensity of the emotions they experience. Your child needs you to be a calm, consistent presence in his or her life., Involve your child in developing these rules. Doing so both respects her developing independence and gives you the opportunity to remind her later that she helped develop these rules and must now live by them. She may grumble, but knowing their boundaries helps teens feel safe.Set, and use, consequences for poor behavior, but make your list of rules and consequences as short as possible. Prioritize your chief concerns.
Pick your battles. If your teenager is basically behaving, ignore minor annoyances such as shrugs, raised eyebrows, or bored looks.
Sometimes, teens may be inadvertently disrespectful. (Again, their brains are developing.) Calmly ask about their intention -- for example, “That comment came out sounding pretty offensive. Did you mean to behave rudely?”, Make your disapproval of poor behavior known, but focus on what your teenager is doing, not who he is. Your child isn’t dumb, even if his decision to slam a door in frustration and trap his sister’s fingers was less than brilliant. Continue to affirm his worth as a person even as you explain why his behavior was unacceptable.

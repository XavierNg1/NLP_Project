, For the purposes of this article, we've used: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+hard+boil+an+egg. In a search for "how to hard boil an egg" you should see wikiHow's article at #1 with the +1 box next to the title. It will become colorful when you hover over that search result.
 A dialog will pop up. If you don't yet have a Google profile, it will look like this:

, If you leave the box checked, Google will tailor content and ads to you across the Web, based on your Google profile, +1 activity, and social connections. You'll also see which of your friends have +1'd a page on the page itself, otherwise you will only see an anonymous tally.,, You can delete any +1 by clicking on the "x" to the right.
 Check or uncheck "Show this tab on my profile." Note than even if you hide the tab, your +1s will still be visible to others in search results and on non-Google sites.
 If someone you know has +1'd a website or search result, it will show right underneath the search result, like (name)+1'd this. Likewise, if you +1 anything, it will appear in the same way to anyone your connected to on the Web.

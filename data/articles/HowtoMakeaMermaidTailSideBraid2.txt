 This is a simple way to create a different look with the mermaid braid. It will keep your hair out of your face, while still allowing you to have a flowing hairstyle.

Divide the top portion of your hair into two sections. Braid each of these sections in a simple three-strand braid. Use a clip to hold the section you arenâ€™t currently braiding. Once you are finished with both of these braids, use a neutral-colored hair elastic to secure them together. Then, use small bobby pins to pin the two braids to each other.
Set your style with hairspray.
 This is a half-up hairstyle that is pretty and slightly bohemian. It works best with long hair. To begin, grab two sections of your hair from the front of your head behind each ear.Then, braid each of these sections of hair in a three-strand braid. You can use small, clear elastic bands to secure the ends of these braids. Be sure to braid to the very ends of your hair.
Pull the strands to the back of your head, and secure the bottoms of the two braids together with another small elastic band. Then, use bobby pins to secure the two braids together in the back of your head.
Pull at the braids to loosen them, and keep a few strands of hair down around your face to soften this look.
 To make your mermaid braid more sophisticated and dressy, you can add a French or Dutch braid to your combined mermaid braid.

A Dutch braid gives a more dimensional look, while a French braid is slightly more subtly complex.

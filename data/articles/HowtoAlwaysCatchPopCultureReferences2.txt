 If you’re new to pop culture, you’ve likely missed a lot over the past years or even decades. Pay attention when people chat about older shows or movies, and make a list of the ones that come up most often.


If people just drop references without mentioning which show or movie they’re talking about, you may have to ask them. If you’re trying to hide your lack of knowledge, try to memorize the quote or reference and look that up instead.
 People love to quote movies and shows to get a laugh or make everyone feel nostalgic. There are tons of online lists that rank the best movies and TV shows of all time. Check out these lists, as well as lists with famous quotations from TV shows and movies.


You can also find lists of quotations from specific shows, such as The Office or Buffy the Vampire Slayer., Words and phrases can become part of pop culture, too. If you’re feeling confused when you chat with your friends, go online to look these things up. Urban Dictionary is one option, or you can just Google the word or phrase.
 View your lack of experience with pop culture as a chance to bond with the people you’re close to. Don’t be embarrassed, because they’ll probably be excited they get to binge-watch their favorite shows and movies with you!


Netflix is a great place to look for older shows and movies.
 There’s so much that counts as pop culture, and it’s impossible to know everything. That’s ok! Start with the most popular stuff and the things your friends are into, and then develop your own tastes and interests from there. As you become aware of older and newer pop culture, you’ll catch more and more references.

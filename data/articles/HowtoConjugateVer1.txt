 One of the most important verb conjugations to know is the present indicative, which is used to talk about a current action. In this case, the present indicative is used to talk about something one currently sees.


Example: "I see the cat," Veo al gato.

yo: veotú: ves
él/ella/usted: ve
nosotros/-as: vemos
vosotros/-as: veis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: ven;
, The preterit indicative form of ver is used to talk about something definitely or concretely seen in the past which has since come to a clear end and is no longer currently being seen.


Example: "You saw the cat yesterday," Viste al gato ayer.

yo: vi
tú: viste
él/ella/usted: vio
nosotros/-as: vimos
vosotros/-as: visteis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: vieron

, Use the imperfect indicative when talking about something definitely or concretely seen in the past when the action of seeing that thing has not come to a final end, thereby suggesting that the same sight could be seen in the present.


Example: "They used to see the cat," Ellos veian al gato.

yo: veía
tú: veías
él/ella/usted: veía
nosotros/-as: veíamos
vosotros/-as: veíais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: veían

, Reserve the future indicative tense for conversations about something that will be seen, for certain, at some point in the future.


Example: "We will see the cat tomorrow," Veríamos al gato de mañana.

yo: vería
tú: verías
él/ella/usted: vería
nosotros/-as: veríamos
vosotros/-as: veríais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: verían

, Using the conditional indicative tense will help you talk about something that will definitely be seen if another condition happens to be true.


Example: "She will see the cat if she walks there," Ella verá al gato si camina allí.

yo: veré
tú: verás
él/ella/usted: verá
nosotros/-as: veremos
vosotros/-as: veréis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: verán

 If your child is younger than 3 months old, contact the child's pediatrician any time there is a fever above 100.4 °F (38 °C).For children older than 3 months with a fever under 104 °F (40 °C), you should call your doctor if the fever lasts more than two to three days.


In these cases, your doctor should know whether or not your child needs to be monitored by medical professionals or if you can continue to treat the fever at home.
 Immediately contact a physician or emergency services if a child has a fever above 105 °F (40.6 °C), no matter the age., When your child is running a fever of 105 °F (40.5 °C) or above and starts having seizures or other neurological symptoms, is very lethargic, dehydrated, or if the fever is due to heat exhaustion, you should call an ambulance for immediate assistance.


If the child has a temperature of 105 °F (40.5 °C), medical attention is necessary. Take your child to the doctor for assistance.
 Apply lukewarm or room temperature water with a sponge or cloth to your child’s head, neck, armpits, and wrists if his or her temperature is at or exceeds 105 °F (40.5 °C). This will provide a temporary reduction in body temperature.Give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen right away to start bringing down the fever.
 After a doctor or medical professional has reduced your child’s fever, he or she will provide you with monitoring and treatment options for the future. Follow your doctor’s instructions closely to prevent another onset of dangerously high fever., Even if your child’s high-grade fever has seemingly been eliminated, it is critical you bring the child back for future follow-ups and visits with the doctor. This will help to eliminate any dangerous or potentially life-threatening complications in the future.

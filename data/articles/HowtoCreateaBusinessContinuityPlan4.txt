 Make sure all employees who could be potentially affected by a disruption have read and understand the BCP. Take the time to ensure that employees are aware of their relevant roles in the implementation and execution of the policy.
 Don't leave things to chance! Even if key personnel are informed about their role under the BCP, you should still make sure that all employees are aware of building evacuation procedures, as well as contingency locations. This way the unforeseeable absence of key personnel will not prevent non-key personnel from knowing how to respond to business operation disruptions.
 No matter how good your BCP, it is likely that there will be disruptive events that are not provided for in your plan. Be open to updating and/or modifying your BCP in light of additional information and/or changed circumstances. Every time something changes, update all copies of your BCP, and never let it get out of date.

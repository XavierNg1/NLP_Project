 There is no cure for either type of FIP. However, cats with the dry form may live for a few months if they are still eating, haven’t developed neurological signs, and don’t have anemia. Providing a cat with the quality nutritious food can help for a few months.If the cat develops anemia, they may need blood transfusions.
 Cats with the wet form generally don’t live as long as those with the dry form. To help prolong your cat’s life for a little while, you can have the fluid drained from the chest and the abdomen.Draining the fluid may cause a significant loss in protein, which may make the condition worse.
 The vet may give the cat antibiotics if they develop infections. Immunosuppressants are sometimes given to help decrease the antibodies. Corticosteroids may be prescribed if the cat has problems with their eyes., Almost every case of FIP is fatal, and there is no treatment for the virus. Most treatments are supportive to help improve the cat’s quality of life for a few weeks or months. Many vets suggest that cats diagnosed with FIP be euthanized.If your cat is diagnosed, you and your family have to decide the most humane and appropriate course of treatment for your cat.

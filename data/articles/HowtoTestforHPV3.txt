 HPV screening may be completely negative, or it may suggest either the presence of the virus (as with the HPV test) or changes in the cells of the cervix (as with the pap test).



You may need follow-up testing after a positive test. This may include another pap test or an HPV test after 6 months to 1 year.
You may also need a test called a colposcopy after a positive test. This is a simple procedure in which the doctor will look at the cervix with a device that magnifies the cervix and allows for a more detailed examination. The doctor may also take a small sample of the tissue in the cervix, called a "biopsy," which will later be examined under the microscope.

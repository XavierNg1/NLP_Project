 If you didn’t have any luck with just soap and water, you may need to use more powerful cleaning ingredients. Take a large bowl or pot, and pour in a cup of white vinegar. Then add ¼ cup of baking soda. Stir the baking soda into the vinegar until they are mixed., Drop the plastic containers into the bowl with the vinegar and baking soda, remembering to also add the lids. Then add enough water so that the containers are fully submerged. Stir the mixture in the bowl with a large spoon.
 Keep the plastic container in the mixture for 24-48 hours. This will allow the vinegar and the baking soda to thoroughly work to deodorize the container., The baking soda and vinegar should have deodorized the container. However, vinegar can leave behind a strong scent itself. This is why you should put the container in the dishwasher directly after the container is done soaking in the mixture.


If you don’t have a dishwasher, scrub thoroughly using water and dishwashing detergent.

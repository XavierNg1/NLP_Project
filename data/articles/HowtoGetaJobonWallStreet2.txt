 Most graduate schools have more robust career-services offices than undergraduate programs. They will often offer interviewing and resume coaching, networking assistance and tips, and have access to employment listings that aren’t shared with the public.


Even if you’ve already graduated, many career services offices will still offer assistance. The better jobs their alumni get, the more it helps the school’s reputation, so it’s in their interest to help you.
 In Wall St. firms, analyst positions are entry level positions usually reserved for recent undergraduates with little to no work experience at all. Despite what the job title might lead you to believe, analysts don’t perform much high-level analysis. They complete the drudgery more senior employees don’t want to complete themselves, like proofreading documents, updating files, and gathering data.Precisely because these positions require long hours and lots of drudgery, many firms are leery of hiring an older or more experienced applicant. An employee with experience is more likely to get bored with the work, question orders, and have commitments outside the workplace.
 While many associates began as analysts, this is not always the case. Many associates are newly minted MBAs with several years of work experience in a non-analyst capacity. Other acceptable graduate degrees might be in finance or economics.An associate is a mid-level management position, considered a stepping stone to a VP slot.
 Paradoxically, too much experience can harm your job prospects rather than help them. Someone with twenty years’ experience might find themselves constrained by a middle management position; since companies are hiring for the long term, they want to find a person who will be happy in their role.The solution to this problem is to pare down what you list on your resume. Don’t list much more than ten years’ worth of employment history, and confine it to the most relevant positions.

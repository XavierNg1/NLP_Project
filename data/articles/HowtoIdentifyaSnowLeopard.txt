 A Snow Leopard's fur, which provides protection from the extreme cold of its mountainous habitat, is a soft grayish color with yellow-brown fur along its flank and a lighter white fur on its belly, chest, and chin. Look for a dark strip which runs along its back. The rest of its coat is spotted with solid circles and rosettes. Its fur provides excellent camouflage it its natural environment making these solitary creatures incredibly hard to spot in the wild.;
, The forelimbs of the snow leopard are relatively small compared to the rest of its body. See if the leopard also has a long, thick tail, which helps it balance while walking through the snowy terrain, jumping across rocky areas, and climbing in trees.
 This cat can reach about two feet at the shoulder and weigh between 55 and 150 pounds, making them the sixth largest wild cat. They have large paws for walking on snow unlike many other big cat species.
 Check for snow leopards in Central Asia, high up in the mountains. Unfortunately, these beautiful cats are hard to come by out of zoos; on the 2009 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the snow leopard was listed as endangered.
 Like most big cats, Snow Leopards are solitary. If you see several of the same sized cats together, they are probably not Snow Leopards as the only observable groups are mothers with young cubs. Snow Leopards are most active at dawn and dusk. If you see a feline hunting in central Asia in the dead of night, it's unlikely to be a Snow Leopard.

 Things that you should look at are:Weight - you, or someone else, will be carrying the tripod. You will want to consider its weight and bulkiness.
Stability - How stable the tripod is means a lot. Depending on the surface that you will be setting it up, and the conditions, and the weight of the camera or camcorder.
Type of leg locks - How easily can the legs be locked into place and how secure is that lock.
Type of head - is it an integrated unit or can it be switched out.
Height - While this may seem pretty minor, if you are a tall person and you have to really stretch out the tripod, it becomes more stable. The "ideal is said to be one with a platform at least as high as your eye level with the legs open at their smallest setting angle.";
, It is good to have something that you can use instead.
 Aluminum or carbon fiber are the 'norms'.
, Being able to do so will broaden your photographic world.

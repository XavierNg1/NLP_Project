 Just as there are some people that can never see a solution, only a problem; there are people that can always see ‘the bright side’ of everything. You can’t force anyone to be less optimistic, so take an accepting and tolerant attitude when dealing with people that are.When they are still convinced that a plan will work even though everything indicates it won’t, just accept that their optimism is impervious and don’t let it upset you.;
, Extreme optimism can be considered by some as delusional. Most people, however, would agree that there is nothing wrong with being positive and believing that good things will happen. Tapping into their optimism is not only a way to be more accepting, but also a great way to improve your own attitude.


Perhaps you are actually too pessimistic. Examine yourself and see if following their example might help you to develop a better outlook on life and situations.
While you don’t have to take it to their level, try to find the positive side of situations. This isn’t just a characteristic of the overly optimistic, but also of effective problem-solving., Don’t assume that you can dismiss what they are saying because of their excessive enthusiasm. Listen to what they are saying before you begin to make judgment on its validity or worth.Overly optimistic people can help explore alternative solutions to a problem because they are trying to find a way to make everything work out okay.
Deep in all that fluffy optimism there could also be great gems of wisdom and insight.

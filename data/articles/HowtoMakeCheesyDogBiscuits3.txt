 Prepare the cookie sheets; line with parchment paper.
 Stir to combine. Let stand for ten minutes.
 Mix together well.
 Add 1 cup of flour to the mixture and stir in well. Continue adding the other 2 cups one cup at a time, stirring in. Mix until a firm dough forms.
 Knead for a few minutes until the dough becomes smooth and loses its stickiness.
 Use a cookie cutter to cut out biscuit shapes.
 Leave about 1" (2.5cm) space between each biscuit.
 Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the color turns golden brown.
 Allow to cool briefly on the cookie sheets, then transfer to the wire cooling rack to cool completely.

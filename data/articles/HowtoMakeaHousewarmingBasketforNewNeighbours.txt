 Line the bottom of it with a blanket or some decorative paper.;
, New neighbors are usually running short of practical things such as instant coffee and sugar, so it might be a good idea to put those kind of things in. Put in a bottle of wine, or a box of chocolates as a luxury to welcome them to the neighborhood. Put in some cups and mugs. This is a good idea as crockery sometimes gets broken during house moves. Try to stay away from buying personal things, such as clothes and toothpaste.
 Find out your new neighbor's name(s), and write a little welcome message inside. Tell them if they need anything, you're happy to help. Place the card in the top of the basket so it doesn't get damaged.
, Put the food in a Tupperware box. Warm homemade food is a nice treat when you're busy moving home as you have little time to make hot food yourself. Your neighbors may also be touched by this thoughtful gesture.

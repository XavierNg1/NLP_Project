 Park next to a gas pump with your gas tank filler facing the pump.;
,, If you're using a credit card, hand it to the attendant. In some locations, you can pump your own gas. In that case, you would swipe the card yourself. In most places, an attendant will do it for you.
 Tell the attendant how much gas you want. Often people just ask for a "fill up," meaning enough to fill the tank. Again, in some locations, you can pump your own gas. This involves removing the nozzle from the pump's cradle, inserting it into your car's fuel-tank filler, selecting the grade of gas you want (the octane level), triggering the nozzle, and either holding the nozzle while it the gas flows or setting the nozzle to flow by itself and turn off automatically when your tank is full.
 At a full-service station, the attendant may offer to check your car's oil level and wash your windshield. There is no charge for this service. At a self-service station, you can do these things yourself while the gas is pumping.
 Don't drive off without your gas cap.
 You're done.

 If your bathroom is already painted or tiled, there are certain bath towel colors that will automatically work with your current color scheme. If your bathroom is painted gray, try adding canary yellow bath towels.If your bathroom is black and white, add pink towels for a feminine flair.
If your bathroom is purple, add towels in a chocolate brown color to bring some warmth to the room.
 Small bathrooms can easily look cramped and your colored bath towels can make a small bathroom look even smaller. If you have a small bathroom, stick with neutral shades for your towels; they’ll make your bathroom appear bigger and more open.Choose dark and bold colors for larger bathrooms. They’ll make your bathroom feel more intimate.
If you have a smaller bathroom, you may need smaller towels. Bath sheets (oversized bath towels) typically won’t fit on the hooks in small bathrooms, so buy bath towels instead.
 If you’re decorating a beach house bathroom, look for towels with a palm tree or seashell pattern. If you’re decorating a bathroom with Spanish tile, use lots of earth and jewel tones. Use your towels to support the design that already exists within the house.If you’re unsure whether a pattern will go with your already existing décor, it’s better to be too subtle than too bold.
Make sure to save receipts for all towel purchases, in case you don’t like the way your towels look in the space.
 The Internet is the perfect place to look for bathroom decorating ideas. Check out Pinterest for inspirational bathroom looks, or look on store websites to see which towels they recommend pairing together.


Remember, your towels should complement the bathroom you already have. Don’t buy towels just because they looked good in someone else’s bathroom; they will not look the same in yours.
Design sites like Apartment Therapy and Houzz are also good resources for finding inspiration and sharing your work with others.

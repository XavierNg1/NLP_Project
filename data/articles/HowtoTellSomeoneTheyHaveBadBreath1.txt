 A classic way to hint at a particular problem is to act as if you have the problem yourself. This is a great way to bring up the topic of bad breath to someone, especially to a person that you are not very close with, because it is a non-confrontational way to make them think about their own breath.Start the conversation by saying:


“I’m going to go grab some water, I feel like my breath is terrible.”
“Is it just me or does my breath smell?”
“Can you smell my breath? I feel like it’s noticeable.”;
, Another subtle way at hinting to a person that they have bad breath is to offer the person a mint, stick of gum, or some water (since dry mouth can also cause bad breath) and see if they take the hint. For a natural transition, try taking a mint first and then offering one to them so you’re both included in the transaction.
 Etiquette experts agree that if you offer someone a breath aid and they turn it down, it’s perfectly acceptable to nudge them into accepting with a kind “I think you should.”It’s a delicate way to let them know that you offered the aid in the first place as a hint. If they still don’t get it, have another friend or coworker try!

, If the person with offending breath has this problem often, their chronic bad breath may be caused by poor dental hygiene and not just their food choices or use of tobacco products.If it is an infrequent problem, the person just might not have considered bringing a toothbrush for midday cleanings. Either way, try showing them good techniques:


After lunch say, “I’m going to go to the restroom quickly and brush my teeth; that dressing had so much garlic in it!”
Show them or talk about how you always keep floss and mouthwash in your desk because you cannot stand having bad breath.
If you’re close with the person, try saying “Would it be weird if I flossed my teeth right now? I feel like my breath is terrible, and it’s driving me nuts.”

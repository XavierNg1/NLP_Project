 That is, if you want a new style of writing, you need to relearn the way you write, which won't be that different from the way you learned to write as a kid., You can use font sites to find a font that you admire or even just use your word processing software.
 You can also include pangrams such as "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." Pangrams are texts that contain every letter in the English language, so they are good for practice.Start out using a larger size for your font, such as 14 point.
 Place the paper over the page you printed. Trace over the letters with a pen or pencil., Once you've traced the letters a few times, move on to copying the letters by looking at the letters and trying to write sentences. This forces you to look at how the letters are actually formed., Without looking at the font, try writing in the same style. Though it will not perfectly match the original, you will be using a different handwriting style.
 To make the font your own, you must practice it often. Try writing in a journal or writing out your grocery list in that style. Over time, it will feel more natural.

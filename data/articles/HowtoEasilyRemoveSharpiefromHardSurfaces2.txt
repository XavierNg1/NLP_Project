 Start with any kind of an oily "remover" type product, like "Goo Gone." Even plain old cooking oil sometimes works.


If that doesn't work, try a product like "Barkeepers Friend" or "KingClean." You might also try ink pen erasers on it or paint or lacquer thinner. You could also grab a can of carburetor cleaner, and it should remove the stain instantly.
If you get only partial results, leave it for several days or weeks, and go back and repeat everything you did the first time, as often the marks themselves will oxidize or deteriorate to some extent, which gives you a better chance at getting rid of them.
 Wipe it away with your towel (or tissues) after no more than 5 seconds. If you leave the hairspray on too long, it will stick!!


Scrub the Sharpie stain until it rubs off. This should take about 30 seconds.
If you don't have hairspray, unwanted perfume would do the job just as well. Do not use this method for clothes or electronic devices.
 A great removal liquid is alcohol. It can be used by grabbing a cotton ball, soaking it with alcohol and rubbing the stained surface.Sharpie ink is soluble in alcohol. Use a dab of the rubbing alcohol, or ethanol if you have it, on a facial tissue or the cotton ball, and apply it to the ink that you want to remove. This works great on surfaces like glass and metal but could potentially ruin delicate surfaces that react to alcohol. Alcohol is flammable so use common sense and only apply in small quantities and away from open flames.
A similar method can be done with nail polish remover, as the strong chemicals can help with the removal of Sharpie ink.

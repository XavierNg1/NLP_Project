 The first step toward enhancing your home should be to determine the style that most reflects your personality (Ex. Outdoorsy, Classic, Modern, etc.);
, Once this style is determined, begin to collect art, knick knacks, fabrics, and textures that display your interests.
 Try moving lamps to different locations to showcase various lighting, or place throws on various pieces of furniture to add warmth and texture to your room.)

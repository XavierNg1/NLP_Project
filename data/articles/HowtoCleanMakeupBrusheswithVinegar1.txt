 Place a cup of warm or hot water in a mug or jar. Add about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Pour in 1/2 a teaspoon of dishwashing soap. Stir it in to make sure the solution is mixed well.You can also just use two parts vinegar to one part water, skipping the soap.;
, Swish each brush in the solution. Move it around until you can see that it's clean, and then take it out to rinse in cool water. Repeat for each brush, washing and rinsing each one separately., On a clean paper towel, dab the brush a few times gently to get rid of the extra water. Smooth out any bent bristles with your fingers, reshaping the brush. Place the brushes flat on the paper towel to dry. They can sit out overnight to dry.

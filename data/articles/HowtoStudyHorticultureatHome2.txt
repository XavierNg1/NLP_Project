 Many tech schools, state universities, and even an Ivy League school or two, offer online or “distance learning” opportunities. Start by checking out the course catalogue for schools near you. Then expand outward to see what options you find.For example, open a web browser and search for “online horticulture classes.” Also search specialized courses on permaculture, gardening, or botanical illustration.
If you find interesting classes at a school that’s out of your price range, look for the same classes at more affordable schools.
 If you want to casually start up an education in horticulture, choose two or three classes from one of the universities you found in your research. Look at the horticulture group of classes and pick ones that perk up your interest.

Taking a couple of classes is a good way to find out if you are really interested enough in the subject to work hard on studying it.
You’ll pick up some useful knowledge in these classes, even if you choose not to pursue horticulture any further afterward.
 You may want to pursue horticulture as a career path. In many cases, to get a specialized job in a horticultural field you’ll need in-depth training, as well as a degree. Find a school that offers an Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Master’s degree in horticulture.Areas of focus include but aren’t limited to: floral design, nursery management, research, sustainability, and turf management.
Most of the time, an Associate’s degree takes 18 months to two years to complete. A Bachelor’s degree usually takes four years. A Master’s degree requires previous study, and takes about two years to complete.

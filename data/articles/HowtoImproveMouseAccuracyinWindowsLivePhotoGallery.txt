Align the grid line with an object that is vertical like a post or a building. Since there might be distortion, use objects in the center of the photo.;

 Instead of moving the mouse from your wrist, try moving it from your shoulder or your body. Moving the mouse with a bigger movement, moves the mouse less, because moving the mouse with your wrist creates a bigger angle of movement.
 With this "big" technique, your palm heel is fixed and you will be shifting your body to move the mouse. This technique takes very little effort.
 Be prepared to trial a variety of techniques.
 It is hard to move a mouse accurately for a few millimeters, so by moving it diagonally you have a bit more control of it. If you can accurately move a mouse 2 mm and an adjustment requires 1.75 mm of movement, by moving the mouse diagonally, the actual sideward movement is less than 2 mm. The Windows Live Photo Gallery slider control can make sidewards adjustments and will not note any diagonal movements.



With this technique, look at slider bar, without looking at the photo, and move the bar just a bit.
A variation of this is to look at the slider bar and the photo, but with more of your vision focused on the slider bar.
When making diagonal movements with the mouse, look at the effect of what your mouse movements has with your photo or page. This is like driving, where you are looking at the road and not at the steering wheel.

, Your front leg should now be on the ball, and your back leg should be on the ground. You'll probably get off balance a tad, but that's okay. Once you've reached perfect balance, move on to the next step.
 Try to go a little faster, but not to the point where you lose balance. Do steps one and two twice.
 Do it at a quick pace now, but don't lose your balance. Tap the ball lightly. Do it five times.
 You should be used to the positions enough that you can do it. Try to go at your own speed, and then slowly pick it up. See how fast and how long you can go!

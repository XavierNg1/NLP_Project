 In order to thrive in a cold climate, a dog must be able to stay warm and toasty. Dogs with thick coats, usually a double coat of under fur and top fur, will be better protected from the cold because they will be able to keep their core temperature warmer.Dogs that are traditionally kept in very cold places, like the Alaskan malamute or the Bernese mountain dog, thrive in cold weather in large part because of their coats. A thick double coat protects their core from losing heat, just as a thick jacket would for you.
 There is a reason that Siberian huskies, American Eskimos, Samoyed, and Icelandic Sheepdogs are known for thriving in the cold. They are built for cold weather with their thick coats and their sturdy dispositions. If you live in a cold area and want a dog breed to match, consider these breeds.This is not to say that you can only have a dog in a cold climate that is known for thriving there. However, it does mean that having that kind of dog will be a lot easier because you will not have to protect it from the cold as much as you would a dog that is not made for the cold.
 Depending on just how cold your climate is, you may be able to protect just about any breed of dog from the cold. If you keep your dog inside most of the time, put protective clothing on it, and protect its paws from ice and snow, most dogs can live in a cold climate.However, there are some breeds that have delicate constitutions and they cannot handle extremes of temperature.

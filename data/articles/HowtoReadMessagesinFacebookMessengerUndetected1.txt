If you’re already logged into the Facebook app on your mobile device, you won’t be asked to log into Facebook anymore.
 Upon logging in, Privy Chat will show you your current inbox or list of message threads or conversations from Facebook Messenger. Swipe up and down to scroll through them.
 New messages on your Facebook Messenger will also come in on Privy Chat. You can see them highlighted in gray. Tap on the message to read it. The person who sent you the message won’t be able to tell if and when you have read his message.


As long as you use Privy Chat as your Facebook messenger, you can read your messages in peace and in secret. Once you go back to using the main Facebook Messenger, your messages will go back to sending read receipts.

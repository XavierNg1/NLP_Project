 There are a number of substances that can cause dehydration and lead to a sore, itchy throat when used too frequently.


Drinks that contain caffeine like coffee, tea and soda can lead to dehydration (and affect your sleep) so try to cut them out or at least cut down.
Recreational drug use and certain medications (like antidepressants) can lead to dehydration and throat irritation.
Smoking cigarettes is very drying on the throat and can lead to itchiness and irritation (along with a host of other health issues) so think about quitting, or at least cutting back.
 Things like talking too much, shouting, or singing can cause your throat to become overworked, leading to dehydration and itchiness.


If you believe this may be the cause of your itchy throat, try to give your voice a break by resting it (no talking, singing or shouting) for at least an hour or two each day.
If your work involves using your voice a lot, remember to keep a bottle of water on you at all times so you can keep your throat lubricated and stay hydrated throughout the day.
 An allergic reaction to a certain food, plant or pollen can cause symptoms such as watery eyes, sneezing, congestion and an itchy throat.


Try taking an antihistamine tablet daily to see if this alleviates your symptoms.
Also try to identify the exact cause of the allergy by keeping a food diary or seeing your doctor for an allergy test.

 Traveling by bus is, by far, the cheapest option. You can travel by bus within cities, as well as to other cities. It is typically 2 euros or less to travel within a city by bus. Euroline is the main bus service in Europe and its network extends throughout the continent.The drawback is that it takes longer to travel from city to city by bus.
 Traveling by train is an affordable option if you plan to visit many cities. To get the best deals, purchase a Eurail pass ahead of time. For unlimited travel to any country within the Eurail system for 15 days to 3 months, get a Global Pass. Get a Flexi pass for 10 to 15 days of travel to any country within the system for a 2-month period.If your travel time to cities is less than six to eight hours, then this is the best option.
 Try flying to your locations if you are traveling for only a short period of time like two weeks. Budget airlines in Europe make this option very affordable. The cost of a flight can be as low as 5 euros. However, make sure to look at the fees and stipulations before booking. The flight may seem cheap, but fees can raise the price substantially.This is a good option if your travel time by train is eight or more hours.
Some discount airlines are Ryanair, Wizz, Easyjet, and Transavia.
 A car is a good option if you want to visit small towns in the countryside, but it is the most expensive option. You have to pay for gas, tolls, and parking. Additionally, many companies charge a drop-off fee of 100 to 300 euros if you drop the car off in a different destination.

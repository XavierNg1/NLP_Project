 Sometimes you can save money by booking flights late because airlines that have not filled their planes will offer discount fares.;
, Purchasing flights directly from the airline is not always the cheapest deal, so check out a few different travel websites and travel agencies to compare prices.
 Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays are usually the busiest flight days for people to travel, so consider booking flights for Tuesdays or Wednesdays, the quietest days for travel. If you are flying around a national holiday, consider flying on the holiday, when most people are already at their destination, rather than the day before.
 Some websites offer discount travel to students, teachers, military personnel and the elderly. If you fit into any of these categories, it may be beneficial to book through a company that offers discounts on flights.
 There are many discount airlines both within the United States and outside of the United States. Discount airlines typically offer discount airfares but sometimes charge extra fees for checked baggage, food and drinks. If you are comfortable without some of these flying luxuries, you may be able to find cheap airfares for last minute flights.
 There are a few websites where you can place a bid on airfares by stating the date you wish to travel and the destination. Once your bid is accepted you will be shown the time of the flight and the airline. Keep in mind that bidding on a flight requires some flexibility in your schedule.
 You do not generally need to have enough miles to purchase an entire flight, but sometimes you can use acquired frequent flyer miles to reduce the price of a flight you want to purchase.

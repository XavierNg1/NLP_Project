It is critical to wear as instructed.Each day after bathing, put the vest on and be sure that the fit is snug. Use the attached Velcro to secure the vest around the chest. Then, attach the defibrillator unit to your belt or use the belt provided. Finally, be sure to switch your unit on., In order for the device to work correctly, it is important to leave it on all the time, including when you sleep. If you should experience SCA during the night, you want to be protected! Remove the vest only for bathing and showering., Not surprisingly, wearing a snug vest under your clothes is not the most comfortable. Around 20% of patients discontinue use due to discomfort. Try to value the lifesaving value of this vest over any mild discomfort you may experience.

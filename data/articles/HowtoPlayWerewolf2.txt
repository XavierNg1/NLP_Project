 This person will count to 30 while covering her eyes. Once she reaches 30 she'll run after the other people.The Werewolf will tag as many people as she can. If the Werewolf tags you, then you become a Werewolf too.


The main Werewolf rotates each round so nobody should feel isolated for being chosen.
 Your objective is to tag as many "non-Werewolves" as you can. Try to be stealthy because once someone sees you, everyone will have an advantage over you.Werewolves aren't allowed to speak. To communicate to one another they are required to make grunts and point.
 The objective for the non-Werewolf is to find a hiding space quickly as the Werewolf is counting.Keep track of the Werewolf's countdown in order to be prepared when the time comes. It is not advised to wander because the Werewolf will easily be able to find you.


Finding a good hiding spot is key.
After a few rounds, the Werewolf will begin to know where to look so vary your hiding spot from game to game.
If the Werewolf tags you, you now must become a Werewolf and attempt to catch the rest of the "humans." To become a Werewolf, you have to kneel, close your eyes, and count for 15 seconds.
 When you notice you're one of the last people, call "Werewolf!" This is when every "human" left makes a run back to the home base.Werewolves will probably be waiting for you there so be quick and careful.
 The round is over once everyone gathers at the designated home base. The last people to be tagged or the ones that aren't Werewolves yet pick the next Werewolf. Then the game starts over again with a new Werewolf.


You cannot choose the same Werewolf from the last round.

 Push-up bras are an easy and affordable way to instantly gain a cup size or two. Push up bras make cleavage appear younger, firmer and larger and can be purchased at any specialty bra store or most stores where bras are sold.








Look for a push-up bra that pushes breasts up and together.
Opt for a bra with a wide backband – this will also help to support your breasts.;
, Padded bras work to boost your breasts at the bottom, lifting the breast upwards to sit on top of the padding. Look for a bra that sits snugly around your body and doesn’t cause your breasts to spill out of the cups.If you’re wearing a deep cut top, look for a padded plunge bra. These bras position the padding on the sides to centralize your cleavage.
Padded bras fit tighter than regular bras, so try a size larger than you might normally wear.
 If you have a favorite bra, you probably wear it regularly and that will cause it to stretch out. Additionally, your breast size may fluctuate due to weight loss or gain. Visit a department store once a year for a fitting and to replace any old bras that may not be working anymore.Continuing to wear old bras may cause your breasts to sag.
If your breasts are on the larger side, always wear a bra with underwire for maximum support.
 If your want full, gravity-defying cleavage like Kim Kardashian, wear a push-up bra and insert a silicone chicken cutlet into the bottom of each bra cup. The cutlets will help boost your bust and make your breasts look fuller.For deeper cleavage, apply the cutlet to the outside of each breast.Place the cutlet high on the nipple, instead of centered on top of it, for a perkier breast.
Buy your pushup bra in your correct size, but look for one with a tight band.
Cutlets can be purchased online, or in many stores that sell clothing and lingerie.

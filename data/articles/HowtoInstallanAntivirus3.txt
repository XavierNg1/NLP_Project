 Out of the three major OSes, Linux is the most secure when it comes to viruses. This is due to both the low population of users as well as the inherent security of the system software. Because applications are installed directly from the distribution, there is little chance of files being infected.


The most important use for antivirus on Linux is stopping the spread of malware to other computers. Viruses are very easily spread through email, and while you may not get infected yourself, you can spread the virus to other computers that may not have the same protection as your Linux machine.
 Check with your repository to see what antivirus options are available for your Linux build. Most builds have antivirus programs available as freeware. These programs have been vetted by the Linux community and are designed to take minimal system resources.
 Because the risk of infection is low, you donâ€™t necessarily need to constantly scan your system. Instead, use your antivirus program to manually inspect suspicious files and emails.
 Updating system software with Linux updates all of your program builds as well, eradicating any exploits that have been found. The process is mostly automated. Be sure to check your settings to ensure that your Linux installation is updating appropriately.

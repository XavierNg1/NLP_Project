 If your allergy is mild, you can take over-the-counter medications like antihistamines. These medications can relieve itchy eyes, nasal congestion, and other mild symptoms. Keep these medications on hand so you can take them as necessary.Keep in mind OTC allergy medications will not treat more severe symptoms like wheezing and chest tightness. You should see your primary care doctor if you experience more severe allergy symptoms.
 If your allergy is severe you may opt for allergy shots. Talk to your doctor about allergy shots, also called allergy vaccines. This medication helps you develop antibodies that can counter your allergy. However, allergy shots take awhile to kick in and you will need to get weekly injections for several months to see any results.Over time, getting weekly allergy shots and then monthly shots can help to reduce your symptoms or make your allergy go away completely.
 Note if your allergy gets worse over time or if your symptoms do not improve with medication. Keep in touch with your doctor about your symptoms so they can make sure you do not get worse. If your allergy does not get better with adjustments to your home or maintenance of your pet, you may need to consider medications or other lifestyle changes.Sometimes, an allergy can get so severe you may not be able to own a dog. If this occurs, speak to your doctor about your options before you give up your dog.

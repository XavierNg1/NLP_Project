, Clear your mind of work, school, kids, the news, or anything else that distracts you.
 Some of the ideas that come to you may seem corny, even to yourself, but that is the way love is, sometimes.
 Then, see if the big things are combinations of little things, and can be broken down that way. Here are some examples of "she is beautiful" (other qualities may be broken down the same way.

She has a full, womanly figure. (Which may be broken down even further.)
She has lovely, iridescent blue eyes.
Her smile can light up a room.

 You may appreciate the absence of criticism, complaining, or other negative qualities. These characteristics, being absent, do not lend themselves to obvious recognition.

 Often, you may find you associate other things only when you remind yourself deliberately.
 You may even try to forget it, but later on, when you take it out, or even rediscover it, you may be surprised by how you take many things on the list for granted.
 Will they see it as a shallow, superficial gesture? That may depend largely on the things you choose to list. On the other hand, they may be flattered and happy you have spent so much time thinking about them.

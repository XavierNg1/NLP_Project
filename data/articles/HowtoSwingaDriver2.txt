 Keep your hands in position on the grip and your feet flat. Your leading arm should remain straight on the backswing so that you don't have to remember to straighten it out again on the downswing.
 Keep your feet flat and shift your weight immediately to the front foot. The goal is not to hit the ball as hard as you can, but to swing smoothly through the ball.
 Throughout the backswing and downswing your front arm should be straight for as long as possible. Both arms become straight when the club reaches impact and remain straight for as long as they can.
 As you shift your weight to the front leg, try to keep your back foot on the ground as long as possible, at least until after impact. This motion requires some ankle flexibility.Â 

, This will increase the speed of your driver's head.


To help you make this part of the upswing, envision your forward arm and the driver's shaft forming a capital "L" and your forearms making an "X" as they cross






Keep as relaxed a motion through the takeaway, downswing and upswing as you can. Tensing up will cause the ball to veer left or right.

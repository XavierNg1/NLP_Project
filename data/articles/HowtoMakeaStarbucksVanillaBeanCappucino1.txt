 Since it's going to be blended with so many tasty ingredients, make sure it's very strong. Otherwise, the coffee flavor will be masked. The coffee or espresso should taste too strong to drink on its own., Make sure it's completely cold before you proceed, or your blended cappuccino will be too liquidy.
 Pour the cold coffee, milk, sweetened, condensed milk, and vanilla into the blender. Leave out the whipped cream for now.


If you want the drink to be extra rich, replace the milk with half and half.
If you don't have sweetened, condensed milk, replace it with regular milk and add one to two tablespoons sugar to taste.
If you want to make a mocha blended cappuccino, add 1/4 cup chocolate syrup.
 After adding all your other ingredients, fill up the blender to the top with ice cubes. This will give your drink a good icy consistency.
 It might take a few minutes to completely crush and blend all of the ice. Stir the mixture if necessary. Keep going until it reaches a consistency you like.
 You can enjoy the whole thing yourself or divide it in half to share with a friend.
 For an extra delicious touch, add sprinkles or chocolate chips.

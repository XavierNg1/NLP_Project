 Because the base tone for all light brown shades is copper, going from blonde to light brown isn’t as simple as just applying light brown dye. Depending on your blonde shade, you may have little or no copper tone in your hair. When you put a light brown dye directly on top of it, you’ll end up with greenish, greyish or purplish results.


Hair levels are judged on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being black and 10 being the lightest blonde. As a reference point, level 5 is considered to be light brown.Level charts can help you determine your level if you aren’t sure. Type “shade range hair level” into a search engine to bring up the info you need.
 If your current blonde shade falls into this range, you’ll need to dye your hair with a dark copper blonde dye before moving forward with your light brown shade.This will prepare your hair with the base copper tone necessary to achieve all light brown shades. Without doing this first, the results of your light brown dye job could end up looking greenish.Purchase the dye and follow the directions on the packaging to add the copper tones to your blonde hair.
 If you fall into this shade range, your hair also lacks golden tones. Putting a light brown dye directly on top of it will result in either a bright purple or very dull, lifeless light brown shade. Use a golden copper/auburn blonde dye first, which will deposit the copper and gold undertones you need to achieve your ideal light brown shade. Purchase the dye and follow the directions to add the copper tones.
 Once you’ve added the copper/gold tones into your blonde hair, you’re ready to move forward with your light brown dye. Apply the dye to your hair according to the instructions that came with your dye kit. After the color develops (times vary from product to product), rinse out the dye and enjoy your new light brown shade.

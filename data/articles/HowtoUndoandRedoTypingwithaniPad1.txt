 iPad keyboards do include undo/redo keys, but they are not located on the main keyboard, so they are often overlooked.


To undo a text-based action, tap the ".?123" button on the touchscreen keyboard. Then, tap the "undo" button that appears near the bottom left of the keyboard.
To redo a text-based action, tap the "#+=" button on the keyboard. Then, tap the "redo" button that appears near the bottom left of the keyboard.;

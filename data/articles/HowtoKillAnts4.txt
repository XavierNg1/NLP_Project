 Boil a kettle or small saucepan of water and immediately use it to saturate any anthills or large gatherings of ants outdoors.


Ants can swim, so warm or cool water will not be enough to wipe the colony out. Boiling water will burn the ants, though, which is an effective means of killing them.
 After a few days, the traps should be coated in ants.


These glue traps are non-toxic, but you should avoid placing them in areas that your pets have access to since pets can unknowingly get caught on the traps. This is especially important if you have a rabbit, rat, ferret, or similar pet that is allowed to roam the house.
You can also make your own glue trap by coating a piece of yellow construction paper with petroleum jelly or a paste made with corn syrup and water.
 When all else fails, you can always squash the ants with a shoe, old magazine, or fly-swatter.


This technique will work against visible ants, but if you have a colony making its home nearby, simply smashing the ants will probably fail to eliminate the problem long-term.

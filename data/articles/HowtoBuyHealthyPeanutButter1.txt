 Many popular brands include unhealthy ingredients and chemicals such as corn syrup, hydrogenated vegetable oil, mono- and di-glycerides, soy protein concentrate, maltodextrin, and soy lecithin. Pure peanut butter is made of roasted peanuts and doesn't require additional ingredients. Look for brands that exclusively use roasted peanuts in the ingredients list.Brands like Skippy, Planters, and Great Value contain additional sugar and additives.
Maltodextrin is a caloric sweetener made from rice, potatoes, or cornstarch and can raise blood glucose and insulin levels.
Monoglycerides and diglycerides are food additives used to prevent the oil from separating out of peanut butter. This means it is natural and normal to see the oil on top of peanut butter that does not have this additive.;
, While an all-natural peanut butter can be healthier than one that has chemical additives, different peanut butter brands have a different sodium content. Sodium is an ingredient that's found in healthy peanut butter but should be taken into consideration, especially for those with conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure.Peanut butter typically ranges from 40 mg to 250 mg of sodium per serving of 2 tablespoons., No sugar is required to make peanut butter, but brands typically add it to enhance its flavor. Look for natural ingredients and sweeteners like honey, cane syrup, or agave nectar. Avoid artificial sweeteners like aspartame.If you can't find a peanut butter that uses natural sugars, then find one that's low in sugar.


Peanut butter typically contains one to four grams of sugar per serving.Special peanut butter like Peanut Butter & Co. Cinnamon Raisin Swirl and Sunland Natural Peanut Butter Creamy Chocolate Spread can contain up to 9 grams of sugar., While the idea of reduced saturated fat sounds like a healthy option, it's typically coupled with a ton of unnatural chemicals and additives. Pay attention to brands that tout to be low or reduced fat variations.

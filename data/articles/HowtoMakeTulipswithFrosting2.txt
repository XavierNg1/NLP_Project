 Dab some frosting onto the center of your flower nail. Place a 2-inch (5-centimeter) square of parchment paper on top of the frosting. Gently press down on the parchment paper so that it sticks., Insert a coupler into a piping bag, then fit a large, round tip into it (ie: Wilton 12).Place a cap over the tip, then fill the bag with medium-consistency buttercream frosting. You are using a coupler, because you will be switching out the tips a few times during this method., Place the tip right against the center of the parchment paper. Squeeze on the bag gently while slowly lifting it upward. Stop when you have a tall, coin-sized mound., A curved petal tip looks like a standard petal tip, with one end wider than the other. It's different in that it's curved, like a ")".An example of a curved petal tip would be the Wilton 123., Place the tip straight down against the parchment paper, with the curved part cupped against the side of the mound. Gently squeeze on the bag while pulling upward. Stop when you reach the tip of the mound, then lift the bag away.Don't worry if the tip of the petal flops over. Real flowers aren't perfect either!

, Each petal needs to overlap the previous one by half. You want to pipe two rows of petals, for a total of 6 or 7. This will give your tulips more body and stability., Gently lift the parchment paper off of the flower nail. Set it down onto a baking sheet. At this point, you can move on to the next step, or you can make more tulips., Once you are done making tulips, place the baking sheet into the freezer for 15 minutes. This hardens the tulips enough so that you can peel them away from the parchment paper and set them down onto your cake.

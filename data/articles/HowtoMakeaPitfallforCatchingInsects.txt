 If you have noticed signs of tiny animal or insect activity in a certain place, that might be the best spot to place your pitfall.;
, Use cling film or vegetable oil to coat the container before setting it into the hole. This makes it slippery, so that the quarry cannot escape once trapped.
 Cover it with something like long blades of grass, leaves or very tiny twigs.
 See what you've caught trying to sneak into your flowers or vegetables. After careful examination, set the beastie free to go about its business unharmed.


If you're curious of what you caught and have a digital camera handy, take a few snaps of the insect and upload them onto a forum for gardeners or bug collectors. Be sure to note specifically where and how you caught what you're showing them, and what kind of mayhem you suspect it of wreaking on your landscape. As always, be gracious and polite, especially if users are going out of their way to help figure out what kind of insect you've caught.

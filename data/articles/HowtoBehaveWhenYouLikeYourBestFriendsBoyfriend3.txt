 Being around someone a lot can cause you to develop feelings for that person. If you have been spending lots of time around your girlfriend’s boyfriend, then it might be time to cut back.Try telling your friend something like, “I would really like to spend more time with just you, but I don’t want to interfere with your time with your boyfriend. What would be a good day for just the two of us to hang out?”

, Even though you are not the one who is in a relationship, “breaking up” with your best friend’s boyfriend may be necessary.You can do this by writing a letter to him that you never send, or just imagine that you have broken up with him. Then, grieve the loss of the relationship the way that you would any other relationship. Allow yourself to cry, watch sappy movies, and eat a pint of ice cream.
 Sharing your feelings with someone you can trust may also help you to feel better. Try telling your mom, your sister, or a another trustworthy friend what you have been feeling.Make sure that you tell someone who will keep your secret. Avoid any friend who you know have a hard time keeping this kind of information to themselves.
You can also write about your feelings in a journal. Expressing how you have been feeling through journaling can help you to feel better and process your feelings.
 Having a crush can cause you to neglect your health and well-being, so make sure that you are taking good care of yourself throughout all of this. Try doing something special for yourself, such as buying yourself a new outfit, painting your nails, taking a bubble bath, or taking a yoga class.

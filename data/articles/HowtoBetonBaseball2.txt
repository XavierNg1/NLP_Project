 A moneyline bet is simply picking which team will win the game. If you choose the favourite the payout will be less than if you bet on the underdog to win. The team with the negative sign in front of it is the favourite. The team with the plus sign is the underdog. There is no point spread to consider.For example, if you are betting the Seattle Mariners hosting the New York York Yankees, the moneyline may appear Seattle +170 New York -200. This means that New York is favoured to win and Seattle is the underdog so you get more money if you bet on Seattle and they win. So if you bet $200 on New York you will win $100. However, if you bet $100 on Seattle you could win $170.
 Strategizing is known as handicapping and takes in many factors. Keep in mind that even the best teams will still lose about 40% of their regular season games so it isnâ€™t as easy as betting on the favourite. Watch for things like good pitchers on bad teams, underdogs who play well on their home field, and small favourites over underdogs.Keeping a keen eye during the season allows you to make informed bets. Steadily build your winnings with each well placed bet.
 Once you have chosen the team who you think will win, find a legal sportsbook online or, if gambling is legal at your location, place a bet at a casino, pub, or wherever else sports gambling is accepted.


Research which sportsbook gives the best return to your bet as not all of them set the moneyline the same. The payout is adjusted based on the odds set at the point of betting., This is basically the same as the moneyline but only factors in the score of 5 innings of play. It is similar to placing a bet for the winner of the first half of basketball or football. The odds are usually very similar to the regular moneyline odds; however, the starting pitcher is a significant factor in determining the odds.

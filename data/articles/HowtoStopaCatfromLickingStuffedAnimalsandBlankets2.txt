 Compulsive behavior such as incessant licking may be the effect of boredom or stress. Fortunately, both of these can be diminished via the best possible form of treatment: play. Make sure to play with your cat at least 15 minutes a day.Keep your cat’s daytime environment stimulating by leaving toys – especially ball and string toys designed for cats – in the areas they like to spend time.
Consider getting a fish tank. Cats will happily sit in front of a fish tank and wash fish swim around – an activity that can be both soothing and entertaining.
 Lots of licking of blankets and stuffed animals may simply be an indication that your cat is not feeling entirely secure. Since blankets and stuffed animals are often security items for cats, and many cats enjoy cuddling with these sorts of items while relaxing, incessant licking may indicate an over-attachment to certain items that stems from a lack of attachment to you.Gently pick up your cat and set them on your lap when you’ll be stationary for a while.
They may not like this at first, but repeatedly do so – with gentleness in mind – and pet them softly, if only for a moment. They’ll come to recognize your affection and slowly become more comfortable cuddling with you.
 Cats especially like high places that they can post up in and feel safe. If your cat is dealing with stress, this may be just the trick to calm them down.When you build or install a new cat hang out, furnish it with bedding or toys you know they enjoy to indicate that the space is meant for them.
 If your cat is particularly stressed, and is beginning to lick more and more, a vet may be able to help diagnose the cause.It may even be a medical issue that you’ll need help treating.


Furthermore, your vet can talk to you about medication options, including temporary anti-anxiety drugs.

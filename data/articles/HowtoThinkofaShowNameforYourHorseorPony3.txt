 You can go to the library and look through name books or you can purchase books, if you want. You might be able to find books that are specific to horse names, but it is not uncommon to give a horse a human name so don’t forget to skim through some baby name books.Don't be afraid to use a unique name that isn't used nowadays.
Looking through library books will save you money. Unless you have a lot of horses, you probably will only use the book once, so the library is a good option.
 Some people are great at coming up with cool names. Friends will probably have a fresh perspective, so don’t be afraid to ask for suggestions.


If a friend gives you a suggestion, write it down on your list, and say, “Thank you!” Don’t suggest that you’re going to go with the name just to be polite. They may feel offended if they think you’re going to use their suggestion, and then find out you’ve chosen something else.
 If you live on a ranch or farm that has a name, and you bred your horse yourself, you can name your horse after that. If you keep your horse at a stable, you can include the name of stables. If you are sponsored by someone, you might consider including that person’s name, the name of their ranch/farm/stables, or the name of their business as part of the show name.For example, if you keep your horse at a stable called, “Winter Creek” you could call your horse “Winter Creek’s Surprise.”

 Your power steering system is actually remarkable at staying clean. That said, over time natural wear and tear will cause bits of rubber, plastic, and dirt to enter the fluid, and this can cause problems to the entire system if the fluid is not flushed. Each car has it's own suggested interval after which you should change the fluid, so look up your model's time frame.


For high-end cars, you should consider replacing the fluid every 35-40 thousand miles.;
, Your power steering fluid level should barely change from month to month. If it is changing, then you likely have a leak and should bring your car to an auto shop as soon as possible.Your reservoir usually has a labeled cap or a picture of a steering wheel. If you are having trouble locating this semi-transparent plastic tank, check your owner's manual.
 Open the reservoir and use a flashlight to peer down into the fluid. The consistency, color, and smell will tell you whether or not you need to change your fluid:



Flush your fluid if it smells burnt, looks dark brown or black, and/or has shiny, metallic bits in it.Refresh you fluid if it is darkly colored, your owner's manual recommends it, and/or if you do frequent towing or high-weight driving.

Your fluid is fine if is is lightly colored, dark without metallic bits or chunks, or was replaced in the last two to three years., This could be the sign of more serious, and expensive, power steering problems. The sooner you take care of the issue, the easier and cheaper the repair will be.

 Young adults go through puberty at slightly different times, but will all notice many changes in their bodies as they grow and develop. One big change is that you’ll have a “growth spurt,” or a time that you grow a lot in a short amount of time. Most girls have a growth spurt between ages 10 and 14. Most boys start growing faster between ages 12 and 15 and will keep growing until they’re about 16.Keep in mind that during growth spurts, you may experience an increase in hunger.
 When your hormones start to change during puberty you will notice changes in your body that mean you’re growing and developing. Seeing these changes can be strange at first, but know that it means you’re turning into a more mature teenager. Everyone goes through these changes.


Girls will start to grow breasts, get pubic and underarm hair, and will start to “fill out” or get a little more fat in places like their legs, tummy, and chest as they get older.Boys will start to grow pubic, underarm, and facial hair. They will also notice their penis and testicles getting bigger, their Adam’s apple getting bigger, and their voice getting deeper. It’s normal for your voice to break or crack while it’s getting deeper. This happens to a lot of boys., Most girls will get their period, or start menstruation, after their biggest growth spurt. The average age for girls to start menstruating is 12 1/2, but this can be different for everyone. Starting your period is a sign that your body is getting ready to be able to make babies, a big sign that you’re growing and maturing.Many schools will teach you and prepare you for your body to change with puberty, but some will not. It’s completely okay to ask your parent or doctor about these changes. You can say, "I haven't gotten my period yet. Is that okay?" or, "I think I need a different size bra, mom, could we go shopping together?" Let someone know you have questions and they will be happy to address any concerns you have.

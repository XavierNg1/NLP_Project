 Make sure your Westie's bowl is always full of water, especially during the warmer months of summer.You can provide filtered water if you live somewhere where the tap water isn't very good. Don't give your dog distilled water, as this can lead to mineral deficiencies.Don't use a plastic bowl, as these can become a breeding ground for germs.A glass, metal, or ceramic bowl is best.;
, High-quality dry food is best for West Highland Terriers. They should be fed twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.Depending on the dog's activity level, between one and one and a half cups of kibble per day is usually appropriate.
Avoid kibble containing wheat, corn, and beef. Westies can often be allergic to these ingredients.Westies love chicken, fish, and lamb. These meats are good for this breed of dog, so look for a kibble containing one or more of them., Some West Highland White Terrier owners choose to feed their dogs additional supplements to fortify their health. Two popular choices include:Omega 3 fish oil. Available in gel caplets, fish oil is good for your Westie's skin and immune system.
Brewers yeast, available in special formulations for dogs, are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Brewers yeast also promotes a healthy coat.
Talk to your vet before adding new supplements or significantly changing your dog's diet.

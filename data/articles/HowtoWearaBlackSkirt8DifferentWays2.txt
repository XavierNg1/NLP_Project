 Choose a top in a solid color over one with a graphic. Some graphic t-shirts may work, but you should be cautious when selecting one to pair with your skirt. Avoid baggy shirts.
 Choose black flats or ones that match the color of your shirt.
 Think long necklaces in bold colors, chunky bracelets, and large earrings.
 If you need something to cover your legs, opt for black leggings or dark-wash skinny jeans. Avoid wearing nylon stockings.
 If you alternate between many purses, then consider going with a large shoulder bag made of durable material over more decorative options.

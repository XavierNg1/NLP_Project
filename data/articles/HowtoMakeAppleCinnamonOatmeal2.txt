 Baked oatmeal is usually made in larger portions, and is perfect for feeding a crowd.
 Stir them gently with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. You can peel the apples beforehand, or leave them unpeeled.
 At this point, your oatmeal is ready to be baked, but you can add some extra goodies for more flavor and texture. Here are some ideas to get you started:2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) vanilla extract
½ cup (75 grams) raisins
¼ cup (60 milliliters) maple syrup

, Choose a glass casserole dish, if you can; the oatmeal will cook more evenly. If you'd like to make individual servings instead, fill a muffin pan with cupcake liners instead. This will be enough to make about 16 muffins.
 Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture, and spread it evenly. If you are making individual servings, scoop the mixture into the cupcake liners instead.
 If you are baking the oatmeal in a muffin tin, bake it for only 30 minutes instead.These oatmeal muffins will be more dry than the oatmeal casserole.
 You can serve the oatmeal as is, or you can add a splash of milk or ½ cup (65 grams) of chopped walnuts over the top first.

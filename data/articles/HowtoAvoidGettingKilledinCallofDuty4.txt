Each map has kind of a set weapons set and it varies on the size and terrain of the map; e.g.: the map Overgrown is a sniper map and is ideal for long ranged and powerful weapons like the M40 and or R700 whereas the map Shipment is an assault close quarters map and is best if fast firing automatics are used. So basically anything Automatic with the double tap perk is ideal here.;
, They are there for a reason.
 If you're in the open and your crouched your an ideal target for snipers but if you're in a building trying to sneak around and you run you might go straight into a campers claymore or knife.
,, It is never a wise idea to stay in one place for the entire game because sooner or later, you'll get spammed with grenades. Learn when an enemy is coming. Listen for the footsteps. If you're not using dead silence, as soon as you hear an enemy's footsteps, find cover and don't move. Anticipate the enemy's move and move accordingly. Try to knife no one else is around. And try not to make much noise. His teammate could be his spotter...

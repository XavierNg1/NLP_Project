 In order to find the area of a circle, you'll need to know the radius. This is the measurement of the distance between the center of the circle and the outside edge. You can also find this by taking the diameter, or the measurement of the width of the circle, and dividing it in half.


In the real world, you'll have to measure for yourself but for your homework your teacher should have these measurements listed with the shape.
 Multiply the radius times itself. Let's say we have a radius that is 8 feet. That gives us a value of 64.
 Pi (Ï€) is a really big number that is used in lots of calculations. If you're using a calculator, use the pi function for a really accurate result. If not, you can round pi (ignore some of the numbers) and just multiply by 3.14159. This gives us a value of 201.06176.
 The resulting number, 201.06176 in our case, is the area of the circle. So we get a result of 201.06176 square feet.

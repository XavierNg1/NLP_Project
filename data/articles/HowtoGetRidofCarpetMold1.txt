 If the mold has reached the backing at the base of the carpet, it may take considerable effort to remove. Consider hiring a professional carpet cleaner in this scenario. If the mold has grown across a large portion of the backing, you may need to replace the carpet.;
, Open all windows and doors in the room with the moldy carpet. Air flow will reduce the humidity that encourages mold, and lessen associated odors. If you plan to use a chemical cleaning product, ventilation will reduce the chance of irritating your lungs and eyes.


If there are no windows to the room, turn on a fan pointing toward a doorway.
 If your carpet is removable, move it outside and hang it over a sturdy clothesline. 24â€“48 hours of direct sunlight will help kill mold spores, and remove moisture that encourages mold growth.


If the carpet is soaked through to the backing, not just the upper fibers, it may take much longer to dry. Leave it in direct sun in an area with good ventilation for several days.
 This step will absorb moisture and reduce odors, but further efforts will be required for all but the lightest mold problem. Sprinkle the affected area generously with baking soda, leave on overnight, then vacuum it up.


Talc-free baby powder may be used instead. Avoid baby powder that contains talc, since this can cause serious harm if inhaled.Cat litter may also be used as a substitute.
 Although vinegar does not kill every mold species, it is a cheap and often effective option. Using white vinegar to avoid stains, apply lightly with a spray bottle, and scrub it in with a stiff brush. Blow dry the carpet, or air dry in a well-ventilated area, to avoid leaving moisture that could replenish the mold.


Some people report success mixing their vinegar with an equal part of methylated spirits.

 Upon graduation you must become licensed in order to practice pharmacy. The North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) is a standardized exam used throughout the United States to test pharmacy school graduates on their knowledge of pharmacology. Each state also has specific tests required to practice pharmacy within that state.


You can learn more about state specific licensure through the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.
 In some cases, you may want to further your education to become a specialized pharmacist. For example, if you want to become a clinical pharmacist, you must complete a pharmacy residency and a BPS (Board of Pharmacy Specialties) certification.A pharmacy residency is two years long. The first year consists of generalized training and the second year is specialized training.Specialities are not required.
 Once you are a fully licensed pharmacist, you can begin looking for a job. Search for job openings online with sites like www.indeed.com. Talk to any connections that you made through shadowing, pharmacy school, or residency.


Your first job as a pharmacist may not be exactly what you are looking for. You may have to work odd hours and a pharmacy that is not your first choice.
Don’t expect to “move up the ladder” quickly. Be a hard worker and you will eventually move up.
Even entry level pharmacists make good money. The average entry level pharmacist makes $75,000. Keep in mind that this amount depends on the location of your job.
 There is a lot more to owning your own pharmacy than just pharmaceuticals. There are a lot of startup costs. You will need to know or hire someone who has a business background to handle the marketing and accounting. However, the payoff could be worth it. You will be your own boss, set your own work hours, and potentially make more money.

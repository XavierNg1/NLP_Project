 Although this is an optional step, it can greatly improve the look of your vlog. Titles, credits, music, and random effects can be added with even simple software such a the Windows Movie Maker or the Moon Valley Soft Video Blog Pack. If you have a Mac, iMovie is a great starter video editing program (it comes on every new Mac, so most people should already have it). When you're ready to go more professional and willing to spend more money, programs like Final Cut Pro are out there as well.

 If you want to commit to a diary practice and avoid getting bored, then you need to start with a diary you like. For some people this might be a simple composition notebook, for others a nice leather-bound journal is what you need. Look for a diary, notebook, or journal that you connect with, and start writing.Diaries and journals are often sold at bookstores and greeting card stores.
Various styles of notebooks can be found at office supply stores.
Try checking out unlined sketchbooks. You can find these at art supply stores.
 In addition to finding a diary that you like, you need to figure out which writing materials work best for you. Maybe you are happy with a ballpoint pen, or maybe you like gel pens. Perhaps you need to use lots of colors so a set of nice colored pens, or even colored pencils is more your speed. Try out different writing utensils until you find your perfect fit, and keep yourself interested.
 Another way to connect with your diary (and keep the boredom away) is to personalize it! Glue images or stickers to the outside or write inspirational quotes on the inside. Find a way to make it your own! If you donâ€™t want to spend a lot of money on a fancy journal, pick up a cheap notebook and make it beautiful., A great way to keep yourself from getting bored with your diary is to use mixed materials. This can mean using crayon, colored pencils, or paints. Or this can mean attaching mementoes from your life to some of the pages (like a scrapbook). Using a variety of materials is a fun way to document your life that can keep you from getting bored.

 You can type up your permission slips using a program like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages. For most cases, use a clear and standard font such as Times New Roman or Arial in size 11 or 12.;
, Answer all the questions that pertain to the specific activity. These could include: who, what, when, where, why, how much, as well as the means of transportation. This information, which summarizes the trip, should be at the top of the document. Here is an example of how these questions can be answered in the permission slip:Who: Mrs. Tucker’s English class
What: The class will be taking a trip to the Alberta Street Library.
When: 8:30am - 11:30am, Friday, May 10th, 2019
Where: The Alberta Street Library
Why: The class will be going to take a tour of the library.
Cost: No cost
Means of Transportation: We will take a school bus.
 You need to have a statement where the parent or guardian writes that they give permission for their child to take the trip. Here is an example of this line: I, (parent or guardian’s name), give permission for my child, (child’s name), to attend the field trip to (location of field trip) with (organization or adult’s name who is leading the trip).
 If a child has specific allergies or a medical condition, or if the trip is over an extended period of time, include space for the parent or guardian to give information about allergies and medical conditions.


Write this as, “Relevant Allergies/Medical Conditions:_________.”

, Create a line for an emergency contact phone number on the slip. This is the person that can be called if something happens to the child and their parent or guardian can't be reached.You can write "Emergency Contact Name: _________" and "Emergency Contact Phone Number: _________."

, Perhaps the most important part of the permission slip is the parent or guardian’s signature. At the bottom of all the information about the trip, the parent or guardian needs to sign the paper! Write “Parent or Guardian Signature: _________” at the bottom of the slip.

 The denominator is the number on the bottom of the fraction. You need to make them the same in order to add the fractions together. This is done by multiplying (or dividing) both the top and bottom number on one of the fractions, until the bottom number equals the bottom number in the other fraction. For example, let's say that you want to add 1/8 and 3/4:


You need to make the 4 and the 8 the same. How do you turn a 4 into an 8? Multiply by 2!
Multiply the 3 and the 4 in the 3/4 fraction by 2. This gives you 6/8.
 The numerator is the number on the top of the fraction. Now that you have 1/8 and 6/8, add the 1 and the 6 together to get 7.
 Take the added numerators and place them over the top of the denominator. The denominator stays the same. This means that the sum of the fractions is 7/8.
 You may want to make the fraction simpler to read, by using the smallest numbers possible in the top and bottom spots to convey the same over-all amount. In this example, we do not need to simplify it. It's as small as it can get. But if you had a fraction that was, say, 3/6, you might want to make that simpler.


This is done by finding the smallest number that both the numerator and denominator are divisible by. In this case, it's 3. Divide each number by 3 to get the reduced fraction, in this case 1/2.

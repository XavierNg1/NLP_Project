 In particular, this applies to white-coated cats (this means cats that are entirely white) whose eyes are either both blue, both orange, or one of each color. Their deafness is linked to a fault in the "W"- white coat pigment gene.
 It is thought that 25% of these cats are totally deaf, 50% are deaf in just one ear, and 25% have normal hearing.Breeds that commonly have the W-gene include:


White Oriental Shorthair, White Persian, White Exotic Shorthair, White Manx, White British Shorthair, White Devon Rex, White American Shorthair, White Cornish Rex, White American Wirehair, Foreign White, White Turkish Angora, European White, and White Scottish Fold.
 Just like humans, cats often experience at least a small amount of deafness as they get older.

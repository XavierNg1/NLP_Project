 It is fairly easy to get to level 8, and you do not need a lot of stuff to do that.;
, Then redo it and redo it. This might sound boring, but there is no other really good way to get engrams.
 When you get to higher levels, and more strikes are unlocked, then do them. And redo them often.
 That way, you will get better results and better engrams.
 Once you are level 5, the Crucible can be a very good source of engrams. You just have to get good, because it is hard at first.
 This is another great way to get engrams. They are harder, get you better stuff, and are more fun than constantly repeating strikes or Crucible missions.
 These are yet another way to get engrams. They are like super-hard versions of the missions.
 This is very profitable when you have high-level friends to back you up.
 These are also a good equipment getter, but cannot be accessed until you are at a very high level.
 You can get you good money for buying engrams yourself.

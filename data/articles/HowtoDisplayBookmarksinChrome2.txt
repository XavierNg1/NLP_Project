 From late 2014 until June 2015, Chrome experimented with a more visual, tile-based Bookmark Manager.If you haven't updated Chrome since that time, the instructions below will not match your browser.


If you're in the minority of users who preferred the visual system, install the Bookmark Manager extension from the Chrome Web Store.
Apart from this temporary change, the Bookmark Manager has stayed mostly the same since a revamp in 2010 (version 5) and bug fixes in 2011 (version 15)., Press Ctrl + ⌥ Option + B on Windows, or ⌘ Command + ⌥ Option + B on Mac. This opens Bookmark Manager in a new tab.


You can also use the Bookmarks option in the top menu or the menu button, or right-click the Bookmarks Bar and select it from the drop down menu.
 Click on the Bookmarks Bar folder in the left pane. Drag the individual bookmarks in the right pane in whatever order you like. Drag bookmarks you don't use often to the Other Bookmarks folder. This folder always exists, but will not show up on your bar unless it has something in it.
 Click the word Folders at the top of the left pane, then Add Folder. This will create a folder inside whichever folder you have selected. Drag bookmarks into folders however you would like them organized.


All bookmarks and folders will show up inside "Bookmarks Bar" or "Other Bookmarks." You cannot delete or rename these top-level folders.
 Choose a folder in the left pane. Above the right pane, click the word Organize. Select "Reorder by title" to arrange all bookmarks in that folder alphabetically.

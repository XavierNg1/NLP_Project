 Use a plastic putty knife to remove any excess nail polish from the wood or laminate surface. It should come off easily but if it is resistant, dampen a cloth with warm water, and let it sit on the spill for thirty seconds. This should loosen the polish.
 Pour the denatured alcohol on a cloth, and lightly rub it against the stain. Do not rub too hard for too long because it could take off the paint or wood finish. Always scrub with the wood grain, and not against it.
 If you use 0000-grade fine stainless-steel wool, it should be gentle enough to take up nail polish but not harm the wood. Just be sure to scrub gently and in the same direction as the grain in the wood.

The fabric of the top must not be see-through.
The shirt should be loose-fitting and not cling to the skin ("bodycon" style).
The hem of the shirt should be at least several inches below the top of the skirt so that when you lift your arms or bend over, no skin is exposed.
The neckline should cover at least the lowest part of the neck.
If the shirt has buttons (full button-down or polo style), all buttons should be buttoned, including the top button. If this is uncomfortable, either purchase a larger size for a larger neck or wear another garment underneath, and the top button can be open.

It is recommended that you use a pin of some type to cover the top button. This serves as a reminder not to unconsciously undo the top button. If you do not like wearing flashy jewelry, the pin can be of a flat-looking neutral metal.

,,, But not all skirts may be tznius for you, depending on your custom, some women only wear skirts well past thier knees and others will be okay with just covering them, also many skirts have slits which makes them non-Tznius.

Try on all skirts on the store to be sure they are long enough to meet your standards. Due to height variations, a skirt that comes down to the ankles on one person may only go down to the knees on another.
 There are a variety of hair coverings on the market available, including wigs (sheitel), snoods, headscarves, and hats. Stores in your community probably sell these for this purpose.

 You can open a list of your recent downloads in Chrome by clicking the Menu button (☰) and selecting Downloads, or by pressing Ctrl+J (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd+J (Mac).
 Chrome stores download history for a few weeks unless it's been cleared. Clicking any item in the list will attempt to open it (if it still exists). You can also click the "Show in folder" link to open the folder with that particular file selected.
 Click the "Open downloads folder" link in the upper-right to open the folder that Chrome downloads your files to. By default, this is the Downloads folder in your user directory.
 Click the Chrome Menu button (☰) and select Settings. Scroll down and click the "Show advanced settings" link. In the "Downloads" section, you can set a new folder for your Chrome downloads to be placed by clicking Change....


You can also choose whether Chrome should prompt you to save a file when downloading.

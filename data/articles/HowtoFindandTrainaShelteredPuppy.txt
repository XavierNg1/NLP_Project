 Research breeds and decide on one or a few that fit your lifestyle.You might decide on making your puppy a family pet, a good friend, a show dog, or a watch dog.


Make sure your landlord allows dogs, if renting.
Anticipate how much time he will need for exercise every day and if you are able to provide it.
Make sure you can afford food, toys, treats, and vet expenses.;
, When you find the puppy you like, before taking it in, ask to examine him/her to see if he/she is sick or injured. If the puppy is sick/injured be prepared to spend your time and money to make the puppy better and see if it is suitable to the surroundings in your house. Specifically check for a constant potbelly, eye discoloration, discharge, general stance, extensive licking one area, or avoidance to putting weight on or being touched in an area., Though these are not 100% reliable (as the puppy's environment helps shape his character), it can provide a good baseline. Before deciding on a puppy it is best to observe the dog to see it's personality and how it acts towards other people, items, animals, noises, and environments. It is also a good idea to see what the dam(mother) and sire(father) are like as your puppy will most likely be very similar in traits.
 See if your puppy needs vaccines or any other treatment. While at the vet you can also get your pet microchipped, which is important for when trying to find him/her when she/he gets lost.
 Before taking the pup home you must have everyday dog essentials ready like a dog bed, food, water/food bowl, dog toys, treats, a dog collar, a dog harness, a kennel, a leash, etc. .
 This can be achieved through a professional positive reinforcement traineror owner training using resources such as YouTube tutorials or books.

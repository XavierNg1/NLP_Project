 Crack open an egg over a bowl and transfer the yolk back and forth between the two shells. Each time the yolk falls into a shall, a little bit of the egg white should fall into the bowl. Keep doing this until all of the egg white is in the bowl. Save the egg yolk and discard the egg white (or save it for another recipe). Egg yolks not only help nourish and moisturize your skin, but they may also help reduce the appearance of blemishes.


You can use the egg white to make a simple face mask. To learn how to make one, refer to the section in this article on making a simple mask.
 Peel a banana open, and cut it to smaller pieces with a knife. Use a fork to mash it to a pulp. The banana will help nourish your face.
 You will need 2 teaspoons of olive oil. The olive oil will moisturize your face, leaving the skin feeling soft and smooth. If you do not have olive oil, you can use coconut oil instead, which is also very moisturizing.
 Use warm water to help open up your pores. If you are wearing makeup, you will need to take it off using makeup remover. As this mask can get messy, it would be a good idea to tie or pin your hair back. You may also want to consider draping a towel over your chest and shoulders to protect your clothes.
 You can use your fingers, a cotton ball, or even a cloth. Avoid the areas around your nose, mouth, and eyes.
 To prevent the mask from dripping everywhere, consider laying down or sitting in a comfortable chair with your head tilted back. You can also use this mask in the bathtub while you are soaking or taking a relaxing bath.
 Use lukewarm water to rinse your face off. Try not to scrub too hard. Gently pat your face dry with a soft, clean towel.

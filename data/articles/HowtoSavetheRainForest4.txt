 If you want to help save the rainforest, there are five steps you can take, represented by the acronym “TREES.” “T” stands for “teach others.” Education and awareness are the most powerful tools for change. You can take steps towards saving the rainforest by teaching those around you how important it is to do so!, The “R” in the acronym stands for “restore ecosystems.” Despite the devastation already experienced by many of the world’s rainforests, these lush ecosystems are still capable of healing. In order for the rainforest to be “saved,” efforts must be made to replant lost trees, and help these delicate ecosystems recuperate.One way that you can contribute aid to the restoration of the rainforest is through ecotourism.
 The first “E” stands for “encourage sustainable living.” No amount of restoration can help the rainforests if the practices of using rainforest resources don’t change. In order to save the rainforest, farmers, companies, and individuals need to learn and embody sustainable practices.You can help support these efforts by donating to a rainforest organization, or by participating in ecotourism.
 The second “E” stands for “establish parks.” National Parks are protected lands that cannot be changed, developed, or otherwise used for commercial purposes. Expanding areas of protected National Park land is one of the most important efforts toward saving the rainforest. You can sign numerous petitions through Rainforest Rescue to help establish and preserve rainforest National Parks., Finally, the “S” stands for “support companies that minimize damage.” This means purchasing products from companies that use sustainable practices and who work to support the rainforest. Some of these companies include Artisana Foods, Newman’s Own Organics, Rainforest Foods Company, and Amazon Herb Company.

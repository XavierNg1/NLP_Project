 Do not use a collar because cats will probably manage to escape. Furthermore if a cat tugs on her collar it can damage her windpipe, whereas a harness will distribute the pressure more evenly, causing less damage.;
, If she doesn't want to, just play, do not force her to wear it. It may take days, weeks or months before your cat will let you put his harness on and guide her with the leash.
 Most cats probably won't like being restrained or lead around by a mere human. Some cats will never let you put the harness on them without freaking out, and you should respect this. Never force the harness on a cat if it is having a fit.
 Let your cat get used to it!

, If your cat is an indoor cat, it will be very different for her outside. Let her adjust to the new noises/smells/etc. Be prepared to sit with her and wait for her to be ready to walk.
, Be ready to pick your kitty up and take her home if she is in danger or scared. Be sensible and take precautions such as carrying your cat across roads.

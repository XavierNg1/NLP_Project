 This means everything: clothes, makeup, hair products, accessories etc. Once you've got everything you need to get ready, get started straight away.;
, Give yourself enough time to get ready so you're not running around last minute looking for your favourite earrings. Make sure you have a reasonable time to meet up and also arrange your travel too. Are you taking a taxi? Or the bus? Or maybe taking the car? Make sure you have all those things planned.
 Take a bath or a shower, to relax you first. Use bath bombs, bubble bath and a refreshing shower gel.
 Choose your favourite shampoo and conditioner and wash your hair.
 If you are a teenager shaving may not apply to you. But if you do shave, then go ahead. Make sure you use lots of shaving gel or foam to help with little cuts and nicks. And use a good brand razor instead of a cheap one as they tend to break easier, they can cause cuts and nicks and they don't work as well at removing hair.
 If you want, use a facial too. But when you get out of the bath/shower moisturize and if you need to use tanning lotion then go ahead.
 Then, dress to impress. Choose your outfit carefully, and work it around where you're going and what you'll be doing that day.
 Add accessories, to build on your outfit.
 This part may not apply to you if you don't use makeup. But if you do, wear a little foundation, concealer, powder, blusher and mascara. Or wear heavy eye makeup if you're going out.
 Your hair says a lot about you. If you just throw it on top of your head, you'll look like a rag-doll. But if you wear it neat and tidy you'll look "try-too-hard". So basically, just wear your hair according to your outfit.
 (Hair bobble, some gum/mints, keys, makeup etc.) Once you've done that you're good to go.

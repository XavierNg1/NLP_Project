 When you create your "references" page at the end of your essay, you will need to give a list of your citations. When you do this, write them so that the first line is flush to the margin, and additional lines are indented.


There should be no line spaces between items on a references list. Your ability to tell citations apart will come from the first line being aligned with the left margin.
Do not number your citations, use only the indents to tell them apart.;
, Your entire "references" page should be listed in order alphabetically by the last name of the authors. The authors listed in individual citations do not need to be put in alphabetical order, but should be listed in the order they are named on their work(s).
 Throughout all of your citations, make sure that the names of all authors, titles of books and other works, and all directly cited and previously capitalized words are left in the upper-case.
 In APA format, all authors names are cited with the last name, then first name. For a single author, you can list both their first and last names. For multiple authors, cite their last name and their first initial. A citation with more than three authors must have all the names listed in the reference citation, but can be simply listed as (author 1, et al.) in your in-text citations.
 For large works such as complete books, journals, or magazines, italicize the title of the piece. You can also choose to underline the name of the work as well. If you are referencing only part of a journal entry or chapter of a book, you do not need to italicize it. Always make sure that the major words of the title are capitalized as well.

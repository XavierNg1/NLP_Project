 Locate the Hangouts icon on your home screen and tap it to launch.


If you don’t have this app yet, you can get it from the App Store.
 Touch the phone icon, and tap the dialing pad icon at the top right corner to open the dialing pad.
 Enter the phone number in the field and tap “Call.” You can also tap “People” to search for contacts to call, and then tap “Call” on the contact details page to make the call.


Calls from the Hangouts app won’t use your carrier’s minutes, but it will use your data plan if you’re not connected to a Wi-Fi network.
Most calls within the US and Canada are free, but to call international will cost credit. Make sure you have enough credits by accessing your Google Voice account via a computer web browser or your iOS device’s browser.

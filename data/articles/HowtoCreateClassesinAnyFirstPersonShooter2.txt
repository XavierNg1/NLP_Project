 When it comes down to using perks, use perks that can help you out in the battlefield.


Examples would be if you keep flinching while ADS(Aim Down Sights) get a perk that would reduce the flinch like Focus or Toughness. Another example would be if your gun is slowing you down, get a perk that would speed you up
(Optional) The best things about perks is that it can complement your gun and your attachments so try out each perk and see which one matches with your gun.
Example will be quickdraw with dexterity. Quickdraw bring your ADS up faster and dexterity brings up your ADS faster when sprinting. Combine these two and its going to be 3x faster bringing up the ADS when sprinting.

 Before you can use this scrub, you will need to make sure that your face is clean and free of makeup. Use warm water and your favorite face wash. Gently pat your face dry with a soft, clean towel.
 This will help make the mask even more effective. You can open your pores up by leaning over a bowl of hot water so that the steam hits your face. You can also hold a hot towel against your face. Do this for a few minutes., Because this mask contains honey, it can get very sticky, especially if it gets into your hair. You can prevent a sticky, hairy mess by pulling your hair back and securing it with a headband, hair clip, or hair tie.
 A small dessert bowl or a cup would be ideal. Whatever you decide to use, make sure that you can easily reach into it; you will be applying the scrub with your fingers.
 You will need 1 teaspoon of raw honey, 1 teaspoon of milk, and 1 tablespoon (14.8Â ml) of ground almonds. If you do not have ground almonds, or if you cannot find ground almonds, you can make your own by grinding some almonds in a blender, coffee grinder, or food processor.
 Using a spoon, mix the milk, honey, and ground almonds until you get a thick paste.
 Scoop the scrub out of the container using your fingers and apply it to your face. Gently massage it across your skin, so that the almond grains can exfoliate your skin. Avoid the sensitive areas around your nose, mouth, and eyes.
 Use cool water, and gently massage your face until you have rinsed the mask off completely. Rinse off with warm water.
 Do not rub your face with the towel. Instead, gently press the towel against your face in a light, tapping motion., If you wish, you can wipe your face with a cotton ball soaked in toner, and apply some moisturizer afterward. The toner will help tighten the pore and restore the pH of your skin, while the moisturizer will help lock the moisture in.,

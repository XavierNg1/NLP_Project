 Purchase a graphing calculator if you don't have one. Be prepared with all the supplies you need to take the test as if it were the "real deal.";
, Record your score.
 Did you run out of time unexpectedly? Are the questions too hard? Did not you remember covering a particular section in school?

If you have the time problem, the best you can do is to do at least one test every day to understand the structure better and practice using your calculator.
If questions are too hard, identify the field where you have knowledge gaps. Review material you had in class, and read through a textbook once more. Most of the test books have theoretical material too. Understand the explanations in the answers, and hire a tutor if you need it.
 If you did not cover a given section of the math knowledge in school yet, become a self-learner! Dive into the SAT study books and your textbook, and talk to a teacher if you need to. You can also hire an SAT tutor or go to an SAT prep class, and ask for attention on that particular area of weakness.

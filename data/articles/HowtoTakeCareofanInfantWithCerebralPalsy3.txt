 Be sure to address the physical and learning challenges your child may face. The sooner your infant gets started the better.



It is best to start physical therapy immediately. Treatment will help improve your infant's mobility. A wide range of exercises and equipment will help your infant achieve or improve his mobility.
Start your infant with occupational therapy. This therapy addresses and works with the muscles in the wrist, hand and fingers. It also works on facial expressions, tongue control and swallowing.
Speech therapy consists of exercise and routines to strengthen your child's speech muscles to improve the oral motor skills required for speech.
Psychotherapy works to improve or eliminate behavioral issues in your child. It provides support, encouragement and self-esteem, and it reinforces positive actions.
 Join a local support group for parents who have children with CP. You may find it helpful to discuss treatment, therapy and some of the challenges you are facing with a child who has cerebral palsy with other parents of CP children.

 Though there may be many forms of Qi Gong, all of these forms fit within three types. One of these types is medical Qigong. Medical Qigong is the most popular, and also the oldest type. Medical Qigong focuses on movement and breathing to help promote self-healing.


Within this type of Qigong there are two sub-types: self-healing Qigong and external Qigong (also called Qi Emission). Self-healing Qigong will allow you to practice Qigong to heal your own ailments. External Qigong will allow a Qigong healer to influence the Qi of other people in order to help heal them.You can use Qigong movements to promote self-healing. If you become skilled in using Qi, you can use your skills to help heal others.
 Martial Qigong is used by practitioners to improve their physical capacities. You have probably seen movies where martial artists break bricks with their hands or pull of other impressive physical tasks, and practicing martial Qigong allows these martial artists to learn how to use Qi to accomplish these things.Donâ€™t think that you will be able to break a brick with your bare hands after a couple of weeks of practicing. Martial Qigong requires a very disciplined student and years of practice.
 Spiritual Qigong uses meditation, mantras, hand positions, and prayers in pursuit of reaching enlightenment. While this may sound like the most relaxing type of Qigong, this type probably requires the most effort and discipline as those who practice spiritual Qigong must train their Qi to a much deeper level.The main goals of this type of Qigong are to teach the student discipline in order to become more self-aware, tranquil, and harmonious with their own bodies.

 You cannot write in it if you don't have it! When you're getting from place to place, though, consider stowing it in a purse or bag to avoid drawing too much attention to your private writing.;
, Writing in public can be a bit trickier than writing in the privacy of your room or office. Find a spot where you can sit and write comfortably, without being right in the center of attention. When you've got a good spot, take your journal out of your purse/bag/fanny pack and open it to a clean page.


If you want, before you start writing, you can go somewhere less busy, such as the corner of a party, or exit the room.
 Journal writing is a personal experience and pursuit, so you don't have to announce it. There's no guarantee someone will even notice.
 If someone notices, don't lie. Just say you have personal things to write down - you don't have to elaborate on what you're doing or why you're doing it now. Steer the conversation towards writing or journaling in general, without focusing on the private thoughts you're documenting (unless you want to). It may even start a conversation!

, Remember, there is nothing bad about keeping a diary or a journal. Just do your thing, and write down your thoughts when you feel the need. When you're done, you can return to whatever other activities you were doing before.


If public journal writing becomes a "big deal" for you for some reason, you can always hold off until you're in a private place. If desired, you can jot down a couple of basic words and thoughts while in public so that you don't forget them, and then elaborate on them in private.

 Place ½ pound (227 g) of pitted olives in a colander or a bowl with a strainer, and set them under cool running water. Wash the olives thoroughly to remove the any excess salt or vinegar from them.You can use black or green olives for the tapenade. A combination of the two also works well.;
, Once the olives are rinsed, place them in the bowl of a food processor with 2 anchovy fillets that have been rinsed, 1 minced garlic clove, 2 tablespoons (16 g) of capers, 2 to 3 fresh basil leaves, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of extra virgin olive oil. Process the mixture to combine the ingredients into a coarse paste.It typically takes 1 to 2 minutes to process the mixture to the right consistency for the tapenade.
Make sure to periodically stop the food processor and scrape down the sides to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.
 When you’ve finished mixing the tapenade, scoop it out of the food processor and place it in a bowl. Serve it alongside crackers, baguette toasts, or tortilla chips.Traditional olive tapenade also makes a tasty sandwich spread or topping for grilled meat.

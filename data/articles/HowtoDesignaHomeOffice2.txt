 When you choose your desk, focus on your posture. Your back should be straight or slightly reclined and your shoulders should be relaxed. Find a desk that lets you sit with your thighs and forearms at right angles to the floor. Your head should be level and you should look slightly down at your monitor or reading material.Consider a stand-sit desk if you like the freedom to both stand and sit while you work.
 Find a chair that is about 17-19 inches or about 43-48 centimeters deep with good lower back support. You might consider a chair with height-adjustable lumbar support. Position your chair so that your feet are on the floor or get a footrest to keep your knees parallel to the floor.Your chair should let you line up your wrists with your forearms.
Make sure you can comfortably shift your position in your chair throughout your workday to help with circulation.
 To keep all of your supplies, references, and work materials in your home office, you will need bookshelves and other storage. Start by grouping the same types of work materials together. Next find the shelves and other types of storage that will fit the materials you need for your work.You can use bookshelves or you can hang shelving.
Use your space wisely by hanging filing and storage systems on your walls or the backs of doors.
Create a filing system that makes sense so you can retrieve papers easily.

 Know when it's freezing and when it's simply taking its time. If WMM doesn't respond to a command, wait a minute to see if it's 'getting there' or has decided to ignore you and freeze. Once you're sure, proceed.;
, One of Windows Movie Maker's saving graces is that it has an auto-save feature. In case you didn't recently save, wait patiently for at least thirty seconds so this feature saves your project.
 Don't be fooled if it tells you WMM is "running". Hit End Task and wait for the pop-up 'this program is not responding'.
 Don't worry about its notice on how 'all unsaved data will be lost'. You just activated auto-save, remember?

, In most cases, it will have saved your project. Click 'upload files now' and wait.
 Go to the File menu, click Save As, and enter your former project name. This is to prevent you from working on four different 'Untitled' projects at the same time.
 Unfortunately, this will most likely not be the last time WMM freezes. However, if you wish to keep using it, you have to make do with it!

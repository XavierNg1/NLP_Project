 If you're in a college course, your professor will hand you a syllabus at the beginning of the semester. Often, if the professor is going to offer extra credit, she will put it on the syllabus somewhere. She may go over it at the beginning of the semester, but she may not. Take the time to read your syllabus.In a high school class, your teacher may tell you about projects you can do for extra credit at the beginning of the school year.
Make notes about those projects, and ask your teacher for more information if you feel like she didn't provide enough details.
 Your teacher or professor may offer opportunities throughout the semester or school year. These opportunities could be anything from an extra project to attending a concert related to class material.Try to take advantage of these opportunities even if you don't think you'll need them.
 Study hard for tests, and pay attention to extra material in the class. Teachers and professors will often offer bonus questions on tests. These questions are sometimes harder than the regular questions or may make use of some miniscule detail. Other times, they may be something silly and have an obvious, easy answer. Take advantage of them.

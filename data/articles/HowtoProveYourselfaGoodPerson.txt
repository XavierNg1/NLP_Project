 If you're not comfortable, most people can detect your uneasiness. Don't do things you don't like or feel uncomfortable doing. Don't change yourself to please others. It's your life, your choice. You may be happy in the short term when you are able to please someone, but in the long term it is unlikely to work out. Do things that make you feel good about yourself and give meaning to your life. Keep in mind that nobody has the exact same mind and or experience. That's what makes us unique individuals.;
, The effect of making the other person lose self esteem does not always take place immediately. Watch what you say and do. Avoid religious intolerance, racism, sexism, stereotypes, criticism, and hate.
 It will make their day.
, We're all meant to be different.
 As much as some people would like to believe otherwise, nobody is perfect.
 This is emotional abuse. Gossiping, starting rumors, carrying on rumors, exaggerating and backstabbing, along with others in its category can make people not like you, but even hate you. It's hurtful and nobody gains anything from it. Don't be one of those people that get a temporary boost by putting others down.
 This step is easier said than done, but achieving it will lift the weights off of your heart. Untying the knot will give you more time to focus on the people and things that are more important to you.
 Keep others' opinions in mind, and be aware when warnings are given to you, but don't be a sheep! Your friends may hate Ricky, but that doesn't mean he's a terrible person. Get to know him yourself.
 It is so much easier to enjoy yourself this way, and people are usually attracted to individuals that are cheerful, because really, most if not all people want to feel that joy.

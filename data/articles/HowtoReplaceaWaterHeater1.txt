 Water heaters will usually last somewhere between 8 to 15 years. If your water heater has stopped working, there's a good chance that it will need to be replaced.


If you notice water dripping from the bottom of your tank or sitting in a rusty pool beneath it, this means that the steel tank has rusted through. This kind of damage is not fixable and the tank will need to be replaced.
However, if you are experiencing problems such as insufficient or no hot water, your heater may just need to be fixed rather than replaced. If you're unsure what the problem is, call a professional plumber.;
, Plumbing codes vary by region, so it's a good idea to call your local plumbing inspector to find out the specific requirements for your area and whether you need to get a permit before replacing your heater.


It is also a good idea to provide a description of the new water heater and the materials you intend to use while installing it. The plumbing inspector may have some useful feedback or advice that will help you with your installation.
If this is your first time replacing a water heater and you are concerned with safety, you can request for a local plumbing or electrical inspector to check your work.

 Set the glass on small plates so you can catch the overflow from the fizz. Pour the soda slowly to keep it from overflowing.


For best results, start with chilled soda.
You can also chill your glass by setting it in the freezer for about 10 minutes beforehand.
Pouring the soda first and then adding the ice cream will result in a small amount of foam. If you prefer a float with more foam, add the ice cream to the cup before the soda.;
, Slowly add one scoop of vanilla ice cream into each glass. If you have more room, and you prefer more ice cream, add another scoop.


For best results, make sure your ice cream is very cold. If it gets too hard to scoop, you can leave it on the counter for a few minutes to soften.
If the ice cream sticks, use a spoon to push it off the scooper unto the cup.
 Drizzle a small amount of cola on top of the ice cream. This will turn to foam. Keep pouring until your glass is full.


Tilt your glass slightly and pour the cola slowly to reduce foam.
Fill your cup into the coke is just higher than the ice cream.
 Let your float sit a while. Give it about 5-10 minutes for the ice cream to melt but not too long, or it won't be cold enough.


Stir until it reaches a consistency somewhere between "ice cream soup" and a milkshake. Add cola to thin it or ice cream to thicken it as you desire.
 Dip a spoon in your cup and top it off with a straw. Eat your float slowly, starting with the cold frozen foam on top, scooping ice cream and cola together with your spoon. Use the straw to sip the remainder of creamy cola left in the glass.

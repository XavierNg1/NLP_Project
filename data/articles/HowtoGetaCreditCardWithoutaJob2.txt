 If you are currently enrolled in college and you have assets, investments, or a trust fund, you may qualify for a student credit card. Review some student credit card offers to see if there is one that seems appealing to you.
 In most cases, you can apply for a student credit card online. However, some banks offer special deals on student credit cards to their current account holders. If you would rather try to get a credit card through your bank, you will need to go to your bank with identification and your Social Security Number.


When you arrive at the bank, ask to speak to an account representative.
When you meet with the account representative, say “I would like a credit card application.”
If the account representative asks if you have a job, say “No, but I have assets and demonstrable income.”

, Once you have found a credit card that seems like a good fit for you, complete the application. Fill in each part of the application and review it to make sure that all of the information is correct. After you have completed the application, return the form to the account representative or submit the application if you are applying for a card online.

 For some patients, the symptoms of CIDP are mild and manageable without medications. Talk to your doctor about whether you might benefit from medications, or if your CIDP can be managed with physical therapy alone., Corticosteriods, such as prednisone, are often the first treatment offered to people with CIDP. This medication may be given by mouth daily, or injected monthly, with doses decreasing over time.It can take 5-8 weeks to see improvements with steroid medication.
Corticosteroids have been shown to improve coordination, strength, and speed.
Side effects include irritability and weight gain.
 Intravenous immunoglobulin (or IVIg) is a sterile solution of antibodies taken from thousands of healthy people, and injected into your arm. This solution is given via IV over a period of 2-5 days.Ideally, this procedure is repeated each month.
Side effects can include headache, fever, chills, rapid heart beat, muscle aches, and high blood pressure.
 Plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange) is a procedure whereby plasma is removed from the blood and replaced with another fluid. This is done through a catheter inserted under the collarbone. Initially, plasma exchange is done five times (every other day for ten days).Benefits can last around 3-4 weeks (when procedure is not repeated).
Rare complications can include abnormal heart beat, salt imbalances, red blood cell damage, low blood calcium, infection, and/or bleeding.

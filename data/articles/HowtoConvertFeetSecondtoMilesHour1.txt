 The fraction will have feet in the numerator and seconds in the denominator. The number of feet per second should be given to you. The rate should be per second, so you should have a 1 in the denominator.For example if you are converting 500 feet per second to miles per hour, your ratio will look like this:500feet1second{\displaystyle {\frac {500{\text{feet}}}{1{\text{second}}}}}.
;
, There are 5,280 feet in a mile.So, to convert, divide the number of feet by 5,280. Rewrite your ratio in terms of miles per second.

For example, if you are converting 500 feet per second, you would calculate 5005,280=.095{\displaystyle {\frac {500}{5,280}}=.095}. So, your new ratio is .095miles1second{\displaystyle {\frac {.095{\text{miles}}}{1{\text{second}}}}}.
 This is the conversion of 1 second to hours, found by dividing 1 by 3,600 since there are 3,600 seconds in 1 hour.

For example, your new ratio is .095miles.00028hours{\displaystyle {\frac {.095{\text{miles}}}{.00028{\text{hours}}}}}.
 This means the rate of miles per 1 hour. To do this, divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator.For example, .095miles.00028hours=339.29miles1hour{\displaystyle {\frac {.095{\text{miles}}}{.00028{\text{hours}}}}={\frac {339.29{\text{miles}}}{1{\text{hour}}}}}. So, 500 feet per second converts to 339.29 mph.

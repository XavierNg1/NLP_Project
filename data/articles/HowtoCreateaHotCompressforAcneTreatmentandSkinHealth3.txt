 After applying a warm compress to your face, wash your face with anti-acne cleanser or simply with mild cleanser and then splash your face with some cool water to close your pores. This will also help to calm down any inflammation from the heat., Once the pimple has come to a head, apply a spot treatment to your pimple. Products containing salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or sulfur can be applied to the pimple after the compress. These ingredients are effective over-the-counter treatments for acne.Because the compress has opened your pores, the medicine may be more easily absorbed by your skin.
 Picking, popping, or squeezing your acne increases your risk of scarring and blemishes that can take longer to clear up.You can apply gently pressure to both sides of your pimple using cotton swabs. If anything is ready to come out, it will. Never squeeze your pimple or use your fingers., If your compress does not work and your acne does not improve, see a dermatologist. Some acne cannot be controlled with over-the-counter treatments alone. Your doctor can prescribe you more effective drugs that are not available over-the-counter.A dermatologist can help you control your acne, prevent future breakouts, and reduce scarring and dark spots.


Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of any medications that you are prescribed. Also let your doctor know about the treatments you have been using at home.
 If your pimple has not gone down after you applied the compress and a topical acne medication, you can use makeup to make it less noticeable until it heals. Look for non-comedogenic cosmetics that offer light coverage. Heavy foundations and concealers will not allow your skin to breathe and can make your acne worse. There are several concealers available OTC that contain anti-acne and anti-blemish medication.


Mineral makeup that does not contain bismuth oxychloride and dimethicone is recommended.

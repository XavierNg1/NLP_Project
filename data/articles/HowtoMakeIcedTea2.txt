 Use the same method you would use to make simple iced tea: just boil 2 cups of water, steep 3-5 tea bags in it for 5 minutes, pour 2 cups of water into the mix, and add sugar or lemon to taste. Pour this mixture into a pitcher.
 Leave the tea in the fridge for 2-3 hours.
 Stir this into the mixture -- if it's not sweet enough, add more of the syrup.
 Dice peaches, pineapples, strawberries, raspberries, and apples until they fit into 1 cup. You can sprinkle them with a bit of lemon juice.
 Stir it around until the fruit mixes in with the black tea and floats evenly in the pitcher.
 Pour the tea into a glass filled with ice. Add a sprig of mint to the top.

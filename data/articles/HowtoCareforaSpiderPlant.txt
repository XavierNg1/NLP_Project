Put your spider plant in an east, west or north windowsill any time of the year.
Put the spider plant in a south window during the winter months or 12‚Äù (30.5 cm) away from a south window in late spring and summer.
Provide bright fluorescent or other lighting and spider plants will do fine.
Provide light shade to deep shade for spider plants that are used outside.



Use room temperature water.
Use distilled or purified water, if possible.
Let the pot surface feel dry to the touch before watering.
Water until water drains from the bottom and empty drained water from trays promptly.

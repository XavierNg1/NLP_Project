 Although most people are more aware of the Sistine Chapel, there is plenty more to be seen as you make your way through the museums toward the chapel.


Use the bathroom right before you enter the museums. There are not many places to use it while you explore.
Bring your camera to take pictures in the museums. You are not allowed to take photos in the Sistine Chapel; however, you can in most places in the museums. There will be signs to tell you when you can use flash.
Spend extra time in the Pinacoteca. This is to the right after you take the entry escalator. Many people ignore this area, because it is the opposite way from the Sistine Chapel, but Italians think of the collection of Raphael, Da Vinci and Caravaggio works as a treasure.
 Summer visitors can quickly become dehydrated, and the Vatican affords you fewer opportunities to buy food and drink than other places in Italy. Come prepared with some water, so you can stay healthy and longer.
 This is a famous staircase that most visitors get to see and photograph.


You can also try to take the "secret" door that will lead you straight to St. Peter's Basilica. If you exit through the right door when you leave the Museums, you will head straight to this place. You may be turned away, because it is technically reserved for tour groups. You will miss the spiral staircase if you take this route.

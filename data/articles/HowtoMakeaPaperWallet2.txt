 You should be working with a standard piece of printer paper -- no need to cut it into a square. It's a good idea to start with a boring piece of regular ol' paper, make a wallet successfully, and then make another one with better paper or paper you've designed.









Once you've done that, unfold the paper so you can move on to the exciting next step.
 This will create four flaps on each side. Just to make sure that's clear, it's one one-inch cut along each crease. These flaps will be used to keep the pockets together.
 Fold them toward the paper, toward you. Leave the paper facing you the tall way.
 They should be about 1/8" apart. In other words, you know the bottom two boxes of the page? Draw two lines right by the crease, really close to each other.
 It should look like a stop sign that you're viewing from the side (the narrow diamond is the top and the two lines are the post). This will be where you can slide credit cards, business cards or cash into.









Just to be clear, your two lines go along the entirety of the bottom quarter and the diamond goes along the entirety of the second-to-last quarter.
 The paper should no longer lay flat on the bottom -- that's a good thing; it means you're doing it right.
 Make sure the diamond cutout is on the inside and the two flaps that you never folded in are sticking out. You should see a flap, a pocket, a flap, and a pocket, just like that, on the sides. You do, yeah?









On top of the wallet should be an opening, just like a normal wallet. If it's on the bottom, flip it over. Ha.
 That's what they're there for, remember? Fold those bad boys into the pockets they're next to. Tape the flaps into the pockets to make them sturdy, if you'd like.
 Use your new wallet!

 Meat is extremely high in protein. One cup of chicken or turkey has about 38 grams (1 oz) of protein and about 25 grams (0.9 oz) for pork, beef, and tuna. Try to work at least half a cup of meat into their diet per day.Broiling in or over water and baking in the oven are the healthiest ways to cook meat and will help retain most of the protein and vitamins. Avoid deep fried meats., 2 slices of whole grain bread will have about 7 grams (0.2 oz) of protein. Use whole grain bread to make meat or cheese sandwiches or serve it as toast with a small cut of butter., Beans, lentils, and chick peas make for a healthy, high protein side dish. Tofu and edamame dip, both coming from the soy bean, are also high in protein. One cup of beans or hummus provides between 15 and 25 gram protein.Some children may not like the taste of lentils so try mixing them with other foods like chopped meat, cheese, and/or rice.
You can also add spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika, cumin, oregano, or pepper.

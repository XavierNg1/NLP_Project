 One great prank call for a stranger is to call a person repeatedly pretending he or she called you. Just don't do it too much or this will be considered harassment. Try this on for size:



You: "Hello? Hello?"

Other person: "Hello?"

You: "Who is this?"

Other person: "Uh, who is this? You're the one who called me."

You: "No, you're the one who called me. Who is this, and how can I help you?"

Other person: "There must be some mistake." (Hangs up.)

You: "Hello? What do you want?"

Other person: "Look, you called me again."

You: "What are you talking about? My phone just rang again. This is getting a little ridiculous."

, Act like the person left a note on your car apologizing for hitting it. This is a great way to make a stranger feel completely confused and very flustered.



Other person: "Hello?"

You: "Hi, this is the person who owns the red Mazda you hit yesterday?"

Other person: "Excuse me?"

You: "You left a note on my car. You hit the side of my car in the Shop Rite parking lot? Thanks so much for leaving a note -- I know so many schmucks would just drive away."

Other person: "No, I'm sorry, I didn't go to Shop Rite yesterday. There must be some mistake."

You: "But this is the number that was left. Look, man, my car is completely ruined. I took it to the shop this morning and there's at least five thousand dollars in damages here. I can't even drive it for three days."

Other person: "I'm sorry, but that really wasn't me."

You: "So you're changing your tune now, eh, Mr. Good citizen?"

Other person: "Look, I'm going hang up now."

You: "Don't worry -- I'll be right over to talk about this. Good thing you left your address too!"

, This is a silly one -- pretend that you and the person committed a crime together. Act like you're in cahoots and insist that the person doesn't have to play dumb with you. Here's what you do:



Other person: "Hello?"

You: "They're on to us. They know what we did to Jim."

Other person: "What?"

You: "I said, they know. Listen, we need to get out of town."

Other person: "I don't know what you're talking about."

You: "Don't play dumb! It was all your idea!"

Other person: "I don't know any Jim -- "

You: "I'll be over in fifteen minutes. Pack up."

, This type of prank call has been made famous by Bart Simpson. This is a short but sweet way to make a prank call. All you have to do is call and ask for people with a variety of names that will sound offensive when they're repeated. Just ask for the person and sit back and wait for the victim to realize what you've said when he repeats the name. Here are some great names to try:


"Master Bates."
"Mike Rotch."
"Bea O' Problem."
"Al Coholic."
"Ivanna Tinkle."
"Amanda Hugginkiss."
Hugh Jass
" Wilma Leggrowbach"
Ayma Hogg

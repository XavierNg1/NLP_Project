 If you simply sew it straight on, it will pull at the quilt pieces and stretch them.
,, Match the middle of the borders with the middle of the quilt block, both top and bottom. That way, if there is an inch too much or too little on the sides, you can ease the border in or out as necessary, to make them both match each other. See the video demonstration for greater clarity on how to move the fabric into place., Measure again through the middle.







Cut two more border pieces. These must exactly match the middle.
Place these on the top and the bottom of the block, again easing to make sure that they fit properly.
 It should give you a perfectly square quilt.

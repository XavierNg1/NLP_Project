 Close your eyes and try to focus on your breathing. Relax.;
, For example, if you want a new car, visualize yourself already having the new car. Try feeling how you would feel if you somehow got that new car. Touch your new car. Drive it. Enjoy that feeling of joy you will experience when you drive your new car. The point is: try creating the exact experience of your desire being fulfilled in your mind.
 Smile and forget about the visualization. Go about your activities for the day and try not to think much about what you visualized. This is because if you dwell too much upon your desire, there is a good chance that you will think negative thoughts about it. For example, you might think - "Will I really get my car?" or "With my current financial situation, how can I get a car?". All those thoughts will stop your manifestation. So it is best to involve yourself in other activities and forget about your desire for sometime after your visualization.
 Close your eyes, relax and clearly feel the feeling of excitement and happiness as you see your desire coming true in your imagination. Then again, after the visualization, forget about it and focus on other work. Repeat this "visualization" process for some days.
 You might suddenly get a fantastic deal on the car you've always wanted. Or you might "win" the car of your dreams in a lottery. The law of attraction works in interesting ways.

 Decide which frequency you want to use for your wireless router.


Usually, 2.4 GHz is the default as a lot of devices don’t have access to 5 GHz. However, newer and higher models of wireless routers do have 5 GHz. If your router has this, it’s suggested that you use it as this frequency has less traffic since less devices are able to broadcast through it.
Select the appropriate tab on the lower part of the screen. The list of available networks will be refreshed on the upper part of the screen.
 Click on the column header for Channel to sort the networks by this value. It will make your analysis easier with the networks appropriately grouped.
 Count the number of networks per channel. Start with channel 1, then tally the results.
 Locate the channel that has the least amount of networks. This is the channel that has the fewest number of users or routers broadcasting through it; it has the least traffic.


Take note of this channel.
 Walk around your house where you expect your wireless coverage to reach and repeat steps 2 to 4. The results may vary depending on your location.
 After doing the tests, analyze your results to see which channel is the best for your home network.


Usually, channels 1, 6, or 11 would be the best bets since these have the least overlaps with each other.
 Configure your wireless router to broadcast on the optimal channel you’ve selected.


Be sure to save your settings, and protect your home network by adding security protocols and passwords.

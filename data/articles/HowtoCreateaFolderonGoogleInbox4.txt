 Look for an app icon of a blue envelope with a checkmark in your device home screen or app drawer, and tap it.
 If this is your first time to use the Inbox app, or if you logged out of your previous Inbox session, you will be asked to log in. Enter your Googe email address and password in the given fields, and tap “Sign in” to continue.


You will be taken to your inbox folder.
 This will open the Main Menu of Inbox.
 Swipe the menu up until you find “Create New” next to a plus icon; tap it and a small window will pop up.


Enter the name of the folder into the text field of the pop-up, and then tap the “Save” button at the bottom.
The folder will be created, and you will be able to access it through the Main Menu.

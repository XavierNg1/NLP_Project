 If it's your first trip, this is the best. The family will help you with everything you need to know and it's the best way to experience the country you're visiting. If you live with other students at a hotel, you will most likely have to deal with stuff you can't handle.;
, These trips are normally 3 weeks or more, if you're not staying for a whole year to study in High School. You will need money, passport and loads more. Check the date on your passport and get a new one in time if it's going to run out soon. You need money for food ( if your stuck somewhere with your group ), for entertainment (if you want to shop, go see a movie and more) and tickets for the bus.
 You can send in your e-mail to most companies like EF and they will connect you to others. To travel alone is the best but it will take you some time to find friends. Be patient, there's people out there going alone as well, but that doesn't mean you should only stick to people going alone. Find many friends.
 Many people are leaving their destinations because they're homesick, don't let yourself be one of them!

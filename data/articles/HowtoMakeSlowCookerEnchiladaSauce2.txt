 Add 3 tablespoons (24 g) of cornstarch and 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of water to a small bowl. Use a whisk to blend the two together into a smooth paste.You can substitute flour if you don’t have any cornstarch. However, you’ll want to cook the sauce for an extra 10 to 15 minutes to ensure that the raw flour taste is cooked out of it.
 Once the cornstarch paste is mixed, add it to the slow cooker along with 2 cups (473 ml) of chicken broth, 1 8-oz. (227 g) can of roasted garlic tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons (16 g) of chili powder, 2 tablespoons (16 g) of ancho chili powder, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of cumin, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of garlic powder, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried oregano, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt. Use a wooden spoon to blend all of the ingredients together.If you can’t find roasted garlic tomato sauce, you can substitute regular tomato sauce. You may want to add an extra ½ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of garlic powder, though.
 When all of the ingredients are combined in the slow cooker, turn it on and set it to low. Allow the sauce to cook for 4 to 6 hours, or until the sauce has reached your desired thickness.If you want the sauce to be ready more quickly, cook it on high for 2 to 3 hours.
 Once the sauce is finished cooking, it’s ready to use for your favorite type of enchiladas. You can also allow the sauce to cool and place it in airtight plastic zipper bags or containers for storage.The sauce will last for 3 days in the refrigerator and up to 6 months in the freezer.

 The Dragonplate armor requires your character’s Smithing level to be at max (level 100). The Smithing level of your character can be increased by constantly forging items in the Blacksmith’s forge.


To forge items, approach a Blacksmith forge that can be found in any town. Press the interaction on your keyboard or controller to start forging weapons and armors.
Your Smithing level will increase regardless of what item you forge.
 Open your Skills menu inside the game and select Smithing to view the Smithing skill tree of your character. The top point of the tree is the Dragon Smithing perk.


To unlock this, all you need to do is to use all the skill points you gained when you were leveling up your Smithing skill (step 1) and unlock all the perks below the Dragon (there are 9).
 The Dragonplate armor set composes of five parts, namely: the chest plate, boots, gauntlets, helmet and the shield. To get the complete set, you’ll need the following:


13 Dragon Scales — This can be obtained by killing a dragon and looting its corpse after.
6 Dragon Bones — This can be obtained by killing a dragon and looting its corpse after.
10 Leather Strips — This can be bought from merchants all over the game for 3 Gold.
 Once you’ve collected all the required materials, approach a Blacksmith forge and press the interaction key to start creating an armor. Once the armor has been created, it will automatically be added to your bag.
 Open your character’s bag and select the Dragonplate armor pieces. Using your controller’s navigation buttons, equip each item of the set one at a time.

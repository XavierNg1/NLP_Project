 Purchase a large bottle of water or soda after you pass through security. You will use this bottle as your recline-defender once you get on the plane.


Use the bottle with or without the liquid still inside.;
, Because once the seat goes back, there’s not much you can do about it (except say something).


Keep an eye on the illuminated signs and/or listen for cues from the flight attendants or captain.
 This will take up some room but should prevent the recliner from reclining.


Make sure you have clearance to lower your tray table (during take off and landing you will need to have it locked in place).
 You may need to use your book or something else to hold the bottle in place between the tray and the latch.


Gently push bottle as far back as possible, into the seat in front of you.
When the person in front of you tries to recline, the seat won’t go back.

 Now you can adjust general photo settings.
 This provides each person access to your photo albums that are visible to them. If you don't include the tab, they can still see your photos on their stream.
 Once approved, the tag and photo is displayed as a post on your profile. Anyone can tag you in a photo, but you have to approve the tags from anyone not on this list before the tagging goes through. You can still manually remove any tag.

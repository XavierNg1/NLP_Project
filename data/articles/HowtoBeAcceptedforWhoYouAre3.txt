 Avoid the people that make you feel worthless. Spend more time with the ones who give you love, kindness, and support. While it takes time to make friends and find genuine people, there are many out there.Talk with a trusted friend or relative about feeling unaccepted. Sometimes being open about what’s bothering you will help you feel less alone.
Consider joining a group with like-minded people. It could be a social group at school, or an interest group in the community. Talk with others about what you’re going through.
Tell those people who accept you that you appreciate them. Show them that their love has meaning and value.
 Instead of desperately seeking validation from others, find ways to cope with your stress and anxiety about the situation. Focus on what you can control—you. Learn to take a difficult situation in stride. Here are some ways to relax:


Listen to music.
Find a creative outlet. Write. Draw. Paint. Build. Sculpt.
Step away from the situation. Take five deep breaths. Inhale slowly and hold your breath. Exhale slowly.
Take a walk. Go for a hike. Ride your bike. Swim. Go for a run. Get active.
 Being happy and confident is also about taking care of your mind and body. If you don’t treat them right, no one else will. Exercising your brain and eating healthy can help you feel more confident about who you are and how you’re viewed by others.


Eat healthy foods that help your mood. Eat more fish. Get your daily greens. Reduce the caffeine and fatty foods.Consider meditation or yoga. Find ways to clear your mind of negativity.
Get good rest. Sometimes being sleep-deprived can affect how you see the world around you. You may feel more judged or stressed.

 If you are working with very hard clay, you may need to use a food processor to really break down the clay and warm it up. Before you put the clay pieces into the food processor, first use a sharp knife or cleaver to chop the clay into the smallest pieces that you can.
 Once you have chopped the clay as much as you can, take the chopped pieces and put them in a food processor. If you wish, add a few drops of diluent or liquid polymer clay to the food processor as well to further help soften the clay. Then place the lid on the food processor.You can also use a coffee grinder, but you may have to grind in several batches.
Try to get a separate bowl and blade for mixing clay because unless you clean them extremely thoroughly it is not advisable to use the same ones for food and clay.
 Use the highest setting on your food processor to grind the clay. Grinding the clay will separate it into smaller pieces and soften it, making the clay easier to work with. Grind for one to three minutes, until the clay is soft.
 After the clay is soft, take it out of the food processor. You may need to use a spoon to scrape the sides and get the clay out of the nooks and crannies of the food processor. Once you get all the clay out, press the pieces together to combine them.
 After you have chopped the clay in the food processor, it should be soft and pliable. Knead the clay in your hands to completely blend the pieces together. It should now be soft and ready for use!

 There’s an entire world of free hip-hop dance videos online. There are even hip-hop dance classes for free online.It will help to make your searches as specific as possible. Don’t just search “hip-hop dancing”. This is too broad and you will get too many results. Instead, search “hip-hop dancing step-by-step” or “hip-hop dance routines for beginners”. If there is a specific style of music that you want to dance to, include that in your search. Remember, hip-hop is used almost as a blanket term these days, so if you have something in mind, you will have to search a little longer for it.
 Use the internet and word of mouth to find out where people are dancing. You don’t necessarily have to dance at these events, just observe what people are doing so that you can feel confident in the future.


This is the best way to figure out how to dress, how many friends to bring, and how to dance with and around strangers. If you see a style that you really like, don’t be afraid to approach someone between songs and ask them quickly how they learned to dance so well.
 If you see a certain style, learn to mimic it. Try to figure out what it is called if you don’t know it. Learn to dress the part and feel good about yourself.


A lot of dancing is simply feeling good in your own skin, and one of the best ways to do that is to mimic somebody who already feels confident. Don’t copy what they wear or how they talk-- copy their self-love and confidence in their own body.

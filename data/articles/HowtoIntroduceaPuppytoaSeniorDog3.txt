 Take your senior dog’s health into consideration before introducing it to a new puppy. If it has a chronic health condition (e.g. diabetes or hypothyroid disease) or impaired vision, a puppy’s energy might be too much for it to handle. Consult your veterinarian if you are uncertain about your senior dog’s health limitations., Take your senior dog’s interactions with other dogs as an indication of how it will deal with a puppy. If you dog interacts enthusiastically with other dogs and puppies while on its walks, for example, there is a very good chance it will adapt well to a new puppy. If your dog demonstrates fear or aggression towards other dogs, or has a tendency to get into fights with them, take this as a sign that it might not tolerate a boisterous puppy in its environment., Monitor all initial interactions between your dogs very carefully, watching for signal from your senior dog. Things like looking away from the puppy or moving to another part of the room are obvious signs that your dog needs a break from the interaction, and these signs should be considered before your dog gets aggressive.A less obvious sign would be your senior dog licking its lips or nose in an exaggerated manner, which is likely a signal that it is anxious or uncomfortable.

 Although it is difficult, you will need to make arrangements for your child’s memorial. You can handle this best if you ask people close to you for help. For example, you might say, “Could you help me with planning the memorial. I am overwhelmed right now.”
If possible, allow someone else to handle the majority of the arrangements. Handle only the parts that you are okay dealing with at the time.
 You have a lot on your mind right now, it’s okay to ask your family and friends for help with household chores and errands. They want to help in any way they can so that you can accept the suicide of your child.


You could say, “Would you mind preparing a meal or two that I can freeze?”
Or, you could ask, “Could you take care of our dog for a few days? I just don’t have the energy?”

, It is natural for people to ask you what happened. They aren’t trying to be mean or insensitive, but want to know what happened so they can help. In addition, not being honest with people will keep you in denial and stop you from accepting the suicide.Let people know that the phrase ‘committed suicide’ isn’t used anymore.
Instead explain that the terms ‘died by suicide’, ‘died from suicide’, or ‘died of suicide’ are used to describe this type of death.Don’t feel you need to give a detailed account of what happened. Be as honest as you feel comfortable and appropriate., Coping with the suicide of your child will take time. You will probably need some time away from your responsibilities to accept what happened. Take some time off from work and focus on taking care of yourself.


Try not to stay in bed and allow your grief to overtake you. Go for walks or ask a someone to come keep you company.
Go away for a few days to some place that you feel peaceful and calming.

 Applying makeup to the black eye while it is still swollen could irritate the skin and cause skin redness.


Additionally, the cosmetics used to conceal your black eye are likely to wear off as you apply cold packs to the injured area, making application prior to treatment fairly pointless.
Wait until you have entered the warm compress stage of treatment before applying any makeup to the injured area, and apply makeup as little as possible. If you feel you need to cover your eye when you need to leave the house or if you are having people over, that's okay, but when you're just at home on your own, you should avoid applying makeup.
 For best results, use a liquid corrective concealer in a yellow or green shade.Liquid corrective concealers are easier to apply and blend than most creams and require the use of less pressure on the skin.


You must use a corrective concealer first before using a standard concealer if you wish to disguise the black eye. Standard concealers match the tone of your skin and can only blend uneven tones together. Corrective concealers rely on the principle of complementary colors to correct discolored portions of skin.
A yellow concealer generally works best for a black eye in its early stages, when it appears to have deep purple undertones. As the black eye lightens and takes on more red tones or yellow-brown tones, you may need to switch to a green corrective concealer.
Apply the corrective concealer with your fingers. Use your fingers to dab specks of corrective concealer all around the blackened area of your skin. Use light pressure to gently and carefully blend the concealer into your skin, covering the entire damaged area.
 A normal concealer can blend any uneven shading caused by the corrective concealer.
 The two concealers should be enough to hide your black eye without any additional make-up. If you want to continue with your standard make-up routine, however, you can do so.

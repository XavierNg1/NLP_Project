, You will need 1 cup (208 grams) of baking soda and 2 tablespoons (15 grams) of cornstarch. Stir the two ingredients together with a whisk or spoon until they are evenly combined.









If you cannot get any cornstarch, try arrowroot powder. If you cannot find any of that either, you may be able to make your shower bombs with just baking soda and water.
 You will need up to â…“ cup (80 milliliters) of water. Stir the water into the baking soda mixture using a rubber spatula.
 Make sure that the mold you are using is safe to use in the oven. Some molds may be labeled as "silicon," but are not actually oven-safe. The silicone molds for baking cupcakes or for making chocolates/candy would be ideal.









Make sure that you are packing the mixture as firmly as you can, or the shower bombs will be more likely to crumble.
 During this time, the mixture will dry and harden. If you do not wish to use an oven, you can set these out someplace where they won't get disturbed for 24 to 48 hours; they must be perfectly dry.
 Do not take them out of the molds just yet. If you take them out too soon, they might not be fully dry, and might crumble as a result.
 If the shower bombs start to crumble easily, they might not be dry all the way; wait 12 hours before checking on them again.
 They may also help loosen or thin out any phlegm. Lavender, on the other hand, will help relax your muscles, and sooth any headaches that might be caused by the congestion.
 Turn on your shower, and place one of the shower bombs on the floor, near the drain. The warm water will dissolve the shower bomb, and help release the essential oils into the air. Keep the rest of the shower bombs in an airtight container.

 Many motorcycles, especially older or less expensive models, do not have modern fuel injection systems. If you aren't sure, you can tell by looking for a choke control. It is normally located on the left handlebar, above the horn. Carbureted motorcycles have a choke, but fuel-injected bikes do not., This will put you in full control of anything that happens once it's started. If you are starting the motorcycle unmounted for some reason, make sure that you shift your bike into neutral (located between 1st and 2nd gear) before you fire the engine. You don't want the bike to take off without you!








, You should have plenty of gas and a well-charged battery. It is important to keep the motorcycle properly serviced, particularly in damp or cold conditions. Fit new spark plugs, or, if not worn, clean and gap the old ones. Check the ignition timing, and adjust if necessary; if fitted, have the ignition points replaced. A carburetor service and clean is also a great idea.



Replace the spark plug leads if they look old, worn, or frayed. Use only manufacturer-recommended spark plugs and plug leads â€“ look for the reference in your motorcycle's handbook.
 Before starting any engine, make sure it is lubricated by checking the oil level. If there is no oil, or the oil level is too low, do not start the engine. Otherwise it will heat up, then will break down.
 Put in the key and turn the key clockwise until the lights turn on. If the lights does not turn on, that usually means the battery is dead and you need to recharge it or install a new one.

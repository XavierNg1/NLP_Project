 Start with a simple question about the topic of your project and begin your research. Once you grow more familiar with the material, make a statement that you can argue for as a project goal. Ask yourself if the thesis statement needs to be researched, and make sure that it is only expressing one main idea., Fight the inclination to save the writing step of your project until after your research is complete. Start writing notes from the beginning of the process to help you engage with the material youâ€™re studying and to record ideas as they come to you. Writing in the early stage of research will also give you content to get feedback on from family, friends, group project co-members, or from a project supervisor., Make your project stand out by adding dynamic elements to it. Wherever possible, add auditory, visual, or tactile components to the project material to make it more interesting and accessible. Different approaches to the project will add new dimension to the topic covered.Add an auditory component like a taped interview or recorded radio broadcast to liven up the project.
Add visual aides like charts, pictures, and maps to enhance the project.
Add a tactile part to your project, like a short video.

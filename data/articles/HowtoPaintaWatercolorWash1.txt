 When painting watercolor washes, you need to prepare the paper.


Soak a sheet of watercolor paper in cold water for 2 minutes.
Remove the paper from the water and place it on a flat drawing board. Smooth the paper out with a sponge. Watercolor wash techniques won't work if the paper is too wet.
Tape the paper around all the edges firmly to the board, and let it dry.
 When painting watercolor washes, you need to cover the entire paper.
 To paint with watercolors, you'll need to add enough water to obtain your desired hue.
 This may help you learn control with watercolor wash techniques.
, When painting watercolor washes, start at the top of the page with a broad, horizontal stroke to the other side. Practice keeping the brushstrokes even and within the square.
 When you paint with watercolors, you may overlap the previous stroke. When you reach the bottom, let the paper dry.

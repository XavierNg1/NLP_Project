 In the first year of having your new puppy, expose them to unfamiliar dogs, people, and environments. Introduce them to people of varying ages, i.e., adults and children, and to both men and women in non-threatening environments.To expose your puppy to new environments and other dogs, take them to the park, for walks, and/or place them in a puppy kindergarten class.
Keep in mind that the first 18 weeks of your puppy’s life is the best time to socialize them. This is the period when they will be most open to new experiences. Take advantage of this window to raise a confident, well-adjusted adult dog.
 Show your puppy where their bed, toys, and food and water bowls are. Establish a routine for when it’s time to eat, play, use the restroom, go to bed, and wake up. This will provide the much-needed structure and security to your puppy’s life.For example, wake your puppy up at an established time in the morning, let them outside to use the restroom, and give your puppy their morning meal. Make sure your puppy eats and goes potty before bedtime, and have their bedtime at a certain time, as well.
 Begin teaching your puppy commands like “No” and “Good boy.” Once your puppy begins to understand these commands, begin to teach them more complex commands like sit, stay, and come. You can either teach them the more advanced commands yourself, or sign your puppy up for an obedience class.Find an obedience class at your local pet store, or ask your veterinarian for recommendations.

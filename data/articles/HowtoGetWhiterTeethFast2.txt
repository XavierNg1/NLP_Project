Whitening strips and gels are not recommended for people with gum disease and other dental problems. Talk to your dentist before using these products if you're concerned.Whitening strips and gels are best for people with a yellow tone to their teeth, and don't necessarily help remove darker stains., Tray whitening systems, also available at drugstores or from a dentist, use a slightly more aggressive approach to whitening teeth. A concentrated peroxide solution is poured into teeth trays, which look like plastic retainers, and the trays are worn over the teeth for several hours.Tray whitening systems may also be used overnight. Depending on how white you want your teeth to be, you can continue using tray whitening systems every day for several weeks.
Dentists may provide an at-home tray whitening kit. In some cases, the trays may be custom-made for your teeth using a mold so that they fit your teeth better than "one size fits all" trays.
 Many dentists offer whitening treatments that are very effective for removing dark stains. This is the most expensive technique, but it is also the quickest and offers the most dramatic results.


Lasers or heat are applied to the bleaching solution to make it work more quickly.
Depending on the level of staining, repeated dentist visits may be necessary, but each session lasts only about 30 minutes.

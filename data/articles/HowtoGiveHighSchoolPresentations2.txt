, Pause when you need to take a breath.
 Give a warm welcome at the beginning of your presentation to get the class' attention. Have your presentation (the visual aids or power point presentation) simple and sound, and keep your talk alive and sure.
 If you look to your audience eyes, they will feel that you know what you are doing and that you feel comfortable. Don't just stare and talk on your visual aid. Talk to the class.
 If you did a mistake, don't let your audience notice it. If you forgot to say something important, make a smart way to insert it through your delivery. You may say, "In addition to our previous point, before I forget to share it. . .", "One more thing is . . ."


Instead of saying sorry, say "I mean. . .", ". . . rather."

, A little humor can go along way, but don't overdo it. Make sure it is related to your topic and not offensive.
,,, Ask your classmates or teacher if you did well.

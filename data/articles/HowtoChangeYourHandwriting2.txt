 Do any of them look squished or not formed correctly? Practice writing that letter in good form by comparing it to an online chart., For a period of time, try using bigger letters when you write. That way, you can see if you are making letters in the right way, and you can correct as you go.One way to encourage larger writing is to use wide-ruled paper., Your letters should all come up to about the same height, and any descenders should go about the same length below the line.For instance, your lowercase "g" and "y" should go down about the same length. Also, they shouldn't be cramping the line below.Use a ruler to check your height. If you lay it across the top of your uppercase and lowercase letters, you can see if you make certain letters shorter or taller.
 Make sure you aren't spacing your letters too far apart or too closely together. Half of a lowercase "o" should fit between letters, no more.

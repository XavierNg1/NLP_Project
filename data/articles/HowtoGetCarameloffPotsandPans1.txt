 If only a thin, partially translucent layer remains, you may be able to scrape it off without taking any additional steps. If a thicker layer remains, you may need to soak it before scraping.;
, Position the chisel at the nearest end of the pot or pan and move the chisel away from you in short strokes. Apply firm, even pressure.
 Pat it dry with paper towels.
 If additional caramel remains on the bottom of the pan, repeat the scraping and rinsing procedures.
 Leave it there two hours to allow the pan and the burned-on caramel a chance to thoroughly freeze. Frozen food is often easier to chisel away, and caramel becomes especially brittle at below-freezing temperatures.
 Repeat the scraping process to chip away the brittle pieces of frozen caramel.

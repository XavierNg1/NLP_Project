 When you have an hour to kill, this can seem like a long time. But if you break that down into smaller increments, such as four segments of 15 minutes each, this doesn’t seem as long. Try breaking down the hour into even smaller segments, such as 5 or 10 minute segments. Mentally cross off each segment as it passes.
 In your mind, take inventory of everything you have in your kitchen, or try to recall all of the movies you own. Giving yourself a mental task redirects your thought patterns away from concentrating on time to concentrating on something else.
 In your mind, try out different ways of arranging furniture, wall hangings, and other decorations in a room in your house. Think of other ways you can make your living space more appealing, such as imagining different colored wall paint.
 Give yourself some math problems, such as calculating how many days you’ve been alive, for example. Forcing your brain to focus on a difficult mental task can make you less aware of how much time is passing.
 Use your mind to list things, such as naming things you’re thankful for, listing the names of every street you’ve lived on, or naming people who graduated from high school with you.


You can also make mental to-do lists, itemizing tasks that you need to complete.
 Think about a place that you’d like to travel to and plan out a trip. Think about how you’d get there, what you’d do while you’re there, what kinds of souvenirs you might like to buy, what kinds of meals you’d like to eat, and who you could travel with.
 Think about your spouse, a celebrity or another person to whom you’re attracted, and imagine yourself being with that person. Imagine the conversation you would have, what you’d talk about, where you’d go on a date, and what else you might do together.
 Look at the people around you and imagine crazy, funny lives for them. Give them different jobs or secret identities. Imagine where they go after work or school, their friends or family, and their hobbies.

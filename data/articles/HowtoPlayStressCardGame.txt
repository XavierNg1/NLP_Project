 Player A and Player B should each have 26 cards.;
, If there are any cards with the same number/letter, just stack them on top of each other until you have 4 different cards/piles.
 Pile A is where Player A should put their card and Pile B is where Player B should put their card. Now each player should have 21 cards.
, This is just like speed. Replace the cards you use from your original stack of cards.
 If the two cards in the middle are the same, you must be the first to place each of your hands on each card and say "stress" so that the opposing player must take all the cards. They shuffle their cards and you each place one new card in the middle to continue the game

,
If both players have cards on the table but no cards in their hand, they must each take their respective pile and use it as their new deck.

 A guitar strap, usually made of leather or vinyl, is necessary to support your guitar in a standing position. Push your guitar's 2 strap buttons through the holes located at either end of the strap. You can adjust the length of the strap after wearing the guitar.
 The guitar strap should fit naturally over your left shoulder, running down your back and to the guitar's lower strap button. Rest your hands in their playing position and determine if the height of the guitar strap is comfortable for you.
 If your guitar is hanging too low, you will have to bend your wrists at awkward angles to play. This can make playing fast passages more difficult and lead to injury. Remove the guitar and shorten the strap until you can reach the fretboard and strings comfortably.

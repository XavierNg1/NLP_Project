Until you are comfortable with your skills, practice your backstroke in a calm area of the river where there are few obstacles and you can easily control the boat.
Sit in the row seat facing the bow of the boat (the bow is the high end of the boat).
Place each oar in its oarlock.
Face the drift boat downstream so that the bow (and you) are facing downstream.
Grab hold of both the oars (the end of each oar in each hand).
Push down on the oars until they are level with the boat. They will be out of the water.
Push forward so the oars reach out behind you.
Place the oars down in the water.
Pull the oars back so they run through the water and in front of you.
Return to the beginning seated position.;

Use only one oar and complete the backstroke movement. If you use the right oar, it moves the boat backward and to the left. If you use the left oar, it moves the boat backward and to the right. Try the same movement while holding the other oar steady in the water. This will help to pivot the boat.



Push forward with one oar while you pull back with the other. Youâ€™re basically completing a forward stroke with one hand and a backstroke with the other. This causes the boat to spin.



Hold an oar in each hand with the oars level and pushed out of the water. Push the oars straight down into the water and hold them in place as much as possible.



Pull the oars into the boat (all the way up to the blade) and place them in front of you (called shipping). Then exit by the transom (stern) so the boat doesn't act violently as you leave.

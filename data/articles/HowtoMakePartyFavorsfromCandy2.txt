 Also buy lots of soft candies that can be pierced easily by the skewer. Get as many skewers as party guests needing a party favor. A few spares won't hurt either, in case some snap while working with them., Arrange all of the candies on a clean tray or large plate. Play around with placement of each type of candy to form a line that will sit on the skewer. When you're happy with the design, start making the skewers., Place the designed skewer in front of you for guidance, and each candy type in order of the template design., Set that skewer aside on a plate and move onto the next one. Repeat until all of the skewers are done., If you can't find cellophane bags, make cellophane covers from plain cellophane and tape in place. Finish off with a ribbon bow at the base to keep the bag in place., The candy party favors are now ready for sharing out.

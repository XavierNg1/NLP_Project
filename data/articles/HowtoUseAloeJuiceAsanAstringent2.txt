 Use warm water to relax your skin and a gentle cleanser. Avoid exfoliating cleansers or harsh cleansers that may dry out the skin. Astringents constrict the skin to close pores, but they also have a tendency to dry the skin out simultaneously. A harsh, drying cleanser may dry your skin out too much.
 Allow the juice to soak into the cotton, thoroughly wetting it.Wipe the aloe-drenched cotton pad over your face and neck. Concentrate on the areas that get oiliest or those that are most prone to break-outs, since these spots will benefit most from the astringent properties of the aloe and lemon.
 Do not wash it off. In order to have time to work correctly as an astringent, the aloe juice should remain on your face for at least 8 hours. You may want to wear the the aloe juice on your face overnight.
 Avoid oily moisturizers. Select a light moisturizing lotion rather than a heavy cream and concentrate on the areas that get the driest. Since the astringency of aloe can dry your skin out, applying a moisturizer after you apply the aloe juice can help prevent your skin from becoming stiff and flaky.
 After enough time passes, the astringent properties of you aloe juice should make your skin firmer and clearer.

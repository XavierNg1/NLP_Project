 Whenever you are around your hamster, use its name. Handle your dwarf hamster every day too, to ensure the trust between you and your pet. This also keeps your pet stimulated and healthy.;
, When your dwarf is in its cage, open the door and call its name while holding something tasty. For example, use a treat of one sunflower seed or a raisin.
 Then give it the treat.
, That way, if it bites you, it will not hurt. Eventually the hamster will trust you enough that you can take the gloves off and it won't bite.
 During feeding, use your hamster's name.
 After about a month of getting used to you calling its name, see if someone else can get the hamster to come forward at the call of its name. Have your friend or family member do this a few times a week over several weeks, until the hamster responds well to someone else too. Be persistent, as this can take some time to work.


Offer treats, as above.

 Egg whites are rich in collagen and protein, and can help to tighten your pores, which has purifying effects. This option is more advisable for those with oily rather than dry skin. If you have dry skin it could cause irritation and excessive dryness. Similarly if you have sensitive skin the vitamin A could cause breakouts, and it best to speak to your dermatologist first.To make the mask just whip up some eggs whites in a bowl.
You want a good frothy consistency.
 Once you have got the egg whites prepared, and cleaned your face and hands, simply apply the mask to your face with your finger tips. Gently massage it into your face, taking care to avoid any areas that are particularly sensitive, such as the area around the eyes.
 Allow the egg white mask to dry on you face. When you feel it has dried you will most likely feel your skin tightening.Now gently rinse it off with warm water. Be sure to clean off any residue and then apply a moisturiser. Egg white will dry out your skin, so moisturising after you use it will help re-hydrate your skin.

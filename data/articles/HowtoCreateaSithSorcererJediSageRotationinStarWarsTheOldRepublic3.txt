 The Corruption Sorcerer/Seer Sage is far different from it's fellow sorcerer disciplines. Instead of going for an all-out Force-based assault, the focus is healing. The standard healing ability given to all Sorcerers/Sages, Dark Heal/Benevolence, is a staple here, used as your quickest, non-instant heal., It is a must. Whenever it comes off cooldown, use it followed by one of three healing abilities: Dark Heal/Benevolence, Dark Infusion, Innervate., Use it whenever the cooldown debuff is done, and on yourself when under attack., It should consist of only three skills. Always go for Affliction/Weaken Mind and Crushing Darkness/Telekinetic Gust, followed by an ability of your choice. Force Lightning/Telekinetic Throw and Shock/Project are good choices. Avoid Electrocute/Force Stun because of the massive cooldown., A tank companion is your best option, but a damage companion is also good. Avoid healer companions; they are rather useless since you're supposed to be healing.

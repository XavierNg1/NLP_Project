 Lemon zest is great as an addition to many dishes, but you don’t want to eat the entire lemon rind raw. To start, take a sharp knife and cut off the top and tail of the lemon. Stand the lemon up on one of those cut sides. With your knife, peel off strips from the lemon until all the skin has been removed.When you're peeling, try to remove as much of the white pith as possible, as this is very bitter.
Once you’ve peeled the lemon, go around and remove any leftover pith by peeling it away with your fingers or cutting it off.
When possible, eat only Meyer lemons raw. They are sweeter and less acidic than other lemon varieties, and are much more pleasant to eat like this.;
, Insert the tip of your knife in between two wedges of the lemon, cutting to the inside of the membrane that encases the wedge. Cut the full length of the wedge, then move to the other side to separate the second side from the lemon. Remove the wedge of lemon and place it into a bowl.Always cut to the inside of the membrane, so that the lemon wedge doesn’t have the membrane attached. This part of the lemon is sour and bitter.
Repeat until you have removed all the individual wedges from the lemon.
 Cut each lemon wedge in half so you get two bite-sized halves from each wedge. Return the cut wedges to the bowl.


You can leave the lemon wedges whole, if you prefer.
 You can sprinkle the lemon with some sugar if you want to take away some of the sourness and add some sweetness. Sprinkle one to two teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of sugar over the lemon bites and stir to coat them.


You can either eat the lemons plain, with sugar, or you can add them to a salad, a fruit cocktail, or another dish.

 This allows you to take yourself further than wearing trainers or flat soled shoes. A reliable, sturdy and supportive boot is best. Also make sure your boots are right for the environment you will be using them in (For example, a pair of heavy duty waterproof boots are a bad choice for desert hiking). Your boots should be suited to you and your environment.;
, If you can't walk up a small hill without tiring then you won't make it up that really big mountain standing between you and success. No, a good hiker is one with good strength, stamina and the will to carry on in any conditions. Develop these quality's, and you will be hiking like a pro in no time.
 Find a friend who has a similar fitness level and has the same love of hiking as you do. They must be willing, as good as you at hiking and be good company. A really boring person with nothing interesting to talk about isn't very good!

, You don't have to go all out and get very expensive kit at all. Your going to need some lightweight pants and a t-shirt, a fleece and a waterproof jacket(depending on time of year etc) and a small day sack to put stuff in. Take lots of snacks and water, drink regularly and keep yourself hydrated. A map and compass are useful but a GPS of some sort can also come in handy (but don't rely on gadgets,they can always run out of charge when you need them most).
 Start out small and local and as you build up your strength go bigger and bigger! A three mile hike up a nearby hill is a good start, and keep going bigger and further.
 Eventually you will be able to tackle the tallest peaks, the longest distances and the toughest terrain.

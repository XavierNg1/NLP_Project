 Agitate the water to help the calcium flakes to dissolve.;
, A five gallon bucket full of concrete would require only a small handful of calcium to accelerate the setting dramatically. A medium Tim Hortons coffee cup of calcium would increase the set time of almost 400 pounds of mixed concrete.
, Direct sunlight or warm ambient temperatures will cause the set time to increase even further. Calcium is most useful for cold weather concrete applications where a high initial set strength is required to resist the potential damage to fresh concrete from freezing.

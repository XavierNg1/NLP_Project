 This will make anything you select have a transparent background, rather than a white background.;
, Obviously, it looks like a rectangle.
 Overlap two of them so they look like this.
 It should look like a cube, a segment of the Rubik's cube.
 Use the eraser tool to erase the excess lines. The lines you are supposed to erase are indicated by the image.
 We will be using red, blue, and yellow. Using the fill with color tool, fill in each segment of your cube with your three colors.
 Copy and paste by surrounding the cube with the select tool, and copying it. Paste it, another cube should appear in the corner.
 Only click and drag. Since you have a transparency tool, the background will not be white. Drag the cube and put it right next to the original copy. You should have a rectangular prism.
 You should have a rectangular prism 3 cubes tall, and 3 cubes high. It should look like one side of a Rubik's cube.
 You only need 3 copies.
 Since the single cube and the Rubik's cube are proportional, you don't need to change the color of anything!

 The structure of a triolet poem is based on a rhyming scheme where the first line of the poem is used three times and the second line of the poem is used twice. The structure can be broken down by:A (first line)
B (second line)
a (rhymes with the first line)
A (repeat the first line)
a (rhymes with the first line)
b (rhymes with the second line)
A (repeat the first line)
B (repeat the second line);
, To get a better sense of how to use the structure of the triolet to create a unique poem, look at several examples, including:


Thomas Hardy’s “How Great is My Grief”.Peter Poole’s “Feed Me Lord That I Might Live”LuAnn Kennedy’s “The Night”, Choose one or two examples and note how they use the repetition of the first line and the second line to enhance meaning in the poem. Ask yourself:


Does the meaning of repeated first line and the repeated second line shift throughout the poem? For example, in Hardy’s triolet “How Great is My Grief”, the first line underlines the overall grief and sorrow of the speaker and enhances the lines between the repeated lines in the poem.
How do the supporting lines respond or react to the repeated lines in the triolet? In Hardy’s poem, the supporting lines put the repeating lines into a certain context. They tell the reader that the speaker has known the subject of the poem over the course of “slow years” and they have shared memories with the subject or “thee” of the poem.
What note does the last line end the poem on? How does the last line, the repeated second line, enhance the overall meaning of the poem? Hardy alters the meaning of the repeated last line by using a question mark, instead of an exclamation mark. This leaves the reader in a state of wonder, as the speaker seems to be posing a question to the subject of the poem, but the reader will never know the answer.
 Think about what you want the triolet poem to be about, or the theme or subject of the poem. One way to brainstorm a theme or subject is to create an association diagram, also known as a clustering technique.Take out a sheet of paper. Write your main topic or subject in the middle of the paper. For example, “a tortoise”.
Moving out from the center, write down other words that pop into your mind that relates back to “a tortoise”. You can also draw a circle or box around the main topic and use little lines to connect the other words to the main topic.
For example, for “a tortoise”, you might write “hard shell”, “ancient”, “slow”, “wise”, “dark green”. Don’t worry about organizing the words as you write. Simply let the words flow around the main topic.
Once you feel you have written enough words around the main topic, start to cluster the words. Draw a circle around words that relate to each other and draw a line between the circled words to connect them. Continue doing this with the other words. Some of the terms may end up uncircled, but these lone words can still be useful.Focus on how the words relate back to the main topic. If you have clustered together several words that relate to “wise”, for example, maybe this may be a good approach for the triolet. Or if there are a lot of clustered words that focus on “dark green”, this may be another way to approach “a tortoise.”
Answer questions like: “I was surprised by…” or “I discovered…” For example, you may look over the clustered words and note “I was surprised by how often I mention my father in relation to a tortoise.” Or, “I discovered I may want to write about how a tortoise means a wise and old personality or character, like my father.”, Some poets find coming up with your main, repeating line first, (A) in the scheme of ABaAabAB, can help to develop the rest of the poem. The (A) line will need to be a line that can be repeated several times in the poem, it should have an ending word that will rhyme with other words, and a strong or powerful tone that will be a good opening and closing for the poem. Many poets also try to make the first line eight to ten syllables long so that it is not too wordy and it will flow with the rest of the poem.


For example, for a triolet about a tortoise, your (A) line might be: “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.” This is an ideal (A) line because it ends on a word that is easy to rhyme with other words and it stays close to 10 syllables.
 The second line of the poem, the (B) line, will also need to be strong and have impact, as it will be a grounding line throughout the poem. The line should end with a word that is easy to rhyme with other words, as you will need to create a supporting line that rhymes with the (B) line.


If you continue the triolet about a tortoise, your (B) line might be: “Though he was once a young man like me.”

, To help you come up with the supporting middle lines of the poem, it may be helpful to place your (A) line and your (B) line within the eight line structure of the triolet:


“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.”
“Though he was once a young man like me.”
(supporting line that rhymes with first line)
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.”
(supporting line that rhymes with first line)
(supporting line that rhymes with second line)
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.”
“Though he was once a young man like me.”
Once you have positioned your first and second lines, you can do some free writing to fill in the supporting lines. Note that you will need to end the supporting lines so they rhyme with the applicable lines in the poem.
 Now that you have filled in all eight lines of the poem, read the triolet out loud to ensure it flows well and each line follows the triolet structure.


For example, your completed triolet about your father, the tortoise, might be:
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow”
“Though he was once a young man like me”
“He is full of knowledge I will never know”
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow”
“His thoughts and memories he will not show”
“Yet I try to set them free”
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow”
“Though he was once a young man like me.”

, Once you have a completed triolet, it will need a title. Many poets use the first line of the triolet as the title of the poem, or they choose the theme or subject to act as the title of the poem.


For the triolet example about your father, a good title might be: “The Tortoise”.

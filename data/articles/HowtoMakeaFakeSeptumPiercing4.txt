 Keep all the materials you're using for your fake septum clean. As you're placing your septum inside your nose, dirty materials could cause infection or illness. Wash pliers, wires, paperclips, and other materials in clean water with antibacterial soap before use.
 When using your pliers, make quick and clean cuts. You do not want to end up with rough edges. This can puncture or tear your skin.








In the event you end up with rough edges, use some sand paper to gently sand them down until they're smooth., Avoid using any materials you're allergic to when making a fake septum. If you notice a rash or burning, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction.If you do experience an allergic reaction, apply antibacterial cream. Make an appointment with your physician to see how to treat the infection. Stop using any fake piercing that resulted in an infection. Try to make a different septum using other materials., With any of the above methods, wear the piercing around your house before wearing it out. You may have to adjust the size if it does not fit in your nose.

A septum piercing is worn on the bridge of flesh separating your nostrils. Place your piercing around this bridge and walk around for a bit.
If the piercing falls off or feels loose, use your pliers or fingers to tighten your fake piercing. Conversely, if it's feels painful you may have to increase the size of your loop.

 Glance around the screen or at your radar every once in a while. You do not want to be surprised.;
, If you are good at the sniper you should pick it. Gunner is a great class for big groups of enemies as well as grenadier.
 If you get lost on a particular map or do not know where that sniper is you should go back again by your self and get familiar.
 Remember, this is not halo, you can be killed in 1 hit. Hide behind walls and trees or anything that bullets can't fly through.
 When playing on campaign you should know how to give your team commands. On Xbox Live you should have good communication with your partners.
 Unless you are a Gunner and especially if you are a Sniper you must use ammo only when you think it is wise to shoot.

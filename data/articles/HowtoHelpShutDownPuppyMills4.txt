 To reduce the amount of business that puppy mills receive, encourage friends and families to adopt their dogs from shelters or rescues instead of buying them from stores.If someone you know mentions that they want to adopt a puppy, you can say, “That’s sounds great. Are you going to rescue one from the shelter? That’s the best way to find a healthy puppy that wasn’t born in a mill.”
If they want a purebred, you can offer to go check out the breeder with them. You can say, “Make sure you visit the breeder so you know that the puppy didn’t come from a mill. I’d love to come check it out with you if you’re worried about that.”
Always try to maintain a positive tone, and don’t criticize your friends. You’re much likelier to convince them if you remain non-judgmental and pleasant.
 If your friend seems insistent on going to a puppy mill, you might try to warn them that mill dogs are more likely to have genetic or behavioral problems. These puppies may also be infected with a disease like mange, kennel cough, or parvovirus.You might say, “You know that puppies that come from pet stores may not be as healthy, right? In fact, they’re more likely to be sick when you adopt them.”
You should also remind them, “Puppies from mills are taken from their mothers too soon. The dog may develop bad habits or behavior problems. It’s safer just to adopt.”

, When you find news stories about puppy mills, share them on social media so that your entire social network can learn about the abuses and problems caused by puppy mills. This will help prevent others from buying from mills.

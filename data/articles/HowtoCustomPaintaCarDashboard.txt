 Consider matching your car's exterior paint color or creating a 2-tone color effect.;
, A custom auto shop can match a car's factory paint or create custom colors for you. Just Dashes and Redline Gauge Works are 2 companies that can create or match paint colors for customers' cars.
 This will help the paint adhere to the dashboard surface.
, Try spraying 3 light coats of aerosol paint onto your dashboard.


If painting a dash with more than 1 color, you can also put painter's tape on parts of the dash painted in the first color that you want to protect before applying the second color.
 Remove any blue tape you put on the dashboard.
 This will prevent colored paint from the dashboard from getting on your fingers.
 Use small paintbrushes from a hobby or craft shop and canned car paint to do delicate or detailed work, such as lettering or a logo.
 These kits offer pieces of trim that can improve the look of wood dashboards and may be available for dashboards made of carbon fiber or other synthetic materials too. You may be able to paint over your kit's pieces or use a kit instead of paint.


The installation process usually involves applying primer to your cleaned, dry, existing dash, and then peeling and sticking the trim material onto the dashboard.

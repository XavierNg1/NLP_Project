 Make a barn or other suitable place for your horse to stay. A barn can be made from a large cardboard box:


Use the opening part of the box to turn into the stable doors. Cut the flaps in half, leaving them attached to the box still. To draw the flaps together when the horse is inside, push in a thumbtack in the middle opening edge of each door. Wind thread around one tack of a top door, and one of another door. Glue in place to keep on these two doors permanently. When you wish to close the doors, simply wind the unglued end of thread around the other two thumb tacks and the doors will stay shut. (Other methods can also be improvised.)
Draw a wood paneling design on the barn doors to make it seem more realistic.
Cut out a window on the sides of the barn.
Draw grooming gear and tack on the back wall of the barn.
Paint the whole box a barn color if wished.;
, Build a stall from ice cream sticks or similar craft sticks. Or, use thin unwanted paperback books to build a stall from.


If you have a stallion and a mare, keep them in separate stalls.
 This is optional but fun. Use modeling clay to make brown colored manure piles.


Sprinkle a little sawdust down for added authenticity.

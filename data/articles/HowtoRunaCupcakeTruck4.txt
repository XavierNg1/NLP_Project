 This needs to be something that people will remember and that has a distinctive flair of its own. You might wish to incorporate a cupcake in the design for visual appeal and help in establishing your brand.


If you don't like designing or feel unqualified, hire a designer. You could even consider asking a design student for help. You could also outsource the work to someone through a freelance-design website.
 You might want a board with an arrow that can be placed a little farther away directing people toward your business.


Business cards are always useful.
Special-offer pamphlets can help to spread the word about your business. For example, "12 cupcakes for the price of 8 with this brochure."

 If your kitten doesn’t trust you, you should not overwhelm it with interaction. Let your kitten do its own thing most of the time, and interact with it in several short 15-20 minutes sessions over the course of the day.These sessions might include play time with toys, talking to it, petting, feeding treats, or any other interaction.
By the end of the day, the kitten should have spent at least two hours in total interacting with you. This shared time will help you build a rapport with the kitten.;
, Your parents may have told you that it was impolite to stare. Kittens agree. In the wild, staring is what predators do to their prey, so staring at your kitten will trigger its fear instincts. Instead, blink your eyes often as you interact you’re your kitten. Turn your head from side to side as you speak to it., If you persistently startle your cat by yelling at it or around it, you will have a hard time earning its trust. Instead, always speak to your pet in a soft, loving manner. Your cat will be able to detect when it’s being spoken to with kindness and love, and will begin to trust you.

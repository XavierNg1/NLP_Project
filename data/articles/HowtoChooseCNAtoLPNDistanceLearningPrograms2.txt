 Almost no LPN program is entirely online, because there are practical courses that require patient care and anatomy labs. Choosing a program in your state will help to lower the burden of completing practical courses.


Go to a search engine and type in your state's name, plus the terms "online" and "LPN." Request information from schools that pop up in your search results.
 Community colleges try to provide night courses and online courses to help people work and attend school at the same time. They cater to the needs of non-traditional students.

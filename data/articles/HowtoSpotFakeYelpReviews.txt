 Profile pictures say a lot! If the person who posted a bad review does not have a profile picture at all, that is a great first reason to be suspicious of the review.;
, If you see that the person has no friends, or very few friends, in combination with 1 or 2 reviews, odds are it is a slander review by a competitor.


Typically, people will not go out of their way to make a username and go all the way through the sign up process to post one bad review. That is, unless, they have something to gain, like taking business away from a competitor.
 Odds are if it is a fake profile, they will list little to no information, and leave spots like interests and hobbies empty. Again, they have no reason to fill out a profile; they are simply trying to make competitors lose business.
 This is very important. If you see that it is something vague like ‘Terrible service, will not go back!’, it is usually a fake.


When people post reviews, they tend to describe their experience in detail. They will use names, pricing, and things that happened when they used the company.
These four steps are the easiest way to tell if the review you are reading is real or not. If the review you are reading has 2 or more of these things wrong, then it is probably a slanderous review in an attempt to make their company look better.

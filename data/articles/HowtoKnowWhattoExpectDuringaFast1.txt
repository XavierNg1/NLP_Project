 Cholesterol and blood sugar tests require fasting from food and drinks. Water is typically allowed. The period of fasting may be 12 hours prior to the test, or as otherwise noted.;
, Fasting for a medical test causes hunger and slight dehydration. This is especially true if you last ate before bedtime and your test appointment is scheduled during late afternoon the next day.
 Taking your test first thing in the morning limits discomfort because you can sleep for the majority of the fasting hours.

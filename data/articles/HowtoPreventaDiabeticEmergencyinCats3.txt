 If your pet is alert, feed it a meal to regulate its blood sugar. If your cat is not alert enough to eat, give it a tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to lick to perk it up. Once your cat is responsive enough, feed it its normal food.Never pour syrup or honey directly into your cat's mouth as it might cause choking, or get absorbed into the lungs.
 If your cat is unconscious, rub corn syrup or honey on its gums to try to revive it (which should occur within 1-2 minutes of the sugar being absorbed into the gums). If it wakes up, try to feed it some of its regular food and bring it to your veterinarian as soon as possible. If your cat does not wake up, or if it experiences seizures, bring it to the nearest emergency animal clinic immediately., Make a plan for veterinary emergencies beforehand to prevent panic or uncertainty in a crisis. Write down the name, phone number, and address of the two nearest 24 hour emergency care pet clinics. Place the information on the fridge or another easy-to-spot place so that it will be accessible in an emergency., If your cat is unconscious or has seizures, do not hesitate to bring it to an 24 hour emergency veterinary clinic immediately. If your cat is conscious but sluggish during an attack, wait for it to stabilize then transport it to your veterinarian as soon as possible. If your cat misses an insulin shot, or is given too much insulin, contact your veterinarian for see when it should receive the next dose.

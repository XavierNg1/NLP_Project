 About once a month, deep clean your toaster. Do so by cleaning the crumb tray and then wiping down the interior and exterior with vinegar. This will keep your toaster from building up too many crumbs and other debris.
 Once a week, remove the crumb tray and shake it out over the garbage. If you don't have a removable crumb tray, turn the toaster upside down and shake it out over the garbage.
 Every day, when you're doing routine cleaning in the kitchen, do not neglect your toaster. Wipe the toaster down with a wet rag or a rag dampened with vinegar. This will keep too much dirt and dust from building up on the toaster's exterior.

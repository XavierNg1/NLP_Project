 You shouldn’t be afraid to blow your nose in class if you do it in a considerate manner. Every single human being blows their nose, and guess what? You shouldn’t be embarrassed to do it too.


Be sure to turn away from others when you blow. Facing a direction other than at someone else is a fundamental rule to remember when blowing your nose in the presence of others.
 Blowing your nose overly hard not only makes it louder and therefore more embarrassing, it can also have detrimental effects, especially if you have a cold or excessive bacteria in your nasal passages. Don’t blow too hard. Blowing too hard can cause excessive pressure which may force mucus back into your sinuses and ear canals.
Instead of blowing through both nostrils, place a finger over your tissue and one nostril and close it off, blowing through the other nostril, then switching nostrils.
 Instead of trying to clear all of the mucus from your nasal passages at once, blow your nose with more frequency and less force-this will also keep the noise to a minimum.


When you have a cold or runny nose, the mucus will continue to develop, so you won’t be able to simply clear it all at once.
Avoid “honking”- remember, blowing with excessive force can actually prolong the symptoms and in the long run cause you to need to blow your nose more rather than less.

 Pick up the knife and hold it using either the handle or blade grip.









Your dominant hand—the one you write with, etc.—should be the same hand used for holding and operating the knife. Your non-dominant hand will be responsible for guiding the knife during the process.
The blade grip is recommended if you feel comfortable with it, but this guiding technique can be used with both the blade and handle grips.
 Place the food being cut on top of your cutting board. Hold it in place with your fingertips.









Place your fingertips on the top surface of the food, then curl or bend your fingers slightly so that the fingertips are hidden beneath your knuckles. Holding ingredients in this manner will keep them stable while also minimizing the risk of cutting yourself.Due to the way the non-dominant hand looks, this is often referred to as the “claw” cutting position.
The food should be held in a stable position. Ideally, you should place it on the board with the flat side down. When there is no natural flat side, it is usually well-advised to begin by cutting off a portion or slice to create a flat space. That flat space should then remain face down on the board for the rest of the process.
 As you cut with the knife, try to guide the blade with the knuckles of your non-dominant hand.









Bring the blade down to the food and hold it at that level for the entire cutting process.
Before you actually begin to cut, lightly press the top knuckles of your index and middle finger to the smooth, flat side of the blade.
While cutting, gradually ease your entire hand back as you move the knife along the length of the food. Your knuckles should stay in contact with the blade the entire time.

 Why do you think they hate you?. If they hate you for no reason, and you have done nothing wrong, then you're the victim. Instead of you going and asking them what's the matter, they will more likely run of, or start laughing. The smartest thing to do is, act as if they like you, so pretend you think that they like you and be nice to them, then they will start thinking oh, she\he thinks i like her, then they start showing you that they hate you, they will start giggling, and laughing at you, After, Smile and say "Your pathetic" And walk off. So now you might know why they don't like you, because maybe of your character, the way you look.;
, They have nothing to do, so they just annoy you follow you, and try to make you start a fight, keep your self calm, forget and ignore what they say, if your really angry count to ten and say in your head, "Be STRONGER!" It works all the time. So in other words, they just want your reaction, and want you to get in trouble.
 Make sure they hear. And what do you think they will be doing, standing there speechless, you've just freaked them\her\him out!

, This is the most important step ever, don't cry in front of them, because they will feel stronger, look stronger, and when for example, they say something like "Cry baby!" You can't say nothing back, because every time you cry, You can't talk back, you cry even more, and feel weaker, also, of course, look weaker.
 Then they will again, feel weaker and you'll be stronger.
 Being ignorant, moody, It wouldn't work, it will get you into trouble, and take you in to bad habits, be sarcastic, so if they are the only ones, swearing and calling you rude names. Just laugh, and say, do you know how ridiculous you look???

, It always works, and you will definitely, make them shut up. Every time you walk past them, just pretend they are not there. Don't even try to look at them, It always works, it's hard at first, but always try again.

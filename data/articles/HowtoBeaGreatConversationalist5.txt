 In other words, stick to the topic they are discussing until a clear tangent is made into another topic altogether. This can often be difficult to do because certain words or phrases can trigger our mind to think of something else. For example, if a friend is telling you about how “chilly” it was at their brother’s wedding the previous weekend, we may start to think about that “chili” we had two weeks ago and want to start discussing that. Refrain from internal distractions.
 Some speakers try too hard in their speeches, which draws their listeners to a bore. If you want to keep them entertained, try to make your speech fun, but formal when needed. Try to throw a joke or 2 in there and make it worthy of listening to.

 While brass and gold have similar colors, gold is shinier and more yellow. Brass is duller than gold and does not have the same vibrant yellow color as pure gold. However, if the gold is mixed with other metals, this method will be less reliable., Gold will not interact with a magnet. Brass, however, will attract the magnet. Bring a magnet close to the metal piece and observe whether it is attracted to the piece or not. If it is, you have brass. If not, you have gold., Gold is a very soft metal. When scratched across a ceramic surface, gold will leave behind a streak of gold. However, brass is harder and will leave a black streak on the same surface. Simply press the metal to an unpolished ceramic surface and pull it across the surface., The most accurate way to test the density of the metal would be to measure the volume and the mass, then calculate the density mathematically. Luckily, thereâ€™s a faster and easier approach. Use your hand to toss the metal lightly up and let it come back down (or you can just lift it and lower it quickly without it leaving your hand). Since gold is more dense than brass, it will feel heavier than you might expect. Since brass has a lower density, it will feel lighter.

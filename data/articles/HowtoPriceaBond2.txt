 The phrase “zero coupon bond” applies to any bond that will not provide any coupon or interest payments during the life of the bond. As a result, the only payment you expect will be the payment of the face value of the bond when it reaches maturity. To find out, ask the broker who is selling the bonds whether the bond will be making coupon payments or not.Although the price of a zero coupon bond may seem obvious -- that it should be the face value -- the price actually takes into account a deduction for the time you must wait until maturity. For example, $1,000 to be paid in five years is not as valuable as $1,000 that you could have today. Therefore, even a zero coupon bond needs to have its price calculated.
 The par value is the face value amount of the bond, which you will expect to receive when the bond reaches maturity. The par value should be evident if the bond is being offered for sale. If you have any question, ask the broker who is selling the bonds what its par value is., This is the interest value that you are promised to receive when the bond reaches maturity. This value should be made evident if the bond is being offered for sale.

For example, a bond may be offered upon the terms that it is a $1,000 face value and a 6% yield over five-years.
 Although you will not be receiving interest payments over the life of the bond, you need to use a theoretical number of payment periods to calculate its value over time. The most common payment schedule is semi-annually. So to compare with these, you would select a number that is equal to the life of your bond, multiplied by two.

For example, if you are considering a bond that matures in five years, you would used a number of payment periods of 5x2, which is 10.
 The bond’s yield is presented as an annual figure, but you will be calculating the bond value based on semi-annual payments. For that reason, you would divide the yield in half.

If the bond has an advertised yield of 6%, use the value of 3% (or 0.03) for the calculation of the bond’s value. This halving of the yield correlates with the number of theoretical payment periods.
 The formula for finding the current value of a bond with zero coupon payments is P=M(1+i)n{\displaystyle P={\frac {M}{(1+i)^{n}}}}. The variables in this calculation are the data that you should know about the bond:


M{\displaystyle M}. This is the face value of the bond at maturity. For the example above, this is 1000.


i{\displaystyle i}. This is the interest rate, adjusted for the calculation purpose. Therefore, if you calculating a 6% yield, at theoretical semi-annual payments, you would use a value of i=0.03. Be sure to rewrite the percentage figure as the correct decimal value.


n{\displaystyle n}. This represents the number of theoretical payments for the calculation. It will be the number of payments per year times the life of the bond. For this example, n=10.
 Applying the basic order of operations to the formula, calculating the value of the bond is fairly straightforward. Perform the operations as follows:

Calculate the base of the denominator by adding 1+i{\displaystyle 1+i}. In the given example, this will result in 1.03.

Apply the exponent to the denominator only. The exponent of n=10{\displaystyle n=10} means that your base of 1.03 is to be multiplied by itself ten times. This will give the result of 1.34. (You can do this by multiplying 1.03x1.03x1.03… for ten times. Alternately, if you have an advanced calculator with a “^” button, you can just enter “1.03^10” to get the result.)

Perform the division last. The final step is to divide the face value by the denominator you have calculated. This gives the result of 1000/1.34, which is 746.27. Expressed in monetary terms, this would be a value of $746.27.
 A bond that will be worth $1,000 in five years, with no interest payments along the way, is always sold at a discounted rate. In this case, the discount should be the calculated value of $746.27.

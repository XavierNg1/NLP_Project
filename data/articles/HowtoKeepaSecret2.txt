 Depending on the type of secret, it may have a built-in end point.


Something like a pregnancy or a surprise gift will have a natural end date.
Other secrets might not have a natural ending point, and you will just have to decide when you will be ready to tell people.
Try waiting a few days if you feel very emotional about the secret. You may regret telling someone immediately, and giving yourself a few days to calm down may help you make more rational decisions about when to tell people and who to tell.
 If you know that you will be able to tell someone in the future, making a detailed plan about how and when to tell may help you keep the secret in the meantime.


If it is a “fun” secret that you’re going to surprise someone with, planning a fun way to tell will help occupy the time before you tell her.
If it is a serious secret, make a plan to give yourself and the person you’re going to tell uninterrupted time alone to talk and discuss the secret.
 Stay busy with other things, and try not to think about the secret too much. If you think about it constantly, it will be much more difficult to keep yourself from telling someone.
 If you are keeping a secret that is upsetting you, you may be standing in your own way. Telling someone may give them the opportunity to help you in a way that you may not expect., If you absolutely must tell someone, be sure you choose the right person.


Think about your past experiences with that person. Have they been trustworthy and discreet in the past?
Be explicit about your expectations when you tell the person your secret: are they allowed to tell anyone? Who and when can they tell?
Know that telling anyone opens up the possibility that the secret will get out.

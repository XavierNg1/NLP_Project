 If a stain persists after the initial wipe down, blot at the stain with a washcloth dipped in a soap and warm water solution. Continue dipping the cloth in soapy water and blotting at the stain until it disappears. Use a dry cloth to blot the spot-cleaned areas dry.


Don’t use household cleaners or bleach on faux wood blinds. These chemicals may damage the finish on them.
 If the blinds are caked with layers of dirt and dust, open the slats and then unhook the blinds. Carefully remove them from the window frame. Lay the blinds down on a large white sheet. When you place the blinds down on the sheet, the slats will be open and horizontal (since you opened them before you took them down)., Fill a bucket of warm, soapy water. Dip a clean cloth into the solution and wipe each slat down thoroughly on both sides. Rinse the rag in the soapy water when it becomes dirty. Wring out the excess water and continue.
 After you’ve cleaned each slat, blot them dry with a microfiber cloth.Spot clean the pull cords with the same solution. Before you re-hang your blinds, run a dryer sheet across each slat. This will help prevent dust from settling on them.If your blinds are heavy or hung very high, have someone assist you with re-hanging them.

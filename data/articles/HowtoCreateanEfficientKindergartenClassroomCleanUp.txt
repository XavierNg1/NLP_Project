 Clean-up is simpler if every object has a designated area. In addition, there are zones for each kind of material: the art area, block area, book area, sensory table, drama loft, science area. Clean-up is easier if objects do not generally go wandering throughout the room.;
, Make containers easy to manage containers, such as see-through plastic boxes that allow students easily find what they need without rummaging through a dozen boxes.
 Make it extremely clear where everything goes. Label both with words and with pictures--kindergartners are developing reading skills.
 Avoid the temptation to put too many materials out at once. Doing so may create so much of a mess that the students can become overwhelmed before even giving clean-up a try.
 Don't assume the students know how to clean up at all--some may not ever have had this responsibility at home. Go over these explicitly with the students. The rules of clean-up at "free play" or "exploration time" should be made very clear. A rotating job chart can be very useful in fair job distributions.
 To let children know that clean-up time is approaching, it's important to pick an easily identifiable signal to use near the end of the work time: flipping the lights, a song, holding up one hand and using the other to cover your mouth, using a clapping pattern. Have your students practice responding to the signal.
 Emphasize that everyone needs to help keep a tidy workspace, not just at free play.
 Kindergartners usually have a lot of difficulty with tidiness. It's real work, often done when one is tired, usually not a lot of fun, and quite honestly, most young students do not really overtly care a lot about. So have patience and compassion yourself.
 The tell the children they did a good job, which will give them motivation to clean up again in the future.

 Place the plantain flat on a cutting board. Use a sharp paring knife to cut off the stem and tip of the plantain.;
, If you examine the plantain you'll see that its peel is ridged lengthwise. Use the paring knife to slice into the skin along the length of the ridges. Don't slice too far in, or you'll mangle the plantain; stick the knife in just far enough to slice the skin.
 Working lengthwise, remove a strip of the plantain by pulling up the end with your fingers. Use the knife to help work it loose, and keep pulling it up until the whole strip is off. Continue removing the remainder of the peel in the same way.
 Green plantains don't peel cleanly, so you'll probably see a few bits of peel left stuck to the fruit. Use the knife to slice these off and discard them. The plantain is now ready to use.

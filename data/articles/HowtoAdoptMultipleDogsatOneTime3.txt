 Once you have decided on a pair of dogs to adopt, the shelter or rescue group will have you complete an adoption application. This typically involves answering a number of questions about your income, home, employment history, and veterinarian. Because adopting a pair requires a significant investment of time and resources, the vetting process may be more thorough. Do not be surprised if the organization denies your application to adopt multiple dogs. Each organization has its own requirements and adoption process.
 If the shelter or rescue group approves your adoption, you should take 24-hours and think things over. Determine whether you are dedicated to caring for a pair of new dogs. Talk it out with your friends and family.Remember that dogs that are adopted and returned to the kennel suffer significant emotional and mental trauma. This manifests as behavioral problems that make it more difficult for the dogs to get adopted later on.
 If you decide that you still want to move forward with the adoption, you will need to complete some paperwork and pay the organizationâ€™s fees. The paperwork often gives the medical history of the individual dogs and documents your agreement to care for the animals. The fees pay for any licensing and help cover the expenses of the organization running the kennel.The fee can run anywhere from $20 to over $100 per dog. The adoption fee for rescue groups is often higher, ranging between $150 and $400 each.

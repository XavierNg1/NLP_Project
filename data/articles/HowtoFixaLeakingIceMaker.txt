 Many homes have a water shut off behind the refrigerator. Sometimes you need to shut off the water to the entire house. In that case, open a faucet to let the water pressure bleed off. You do not want to continue until the water supply is off.;
, It is much easier if you remove the contents (at least the liquids, which make up most of the weight).
 In most cases, this will be a white plastic flexible pipe about the thickness of a pencil. The hose will run from the wall or floor to the refrigerator.
 This is almost always the source of your leak. You may need to temporarily turn the water back on to find the leak. Remember to turn the water off again before proceeding.
 Be sure that your cut is straight and there are no burrs or extra bits of plastic left behind.
 The connector is available broadly. The connectors are less than two dollars before shipping. Buy extras because the water hose WILL leak again before you replace the refrigerator. The connect is a "push on" style, so you don't need tools to make the splice.
 This is important, because there may be more than one leak.
, You are done. Well done.

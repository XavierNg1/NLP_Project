When you’re done selecting, click “Okay” to begin uploading the photos. Depending on the size of the photos and your Internet connection speed, this could take a while. Wait for it to finish.
 Once the photos have uploaded, you will see them as thumbnails on the next screen. This screen has all the information that you need to fill out before you can create the new album. The top box says “Untitled Album.” If you click inside there, you can rename the album to anything that you want.
 Click below the title, and type in a little something about what the album is about. For example, “First Birthday Party” if the photos are of your child’s first birthday.
 Select the box below the information about the album if you want to tag your location to these photos. For example, you could enter “State Lake, OH” if the birthday party was set there.
 The button can be found at the bottom of the page; clicking this will create the new album and post it to your wall so your friends and family can know about it.

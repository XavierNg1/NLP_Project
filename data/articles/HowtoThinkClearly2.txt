 Do deep breathing and take a mental vacation before you head into a stressful environment.
 Think about the things that are important to you, like friends, family, charity, community or religion. Write for two minutes about why a value is important to you. Then, return to the original topic on which you need to think.

 With this pro-con list, you write down the good, the bad and the interesting points of a problem. This may help you to clear your head and choose a strategy that takes into account all angles.

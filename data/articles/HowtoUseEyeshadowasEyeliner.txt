 You can use any brush you feel the most comfortable with, but an angled brush will likely be easier and more effective to use.;

It may be better to use an unused brush if you are trying to apply eyeliner. Bacteria can easily get in your eye since the brush is so close.
 This will help keep your eye from drying out due to the harshness of the eyeshadow. Eyeshadow is not meant to be used as eyeliner, so it is a good idea to counteract it by using a lotion or primer beforehand.


Take care to not let the primer or lotion touch your eyeball. It will not cause harm, but it will be painful.
 Do not make the brush wet, but just slightly damp. A brush that is too wet will cause the eyeshadow to run and will make it very difficult to apply.


You can also try to use Vaseline. Do not apply so much Vaseline so that the brush is clogged up, but try to make it damp.
 Coat each side of the brush with the eyeshadow. Tap off any excess eyeshadow to avoid fallout when applying the eyeshadow.


Try to use a darker eyeshadow so that it resembles an eyeliner color. Good colors include brown, black, plum or dark green.
 Start at the inside corner of your eye and follow your eyelid to the outside corner using the brush. Depending on the darkness of the eyeshadow, you may need to repeat this step a few times


Try to keep the brush as close to the lash line as possible for an accurate draw.
 Give it a few moments to dry and set before you blink, otherwise you'll get it smudged into your crease.


Try to set it with a translucent powder so that it does not smudge throughout the day.

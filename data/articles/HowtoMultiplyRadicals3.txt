 To find the LCM of the indexes, find the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both indices. Find the LCM of the indices for the following equation:3√(5) x 2√(2) = ?


The indices are 3 and 2. 6 is the LCM of these two numbers because it is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both 3 and 2. 6/3 = 2 and 6/2 = 3. To multiply the radicals, both of the indices will have to be 6.
 Here's what the expressions would look like in the equation with their new indexes:



6√(5) x 6√(2) = ?

, For the expression 3√(5), you'd need to multiply the index of 3 by 2 to get 6. For the expression 2√(2), you'd need to multiply the index of 2 by 3 to get 6.
 For the first equation, make the number 2 the exponent over the number 5. For the second equation, make the number 3 the exponent over the number 2. Here's what it would look like:



2 --> 6√(5) = 6√(5)2


3 --> 6√(2) = 6√(2)3


, Here's how you do it:



6√(5)2 = 6√(5 x 5) = 6√25

6√(2)3 = 6√(2 x 2 x 2) = 6√8

, Place them under a radical and connect them with a multiplication sign. Here's what the result would look like: 6√(8 x 25)

, 6√(8 x 25) = 6√(200). This is the final answer. In some cases, you may be able to simplify these expressions -- for example, you could simplify this expression if you found a number that can be multiplied by itself six times that is a factor of 200. But in this case, the expression cannot be simplified any further.

 Do this by opening this link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/.
 You can do this by clicking the plus icon on the bottom righthand corner of the web page. A new, blank slide will open.


If you already have an existing file you want to add music to, just select it from the list of presentations displayed to open it.
 Go to YouTube and search for any videos you’d like to use as sound or music for your presentation.
 Open the video and copy its URL displayed in the address bar of your web browser.
 Go back to the browser tab where you have Google Presentation opened and click “URL” from the left menu panel on the “Insert Video” window. You’ll then see a text field labeled “Paste YouTube URL here.”

, Paste the URL you copied into the text field then click the “Select” button to add the selected video to your slide.
 Once the video has been inserted, select the arrow button from the menu toolbar. Using your mouse cursor, click on the corner points of the video you’ve just inserted and drag it across the slide to adjust its size to your preference and location.


Resize the video to its smallest size if you just want your audience to hear it play and not see the video itself.
 Click “View” from the menu toolbar and select “Present” from the drop down list to play the presentation. While the presentation is in view, click the video you’ve inserted to play it.

 FVD will take you to a save video page.
 Select the text field at the top and enter the name you wish the file to be saved as.


FVD will automatically pull a filename from the site, but these will sometimes just be long strings of seemingly random character or numbers.
 This button is under the file name text field and will download the file to your device., You can access your videos directly from FVD using the in-app file browser:


Return to the main page of FVD.
Tap “Menu”. This is located just above “Open Browser” in the center of the page.
“My Videos”. A list of your downloads will appear.
Tap a video to play.
You can also download a separate file explorer app if you do not wish to use FVD to browse and view videos.

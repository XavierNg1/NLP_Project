 You can buy inexpensive beaded necklaces at discount stores for as little as $1 and cut a single bead off with scissors.









You can also use wire cutters and snip the post from the back of a bead earring.;
, The small jewels have adhesive applied to the back so it will stay on your skin.You can also snip off the post of a jeweled earring stud (as long as it has a flat back) with wire cutters.









The size of the rhinestone is up to you, but your fake piercing will look more realistic if the jewel is smaller than the bead you chose.
 If you're using a stick-on piece, you don't need to add adhesive. If you made your own piece of jewelry, use spirit gum, nail glue, eyelash glue or body glue so the jewel adheres to your skin.
 Since the back of the bead won't be visible, you can get a little creative with your adhesive. Try to place the bead in the upper part of your belly button, so that it looks like it's attached to the jewelry above.
 Don't jostle or move the pieces for a few minutes while the adhesive dries. It helps to lie down while the glue dries.

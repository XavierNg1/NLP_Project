 Regular exercise helps build up your body, ultimately giving you more energy and more strength. If you find that you are chronically tired and exhausted--physically or mentally--the problem may be that you are burning more calories than you are taking in.;
, Over exercising quickly depletes many of your body's nutrients and replenishing them becomes difficult. Without the proper nutrients fueling your body, you may end up feeling overly anxious, irritable and depressed.
 Your muscles need time to repair themselves after a workout session. If you are working yourself too hard, you aren't giving your muscles the necessary time for regeneration. As a result, your muscles will actually grow weaker, resulting in decreased performance. This will be more noticeable in endurance-based activities, such as running and swimming.
 Muscle soreness is an indicator that your muscles are repairing themselves. If you're experience muscle soreness that lasts for days after your exercise session, your body may be telling you that you need less exercise and more rest.
 When your body is in a state of overload, your sleeping patterns and rhythms are thrown off. This has the potential to be very dangerous, as you need sleep in order for your body to repair itself after exercising. If you are experiencing exercise-related insomnia, take a break from exercising until you return to a normal sleeping rhythm.
 There's nothing wrong with planning an exercise session or reading up on the subject for the future. However, if you find yourself obsessing over exercise to the point where you can't stop thinking about it, then you may be exercising too much.
 Exercise should be something that bolsters your social life by improving your physical and mental health. If you find yourself sacrificing elements of your life--e.g., avoiding plans with friends in order to exercise a little more--then you may be working yourself too hard.

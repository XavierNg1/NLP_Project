 This process will take a bit of experimentation to create the most realistic color. Collect the following colors for your palette:


Burnt Umber
Raw Sienna
Yellow
Red
Purple

, Use a mixing palette or whatever surface you have available. A good alternative to a mixing palette is a sturdy piece of cardboard. Create a blob of each color onto your palette.
 Mix equal parts of burnt umber and raw sienna. Separately mix equal parts of red and yellow together. Then slowly add your red and yellow mixture to the other mixture.
 Have the prospective skin tone that you are trying to emulate nearby. Compare the base you've created with the tone you are shooting for. If you're using a photograph, be aware of the lighting from the photo.
 For darker skin, add small increments of purple. It's best to use dark purple. To create dark purple, add small amounts of either dark grey or black to the purple. Mix until you're satisfied.


Black paint can ruin your base quickly. Use black paint in very small increments. Experiment to find your best mixture.
 For a dark skin tone that feels warmer, mix burnt umber instead of purple. Use small amounts of the mixture to gauge what color you're working with.
 You can lighten the color by adding orange. Orange will hold the realistic tone while lightening the color as well. You can mix yellow and red together to create orange. White paint will throw the colors off too much., After creating the desired skin tone, paint your picture. Keep gray around to adjust shadows and lighting. It'll also be convenient to keep multiple swaths of skin tones available for your painting.

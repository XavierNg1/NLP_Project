 It's easier to part with things when you are doing it on a regular basis and can see the positive results. If you can't get rid of that 20-year-old cheer-leading uniform that you'll never wear again, maybe a year of decluttering other items will make it easier to part with later.;
, Or sell your extras in a yard sale before you end up with an unintended collection.
 If you don't want to give-up something for sentimental reasons, but can't justify the space it takes up, take a photo or photos of it. It can even be more fun to go through a photo album or scrapbook and remember things than it is to pull them out of a dusty box. (Besides, holding up the cheer-leading uniform and noting how small you were "back then" can be really depressing.)

, This will help you remember stories or details that you might forget later, and is great for sharing with family and friends.
 Instead of collecting dust, it could have real purpose again! Focus on this, and give it away. Enjoy the good feeling that comes with sharing and helping others!

,, The ugly lamp that Aunt Cheryl gave you could be replaced by something else that would make you happier because it actually matches the rest of the d√©cor.
 Box it up if you can, so you won't see the item, and give it to someone else before you can change your mind.
 Write the date on the box and mark it "Give away on (date)". Then when that day comes, don't even open the box. Give it to your choice of local charities (Goodwill, etc.) and let it go without thinking about it any more.
 Keep it out somewhere in plain view - e.g. if it's an item of clothing, hang it on your wardrobe door. Once you realise you've seen it every day for a week/ month and haven't wanted to use it, it'll be much easier to part with.
 It's easy to become attached to items, and learning to detach yourself from "stuff" takes time. Keep at it and you'll discover it becomes easier and easier to do.

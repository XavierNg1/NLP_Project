 Set aside a regular time each day to do homework. Even if the time shifts around due to other commitments, always stick to it. Homework exists for a reason––to expand your understanding and to force you to think for yourself, rather than simply relying on what the teacher has to dish out. See it as improving yourself, only this part of yourself is your mind.


If you have trouble with anything, ask the teacher, read further in the book, use your notes or search online. When something is difficult, use this as an opportunity to extend yourself and learn more, rather than as an excuse to give up.
 Teachers ask you to do things for your own benefit. It might not seem like it at the time but in the long run, learning to listen to authority and follow instructions does have a purpose. You will have to do this throughout your life, so the sooner that you realize this is a useful skill, the better. Of course, this doesn't mean that you can't question what is asked of you. But there is a polite way of doing so, which will always work better than the brusque way. Be polite, show that you have thought through things before simply snapping or rebelling. In the long run, knowing how to ask intelligent questions that show that you both understand the instructions but see a better way of doing things will be more likely to get you what you want.
 Make it short notes in a notebook or a composition book. Summarize. This will help you to keep track of the things you need to learn in greater depths.
 Do this every night no matter if you have a test the next day. Gradual retention is always better and longer lasting than last-minute cramming.

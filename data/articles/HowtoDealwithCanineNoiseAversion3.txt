 Some dogs can be helped through the use of pheromones. You can use a collar or an oil diffuser to release the pheromone scents. The smells remind the dog of being with its mother, which may help comfort it.Both the oils you need and the diffusers or collars can be found online and in some pet stores.
 For dogs that are fearful of many noises all the time, an anxiety medicine may help. Your dog would need to take it every day for it to be effective. Talk to your vet about whether this is a good option for your dog.You could say, "My dog has severe noise aversion. He tends to chew walls, whimper, or sprint away from me when there are loud noises. I've heard anxiety medications may help. What do you think of that option for my dog?"
While some dogs may require anxiety meds their whole lives, others can be weaned off of them in time.
Another option is sedatives, taken in the moment that the dog is being triggered., This medication hit the markets in 2016. It's an option designed specifically for treating noise aversion in dogs. The drug is designed to stop norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is somewhat like adrenaline, and it pumps up your dog's anxiety. This drug helps to block the increase of norepinephrine. Better yet, it wears off in a few hours.You could say, "My dog has problems with noise aversion. He runs and hides every time there is a thunderstorm or fireworks, and he tries to burrow into tiny spaces. I'm afraid he's going to hurt himself. I've heard there's a new drug on the market, Sileo, meant for this issue. Do you think that's a good option?"

 Choose a location that is relatively flat so there will be less work involved in leveling it later on.


The size of a regulation NBA and NCAA basketball courts are 94 feet (28.7 m) by 50 feet (28.6 m by 15.24 m). The size of most high school basketball courts is 84 feet (25.6 m) by 50 feet (25.6 m by 15.24 m). For half-court dimensions, divide the length by 2.;
, If you are making a half court, purchase only 1 hoop.
 Place stakes in each of the 4 corners.
 Remove everything but dirt from the staked-out area. This includes all rocks, sticks and grass. Leveling requires transferring dirt from high areas to low areas before being packed down.
 Make sure the weather is dry before performing this step. Once the concrete has been poured, you will need to wait at least 36 hours before utilizing the court.


Pole hoops will need to be installed during the concrete pouring step. Each pole must be placed 1 to 2 feet (30.48 to 60.96 cm) into the ground and stabilized with concrete. Regulation height for basketball hoops is 10 feet (3 m) from the ground to the top of the rim.



Spray paint works well, but it is harder to get straight lines without a stencil.
The out-of-bounds line should be 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) thick surrounding the entire court.
The center line runs horizontally from one side to the other directly in the middle of the court.
The free-throw line is exactly 15 feet (4.57 m) from the hoop and 12 feet (3.65 m) long.
The free-throw lane is 12 feet (3.7 m) by 19 feet (the top of the box is the free-throw line).
 These are the 3-point arc, the center circle and the boxes.

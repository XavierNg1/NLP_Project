 If you have performed well as an amateur an owner might ask for you to drive for their team. These teams are often owned by car companies and have their own sponsorships to cover costs. They usually sign their drivers on a season-to-season basis.
 Most Formula 1 drivers have some sponsors that require additional work off the track. To attract sponsors you need to have success on the track and a positive public opinion. You may have to do appearances or photo shoots for your sponsor in addition to your on-track work. Racing is a very expensive sport, so drivers must look to add to supplement their racing income whenever possible.
 Pay drivers are common in many levels of motorsports, including Formula 1. Instead of being paid by the race team, the driver uses money from sponsorships or their personal fortune to fund the racing operations.While this isn't practical for most new racers in Formula 1, it is an option if you have the ability to pay for it.

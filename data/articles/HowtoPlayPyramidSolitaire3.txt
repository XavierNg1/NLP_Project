 Start the game off with an extra row of six free face-up cards in reserve. These cards may be played at any time throughout the game. Keep in mind that the reserve row isn't replenished; you only get six reserve cards per game.


Try using a reserve row if you're having trouble winning the basic game., As you build your pyramid, try spacing out the cards differently to create new and unique patterns. You don't necessarily need a perfect pyramid to create a playable game.


You could also make a pyramid with essentially the same layout as the basic game but with an extra row, making the base eight cards wide.
 Only allow yourself to go through your stock once. Waste cards can never return to the stock, and the only way to go back through your waste is to match each top card. This adds a challenge to the game if you find yourself getting too good at it.In addition to the extra difficulty, this variation has more unwinnable hands.

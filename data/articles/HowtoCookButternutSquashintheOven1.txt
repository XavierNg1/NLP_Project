 Prepare a roasting pan or deep baking dish by lightly coating the bottom with cooking spray.


You could also coat the pan in butter or cover it with aluminum foil to prevent the squash from sticking to the bottom.





;
, Use a sharp serrated knife to cut the squash into quarters lengthwise.


Cut the squash in half from top to bottom. Use a sawing motion.






Cut each half in half, again working from top to bottom in a sawing motion.






Peeling the squash is not necessary.






Use a metal spoon or melon-baller to remove the seeds and stringy pulp.
 The quarters should be cut-side up.
 Coat the upward-facing, cut-side of each quarter.

Drizzle a generous amount of olive oil over each quarter.






Divide the butter equally among all the quarters. Dot the cut surface with small chunks of butter.






Sprinkle salt and pepper over the squash. This should be done according to taste, but if you are uncertain where to start, use roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.62 ml) pepper per quarter.






Additional herbs and seasonings can also be used. For instance, you can sprinkle the squash with thyme or parsley for a savory taste or a dash of red pepper for a spicier flavor.
 The squash should be tender enough to stick a fork into.


The entire squash may not be browned, but you should begin seeing golden-brown patches developing, especially along the edges.
 Let cool slightly before serving warm.

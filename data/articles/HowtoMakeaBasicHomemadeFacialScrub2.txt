 Green tea is said to have anti-aging effects when applied to the skin. It reduces wrinkles and blemishes, and even repair scar tissue.


For best results, use loose green tea and a tea ball or strainer, rather than using a bag of green tea.
If you're using bagged green tea, go with plain tea, rather than flavored. This will give you a more concentrated result.
 Allow the tea to cool.
 Keep adding sugar until the mixture has a consistency that's gritty enough to scrub your skin, but still wet enough to apply easily.
 Make sure it's thoroughly mixed in. Honey has great moisturizing and antibacterial properties.


To store this scrub for later, put the mixture in a jar sealed with a lid. Keep it in a cool, dry place. It should last for several weeks.
 Rub the scrub all over your face, concentrating in spots that are dry. Use a wet washcloth to remove the scrub, and splash cold water over your face when you're finished.

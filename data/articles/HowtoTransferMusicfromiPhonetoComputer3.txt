 You must have iTunes 10 or later to use it.


Download the program at: http://www.getsharepod.com/

After downloading the EXE file, open it and begin the installation process. Follow the on screen instructions to complete the process and install SharePod on your computer.
 Use a USB cable to connect your iPhone to your computer.


Your iPhone will likely have come with this cable. It will be the same cable you use for your wall outlet, but you will need to remove the plug portion of the cable to reveal the computer end of the cable.
 After installing the program, you need to double-click on the icon on your desktop to open it.


It is advisable to do this after you plug in your iPhone. Otherwise, when SharePod searches for a device, it will not find anything and may not recognize your iPhone even after you do plug it in.
 Click on your iPhone in the side panel of the SharePod program if necessary. The music on your iPhone should open up in the main window of the program. You can select one or several songs to transfer to your computer from this main panel.


After selecting your songs, click on the "Copy to computer" button in the upper left corner of SharePod.
If you want to transfer all your songs to your computer, you can skip the selection process and simply click on the "Backup iPod" button. This button should work even when using your iPhone.
 A SharePod window will pop up asking you to choose a location on your computer to place your files in. Navigate to this location and hit the OK button.


You will also need to indicate how you want the music to be organized.
 SharePod will begin transferring your music at this point. All you need to do is let the process finish on its own.


After this point, you can eject your iPhone from your computer and close out of SharePod.

 This seems like a very huge step. But in order to get Beldum, you must complete the game.;
,, However, he may say something else and give you the item King's Rock. If so, this means you have already been to Steven's house, in which case you just go back there and Beldum's there. In the likes of people who don't look in houses, keep reading.
 Go inside and there is a Poke Ball which contains Beldum and there is a letter saying that Steven is going out to find himself, which coincidentally is at Meteor Falls to battle, Steven specialises in steel type, he also has a Metagross, how ironic! That is how you get a Beldum on Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire.

 In Asia, acupuncture has long been a popular way to bring on labor, and its effectiveness is being studied in the U.S. In a small University of North Carolina study of women who were 39.5 to 41 weeks pregnant, 70% of those who received just three acupuncture sessions went into labor on their own, compared to 50% of those who did not receive treatment., Sex releases hormone-like substances that are similar to the medications used to induce labor. The key--be sure the man ejaculates inside the vagina; the semen is what contains prostaglandins, those hormone-like substances.Prostaglandins help the cervix to ripen (soften) and encourage it to open. Other thinking suggests that having an orgasm plays a role, because during orgasm, the hormone oxytocin is released. This hormone is also responsible for triggering labor contractions.
 Nipple stimulation also produces oxytocin, the hormone that helps trigger contractions. Try stimulating your nipples one at a time with your fingers the way a baby would when sucking. Massage them for about five minutes and then wait 15 minutes or so to see if contractions begin. If not, try again. Another option--if you are still breastfeeding a toddler, let him or her attach and see if that brings results. If contractions do get underway, stop the stimulation.

 If you have a spill on your carpet that is liquid, you should try to soak up as much of it as you can right away. Whether it's a beverage, urine, food, or other type of liquid, baking soda does a great job of absorbing all kinds of liquid and pulling them out of your carpet.Sprinkle baking soda over the stain, making sure that you put enough down to absorb all of the liquid. Give it a few minutes to soak it up.
 If you have a simple water-soluble spill, you can use a mixture of vinegar and water to clean it up. Mix a 1/4 teaspoon of white vinegar with 32 ounces of water in a spray bottle. Spray it on simple spills and then blot the area to remove all the residue. Some spills that this will work on include:Beer
Cola
Milk
Dirt

, Blood stains can be particularly hard to get out of fabrics, including carpets. Hydrogen peroxide can be helpful with removing blood, as it is a natural oxidizer and so it can break blood up. Put some hydrogen peroxide on a clean cloth and dab the area repeatedly. It can take awhile to get the blood out, so take your time and be patient while the hydrogen peroxide does its magic.Be sure to test that the hydrogen peroxide will not damage the carpet fibers on an area of carpet that is not seen before using it in a visible area.
 Club soda will remove many acidic stains, such as coffee, wine, or juice. Simply blot the area with a cloth covered in club soda. Keep adding more club soda to the cloth as it is absorbed into the stained area until the area is relatively saturated.As the stain is removed, and gets onto the cleaning cloth you are using, use a different area of the cloth to blot, so that the stain is not reapplied to the carpet.
Once the stain is gone, make sure to keep dabbing the area with a dry cloth until the area is dry.

 There's always somebody who takes pleasure in worrying people. Puberty is such a worrying thing that some people will enjoy making you even more worried about your body. If you know someone is a liar, don't listen to what they say and just leave them alone.;
, If you make out that you're not worried by anything you're told, the liars and teasers should leave you alone. If you listen to them or seem to be taking in what they say, they'll come back again and again.
 People in these conversations BRAG. They will exaggerate anything about their body or their sordid exploits, and you would be well advised to avoid these conversations.
 If you're trying to stop someone following you around and talking about puberty, stay near an adult. Any adolescent following you won't want to be overheard, so they'll go away.
 If your friends are misinformed, they might pass that misinformation back to you. If you see someone you talk to about puberty talking with bullies or the braggers, encourage them to come away and do something else.

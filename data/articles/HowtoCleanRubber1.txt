 Fill a bucket with roughly 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water. Add 1 tbsp (15 ml) of dish soap to the water. Stir the solution with your clean hands or a utensil, like a wooden spoon, until the soap is distributed throughout and bubbles form., Dip a clean cloth or rag into the solution. Remove the rag and wring out excess solution into the bucket. Scrub dirty rubber firmly with your cloth until it is clean.Your cleaning cloth will absorb dirtiness while cleaning. Remove this by dunking the cloth in the solution and wringing it out over the bucket.
Avoid using abrasive cleaners and cleaning tools. These can deform or cloud the surface of your rubber.
 Once the dirtiness has been removed, turn on your sink and run the rubber under the faucet to rinse away all soap from the rubber. Leftover solution can be used for other cleaning projects or dumped down the drain.
 Choose a spot out of the sun when air drying rubber. Sunlight will break down rubber over time.Avoid using direct heat to dry rubber, as this can also damage it. Speed up dry times by blowing air on drying rubber with a hairdryer set to “Cool.”


In some cases, it may seem as though the rubber is cleaned while wet, but when it dries, stickiness may remain.
Clean remaining stickiness a second time with soapy water as described, or use rubbing alcohol in the fashion described in the following step.
 Although alcohol is an effective cleaner for most kinds of stickiness, you should only use this cleaning agent on rubber occasionally. Dampen a clean rag with alcohol and wipe at sticky areas until they are removed. Rinse the rubber with water afterwards.Exposing rubber too often or too long to alcohol may cause it to break down more quickly than normally.

 To potty train a dog, keep track of when your dog usually uses the bathroom. Most dogs eliminate shortly after dinnertime. Track your dog's bathroom habits for about a week. Then, try to schedule letting your dog out around the time he usually has to eliminate., You can actually train your dog to eliminate on command. Create a command that you will use to signal to your dog it's time to go. Something like, "Go potty" should be sufficient. Say this command when you notice your dog squatting or sniffing as this means he will probably eliminate soon., Dogs tend to respond best to positive reinforcement. Always praise your dog when he eliminates outside.


Say something like "Good boy" immediately after your dog eliminates. Then, pet him a bit to show him he's done well.Some dogs respond well to a reward like a small treat. Consider taking a small bag of treats with you when you let your dog out. Give your dog a treat as a reward as soon as he eliminates., Dogs do not respond well to punishment. Scolding your dog after he's eliminated inside or confining him to his crate as punishment will not help. It will only create a stressful situation for the dog that might make accidents more frequent. If you catch your dog in the act, clap your hands fast and say "No!" and then take him outside. However, never punish a dog after an accident has occurred. Dogs live in the immediate moment as they might be confused as to why they're in trouble., If your dog does have an accident indoors, clean up the area thoroughly. Dogs tend to be attracted to spots where they've previously eliminated. Accidents might reoccur if you do not clean an area after an accident.


Look for special cleaners designed to remove pet urine and feces. However, urine especially can be difficult to get out of carpet. You may have to hire a carpet cleaner.

 Make sure that you are using a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters. Memory wire is very strong, and it can damage a more delicate pair of beading or jewelry wire cutters. Do not cut the three coils apart; this will make one napkin ring.
 Pinch the end of the memory wire with the tip of your pliers. Wrap the wire over the top of the pliers forming a loop. Make sure that you are bending the loop back towards the arch of the wire., You can use any type of beads you'd like. You can even play around with different shapes, sizes, and colors. For a more professional look, work in odd numbers for each design. For example, you could have three seed beads, and one large, brown bead, followed by three more blue seed beads. Leave about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) at the end of your wire bare, so that you can make the end loop.
 Pinch the end of the wire with your plies, and curl it in on itself to make a loop.
 Use a pair of pliers to open up a jump ring, then slip your desired charm onto it. Position the jump ring wherever you want it to be on the napkin ring (between two beads or at one of the end loops), then close it.


Open your jump ring by pulling the two ends past each other, like a door. Don't pull them away from each other by pulling on them.
 Roll or fold your napkin into a tube or rectangle, then wrap the napkin ring around the middle. If you'd like, you can gently fluff out each end of the napkin for a fancier look.

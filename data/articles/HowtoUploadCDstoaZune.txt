 The USB input is found along the sides or on the back of the computer.
 Usually, the page that loads is the "quickplay" screen.
 Click it, and your disk's title and track names should appear.


If the names of the songs don't show, or if all tracks are "unknown," right mouse click on each of the tracks and rename them.
 It will take a while to upload the CD to your Zune collection.
 Find the CD in your collection, and then click and drag it to the little Zune icon in the bottom left corner of the screen.


There will also be a little CD icon in the corner as well. Don't drag it to this icon unless you wish to create a burn list.
 When it shows "Sync Complete," your CD should be finished loading onto your Zune, ready for you to enjoy!

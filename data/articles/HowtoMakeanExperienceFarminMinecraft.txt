 There are spawners of every mob with the exception of bosses, creepers, slimes, endermen, and magma cubes. The most common spawner can be found in an abandoned mineshaft, although these spawners can be more difficult to make;
, If you are playing on hardcore mode or do not want to change it to peaceful, you can light up the area very well. If there are any vaguely dark spots, mobs will spawn.
 This is the actual area where the mobs will spawn. Make the hole two blocks above the spawner and three blocks below the spawner as the mobs can sometimes spawn in the wall, suffocate, and not get you any exp.
 Place the water along the 8 long wall. Water will flow for eight blocks, and the mobs will not fight the current.
 Place water at one of the ends. This will move the mobs to a place you can kill them at.
 Go out of the hole and create a small 3x3 room. Replace the top block. This should make it so that you can see the monsters' legs but they shouldn't be able to hit you.
 Test out your mob trap. If they can get you, turn it back to peaceful and make changes. You could also make a trap with redstone to kill the mobs, meaning you wouldn't have to spend so much time down there. If you can kill them, then you can turn it to whatever difficulty you want. Kill the mob and harvest exp!

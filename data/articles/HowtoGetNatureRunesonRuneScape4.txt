 Nature Island is an island in the Wilderness that contains the only Nature Rune respawn in the game (for free players that is). It spawns about every seventy seconds which is a pretty good rate. However, there is no way to possibly set foot on to the tiny island. No Big Deal though, all you have to do is cast Telekinetic grab (requires level 33 Magic).

 Mix together a paste with baking powder and a small amount of water. Then use the paste and a cloth to scrub away the adhesive. If it is not coming off, wipe the paste on the adhesive and let it set for several minutes.

 A regular eraser meant to remove pencil is okay to use. Vigorously rub the residue with an eraser until it begins to lift. Continue until most or all of the residue is removed. If there is still some left, you can use a blade to remove it.
 It is better to use a plastic blade to remove residue. You can find blades specifically made for removing stickers on Amazon or similar websites. Search for label and sticker removers. Work the tip of the blade under the residue. Then, move the blade back and forth until the residue begins to come off. Continue using the blade until most or all of the residue has been removed.

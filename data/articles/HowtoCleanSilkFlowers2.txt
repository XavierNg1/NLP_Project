 If silk flowers have been in storage for awhile, they may build up dirt and grime. In this case, you can wash flowers in water with dish soap in a sink full of warm water, mix in two to three tablespoons of gentle dish soap. You can then gently swish your flowers in the water. This should remove any unwanted dirt and grime.When you're done, set your flowers on a towel. Allow them to air dry.
Make sure to add water to a small portion of the flowers first to make sure it does not damage them.
 Take a spray bottle and fill it halfway with distilled vinegar and halfway with water. From there, shake the bottle until the water and vinegar are mixed together. Spray the flowers with a light amount of the mixture and then let them dry.If you've never exposed your flowers to water before, spritz a light amount of water on a small corner of the flowers to see if it causes damage first.
 Many cleaning sprays are sold specifically for silk flowers. Some of these sprays can work well, but use discretion. Make sure the spray is designed for silk flowers, as sprays made for artificial flowers in general may not work on silk.You should also keep in mind flower sprays may be more expensive than other methods.
 If you have a dishwasher that can be a set to a gentle cycle, you can wash your flowers on the top rack without detergent. A mild amount of water will wash off set in dirt and dust. However, make sure manufacturer's instructions first as some silk flowers are not dishwasher friendly. This can result in your dishwasher getting stained and flowers getting damaged.As always, make sure your flowers respond well to water by adding a small amount to the flowers before washing them.

 In addition to disorientation and decreased social interaction, dogs with dementia have sleep disturbances (pacing at night, waking up at the wrong time), bladder problems, and anxiety.These problems can be distressing to your dog. To support your dog, give it reassurance that you will be there to comfort it when it feels anxious.Simple activities like petting your dog and quietly talking to it can be reassuring to your dog.
 Dementia is not curable. However, there are medications that can help lessen dementia’s effects. For example, a medication called Anipryl reduces free radicals in the brain and prolongs dopamine activity.Dopamine, which helps nerve cells communicate, is usually reduced in dogs with dementia.Because dementia can make a dog feel anxious, anti-anxiety medications are helpful for supporting a dog with dementia.Schedule an appointment with your vet to discuss medication options for your dog.
 Because your dog may not be to control its bladder muscles very well, an indoor litter box will help prevent bathroom accidents.Litter boxes are practical for small dogs, but won’t be so convenient if you have a large breed dog. Below are some tips to litter train your dog:Select a litter box with a low entry point so your dog can easily climb into and out of it.
Line the litter box with pee pads or newspaper.
Take your dog to the litter box when it’s showing signs of needing to eliminate (sniffing, circling).

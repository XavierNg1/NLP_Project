 The reason? Dogs easily detect the presence of the spirits. It will be daring to you also with the dog.;
, Doing this will give the ghost(s) a chance to scope you out, and accept your presence in 'their' home.
 This will avoid riling the ghost(s) to the changes going on during the transition from former occupants.
 If you can make a ghost happy by placing a chair in a particular place, it could save you lots of trouble later on.
, For example, on October 29 of a year, try to talk about how past residents would have felt about the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression (if the house is old enough).
 Try using the room as a storage area and leave the ghost alone.
 Some ghosts try to communicate with the living through dreams. Allowing the ghost to get its message to the living may put an end to the haunting and send the ghost on its way.
 While this may be difficult for some to do, most ghosts will leave you alone if you acknowledge their presence.
 Let it know it is welcome to stay if it leaves you and your family alone.
 Some ghosts can be persistently aggressive and this behavior may prevent you from sleeping or enjoying your home life the way you deserve to. If this happens, never respond in anger. This will only add fuel to the fire. Focus on feeling love for these entities that probably haven't felt love in a very long time (if ever). Directing positive energy toward them can be surprisingly effective in stopping unwanted behavior.

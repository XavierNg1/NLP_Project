 Sometimes cats who exhibit litter box aggression just need more outlets to expel their energy. Try spending a bit more focused play time with the aggressive cat each day and see if that helps the unwanted behavior.Try throwing a toy mouse around for your cat to chase. Or use a string toy to get your cat to run around following it. Use a feather toy to entice your cat to jump up and grab it. Any active game is good for expending excess energy.
 Your cat may be aggressive about the litter box because it prefers one location over another, or it likes a certain kind of litter better. In any case, it’s important to give your cats choices. Try using several different kinds of litter (one in each litter box) so that your cat may choose which one it likes best.Try using one fine grain litter, one clumping litter, one larger grain litter. See which one your cats prefer.
 If the aggressive behavior gets too extreme, try separating the cats for a few days. Make sure each cat has everything they need in their own space – food, fresh water, a clean litter box, and several toys.Make sure you still take some time each day to hang out and play with each cat. Don’t just isolate them.
 To help your cat overcome its aggressive behavior, use positive reinforcement. This means that you should provide your cat with treats and praise when you notice that it doesn’t bother the other cats while they are using the litter box.Don’t give your cat a treat every single time, as this could contribute to a weight problem.
Never use negative reinforcement. Don’t yell at or hit your cat when you see it acting aggressively. This will only perpetuate the problem.
Instead, try to distract the aggressive cat with something more interesting (attention from you, play time, etc.) and then reward the behavior with praise or (occasionally) a treat.

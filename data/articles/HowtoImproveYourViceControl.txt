 Very few, if any, vices are free. There is almost always a financial cost. Some examples are:


Cigarettes (7.00 a pack)

2 packs a day - $14.00
30 days in a month - $420 dollars
365 days in a year - $5040 dollars


1.3 liters (0.3 US gal) of carbonated beverages (non-diet versions) (Over a dollar for one liters or 44 ounces)568 caloriesIf you drink 2 of those a day, that is most of the calories that you should be taking in and you haven't had any food yet!



;
, Instead of two packs, decide on one...and don't get another one until that day is up. Your body will make the 'modifications' all on its own. Instead of 2 giant carbonated beverages, get one and drink some water (warm and flat soda pop does not taste good, so there is usually no making it last.)

, cigarettes, drinking, etc. Too much of anything can be considered a vice or an addiction.

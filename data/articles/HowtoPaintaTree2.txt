 This practice is especially common among orchards where trees are pruned. Although there is no substantial evidence to support this claim, painting the wounded or pruned sections of a tree has traditionally been thought to protect the exposed area from invading insects, and to allow the tree to heal more quickly.This practice is also commonly referred to as “wound dressing.”

, Despite the general ineffectiveness of wound dressing to help trees recover from damage, the procedure has been shown to have some use in preventing fungal infection.Tree painting may also be useful in preventing oak wilt. This disease is caused by a fungal pathogen, and effects trees primarily in the Eastern United States. Tree paint should be applied to trees pruned or wounded in this region—especially if the pruning is done during the spring or summer.Oak-wilt spores are carried by insects, and tree paint is a sufficient deterrent to keep the insects from boring into the exposed tree wood and spreading oak wilt.
 You want the paint to adhere to the cut or wounded portion of the wood, not to any remnants of bark that may still be on the wood.


It’s best to wear thick work gloves while you’re brushing the bark and dirt off of a tree. Otherwise you may wind up with a hand full of splinters.
 Your local hardware store will stock a variety of tree paint brands. Work with the sales staff to choose one that best suits your needs.


Avoid tree paints that contain asphalt, as these can raise the internal temperature of a tree to a harmful level. , When applying, fully cover the wounded or pruned area with a thick layer of paint. In addition to covering the exposed wood, you should also paint up to 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) beyond the edge of the cut.


This extra coverage will seal the wound’s edges and prevent any boring insects from sneaking in around the perimeter of the painted area.

 If your experience with English has largely been in textbooks, it can be helpful to practice your conversation skills with a native English speaker. Conversing regularly with a skilled English speaker will enable you to speak more fluidly and develop a natural speaking cadence. You can seek out a native speaker to partner with for conversation through Meetup.com or a local university.


If you donâ€™t have time to seek out a partner in person, many online services such as Italki.com can connect you with a native speaker over Skype for one-on-one conversation sessions.;
, A classroom setting allows you to brush up your language skills in areas of confidence and improve your skills where you lag. You may feel at ease practicing in front of others who fall a little short of fluency as well. ESLdirectory.com provides a great database to browse ESL classes in your area., Immersing yourself completely in not just an English-speaking population but also an English-speaking culture can take your fluency to the next level. Seek out university programs in the United States, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia or New Zealand for further study. Many accept international students year-round.

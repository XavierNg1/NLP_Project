 Expect mechanical pencils to be reloaded in one of two ways: with or without a cassette. Cassettes already contain lead and can be loaded straight into the pencil as one piece, while cassette-less pencils require you to feed each piece of lead into the pencil. Check the instructions to find out which method is needed.Manufacturers often color-code their products so you can tell which type it is at a glance. Cross, for example, uses a black band around the base of the eraser to indicate that a cassette is required, and a yellow band to indicate that lead pieces need to be fed in individually.
 If not, refer to its packaging or directions. Only use the diameter specified. Avoid jamming your pencil with lead that is too thick, or being stuck with a wobbly piece of lead that is too thin.
 Refer to its instructions. Find out the maximum number of lead pieces that will fit inside. Some models may only fit two at a time, while others may hold up to nine., If you no longer have the pencil’s instructions, search the internet for the manufacturer’s website. Once there, look up the exact model of your pencil to find out its specifications regarding cassettes, lead size, and capacity. Expect most companies to have instructions for reloading available.

 Expressions differ from other related concepts such as equations, formulas, and identities. Each of these is represented by two expressions separated by an equal sign.;
,, Ensure that each symbol is used for only one thing. That is, don't use i to refer to the imaginary unit, the index of a summation symbol, and a variable electric current in the same expression.
 If the expression expects p to be prime and t to be a real number between 0 and 1, then be sure to say so. The expression at the right can't be simplified in general, but if the problem it came from required that s is odd and u is either +1 or -1, then it simplifies to 1.
 Otherwise you may be able to build a more complicated expression from a simpler one if the convenient variables are unavailable and must be calculated. The expression on the right is equivalent to rate times time, but rate had to be computed from the average of two other rates and time computed from the difference between two times.
, The expression shown to the right is well formed, but cannot represent anything meaningful about a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c. This is because each variable has dimension length. Length can't be added to length squared, and logarithms only operate on dimensionless quantities.
 TeX is the industry standard for publishing technical writing and an implementation of it was used to produce the images appearing in this article.

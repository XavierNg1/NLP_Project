 Adobe no longer supports Flash on Android, and all official apps have been pulled from the Play Store. You'll need to manually install an older version of Flash. This could lead to security vulnerabilities on your device, as Flash does not receive any updates from Adobe.


Open the Settings app and select "Security"
Check the "Unknown sources" box.
 Use your Android's browser to download the latest version for Android from here. This may not work on newer versions of the Android operating system.
 Once the download is complete, tap it in your notification bar to begin installing it.
 It is not possible to download Flash files on your Android device, unless the Flash file has an actual Download option. In order to download embedded Flash videos and games, use one of the methods above to download the file to your computer, and then transfer the file to your Android device.


You can transfer files by plugging your Android device into your computer via USB. You can then drag and drop downloaded files into any folder on your Android device, just as if it was a USB drive.
Alternatively, you can use a Flash-enabled browser like Puffin or Photon to visit websites that have Flash content and view the content from the site. This is necessary if your newer device does not support the Adobe Flash Player app. Chrome for Android does not support Flash, even with the Flash Player installed. If you have Flash Player installed, you can use the default Internet or Browser app to view Flash content.
 Use a file manager app to find the Flash files that you transferred from your computer. When you tap the Flash file, you'll be asked what you want to use to open it. Select one of your Flash-enabled browsers, or your stock browser if Flash Player is installed.You may have to open the browser's Settings menu and enable Flash before Flash content can be played.

 Chill the cream and milk in the refrigerator. Once they're cold, mix the 1 cup cream with 1/3 cup of milk.
 Pour the cream and milk into your chilled bowl and begin whipping until the mixture becomes frothy and soft peaks begin to form.
 Add the caster (superfine) sugar and the vanilla extract to the mixture. You can make a vanilla sugar that incorporates both of these ingredients and add that to the whipped cream instead.
 Whip the cream to distribute the vanilla and sugar. Continue whipping until the cream sticks to the coils of the whisk. When stiff peaks begin to form, stop and serve the cream immediately. Otherwise, you may refrigerate it for a short time until it's needed.

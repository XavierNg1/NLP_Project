 Common causes of respiratory illnesses in hamsters are bacteria (Pasteurella, Streptococcus) and viruses (flu virus).If your vet determined that a bacteria caused your hamster’s respiratory illness, they will prescribe antibiotics.The type of antibiotic will depend on the specific type of bacteria your vet identified during testing.


Antibiotics will not work against viruses. However, a viral infection can weaken the immune system, causing what is called a secondary bacterial infection. If your hamster has a secondary bacterial infection, your vet will prescribe antibiotics.Antibiotics may not work if they are given when the respiratory illness is already advanced.;
, Follow your vet’s prescription instructions carefully. For example, make sure you give the entire course of antibiotics to your hamster.Even if your hamster starts looking better, give all of the antibiotics so all of the bacteria are killed. If you stop treatment early, bacteria could remain that would become resistant to antibiotics.


The antibiotic will be a liquid that you will draw up into an eyedropper.Place the eyedropper into the side of your hamster’s mouth. Slowly and gently empty the prescribed amount of antibiotic into your hamster’s mouth.
Eyedroppers are available at your local pharmacy.
 Hamsters are very sensitive to certain antibiotics. These antibiotics can cause digestive problems for hamsters, such as diarrhea.If your hamster develops diarrhea during antibiotic treatment, call your vet right away. Your vet may prescribe another antibiotic for your hamster.

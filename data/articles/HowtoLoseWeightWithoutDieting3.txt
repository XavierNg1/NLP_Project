 Baseline activity refers to your normal, day-to-day activities: walking to the car, going to the store or doing household chores.Increasing your baseline activity may help support your weight loss.


Baseline activity does not burn as many calories as planned exercise (like going for a 30 minute jog). However, it does burn a small amount of calories and has been shown to improve mood and increase energy.Include more baseline activities such as: parking farther away, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or standing during commercial breaks.
Avoid sedentary behavior as much as possible. Try to not sit or lay down to watch TV or use the computer for long periods of time.
 Cardio exercises or aerobic activity burns the most calories per minute. Adding in regular cardio to your week can help support your weight loss - especially when you're not dieting.It's recommended to perform at least 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week. To see additional results, increase your activity as needed or try adding in vigorous-intensity activity (which burns more calories per minute)Cardio activities include: running/walking, biking, hiking, using the elliptical or going to a aerobic dance class.
Consult a personal trainer who is accredited to create a custom exercise plan that takes into account all of your goals and limitations/injuries.
 Although cardio burns a significant amount of calories, strength training can also help burn calories and support weight loss. Include 1–3 days of strength training each week.Strength training is crucial to weight control. This type of exercise helps build and support muscle mass which may increase your metabolic rate or how many calories you burn throughout the day. Muscle is active tissue that consumes calories throughout the day — whether you worked out or not. Include exercises such as: weight lifting, isometric exercises like yoga or pilates, or use resistance bands/tubes.

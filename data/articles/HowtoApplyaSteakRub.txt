 Thicker cuts of steak will stand up to the assertive flavors of a dry rub better than a thinner steak. If you are grilling a thinner cut, you should either choose a milder rub or apply a lesser amount of a stronger-flavored rub.;
, There are thousands of rub recipes. Choose one that features the flavors that you enjoy or that will complement other foods you will be serving. Rub recipes are very forgiving. Ingredients are easily substituted or left out if they are not available.
 Ideally, a rub should be ground by hand in a mortar and pestle. This brings out the essential oils of the herbs and spices without over processing them. A spice or coffee grinder also can be used. Pre-ground will work fine if grinding your own spices isn't an option.
 Liberally sprinkle the rub over one side of the steak and, with your fingers, massage the rub into the entire surface of the steak. Repeat this process on the other side of the steak.
 Wrap the steak tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least a few hours or up to 24 hours. Steaks that are cut more than about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) can rest for longer, if desired. This resting time allows for the flavors to penetrate into the flesh.
 As with all grilling, you should preheat your grill. Use a grill brush to clean the grates of any burned on food from previous grilling. Using tongs, dip a paper towel in some vegetable oil and wipe the grates to prevent the steaks from sticking. Remove the plastic from the rubbed steak and grill until they reach the desired doneness.

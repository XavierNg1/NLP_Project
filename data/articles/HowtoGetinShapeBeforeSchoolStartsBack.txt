 Instead of drinking those sugar filled soft drinks, go for water or, if you cannot step up to that just yet, drink a diet and caffeine-free soda. In addition, stay up-to-date with the latest fruits and vegetables that are in season... chocolate might taste good, but vegetables and fruits are more nutritious for you. Again, if you cannot stretch that far yet, try a fruit dipped in fat-free chocolate, or make a smoothie with your favorite fruits. Work up to going straight to fruits and vegetables. Take one small step at a time.;
, Instead of sleeping in one summer day, wake up early, go for a walk, and the outdoors. If possible, bring a friend, pet, or your iPod. Stomach crunches are a good form of exercise too; start doing 25 every day for the first week, then gradually increase to 50 the next, 75 each day the next, and so on.
 If you have not worked out at all during the summer, then you are not in good shape. Start doing simple things like lunges or lifting hand weights. You can do three sets of 10-12 reps each. Then as you get used to it, increase.
 This will help flush out those toxins and even lose some weight.

 Read the instructions and warnings on the back of the bottle. Pour an equal amount of the chemical and warm water in a bowl.You can purchase calcium lime and rust remover from most department stores or online.
Work in a well-ventilated area.
Wear rubber gloves to protect your skin.;
, Saturate a corner of a cotton cloth with the chemical and water solution that you just created. A cotton cloth will prevent scratches that would be created with a rough brush.The rag does not need to be fully saturated with the solution to work. Just dip it in the solution enough to get a small part of the rag wet.
 Apply the solution onto the surface of the pipe and rub it in a back and forth motion. Keep dipping your cotton rag in the chemical solution as it dries. This should remove any calcium, lime, and rust deposits that may have formed on the copper pipe.You may have to go over your pipe multiple times if it's very dirty.
 Run cold water over the pipes to remove any chemical that's still on the pipe. Once it's rinsed down, you should wipe down the surface of the pipe with a separate, clean rag. Your pipe should now look shiny and brand new.

 Clematis that bloom in very late spring and early summer should be pruned before they blossom. This type of clematis include most large-flower types. These sort of clematis produce so many buds that they need to be cut back so that most of the flowers have a chance to bloom. Types that fall under this category include Henryi and Nelly Moser., To prune this sort of clematis, you will have to locate the healthy buds. They should be about a third of the way down from the top of the plant. Once you have located the buds, use pruning or garden shears to cut the vine just above the buds, removing the top part of the plant and keeping the buds intact., The reason for doing this would be to delay heavy blooming until the later summer (in case you are going to be gone for the early summer and want to see your clematis bloom). See Method Three for how to prune in this way.

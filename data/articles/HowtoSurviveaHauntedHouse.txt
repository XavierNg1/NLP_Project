 If you're somebody who gets easily scared in horror movies/themes, then you may just end up getting badly scared and not enjoying yourself at all. So check that you definitely want to do this. It's okay not to--it doesn't mean that you're a "chicken". You just didn't want to do it.;
, Go with somebody you're comfortable around and are especially close to. That way, when/if you get scared, you can hold onto each other. Plus, things don't seem as scary when you've got a friendly face by your side.
 Things can be scarier when it's just two or three people--you feel more helpless. Try going with a group of at least four--things will be more fun and it won't be as scary.
 If you start to get really scared and are regretting going in, then calm down and remind yourself that this isn't real. Tell yourself that it's just pretend, and that it's provided for your enjoyment. Another good method is thinking about what will happen when you get out of the haunted house--driving home, going to the park, lunch, etc.
 Don't run around totally freaked out and screaming. Calm down, and enjoy everything--the suspense, the effects, etc. Remember that the only reason the haunted house exists is so that people can have a fun time. So let yourself get spooked--enjoy it!

, Plan something that's as not scary as possible, whether it be shopping, hanging out with friends/family, or going to a restaurant. Try to make it so that you're surrounded by people and don't have too much time to start thinking about the haunted house again.

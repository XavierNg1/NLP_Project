 For this experiment you’ll need regular latex balloons, a candle, and some water. They are some pretty simple materials. Don’t get blown up balloons. Wait until you are doing the experience to put air inside them.
 Light your candle with a match or lighter and then blow up one of your balloons. Blow it up to a decent size, not too small or large. The size doesn’t particularly matter for this experiment. Hold the balloon an inch or two above the candle. Be sure to keep your fingers out of the way. Within ten seconds the balloon will pop.
 Take your second balloon and fill it halfway full with room temperature water. Hold the balloon over the candle flame again. This time you’ll notice that the balloon does not pop. You can even let the candle flame touch the balloon and it won’t pop.


The candle is warming the water rather than popping the balloon. That’s why water isn’t going flying everywhere. The balloon conducts heat and is able to transfer it to the water without damaging the balloon.If you hold the candle to the balloon long enough it will pop, but it will take much longer than a balloon filled without air.

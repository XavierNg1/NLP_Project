 Depending on whether or not Windows will boot, you have two different ways to get to the System Restore tool.


If Windows will not load, follow steps 2-4 in the previous section to enter the System Recovery Options. From there, select System Restore.






If you can log in to Windows, click the Start button. Select All Programs, then Accessories. Select System Tools and then click the System Restore icon.
 You can choose from restore points you created, automatically scheduled restore points, and restore points that were made during the installation of certain programs and Windows updates. You can only restore your computer to dates that are listed here.
 Click Yes for the final confirmation. Your system will begin the restore process. Your computer will automatically restart during this process. The restore may take several minutes. When you log in to Windows after finishing the restore, you will see a message telling you that the process was completed successfully.


System restore will not recover deleted files.

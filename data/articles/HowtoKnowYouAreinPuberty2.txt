 This is often the first sign of puberty for women: your breasts will start to grow, at first by developing a small “bump” under each nipple.Many women find that their breasts develop unevenly; one may grow more rapidly than the other. Don’t be alarmed; this is a normal part of puberty, and they’ll even out with time.


This process often causes some soreness around your developing breasts — don’t be concerned, this is normal.
 Once you’ve hit puberty, hair will start to grow under your armpits. Your armpits will produce more sweat as well, even if you’re not exercising.


Most adolescents begin wearing deodorant during puberty, to prevent any unpleasant body-odor smells that may develop. It's also important to bathe or shower daily.
Many women (and some men) begin to shave their armpit hair. This is a fine thing to do, especially if you consider this hair to be unattractive or uncomfortable.
 One of the major signs of puberty in girls is menstruation, which usually begins one to three years after you first begin puberty.If you often find little brown-reddish spots or a white or dark fluid in your underwear, be prepared for your first menstruation to begin soon.


Menstruation is a monthly process that all women experience. Each month, an egg from one of your ovaries will descend to your uterus, only to be shed along with the inner lining of your womb. The eggs and uterine lining exit through your vagina, and this process causes monthly bleeding.
It helps to have a box of sanitary pads ready in advance. If you’re uncertain about how to use them, you can ask your mom to show you. You may want to have one or two in your backpack or locker at school in case your period begins at school.
Your periods may be inconsistent or widely spaced out at first. As you age, they will happen monthly, but at first, you may only have a period once every six months.

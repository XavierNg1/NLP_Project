 Make a list of the clinics that are featured and that appeal to you. Remember the sponsored clinics have paid to be on the first position, they have not necessarily been selected by Google as suiting your criteria.;
, If they have been around a long time then they probably have a good track record.
 Ideally the clinic will have an on-site laboratory.
 Are there different experts in each field of dentistry or is the same person an expert in all aspect of dentistry? The latter is obviously not a good sign.
 Talk to people who have had treatment some years ago, not last week. You want your dental treatment to stand the test of time.
, Check if they can provide OPG x-ray and CT scans on site. Check that the equipment is up to date. Modern equipment is a good sign that the clinic is constantly keeping up with the latest advances in dental procedures. Remember, price alone should never be the deciding factor in choosing a dentist. Poor quality workmanship will be more expensive in the long run.
,, Remember there are the additional costs of flights and accommodation involved in travelling abroad for dental treatment which you would not incur if you had the treatment carried out locally.

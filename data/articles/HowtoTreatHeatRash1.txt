 Heat rash usually occurs underneath the clothes, where moisture and heat trap clothes close to the skin. It feels itchy and looks like a patch of bumps or pimples. Other symptoms include:


Pain, swelling, or warmth of the skin.
Red streaks.
Pus or fluid draining from itchy areas.
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit, or groin.
Sudden fever (over 100.4°F or 38°C).;
, Get out of the sun and somewhere cool and dry if possible, around 70°F. If you cannot get inside then move into the shade.


Most heat rash will go away soon after cooling off., Expose the affected area and let it air dry. Since blocked sweat glands cause most heat rash, you want the skin to be able to breath freely to prevent further blockage.


Do not use a towel to dry your skin-- air should be fine., Heat rash is a symptom of your body overheating. Avoid hot beverages and drink plenty of cold water to lower your body temperature., The water does not need to be cold, just cool enough to be relaxing. Use a gentle cleaner or antibacterial soap to lightly clean the affected area and pat or air dry afterwards.
 Blisters are filled with fluid meant to heal your skin, and they can scar if popped prematurely. While some blisters will pop, try to let your skin heal naturally and avoid picking at it., Treat heat rash with an application of 1% hydrocortisone cream or calamine/aloe lotion to relieve itching. For more extreme cases, antihistamines like Benadryl or Claritin can ease itching and swelling., While most heat rash will disappear soon after cooling off, severe heat rash can lead to infections that need treatment. Call a doctor if pain increases or spreads, if yellow or white pus begins to leak from your rash, or the rash does not disappear on it's own. Immediately call emergency services if you feel:


Nausea and Dizziness
Headaches
Vomiting
Fainting

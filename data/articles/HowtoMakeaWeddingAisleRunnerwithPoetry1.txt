 Depending on the length of your aisle you may want to choose several poets and works to include on the runner.


Select poets both you and your fiancé love. Make sure the works are enjoyed by you as a couple.
Keep context/language in mind. Remember--if there’s something in a poem that would make grandma blush or inspire your sister to cover her children’s eyes; reconsider using it.
Choose enough poems to cover the entire aisle runner. You could rank the poems from your favorite to your least favorite so when you start writing, you can begin with the ones you love initially and keep going until you are finished.;
, Craft stores have plenty of aisle runner choices, however you need a runner that will accept writing on it.


Make sure the runner conforms to the ceremony location aisle. You not only one a runner that's long enough but wide enough to balance the aisle.
Examine the runner for ways to anchor it to the ground and the end of the aisle. You don’t want to be tripping down the aisle on the runner so make sure there is a way you can have it secured.
 Even if you cover the entire runner in black ink you want to make sure the pen you choose doesn’t bleed or run, presents in bold color and is easy to use.


Consider using a pen color that compliments your wedding colors. The color could tie together décor and brides maid’s dresses in an understated way.
Add some “sparkle” to your notes by choosing a glittery paint pen (in silver, black or gold).
Make sure you can read the poems. While writing the entire poem(s) in silver pen may sound lovely, you may not be able to easily read the words (unless this is the look you hope to achieve).
 In order to keep lines straight when writing you may want to draw light guidelines on the runner that can be later erased.

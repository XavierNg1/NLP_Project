 Make the string so it hangs an inch or so above the bottom of the container or jar that you will use to make crystals.


You can also try to suspend a lollipop or popsicle stick. It makes a good handle if you plan to eat your project when it's done.
 Stir three cups (660g) of sugar into one cup (240mL) of boiling water.Add some food coloring to give your crystals some color.
 Be sure the container is completely clean so your sugar crystals do not latch on to any leftover food fragments or dirt in the container instead of your string.
 Place the knife over the top of the container so the string hangs down. The string should hang into the mixture, but do not let the string touch the bottom of the jar because the crystals with grow there instead of the string.
 Find a safe place to store the container for a couple weeks. You should look for someplace that is clean and where the container won't get knocked around. You can place it in a box on the top of your refrigerator, or an unused shelf of a kitchen cabinet.

 Expect many hotels to be long accustomed to meeting international travelers’ needs. Before you start shopping for adapters and converters, call ahead and ask what accommodations are already available where you’ll be staying. For example, they may offer upon request:


Electric devices like hair dryers and irons.Adapters and/or converters.
Designated outlets providing the required voltage for your single-voltage devices., Expect converters to be bigger and more expensive than adapters. If possible, leave any devices that are single voltage at home. Save yourself some money while freeing up more luggage space at the same time. Consider how long you’ll be abroad, and if you really need a particular device for all that time. For example:If you intend on bringing your single-voltage laptop as well as your dual-voltage smartphone or tablet, consider leaving the laptop behind. Ask yourself what you intend to do with it while abroad, and if you could do the same with your phone or tablet.
 Whether you’re going to one destination or many, reduce the number of adaptors that you’ll need by being picky with what you bring. Ask yourself what you really need and what you can do without or easily substitute with another item. For instance:Favor battery-operated devices (like cameras or electric toothbrushes) over plug-in varieties.
Opt for manual devices to use instead of your electric ones, like disposable razors instead of your electric razor.
Purchasing new devices upon arrival for longer stays abroad, like an electric beard trimmer.

 Make the waffle batter by following your favorite waffle recipe. Any type of waffle recipe will work when cooking the waffles on the grill pan, as long as the batter is well-combined and made correctly.


Plain waffles aren't the only waffles that can be made on a grill pan. You can prepare a waffle batter that isn't plain, too. Consider making a blueberry waffle batter, chocolate chip, cinnamon roll, or bacon.
;
, According to your grill pan's cooking instructions, preheat it on medium heat. Spread canola oil or butter over it.


The waffles will be ready to cook when the oil or butter melts on the grill pan. , Allow the batter to spread into a circle. The circles won't look perfect because of the grill pan's ridges, but the waffles will still come out fine. , Bring down the heat to a medium-low temperature. This helps avoid the waffle from burning and blackening. Let the waffle cook for about 5-6 minutes, until bubbles start to appear on the top.
 If you can, try to flip it facing the lines of the grill pan. This isn't a must, but it does help give it its waffle-like texture.
 Gently press on the waffle with the spatula so it can adhere the grill pan's edges. Once done, place the waffle on a wire rack.
 You may need to brush the grill pan with more oil or butter every now and then to prevent the waffles from sticking.
 Place a waffle on a serving plate. Drizzle maple syrup all over it and add other desired toppings. Enjoy!

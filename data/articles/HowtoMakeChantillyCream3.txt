 Combine a cup of heavy cream with two ounces of chocolate. Choose dark or milk chocolate based on your preference. Chop up the chocolate or simply buy chocolate chips and use those.


In a pinch you could use cocoa powder, but the cocoa butter in the chocolate acts as a stabilizer and helps the whipped cream hold its shape.
 Put the mixture in the microwave for about 30 seconds on high and then stir. Continue to heat the mixture--15 seconds at a time--and stir until the chocolate melts completely. The mixture will start out looking grainy but will smooth out eventually.


If you use dark chocolate, you'll need to blend the mixture particularly well to avoid flecks. Use an emulsion blender to get the smoothest consistency.
 Pour the mixture into the larger bowl that you'll use to whip the cream and place in the refrigerator for about four hours.
 Whip until soft peaks form and add sugar if you like. A good guideline to follow is 2 tablespoons of sugar for every cup of cream. You can stop right here or continue to whip until the cream forms stiff peaks. Serve immediately.

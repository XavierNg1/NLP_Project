 Pour the rice into a colander with fine mesh holes. Gently shift the colander so that the rice is evenly spread throughout.


The holes of the colander must be very small. For this reason, a mesh colander is better than a plastic one, since mesh colanders are often available with very fine holes.
It is not recommended that you use cheesecloth since the grains of rice will likely stick to the cloth.
Note that this part of the process only applies to versions of the recipe that use uncooked rice. If you are using rice that has already been cooked, the cooked rice does not need to be washed.
 Rinse the rice under running tap water. Continue rinsing until the water dripping out from the bottom of the colander runs clear.


You must wait until the water runs clear. Only then can you be certain that the rice is thoroughly cleaned.
Shift the rice gently in its colander or use your hands to gently stir it as it rinses. Doing so will help clean the rice quicker and more thoroughly.
 Set the colander of rice aside and let the excess water drip out naturally. Wait until the rice air dries before you use it for the dish.


Do not attempt to dry the rice with paper towels or cloth towels.
The rice must be thoroughly dry before you add it to the pan in any of these recipes.

 Take some time now and then to just sit still in the paddock (on the fence or in a chair, not on the ground) and let your horse approach you on her own terms. As you sit, pay attention to your horse’s behavior to see what she’s like when she is not working for you. By taking time to just be a presence in your horse’s environment, you will gain her trust and learn more about her personality., Instead of walking straight up to your horse, throwing the saddle on, and going for a ride, slow down a bit. Let your horse sniff your hand and talk to her. Taking time to slow down and be a calming presence will help improve the trust between you and your horse., Take time to pet your horse to let her know that you appreciate her. Massage her ears, scratch her neck, and pat her head. Learn where your horse likes to be pet and make it a daily part of your interactions.Some horses are ear-shy and don't enjoy their ears being touched.
 Giving treats to your horse when you want to reward her is a great way to bond with your horse as well. Just make sure that you do not overdo it with treats or your horse may learn to expect them or may even try to root around in your clothes for treats.Fresh apples and carrots make great treats for your horse.
 Neck drops are a horse’s way of demonstrating trust or submission. If your horse is willing to drop her neck in your presence then you have a good bond.To get your horse to drop her neck, tug gently on the lead rope below your horse’s head.
If your horse does not yield, then keep building your bond and try to request a neck drop some other time.

 Before applying toothpaste, give the disc a rinse to get rid of any excess dirt and grime. You can use warm water to rinse the disc off in the sink.


If the label is peeling off of the disc or if there are physical cracks, you won't be able to fix them.;
, Use a microfiber or other soft cloth to dry the disc off after rinsing it. When drying use straight strokes from the center of the disc out to the edge. Avoid circular strokes. This will help prevent more scratches.
 You'll need the proper toothpaste in order to effectively fix your disc scratches. Toothpaste works by sanding out the rough edges of the scratches, allowing the laser to read the disc properly. To get this effect, you'll want a plain white toothpaste, preferably one with baking soda.


Avoid gel-based toothpastes, or toothpastes with whitening agents.
 Apply a small amount of paste directly to a particularly bad scratch on the disc.
 Use a small cotton swab and buff along the length of the scratch in a tiny circular motion, much like you would wax a car. Run along the entire length of the scratch.









You don't need to apply much force, just continue gently buffing in a circular motion.
 You may notice some new finer scratches created by the toothpaste, but the big scratch should be nearly or completely gone.
 Repeat the buffing process on any additional scratches, using a small amount of paste for each one.
 After you're done buffing out all of the scratches, you can rinse the disc off with water and dry it again using your soft cloth.

 A telescope is a pricey but integral part of observing Mars, so you should put a good deal of thought into choosing one. As a general rule, you should be focused on finding a telescope with good optics and a sturdy mount that moves smoothly. With this in mind, read reviews online and look for beginner telescopes that have these features and have good ratings., While any telescope can facilitate your observation of Mars, there are three kinds of telescope on the market to choose from. These three types use different optics to enhance distant objects and make them look larger to the eye. The options are:Refractors, where you have a lens at the front of the tube; these are popular and low-maintenance, but can be expensive depending on the model.
Reflectors, which gather light with a mirror at the back of the tube; these are less expensive but require more adjustment when used.
Compound telescopes, which use a combination of lenses and mirrors.
 As a general rule, the bigger the telescope, the better. Look for telescopes with a higher aperture, which refers to the diameter of its light-gathering lens or mirror. Opt for a telescope with an aperture of 4 inches (10.2Â cm) or more, which can pick up greater detail on a planet or other celestial body., If you opt to buy them, color filters can add a lot to your experience of viewing Mars. These filters screw onto the tip of your telescope, and work by controlling the type and quantity of light that your eyes receive by either reflecting or transmitting it.Some specific filters that might enhance your Mars observation are:Orange (#21): increases contrast and penetrates clouds and haze
Red (#25, #29): enhances surface details
Yellow (#12, #15): brightens desert regions, darkens blue and brown features
Green (#57): darkens red and blue features
Blue (#80A, #38, #38A): shows clouds and darken reddish features

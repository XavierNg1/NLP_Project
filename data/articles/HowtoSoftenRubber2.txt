 An oven or hair dryer are the most likely choices, although some people espouse placing rubber soled shoes on a radiator, for instance.Ensure your oven’s heat element can run at a low setting and your blow dryer’s heat element can use a high setting, to get approximately equal temperatures.


A clothes dryer placed on its highest heat setting could be another option, especially for sneakers.
The temperature range you seek is roughly 200-220 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures above this range will likely do more damage than good.Remember to clean rubber objects, ideally with just water, before heating them.
 In case your oven overheats and melts the rubber, place the item(s) on an oven safe pan or other container (but one you won’t use for food).


If you are heating shoes, make sure the soles are facing up, to reduce the chance of them melting onto the oven rack or pan.
Keep the item(s) in the oven for five to 10 minutes. If you happen to have an infrared surface thermometer, you can take the guesswork out of reaching the desired temperature range.
Again, be careful about overheating, because high heat will break down rubber, and because cleaning up melted rubber is no one’s idea of fun., For rubber-soled shoes, at least, heating on “high” for seven to ten minutes has been claimed to be successful.Don’t hold the dryer in any one spot, and check the rubber item regularly for signs of melting or other deterioration.
Check carefully, however, as the rubber can become very hot. Again, an infrared surface thermometer could prove useful.
 Then, try to manipulate it. With luck, the item will remain softer and more flexible even after cooling.


Keep in mind, however, that there are many rubber formulations, and some may respond better than others. Also, there is no miracle cure, and some hardened rubber items will simply be too far gone for softening. You are actually damaging the rubber by heating it to soften it, and some items cannot take the beating any longer.

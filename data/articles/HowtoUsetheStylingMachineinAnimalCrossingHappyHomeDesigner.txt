, This is the Styling Machine. The crane will stick a big dome on your character's head, and now you are ready to begin changing your appearance.



The first menu allows you to alter the character's face.

To change your eye color, tap any of the colored squares beside the two eyes, on top of the head icon. To change skin color, tap any of the colored squares beside the head icon. To change your eye shape, tap the eye shape that you want, on top of the head and eyes icons.


If you tap the icon on the bottom left with the icon of the scissors and the word "Hairstyle", this will lead you to a menu that allows you to alter hairstyle and hair color.

To change your hairstyle, tap any of the hairstyles on the top of the menu. To see more hairstyles, swipe left or right with your stylus. To change your hair color, choose any of the colored squares beside the icon picturing a head with hair.


If you want to see how your character looks to the side or back, use the D-pad to change the angle.
 The Styling Machine will lift off of your character's head, and you are done.

Make raised beds: areas of soil about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) on top of the ground. Raised beds are better for your garden because they do not require you to till the ground, which exhausts the nutrients in the soil.
Your beds should be wide enough so that you can fit two rows of plants in them but narrow enough so that you can lean in from the side and reach the middle.
,, Consider pests when placing plants.


Plants can act as pesticides for other plants; for example, nearby marigolds can deter worms from tomatoes. Consult your local nursery or garden society for information about such relationships between plants in your area.



Mulch helps prevent weed growth and enriches the soil, negating the need for chemical weed killers or fertilizers. You can also avoid tilling the soil, which can drain nutrients. Popular and effective mulches include wood chips, cardboard, and newspaper.



Compost is natural fertilizer which reuses waste products for the benefit of a garden. A pile of uncooked kitchen waste, garden waste (like weeds, dead plants, or leaves), and other organic matter mixed with paper scraps or sawdust is a simple and effective composting system.



Drip irrigation, which uses a rubber tube punctured with small holes and draped along a bed, is a good way of getting water directly into the soil and avoiding needless evaporation. Water only when necessary and remember to vary the amount of water based on different plants' needs.
Collect water run-off from gutters or other surfaces using large barrels; recycle this water into your irrigation system.

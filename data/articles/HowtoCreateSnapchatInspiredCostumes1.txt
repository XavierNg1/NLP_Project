Use stiff card stock when printing to prevent the costume from being too flimsy. However, if you don't have a printer or if you want to add personal flair to the template, to draw your own you should:


Look up a picture of the kind of dog you want to imitate. Some dogs have short, perky, triangular ears, others have long, floppy ears. You can even trace parts of this picture to make your hand drawn template.
Use your pencil to draw out four separate dog features: two dog ears, a dog nose, and a large tongue.
Add color to the features with crayons, markers, and so on to make the dog features look more realistic., Take your scissors and cut free the four dog features of your template or drawn design. After that, use your tape to attach the front end of the tongue to the end of your wooden dowel or tongue depressor.


To securely fasten your dowel or tongue depressor to the tongue printout/design, you may need to use several pieces of tape.
By holding the wooden dowel or tongue depressor so the back end of the tongue meets your lips, you'll give the impression that the tongue is coming out of your mouth.
 Use tape to attach one ear to both sides of the top of your forehead. Then use tape to stick the dog nose on the end of your own. All you need to do now is hold the tongue up to your mouth with your dowel or tongue depressor, and your costume is complete.

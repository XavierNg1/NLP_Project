 Rubbing lemon juice on your hands is a natural, effective way to remove odors. Lemon juice can be used full-strength, or it can be diluted with a small amount of water to reduce its harsh effect on your skin. Lime juice works as well. Just squeeze the lemon/lime in a bowl of water and soak your hands in it. Note that using this method will leave your hands smelling like lemon or lime.


Freshly squeezed mandarin and orange juice will also work.

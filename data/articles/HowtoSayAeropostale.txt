 This is the correct pronunciation of the name. If it's easier, try saying "arrow-poe-stall" or "arrow-post-all".Say each syllable separately, then string them together. Don't say the word too quickly – take your time, especially while you're still getting it right.

, It refers to the transfer of mail by air – something like "air postal" or "airmail".As such, it is most "correct" to say it according to the French pronunciation. Aeropostale is, however, an American clothing company, and you can vary your pronunciation somewhat to fit your natural cadence of speech. "Air-oh-post-ull", "air-oh-pas-tell", and even "arrow-paw-still" can be acceptable pronunciations as long as people know what you're talking about., If you are trying to talk about the American clothing company, and not refer specifically to French airmail, then you should pronounce the word the way that the Aeropostale company says it's pronounced. Try calling the Aeropostale's 800-number and listening to the automated recording. Ask a store employee, or write a letter to the company., Many English words place their emphasis on the first syllable or two, but many French words emphasize the final syllable. Instead of "AEROpostale", say "aeropoSTALE".

 Want to try a fun project at home? Mix up your own play dough, with some help from your parents. Mixing up some flour and water and food coloring, you can have your own varieties of customizable colors to play with. Get your parents to help you if you need to use the stove. All you need to mix together to make play dough is:


2 cups of white flour
2 cups of water
1 tsp. cream of tartar
2 tablespoons of canola oil
1 cup of salt

, You can always read, or you can that an old book you're tired of to make an art project. If you've got a ratty old magazine or school textbook that you're done with, go through it and cross everything out but a couple of words to make new sentences, or color on the pictures and give everyone a mustache. Make a new story.


Always make sure you get permission to cut up or color on any old books, to make sure you won't get in trouble after the fact.
Take a bunch of different magazines and cut out a variety of pictures, making collages for fun. Stick the pope next to a chicken McNugget and a bunch of flamingoes. Weird is fun.
 If you're allowed to be in the kitchen, try experimenting with some new recipes. If you're bored, a batch of cookies is a great result. Check out these wikiHow resources for great cooking projects:


Pie from scratch
Chocolate chip cookies
Vegan pudding
Sauerkraut
Toast
Scrambled Eggs

, There's no better way to spend time than cranking up some tunes and flailing around for fun. You don't have to be a great dancer to have fun dancing in your room by yourself. It's good exercise, quick, and easy.


You don't even have to annoy your parents or you neighbors, if you've got some headphones. Put your earbuds in and listen in private. Have a dance party of one.

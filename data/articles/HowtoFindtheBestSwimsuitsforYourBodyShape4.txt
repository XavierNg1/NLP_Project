 In one sense, your smaller bust makes it possible for you to wear these swimsuits, since you can get away without having strong support for your chest. Bandeau tops emphasize your lack of upper curves, however, making your body look more boyish.
 More feminine prints make your figure appear softer and more womanly.
 Stripes angled downward toward the center front of your suit create an optical illusion, making it appear as though the suit has a nipped waist. This creates the appearance of curves.
 Ruffles create the illusion of volume, which makes you seem curvier. Ruffled trim works especially well if you have an athletic rectangle shape.
 Bikinis break up your straight contours by revealing your stomach, which defines your waist. String bikinis work especially well due to the ties. Look for a bottom with ties that cinch at the side. The extra detailing on your hip will draw the eye, creating a stronger illusion of curves.
 A knot that lands in the center of your chest draws the eye to your cleavage, accentuating the shape and creating a voluminous appearance.

You could feel the diaper for fullness or "being squishy" though sometimes the diaper brand may be so absorbent that you wouldn't be able to feel for the fullness and sometimes you could accidentally squeeze out the very thing you didn't want to come out in the first place (e.g. feces, poop).
You could look at the diaper or pants the child is wearing for signs of leakage or stains but by then it would probably be too late and diaper rash would have set in and you would have to rummage through all your baby first aid things only to find the empty tube of diaper rash cream.
Look down the diaper. This is easier if you have a mobile child.;

 Take out the insoles of your shoes. Stuff each shoe with two full pages of crumpled up newspaper. Allow the newspaper to absorb the moisture for one hour. Take out the wet sheets and insert two new full pages of newspaper into each shoe. Allow the newspaper to sit for two to four hours. Remove and replace the paper one last time. Let the paper sit in your shoes overnight. Take out the paper in the morning and reinsert your insoles into your dry shoes., Fans provide an effective, low temperature drying method for your shoes. Plug in a high speed fan and place a towel or newspaper directly in front of it. If the insoles of your shoes are removable, take them out. Place your wet shoes on the towel or newspaper. Turn on the fan and wait for your shoes to dry., If you intend to air-dry your shoes outside, you must remember that direct sunlight shrinks shoes. Instead of leaving your shoes in direct sunlight, place your shoes under an object, such as a table, chair, or stairwell, to protect them. Insert a small cotton towel inside each shoe to help it retain its shape.

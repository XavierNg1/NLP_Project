 Most receivers have either preamp-in and preamp-out connections or tape monitor connections. In most cases, these are the best way to connect an equalizer to your stereo.


Connecting to the tape monitor channels will require connection to only your receiver. Learn how to hook up an equalizer to the receiver instead.;
, To run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and then to your amplifier, you will need 2 sets of RCA cable (the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and CD players).


The length of the RCA cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer.
 Connect one pair of cables to the pre-amp output channels on the receiver and the other end of the cable to the left and right channel inputs on the equalizer.


You will usually find these channels on the rear of the equalizer.
Right channel jacks will usually take the red colored RCA plug while left channel should take white or black RCA plugs.
 Connect the other pair of cables from the output channels on the back of the equalizer to the left and right input channels on the amplifier.


Right channel jacks will usually take the red colored RCA plug while left channel should take white or black RCA plugs.
 The amplifier should remain connected to the receiver with an RCA cable between the amplifier outputs and the amp inputs on the receiver. This effectively creates a loop from the receiver through the equalizer and amplifier and back to the receiver.
 Turn on all three components and adjust the equalizer knobs according to your preferences. You should now be able to manipulate the controls on the equalizer to change the frequency response or tone of your music.

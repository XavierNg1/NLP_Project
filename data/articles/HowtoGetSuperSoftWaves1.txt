 After you get out of the shower, let your hair air dry about halfway before starting this process.;
, For softer waves, use hair cream or serum. Only apply it two-thirds of the way up your hair; leave the top of your head alone. Use enough to cover the ends, but not so much that your hair is greasy. Using gel or mousse will result in stiffer waves.
 If you want very structured, neat curls, use a comb to part your hair into sections. If you want a messy and more natural look, skip the comb parting and just grab differently-sized tresses. You'll pin between separating each section.
 Twirl your hair around your finger until it starts to twist into coils. Hold a finger down at the root to steady it, and twist hair into a small bun around that point. Secure with non-rubber elastics or curved bobby pins.
 Start with the hair over your forehead, moving to the sides, and then going back. For a more comfortable night's sleep, don't pin up the hair at the back and bottom of your head; if you're planning on wearing your hair loose, the upper parts will cover this lower section anyway.
 Let your hair stay pinned up overnight.
 In the morning, start unwinding the buns at the back of your head and move forward. You'll have twisty, bouncy tendrils of wavy hair. You can keep the waves a bit tight, or continue to the next step.
 Run your fingers through your hair gently, pulling down on the waves. They'll start to unwind and hang a little more loosely. Don't loosen too much, though; remember that your hair will continue to fall a bit as the day goes on.

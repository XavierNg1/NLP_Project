 The radius is the larger of the two forearm bones. When the palm of the hand faces forward, the radius is the outer bone.;
, The distal end of the radius is biconcave and triangular, and it is covered with hyaline cartilage. It has a smooth ridge that divides its articular surface into two facets: a triangular lateral facet, which connects with the scaphoid (a wrist bone), and a quadrilateral medial facet, which connects with the lunate (another wrist bone).


The lateral surface of the distal radius elongates into the prominent radial styloid process, which attaches to the brachioradialis muscle.
The medial surface of the distal radius forms a semicircular notch, also covered with hyaline cartilage, which connects with the head of the ulna. This is what allows the radius to swing around the ulna.
 The wrist joint is formed by the lower ends of the radius and ulna, all eight carpal (wrist) bones, and the upper ends of all five metacarpal (hand) bones.

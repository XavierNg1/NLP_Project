 A couple of weeks before your prom, try on your dress with your shoes, jewelry, make-up, and hairstyle to be sure you like the finished look. Walk and move around in your prom dress a little to give it a comfort check.
 On the night of your prom, put your dress and a "cover-up" (any clean shirt or jacket) on before applying make-up or styling your hair. This will prevent any make-up smudges or product stains on your fabulous prom dress.
 Wearing a nice prom dress is good, but if you are smiling it will make you look like the best person in there. Your confidence will go through the roof when you get all the compliments.

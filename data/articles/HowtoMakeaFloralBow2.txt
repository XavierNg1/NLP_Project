 To make a small floral bow you will need a length of 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) soft ribbon, a piece of cardboard or foam, a scissors and a piece of floral wire or a pipe cleaner.
 Cut a thin, V-shaped slit into a piece of foam or cardboard with a sharp knife or scissors.









The slit should be wide enough to insert the ribbon but small enough to hold the ribbon in place.
If you're using a ribbon that is shiny on one side and dull on the other, make sure that the shiny side faces down so that as you make your bow, the shiny side will form the outside of your loops.
 Fold the ribbon to make a loop on one side of the slit, then slide the ribbon into the slit. As you push the ribbon into the slit, twist it so that the shiny side faces down again.
 Continue to make loops, alternating between one side of the cardboard and the other. If you want your bow to have smaller loops in the middle, just make each loop smaller as you slip it between the cardboard., When your bow is full enough, cut the ribbon at an angle.
 Slide the bow out from between the cardboard, making sure to firmly grab the center of the bow between your thumb and forefinger.
 Take the piece of wire or pipe cleaner and wrap it around the center of the bow. Twist the two ends of the wire tightly to secure.
 After you have secured the bow, take a minute or two to readjust the loops to fluff out the bow and make it look even.

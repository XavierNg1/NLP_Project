Be creative and weird with the faces you make, and see if you can make them laugh. Very soon, the baby will be love having you around., There are few things that a baby loves as much as a puppy. If you have a puppy (or any gentle family pet) that you can bring over to play with the baby, you are sure to brighten the baby’s day.Always be careful and alert when bringing animals around babies.

 Use clean paper towels or sponges. If the urine sits too long, it can seep into materials permanently or discolor your surfaces.If there is discoloration, wood surfaces can be re-stained after clean-up.


Make sure to wear gloves while cleaning up the urine. This will prevent your hands from smelling like urine after cleaning.
 Using new materials is important in this step, so you’re not mixing other cleaning products and chemicals with the ones you’re using for this clean-up.



Surfaces and finishes react differently to products. Test a hidden area of your surface before applying to the affected area if it is in a high-traffic area. This will let you see if the solution reacts poorly to your surface in a place that others will not see it.
 Enzyme cleaners continue cleaning long after application, so make sure to keep pets and family members away from the area for a few hours to allow the cleaner to take full effect., Make sure to dispose of the used towels or rags in a place your pet will not retrieve them. If your pet smells remnants of urine in another area, they may think it is acceptable to urinate in that area.

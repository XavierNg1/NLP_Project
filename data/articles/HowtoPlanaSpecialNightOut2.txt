 It could be eating out, movies, ice skating, ten pin bowling, go-kart racing, etc. Whatever it is, ensure that the activity will be available at the time you intend to go.


Keep in mind the ages of the children. A special night out for younger kids will start and end earlier than one meant for your teens.
Some of the activities suggested for the date night can work for kids, such as setting up an outdoor movie screen and/or having a picnic under the stars. Just be sure to scale everything down and use kid-friendly food and drinks.
 Most kids will want to be fed and do an activity. If you don't feed them, the night out could be more complaint-filled than special! Work out whether it's best to eat first, during or after the activity and factor this into the planning.
 Do you need to drive or can you add to the adventure by taking public transportation? This will all depend on where you live and how easy it is to take kids out. However, if you can catch a train, bus or ferry, many kids will consider this part of the fun of the night.
 Look online to check out the menus before going, and to see whether you need to book. And while you might not like the food as much, remember that it is a special night for your kids, so pick the restaurant with their preferences placed foremost.
 When the kids get tired, it's time to end the activity. Too tired and everyone will end up miserable. Short and sweet will ensure it stays special for everyone.

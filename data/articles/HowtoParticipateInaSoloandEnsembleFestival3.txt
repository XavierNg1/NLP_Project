 The judge will probably give you a minute to tune with your ensemble or with the piano, and it would be in your best interests to do so.
 Focus on the music, not the judge, who should remain still and quiet so as not to disturb you.
 After you finish playing, the judge may need time to finish writing on the scorecard, and then they often will tell you how you did, and may ask you to play certain parts of your piece over, with instructions on how to make it better. Don't take offense to this, and keep in mind that you may still get the highest rating, The judge is just trying to leave you with something to keep in mind for the future that will make you a better musician.
 Then, you can either wait around for your scores, which, depending on how many people are participating, could take from a few minutes to hours and hours to appear, or go home and get them from your director later.

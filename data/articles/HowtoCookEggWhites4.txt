 Meanwhile, prepare a six-cup muffin tin by spraying each cup with nonstick cooking spray., Arrange the chopped tomatoes and feta cheese crumbles in the bottom of each muffin cup, dividing the fillings evenly among all six cups.


Nearly any combination of chopped vegetables will work, and you can omit the feta cheese or replace it with another type of cheese. Only place about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of your desired fillings in each muffin cup, however.
 In a small bowl, whisk together the egg whites, salt, and pepper. Continue until the egg whites seem frothy.


Adjust the salt and pepper by personal taste. If you aren't sure how much to use, start with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of each.
 Pour the whisked egg whites over the tomatoes and cheese, dividing the mixture evenly among all six muffin cups.
 Place the muffin tray in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the eggs are fully set and lightly browned.


The egg whites should no longer appear glossy when done. If in doubt, insert a toothpick through the center of each egg white muffin to test for doneness throughout.
 Remove the tray from the oven. Cool the egg whites for about 5 minutes, then enjoy them while they're still warm.


You should be able to reheat the egg white muffins without difficulty. Store leftovers in sealed, airtight plastic bags in your refrigerator for up to one week. Reheat one egg white muffin in the microwave for 1 minute at full power.

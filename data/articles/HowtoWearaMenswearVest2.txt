 Vests are typically viewed as a formal addition to an outfit. A menswear vest works well in professional environments and special events like a charity fundraiser. There are a variety of menswear vests that were designed to be paired with a dress shirt and tie.


Try on the vest before you purchase one to be sure it fits. Pay attention to the width of the vest, and make sure it fits snugly. You should also be sure the vest's shoulders do not droop over the your own shoulders. Basically, don’t pick out and wear a baggy vest for formal attire.
For formal wear, you should only wear neutral colors like black, grey, beige, or navy.
 The shirt underneath the vest should compliment and accentuate the vest. For formal wear, the best shirt to wear is a white collared shirt. White pairs with every color and it’ll bring more attention to the sleek vest. Fold the collar over the vest.


A different light colored top will also work as an undershirt., The key to wearing the right dress pants is to make sure they match the color of the vest. Most people wear pants that are the same color. This is common in suits where the vest, jacket, and pants are all the same color.


Dress pants are a staple for looking formal, but you could also look formal in a clean pair of khakis or slacks.
 Accessories must be subtle, but can bring out the overall appearance of your outfit.If you are going to wear jewelry, wear something subtle like silver earrings and a silver necklace. You can wear a purse, but choose a small, clean purse that’s a neutral color.


Don’t use a large bag that you might use every day.
Heels are great for formal occasions. You can also get away with a flat top dress shoe.

 To begin, youâ€™ll need to turn on both your Blackberry and your computer.;
, Plug the smaller side of your Blackberry USB cable into the small USB port on the side of the Blackberry itself. Then plug the other side of the cable into the 2.0 USB port of your PC.

Note that older computers do not usually have 2.0 USB ports. Your computer will notify you if this is the case.
 When you connect your Blackberry, it will automatically install itself on your computer. Wait for this process to finish.
 When your Blackberry is installed on your computer, a small pop-up notification will appear on the side of your task bar. You are now ready to go!

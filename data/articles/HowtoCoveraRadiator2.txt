 There are many simple radiator covers that you can likely find at your local hardware store, big box home center (like Lowe’s, Home Depot, etc.), or online. Though these designs may seem run of the mill, they often come in various colors, which means you can choose the one that best matches your home’s color scheme., If you don’t mind the look of your radiator but want to dress it up a little, use a marble radiator cover. This small slab of marble will not hide your radiator from view, but it’ll give the radiator a more a classic appearance. This look would likely work well in places like bathrooms and kitchens.


Be sure to only do this for suitable, sturdy radiators. Marble is quite heavy. Installing your marble cover on unstable radiators could result in damage or harm., If you can extend the surface of an existing feature in your home so it overhangs your radiator, this can effectively camouflage your radiator. Prime features you can use in this way include things like counters, sills, and so on. Similarly, you can top and hide radiators under material similar to that used in desktops, sills, and shelves in a room. This will make the radiator seem like a natural part of the room's decor., Bookshelves generally have a rectangular or square shape, much like radiator covers. Because of these similarities, covered radiators can often be easily integrated with bookshelves. This will make covered radiators less obtrusive.

 It's the long hair that has highlights and is the color that is reddish brown and resembles strips of bacon. (Lots of people think bacon hair is ugly and it makes you seem like a noob)






Swirly top






Long skirt.
 Go for light blue, purple and light purple. The light pink is overused and just looks silly. Don't go over the top with accessories.
 Skirts are nice, use black or white. If you want to make a dress, use the tank top and make the skirt the same colour and use a belt. If you want to look laid back (and look nicer), go for grey shorts.
 Use sandals or the flat shoes. Make them black, white or the color of your top. Avoid the heels, many people think they're trampy. Don't go for the slippers, as they're immature and only noobs and the people who act like little kids and tawk wike vis use them.
 Most HC use this style. By doing this, you can look more like them.

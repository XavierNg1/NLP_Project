 At the top, you'll see the SafeSearch filter. By default, it's in the Moderate position. Click on the topmost radio button to enable strict filtering.


Unlike Google, setting strict filtering on Bing will block everything. For example, searching for the word "sex," Bing gives no results at all. This indicates that Bing is not filtering content of the results, but prohibiting the search completely. Depending on your own personal feelings, this may either be a good thing or a bad thing. Either way, there is a very clear difference between Bing searches and Google searches.

Note: Bing does not offer a way to lock strict filtering.
 When you are done adjusting your SafeSearch settings, be sure to click the blue Save button at the bottom of the screen, or your prefs won't be saved.

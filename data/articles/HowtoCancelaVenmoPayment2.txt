 If you sent money to an email address or phone number that is not associated with a Venmo account, you can cancel the transaction. Once it is canceled, the money will be returned to the original funding source., This is the menu icon, and it appears in the upper left corner of the app., Here you’ll find two tabs: “Requests” and “Payments.”, Here you’ll see the payment-in-question. Remember, you can only cancel a payment if the phone number or address is not associated with a Venmo user. Here’s how to check:

If the phone number or address you sent money doesn’t belong to a Venmo user, you will see the email or phone number at the top of the payment-in-question. You’ll also see a button that says “Cancel.”
If the address or phone number IS connected to a Venmo account, the person’s name will appear on the screen. If it’s not your intended recipient, see If You Paid the Wrong Person.
 The entry will be removed from the list, and the money will be refunded to the card or account from which it was sent. The deposit will appear in the original funding account in one business day.

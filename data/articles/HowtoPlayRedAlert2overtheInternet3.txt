Red Alert 2 uses the IPX protocol. Which is currently outdated, what this means is that there is little if not no support for it. Furthermore, Windows Vista does not support the IPX protocol.
This problem can be solved by using a patch to change Red Alert 2's IPX protocol into a UDP protocol. UDP is currently widely supported. And should present itself as the de facto way to play Red Alert 2 on the LAN.
However that is not the case. Certain players on the Hamachi networks, for some reason, still flock to play on IPX. As such, this guide will teach you how to configure both.

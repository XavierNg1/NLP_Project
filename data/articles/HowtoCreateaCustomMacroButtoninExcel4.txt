 The Developer tab is a tab in the Ribbon at the top of Excel. If it is not displayed, follow these directionsin order to display it:


Go to Excel → Preferences → Ribbon (Under Sharing and Privacy)
Under Customize, check the box next to the Developer tab, and press "OK"

, The Button icon is under the Form Controls group in the Developer tab and looks like a rectangular button.
 Place your cursor where you'd like the button to go and drag to select the size of the button. You can make the button as small or as large as you'd like, given your needs. If you wish, you can move the button around after placement.
 Excel should automatically prompt you to assign a macro to your button after you finish placing it. Once you've selected your macro, click "OK."


If you are unfamiliar with what macros are or how to record them, read more. You should have a macro already built before you create the button.
 Right-click on the newly-created button and select "Format Control." Select Properties → Don't move or size with cells → OK. This helps you maintain the size and placement of your button. If you don't have this property chosen, your button size and placement will change if you have it add, delete, or move cells.
 Change the text in the button to say whatever you'd like it to.

 If you're dating a reader, hook him up with some new material. Do a little detective work about what he's currently reading and what he already has, and try to fill in the blanks with a similar book.


Take advantage of product recommendations. For instance, if you know your boyfriend loved a certain book, ask the clerk at your local bookstore for similar titles. Or, type the title into a service like Amazon and see what other readers bought after reading that one.
If you're not sure what to buy, get a gift card. Books are a pretty personal gift, and it can be tough to figure out what someone would enjoy reading. If you're stumped, rely on a gift card. Offer to go shopping with him and make a date of it.
 If your boyfriend is really into music, get him a present that's in line with his interests. Here are a few suggestions:


Pick up some new guitar picks if he's a guitarist, or drumsticks if he's a drummer.
Find a good pair of noise-canceling headphones if he listens to a lot of music.
Get him an iTunes gift card or a Spotify subscription.
 If your boyfriend is a big gamer, he's almost guaranteed to like a gaming-themed gift for Valentine's Day.


Buy him a new game. See if there are any upcoming releases he's had his eye on, or ask his buddies what he's been dying to play.
Or, just buy him credits. You can buy the gaming equivalent of a gift card depending on what platform he uses:

Steam (PC)
Xbox Live Marketplace (Xbox)
PlayStation Store (PS3)


Update his controller. Whether he uses a console controller or a mouse, buying him a new piece of hardware could be a great Valentine's gift.

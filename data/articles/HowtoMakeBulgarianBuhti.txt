, It is crucial that you add sugar so the mixture can blow up.
 Then add 100-200g of the white cheese.


After you put the 3 ingredients in the bowl, you must mix them slowly and not fast.
 By now your mixture must look like something in the picture above and this phase is important. Here you can guess whether the dish will blow up and become hollow on the inside or not. There must be a lot of dark bubbles and when you put your head near the mixture, you should be able to hear a lot of rapid popping.
 Make sure you mix it in such a way that the new mixture will be homogeneous before adding the next wave of flour.
 Lay some flour on a clean table so it doesn't stick and start adding flour as you slowly push it. If you do not know how to make it hard and not sticky, try researching it online.
 Add enough oil so there is about 1–1.5 centimeter (0.4–0.6 in) in depth. The pan doesn't need to be wide because you will need more oil that way. Preheat the oven on at lvl 5 (out of 6).
 Use a long stick to straighten the down. After that, use a sharp object to cut the buhti. Bear in mind, you cannot get very detailed shapes after the dough blows up.
 There needs to be a little space between the pieces of dough because, after all, they will get larger. After they begin to look brown, turn them over.
 Congratulations, you have now finished cooking Traditional Bulgarian Buhti. You can add some caster sugar in a small bowl and dip the Buhti inside.

, Choose a metal strainer or colander that can fit into your pot. Ideally, find one with long handles for easy handling.
 It only takes about thirty seconds to refresh most pasta. Withdraw the strainer and taste test the noodles. If they are not ready, return them to the water. Withdraw and taste test again every 15 seconds.If your strainer does not have long handles, or if you do not have oven mitts, instead place the strainer in a bowl and pour boiling water over it.

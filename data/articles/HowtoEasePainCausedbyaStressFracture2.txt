 If you suspect you have a stress fracture, visiting a doctor is a must for helping ease the pain. The doctor can assess whether you have a fracture or a sprain and help you better understand how to treat it.In some cases, surgery may be necessary.
 If you have a history of stress fractures, the doctor may diagnose your condition without imaging tests. However, if you are coming in for the first time for this kind of injury, your doctor will want to run imaging tests to see if it is actually broken.One type of imaging test you may have done is an X-ray, where your doctor uses radiation to produce an image of your bones. However, this type of test won't always show stress fractures right away.Your doctor may move on to a bone scan or MRI. With a bone scan, she will first inject a substance known as a tracer into your blood. This substance is radioactive and helps the doctor see the fracture when the bone is scanned.However, sometimes other injuries appear the same as a fracture with this type of scan.With an MRI, magnets are used to produce an image of your bone. You won't be exposed to any kind of radiation with this scan, and it generally produces a good image of the injury., Sometimes, you can get away without wearing a cast, splint, or walking boot with a stress fracture. Nonetheless, having support on the fractured bone can help ease the pain.Sometimes, in place of a walking cast, your doctor may have you were a stiff-soled shoe or sandal.On your shoulder, you might wear a sling.
 You may need crutches, as they take the weight off your foot completely. Not putting weight on your foot can reduce the pain. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether they are a good solution for you., If your pain is severe, your doctor may write you a prescription for pain medication. However, she may ask you to rely on over-the-counter medications.

 First, lie supine on your back. Engage your core, and slowly raise your legs straight up into the air. Use your arms for support, if you have trouble.
 When you can do the candlestick position well, without needing support from your arms, try moving one foot closer to your head. You should be able to do this with one foot on the floor near your head, both with a bent knee and a straight knee. When you can do this well with each leg separately, try with both legs at the same time.


Make sure to bend your knees.
 While sitting up, try placing one foot behind your head or as close as you can manage. Doing this a couple of times every day, and it should become easier and easier. Remember to practice equally with each of your legs., Do the same as the previous step just with both legs at the same time and you should succeed! This can take up to 3 weeks to master and may take beyond that as well so don't worry if you don't seem to be getting anywhere.

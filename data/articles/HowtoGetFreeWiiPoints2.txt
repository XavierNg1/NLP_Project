 There are loads of websites out there that claim to get you free Wii Points if you just give them your information, complete some surveys, or complete their offers. Many of them (if not all) aren't legit. Be cautious before doing anything--you don't want to get your identity stolen.


Prizerebel and Rewards1 are two sites that claim to be able to do this. If the information you're garnering off the internet is confusing and spammy, ask friends or family if they have any experience with this.
 If you do wind up tempted into action by these websites, be sure to have an extra email address just for spam. You're going to start getting loads of it. What's more, don't give them any important information about yourself. Fill in the fields in a believable, but fake manner.


A new email address can be obtained in seconds and can be from any webmail provider.
 If you've found a site that looks like it'll deliver what you're looking for, complete the registration process with your fake email and information. Once you've done that, you can start exploring, looking for the deals you're interested in.


Complete the offers and surveys according to the descriptions and sit back. It may take a few minutes. After you accrue enough points, go to their available prizes and exchange your points for codes. The codes will then be emailed to your spam email address.

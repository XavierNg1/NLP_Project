Yogurt is great for the skin because is it naturally exfoliating, brightening, and hydrating. It also helps lighten dark spots and reduce blemishes.;
, Honey is one of the best things you can put on your skin. It is naturally moisturizing and anti-bacterial. It will help hydrate your skin while managing acne.
 If you are wearing a nice shirt, it might also be a good idea to drape an old towel across your chest and shoulders. Washing your face with warm water first helps open up your pores and make the mask even more effective.
 If you have any mask left over, you can also apply it to your neck. You can apply the mask using just your fingers. For a more spa-like experience, gently brush the mask on using a foundation makeup brush.
 The mask will still be doing its "job" hydrating and moisturizing your face.
 Gently pat your face dry with a clean towel afterwards. Your skin may feel a little stiff and tight after this mask; if this is the case, apply some moisturizer afterwards.

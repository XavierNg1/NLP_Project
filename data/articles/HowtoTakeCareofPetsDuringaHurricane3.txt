 Before a hurricane warning is issued, you should have an emergency evacuation route planned out. In addition to a route, your emergency evacuation plan should also include how you will transport your pets and what supplies to bring with you in an emergency evacuation.

This is especially important if you have large animals, such as horses, because they cannot be brought into typical shelter areas, such as basements or hurricane shelters., If you live in a hurricane-prone area, it's important to have emergency supplies gathered before an incident occurs. An emergency supply kit for your pets includes:One week supply of food and fresh water
Medications, if your pets take any
Vaccination records and other medical records
Pet insurance policy, if you have one
Photos of your pets, for identification if they get lost
Cat litter and pan, if necessary
Manual can opener, for canned pet food
Food dishes
Pet carrier
First aid kit and other supplies

, It is important that your pets are always wearing id tags so that if they are lost during an emergency, like a hurricane, they can be identified by anyone that finds them. This makes it more likely that they will be returned to you if they are found.Consider also getting your pet microchipped, if possible, so that there is a secondary way for them to be identified in case they get lost.
 When evacuating it is important to bring along some supplies for your pet. It may be hard to find your pet supplies in the aftermath of the storm, so bringing them along is important for their survival. At minimum, you should bring:Enough food and water for a week
Medications, if your pets take any
Vaccination records and other medical records
Pet insurance policy, if you have one
Photos of your pets, for identification if they get lost

, While packing away food and water for your family, include pet food and water as well. Place it all in the basement, cellar, or whatever other low-lying spot you are using for shelter.

Also make sure that you have a way to keep your pet contained, if necessary. This may mean that you bring a pet crate into your shelter area if you have a cat or you just keep your dogs leashed during the storm. This will also help you to keep control of your pet after the storm, when its usual areas may be full of hazards.

 If you have access to resistance bands, wrap these loose rubber loops around your ankles as you work on your toe touch. Then, try to perform your toe touches as normal. It will be much harder to fully extend your legs. However, the bands will bring your legs back together more quickly once they're spread, which might help you perfect the sharp "snapping" motion.As an added bonus, this should strengthen your legs.
 If you are going to be doing a toe touch as part of a cheerleading or gymnastics routine, you'll probably need to do it to the beat of a song. Try giving each "position" of the toe touch a number from one through eight. On 1 and 2, keep your hands clasped in front of you; on 3, swing into the 'high "V"' pose, and hold it through 4; on 5, snap down into the crouch; on 6, begin your jump and swing your arms into the "T"; on 7, hit the peak of your jump; and land on the count of 8.


Listen to a short section of the song on loop, and try to figure out the tempo – the number of beats per minute (BPM). Count to eight in your head as the song loops: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Try to reach each position of the toe touch in time with the beat of the song.
Even if you aren't doing a toe touch to a song, the act of counting might help you space out the movements. Practice counting in your head until you do not need to think about the numbers separately from the positions.
 The best way to improve is to practice regularly. Stretch before and after to build strength and flexibility. Make sure that you have plenty of room to perform the full jump!


Consider practicing the move in front of a mirror so that you can analyze and improve your form. Otherwise, try working on your form with a partner, for feedback – perhaps a coach, a friend, or another member of your gymnastics/cheer team.

 Place the stained part of the fabric under a tap with running warm water. Try to get out as much of the latex paint as you can, especially if the stain is fresh., Pour some liquid dish detergent onto the inseam of the piece of clothing you want to clean. Rub the detergent into the inseam and see if any color comes out. If nothing comes out, you know the fabric is color-safe and you can proceed with using dish detergent to remove the stain.If the fabric is not color-safe, you’ll need to take the item to a professional dry cleaner.
 Because dishwashing detergents are made to break up oils, they can help to dissolve latex paint. Mix one-part dishwashing detergent with one-part water., Allow it to soak in for three minutes. Then, use a clean cloth or fabric brush to scrub out the stain., Using your sponge, rub away at the stain until you get a nice lather. Continue to scrub the stain until the paint is no longer visible.You can reapply the detergent mixture and try again, if necessary.
If you can’t get rid of the paint using detergent, you’ll need to use rubbing alcohol.
 Run warm water over the stain until all of the soap and the paint are gone. Finally, throw the item in the washing machine.To launder the item, follow the directions listed on the clothing label.

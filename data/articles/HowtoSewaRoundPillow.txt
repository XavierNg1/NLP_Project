 If you are a beginner, it is best to start with a fabric that is easy to sew. Select a fabric that matches the couch, bed, etc.;
, Make the pillow on the large side, so that you can sew it more easily.
 Use a fabric marker, pen, chalk etc. It is always helpful to use a cardboard template to draw around - mistakes are more easily remedied on the cardboard than on the fabric when creating the circle.
 It is easier to place two pieces of fabric together when cutting, as you will get a perfect matching cut.
 Before you start sewing, it might be easier to draw a dotted chalk line around. Sew. Hand sewing is often easier for this simple project. Do not complete the stitching all the way around â€“ leave a hole for stuffing the pillow.
 Make sure that the pillow is fully stuffed so that it sits firmly.
 Pat down the pillow into shape. Add any adornments that you think will improve it (for example, lace, buttons, fabric shapes, etc.) Once completed, use as wished.

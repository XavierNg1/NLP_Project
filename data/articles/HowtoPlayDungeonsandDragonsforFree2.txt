 Play the demo on the Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) website. This will familiarize you with the game and give you a basic idea of the flow and systems at work.
 Dice are the only material that is required from all players. There is a dice roller at WOTC's site, or you can find a printable paper template and make your own. A pencil with dots on each side makes an inexpensive replacement for six-sided dice.
 If you want the traditional DnD-style game, go with dwarves, elves, humans and even half-lings. If you want sci-fi, you can use any sort of aliens you want.


The System Reference Document (SRD) contains the rules of D&D, which are important to consult as you learn to play. Follow the link and scroll to the bottom of the page. Download the Basic Rules and Spells sections. If you're planning to be the Dungeon Master (DM), get the Monsters and Magic Items as well. Don't worry about any of the other sections for now, they're for advanced players. Be advised: The SRD is not comprehensive, and lacks vital information on subjects like character generation and gaining levels.
Printable character sheets are available here. For most beginners, the 4th Edition Character Sheets will do.
 This is what makes your game interesting, making your own story line could be the hardest, but most fun part of the process. You can choose to have whatever characters you want, whatever mythology you want or you can even make up your own mythology.
 Dungeons and Dragons is a complex game that will take some time getting used to, so encourage everyone playing to read the core materials and go over the WOTC tutorial. Stay persistent and your game sessions will become much more rewarding.

 This can be expressed as the ratio of grams of water vapor to the number of kilograms of dry air. This is called the actual mixing ratio. This data can be obtained online as measured from instruments such as a microwave water radiometer.Measuring the water vapor in the air is not something that can be done with household items.
 This is the point at which the air would be saturated with moisture and is called the saturation mixing ratio. The amount of water vapor the air can hold is dependent upon the temperature of the air. Tables are available online that will tell you the capacity of water vapor at a specific temperature.The higher the temperature, the higher the water vapor capacity., This simple calculation produces the relative humidity. Thus, if the air currently holds 20 grams of water per kilogram of dry air and can hold 40 grams of water per kilogram of dry air, the relative humidity would be 20/40, or 50 percent.

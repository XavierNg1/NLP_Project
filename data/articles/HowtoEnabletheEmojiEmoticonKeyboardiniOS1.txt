Emoji originated in Japan and is a set of pictographs such as smileys. The emoji keyboard offers a wide variety of icons that can be read by any device that supports the emoji character set.
All Apple devices with iOS 5 or later support Emoji.
Google Hangouts for Android and iOS also supports Emoji.;

Open any app that uses a keyboard (e.g., text messaging) and tap the text bar to activate the keyboard. At the bottom left-hand side of the keyboard, next to the numbers and symbols icon, look for either a smiley icon or a globe icon.
If you see a smiley icon, this means that the emoji keyboard has already been turned on.
If you see a globe icon, press and hold the icon to see a list of activated keyboards. “Emoji” will appear on this list if it has already been turned on.
If you don’t see either icon, this means that your iPhone only has one default keyboard set. You will need to add the emoji keyboard.

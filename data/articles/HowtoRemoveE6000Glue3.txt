 Chances are that E6000 or any other industrial strength glue will ruin clothing, either because you wonâ€™t be able to remove it entirely or because the fabric will be discolored or damaged in removal. Try acetone if you want to keep the item, however.Find an old tooth brush. Then, using an applicator like a cotton swab, dab the glue with acetone.
Brush the bonded glue with the tooth brush to begin removing the adhesive. Reapply the solvent and brush several times to erode the glue.
Work on both sides of the fabric, if need be. You may not be able to entirely remove the glue.
When done, remove the acetone by washing the fabric.
 Hard surfaces like tables, countertops, and floors can take a more aggressive approach. First, choose the right solvent for your surface. You do not want to damage the surface with too powerful a chemical.


Goo Off, for example, contains mainly acetone and will dissolve plastic, laminate, and Formica surfaces.Test a small and inconspicuous area of your surface beforehand to prevent widespread damage.
Once you are sure that the solvent will not harm the surface, apply it liberally to the glue.
 Let the solvent sit for 15 to 30 minutes. Then, begin to abrade the softened glue with whatever mechanical means are at hand. Repeat this process until the glue is gone.You can use a heavy cloth or rag, a wire brush, sandpaper, or a tool like a screwdriver to abrade the glue, depending on the surface.
For especially hard surfaces, it may be possible to scrape off the glue with a utility knife or razor blade. Be careful not to cut yourself.
Unfortunately, abrasion may scratch or damage the surface while you are removing glue. A hardwood floor may need to be sanded and refinished, for example.

 Some people brag because they feel insecure and feel that others will only love them if they are amazing.Tell your friend that you care about them no matter what. Explain that you are not the kind of person to judge someone for their successes or possessions, and that what matters to you is their heart.


Make an effort to tell your friend how much you care, and compliment them on little things. You could tell your friend, for example, "Dakota, I really loved spending time with you today. You're great to talk with."
Once they know that you are not impressed by their bragging, they may feel uncomfortable bragging around you in the future.
 Often, people who brag are less self-confident than they appear. Your friend might brag because they feel insecure around you. Build a safe space in your conversations where you and your friend can express themselves authentically.Creating this safe space depends on your attitude. If you approach them compassionately, this will show and your friend will feel comfortable. If you feel angry around them, they will sense this, too, and become more nervous.
 If nothing else works, talk to them about how their behavior hurts. Tell them that you feel alienated when they one-up you or that you feel like they don't care about you. Ask them if they could be more conscious of their behavior.


Avoid seeming confrontational. Instead of putting the blame on them (e.g.: "You brag too much!"), put the emphasis on your feelings (e.g.: "I feel hurt when you one-up what I say."), While you might feel tempted to vaguely mention how much you hate bragging, your friend might not take the hint.


Say something like, for example, "Hey, Henry, can we talk? I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I felt hurt when you started talking about your dog after I told you my dog just died. It made me feel like you aren't paying attention to me. I feel like I listen to you when we talk. Can you please listen to me?"

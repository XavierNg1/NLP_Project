 Chargin’ Chucks will charge at you as soon as you approach. Avoid this first charge by jumping out of the way (2 button).
 To do this, pressing the “2” button when the Chargin’ Chuck is near.
 When in Yoshi is still in mid-air, press “Z” to hammer down on the Chuck. A single hit will defeat the Chuck and give you coins.

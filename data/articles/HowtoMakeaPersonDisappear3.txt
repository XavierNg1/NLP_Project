 This trick is an easy way to vanish someone from a video. It doesn't require a live audience but can look professional. You can incorporate this trick into any type of video project you're working on.
 You'll need a standard video camera and a tripod. If you don't own a tripod you can set one up on a study surface for your video camera. The idea is to not change your camera's the location.
 For a realistic effect, weave the vanishing effect into your video, so it appears seamless. For example, your video is about a futuristic society who teleport for transportation. In this scenario you'd script the dialogue in a way that the characters are talking about teleporting somewhere, or are preparing to teleport.


Shoot the footage up until the moment that you want the characters to disappear.
It might help if they countdown, 3-2-1 and then cut the scene.
 Have everyone in the shot leave the camera's eye. Check on the camera's display monitor to ensure that the shot is only the background.
 If you roll the film from exactly where you left off, it'll appear as though the characters disappeared from their location. If you want them to reappear: cut the scene and gather all the characters back into their original positions and continue filming.
 Another way for you to perform magic tricks is by using the camera to relay your magic tricks. Follow the above steps to incorporate various approaches to making somebody disappear. You could even expand beyond people and cause cars to disappear! Be creative and have some fun in the process.

 It is best to cut gladiolus at the point when one or two flowers are already open (the lower ones will open first).


It’s always best to cut flowers in the morning when the air is cool and the plant hydrated.






Use a sharp blade to give a clean cut.
Avoid using scissors or a blunt tool, as this will crush the cells and they won’t take up water very well, shortening the cut flower's life span.
Immediately put the base of the stem into a container of water until you can arrange them in a vase.;
, Gladiolus flowers arrange themselves nicely in a vase and look good by themselves or with other flowers. Be wary, because the cut flower stem is tall and heavy and can tip over a lightweight vase.


It’s best to use a heavy vase or one with a heavy base.
A big earthenware jug works well.
You can try adding a weight to the vase, such as the weights from your kitchen scales, to help add weight to the base of your vase and stabilize it.
Make sure the vase is at least 2/3 full of water as this will also provide stability.
Whatever container you use should be very clean.
 For safety's sake, don’t put the vase somewhere it will cause damage if it tips over, and try to arrange the flowers in a balanced way so the weight is not all along one side of the vase.


To keep your gladiolus flowers alive as long as possible, keep the vase in a cool environment.
It should be placed away from sources of heat and direct sunlight.
Don’t put the vase near a TV or other electrical equipment as these also emit heat.
Remember, gladiolus vases can be prone to tipping over!

 A simple cereal, such as Corn Flakes, would work best, that way when you mix all the ingredients together, the tastes compliment each other and don't make you feel nauseous.;
,, This is optional, since you might want to add fruit and the syrup/jelly or jam might make the breakfast too sweet.
 Fruits that can be delicious to add would be any kind of berries such as blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries. Nuts like walnuts, almonds, raisins are great for that crunchy texture. They are delicious and you don't need to chop them up!

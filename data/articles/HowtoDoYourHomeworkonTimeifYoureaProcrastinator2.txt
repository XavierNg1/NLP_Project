You may prefer to work in short time blocks. If staring at a book for 2 straight hours without a break makes you miserable, then don't do it. Work for 1 hour when you get home. Then, take a break, eat dinner and work for another hour after dinner.
 Then, write times for when they need to be started by. For example, you could put "Math Worksheet 5:00". Take any extra time you have in between the times and when you finish the assignment for yourself.


You may want to start studying and work until you are finished. Make sure that you at least stand up and walk around about every 45 minutes to refresh your mind and body.
You may learn best when you work with others. However, be honest with yourself. If other people distract you instead of helping you, then you need to work alone. Also, a lot of assignments require you to work individually.



Avoid putting off large or difficult assignments until the last minute. You might not be able to finish them.
Never do your homework between 2 class periods. Rushing through an assignment usually results in a bad grade.
Avoid doing homework during a class. You might end up missing something important.
Save "late homework" passes (if you get them) for true emergencies.
Never copy another person's work. You are capable of doing better. Besides, your teacher will catch on eventually.
Block the internet. Research shows that taking control and blocking the internet when you do your homework means you get it done more quickly, leaving lots of time for fun. Don't pull an all-nighter to finish an assignment. You'll make more mistakes when you're sleep-deprived.



Do 50 minutes of homework and then look at Facebook for 10 minutes. Just set a timer for yourself so that you don't procrastinate.
Reward yourself for a job well done. When you've finished studying, call or text a friend or go over to a friend's house. You can also do something that you love to do such as listening to music.

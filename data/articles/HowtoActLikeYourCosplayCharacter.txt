 Watch your character in action. Try to look at as many videos or episodes as you can so that you can get an idea of what to do.;
, Write the following questions down, then answer them after watching your character more closely:


How does my character's voice sound? (Normal, breathy, loud, etc.)
What would my character say?
What mood is my character usually in?
Is there a certain phrase that the character says that is popular among fans?
Is there a certain movement that my character constantly does?
How does my character react to people?

, Practice what you wrote down in front of a mirror. Practice it so often that once you get to the convention, being the character is like second nature.
 If you exaggerate your character too much, people will get irritated and lose interest in you. Keep it vibrant, but subtle.
 Although optional, it can give you an extra something to entertain people with. Often in conventions, the winners of the costume contest are called onto a stage. You should give a good speech and entertain them. If your character doesn't sing or dance, practice a speech, and say it in the way that your character would.
 In the days leading up to the convention, practice your new personality in everyday life. This will make you feel more comfortable in adopting it. If anyone asks why you're suddenly acting so strange, be honest and tell them why.
 The whole point of cosplaying is to enjoy the experience and to meet others who are also enjoying it.

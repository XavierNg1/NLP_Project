 There may be various sources of standing water in your home that should be regularly changed. For instance, vases, water bowls for your pet, and other household decor that uses water need to be emptied, cleaned, and refilled once a week.If you keep lots of plants in your home, make a list of everything that holds standing water to be sure you don’t forget one or another of your flowerpots.
 Your household likely has appliances that can create puddles of standing water if they’re not working correctly. For instance, improperly working refrigerators, dishwashers, and washing machines can create puddles, potentially beneath the appliance itself. If you discover that an appliance is leaking, immediately get it repaired and replace it if necessary.
 While many buildings have basements or crawl spaces that are damp, this usually does not lead to standing water. However, if allowed to persist, the issues that lead to a humid basement can potentially lead to damage, health risks, or accumulated water in the future.Note that a dehumidifier or even an interior moisture coating only address the symptoms, not the cause of the problem. Consult a home drainage professional to help you identify the source of the moisture and consider their recommendations.

 The first step is to prepare the vegetables by cutting them into bite-sized pieces.Do your best to make the pieces the same size.








If your vegetables are not the same size (and especially the same thickness), they won't finish cooking at the same time. When you take your vegetables out of the pan, some will either be over or under-cooked.;
, In theory, you can saute vegetables in any pan, but some work better than others. A wide saute pan with straight sides or a skillet with sloped sides works best.Your pan should have have a dense bottom so as to distribute heat evenly.
A stainless steel, non-stick, aluminum, or anodized pan will work well.
 Choose an oil or fat to saute your vegetables in. Butter or any kind of oil will work. You can also use bacon fat, though this option is less healthy.









While any oil will work, oils with a high smoke-point such as canola oil, peanut oil, and regular olive oil work best. Oils with a lower smoke points like extra virgin olive oil nut-infused oils can be used, but often lose their flavor when cooked at high temperatures., Turn your burner up to medium-high and allow the pan and oil to heat up.

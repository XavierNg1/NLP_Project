 Place the lard in the skillet and melt it over medium high heat, until it's clear and swirls easily in the pan.


If you don't want to use lard, you can use vegetable oil or peanut oil in its place.
If you have roasted peanuts and almonds instead of raw nuts, skip this step.
 Roast them in the lard, stirring often, until they turn golden brown, which should take about 5 minutes., SautÃ© the raisins with the nuts until they are soft, about 1 more minute.

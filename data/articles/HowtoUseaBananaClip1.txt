 These simple plastic clips are available in the hair accessory section of drugstore or online. They come in many different colors. If you don't want the clip to be visible in your hair, choose one that matches your hair color., Remove any tangles and comb it out smooth. Or, if your hair is curly or kinky, use your fingers to separate it into neat locks.
 You'll see it has a snap at the top where it fastens to keep your hair in place.
 The hinge of the clip should hit near the back of your head, with the jaws open on either side of your hair. Make sure the curve of the clip fits the curve of your head, rather than pointing outward. You may need to move your hair out of the way to get the clip in position.
 Make sure all of your hair is inside the clip. Pull it as tight or as loose as you want.
 Close it close against your head so the style will hold. Fasten the tip toward the top of your head to hold your hair in place.
 It may take a little practice before you're able to smoothly gather your hair into the clip.

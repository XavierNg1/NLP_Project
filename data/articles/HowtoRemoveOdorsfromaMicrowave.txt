 Put diluted vinegar, water, and a spoonful of salt in the microwave. Heat until it steams for at least thirty seconds.

Water can "superheat" in the microwave, causing an explosion when you touch the container. Stirring in salt prevents this from happening.If you're worried about this, wet a dishcloth thoroughly in water and vinegar and heat that instead for five minutes.
For light smells, even pure water can help. If your microwave has developed a more pungent odor, you may need a 50/50 mix of vinegar and water, or even more.;
, If you heated a vinegar mixture, dip a clean dishcloth into it and use it to scrub the microwave. Otherwise, just use soapy water â€” which is particularly effective at removing grime stuck to the walls.
 Cut a thick wedge of lemon and place it on a paper towel in the microwave. Zap it for one minute on full power. Besides covering smells, the citric acid may help loosen grime from the microwave walls.


A shallow saucer of lemon juice will also work.
 Leave the baking soda there overnight, with the microwave door shut. Wipe away the baking soda before using the microwave.

If the walls and ceiling of the microwave are grimy, wet a cloth, sprinkle with baking soda, and give them a good wipe.
You can also buy boxes of baking soda sold as "odor absorbers" or "fridge fresheners" at the grocery store. These require less cleanup, since you just leave the box open in the microwave.
 If you have your microwave's owner manual, check it to see if the turntable is dishwasher safe. If you're not sure, wash the turntable by hand in hot, soapy water.

 If your cat is repeatedly regurgitating, take it to be seen by a veterinarian. Regurgitation once in awhile, for instance once a month, is usually not cause for concern. However, if your cat has hairballs more often than that, then you should get it checked out.When you make an appointment for your cat to be seen you should tell the vet what the issue is and how long the symptoms have been occurring.
 When your veterinarian is trying to figure out what it wrong with your cat, they will first need to figure out whether your cat is regurgitating or vomiting. Your details about the cat's symptoms can help them to do this, as it is rare that the cat will regurgitate on command for them to witness.In order for the veterinarian to differentiate between vomiting and regurgitation, you may want to take a video of your cat while it is having an episode. Showing your veterinarian exactly what is going on will help them immensely with their diagnosis.
 When figuring out what is wrong with your cat, your veterinarian will need to run tests and assess its physical health. The vet will likely give your cat an overall physical assessment by looking at and feeling the cat's body. Then they will run tests on your cat. These will vary but they will usually include a variety of blood tests.With the information you give the vet and the information they get from their assessment and tests, they should be able to give you an accurate diagnosis.

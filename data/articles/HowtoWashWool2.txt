 Machine washing a wool garment has a greater probability of shrinking the item, so it’s important to check the wool item’s care label before machine washing.If the label says hand wash, it’s best to hand wash your sweater rather than machine wash. Only machine wash the garment if it is recommended on the tag.
 Put the wool item in a mesh delicates bag to protect the wool material from snagging inside the machine. Though it isn’t absolutely necessary to use a mesh bag, it can protect the delicate fibers of the wool item from damage., Most washing machines have a wool setting that is set up specifically to wash wool garments. If your machine doesn’t have a wool setting, set the washing machine to coldest setting, which will protect the wool from shrinking.Some machines have a hand washing setting, which you can also use as it is quite gentle.
 Add a laundry detergent formulated for wools or delicates, using its label to approximate how much you will need., After you turn on the wash settings and have added the soap, place the wool item in the machine. Close the machine and wash the garment until the cycle is over.

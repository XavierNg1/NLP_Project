 Cradle cap is a skin condition that is very normal for newborns. This will look like a scaly, yellow or white series of patches on their skin. It is not a serious condition and should resolve itself in a few months. If it seems overly severe, talk to your doctor.
 Colds are normal in small children and should not be a cause for concern. Usually they will go away from two weeks. However, if your child is younger than 2-3 months, go to doctor as this can result in more serious health conditions., Thrush is an oral yeast infection, usually a result of taking antibiotics. It will appear as whitish patches in and around the mouth or cracks at the corners of the mouth. Prevent thrush by keeping bottles and pacifiers clean. Though it is not a terribly threatening illness, if your child contracts thrush you should talk to your doctor to get the appropriate creams to treat the problem.

 Rinse the rosemary well in cold water to remove any remaining dirt or debris. Pat dry with paper towel or use a salad spinner to remove moisture. Pick off any withered leaves or woody stems.
 Place the rosemary - cut into 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) sprigs - onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Do not overcrowd.
 Place the baking sheet onto the top shelf of an oven preheated to the lowest temperature. Leave to bake for 2 - 4 hours, until the stems of the rosemary are brittle., Once out of the oven, leave the rosemary to cool completely. Gather up the edges of the parchment paper to form a funnel and slide the dried rosemary into a clean glass jar. Seal the jar tightly and store in a dry, dark place, such as your kitchen cupboard.

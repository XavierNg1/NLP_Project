 Because your heard does not pump as well, excess fluid backs up into your lungs, leading to shortness of breath.This symptom might be most noticeable when lying down or when engaging in physical activity.
You may find it hard to exercise or wake up in the middle of the night feeling short of breath.;

You may incorrectly interpret the swelling as weight gain. If you experience a steady and inexplicable increase in your weight along with other symptoms of an enlarged heart, consult a doctor., If you can feel your heartbeat speeding up or slowing down inexplicably, you may have arrhythmia. This condition can be harmless, but it could also be cause for concern. Signs of arrhythmia include:Fainting or near fainting
Sweating
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Palpitations — A palpitation can be an increased or decreased heart rate, irregular rhythm, or a skipped or missed beat

If you’re coughing up a lot of frothy, watery sputum (saliva and mucus), you may be on your way to heart failure, a common consequence of an enlarged heart. You may also notice trace amounts of blood in your sputum., Without an adequate amount of blood circulating, you may start to feel fatigued and dizzy. A decreased blood supply to your brain, especially, can lead to feelings of fatigue or lethargy.


Keep in mind that fatigue can be a symptom of many conditions and does not particularly mean that you have an enlarged heart.

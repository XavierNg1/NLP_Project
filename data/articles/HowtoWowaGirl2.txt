 It is easier to wow a girl if you know her personality. Watch how she interacts with other people and how she interacts with you. Pay attention to her personal style, the things that make her laugh, and what her interests are.


You can do something special for her based in what you know about her.
You can also gauge her interest in you to see if she treats you any differently than she treats her friends. If she is more touchy feely, laughs at all of your jokes, or smiles more when you are around, she probably likes you.
 Get to know her friends and learn their names. Her friends are important to her. If her friends like you, she is more likely to be into you. She will also be impressed that you took the time to get to know them.They can also give you clues about her personality and things that she likes.
You do not necessarily have to spend time with her friends. Just be friendly and kind to them.
Also watch your behavior when her friends are around.
 Do not dominate the conversation by talking about yourself. You will come across as self-centered. Ask her questions about her life. Find out what she likes and dislikes.Make eye contact and give her your full attention when she is talking.
Ask her open ended questions and follow up questions during the conversation. For example, ask her “How was your day?” instead of “Did you have a good day?”

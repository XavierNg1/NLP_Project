 Observe your surroundings, especially if you are in an urban area. Keep in mind that even earthquake-proof buildings have a chance of falling, so don't assume you are completely safe. Don't attempt to run or drive away from an earthquake - this only increases your risk of injury.
 Also make sure you are not near an open fault or sinkhole. People have died after falling into large holes which suddenly appeared at the time of the earthquake. These can appear anywhere, including on roads or in parks.
 If you are near objects that could fall on you, head somewhere without overhead hazards. If you can, seek shelter in a place where you are protected from the weather, but make sure that you're not somewhere where rock and soil can fall on you when aftershocks occur. Do not seek shelter under a bridge, even a sturdy one. Some bridges can be earthquake-proof, but not completely safe as objects like signs or lights can still fall on to you.
 Also, as in a blizzard, do not walk near power lines, fallen streetlamps, or rubble.


Beware of broken glass, as even a small piece can injure your foot. Wear heavy shoes to protect your feet.
 It is likely that there are other people near to you or near to your area. Things like a cell phone are handy for everyone, because if one person is injured, another can dial 911 for an ambulance.
 It is best to do this because aftershocks right after an earthquake are usually the strongest. If you eventually leave, observe the safety rules above and take care that debris does not fall on you.

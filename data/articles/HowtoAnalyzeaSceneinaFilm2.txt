 In particular, note when the scene occurs within the timeline of the movie and whether the scene depicts events out of order.


Many movies have scenes that occur out of order, such as when the character is remembering or relaying events that happened at another time (a flashback) or because the director has made the creative choice to show events out of order. Usually, even though the events are out of order, the story itself is told in a straightforward manner from the first scene to the last scene.
As it relates to the story, ask yourself why the scene is taking place where it is and whether it helps to tell the story or distracts from it.
The setting may have been chosen by the director for reasons other than telling the story. Try to determine if the setting is important to the story or just interesting to the director.

 For a Chicago bibliographic entry, begin again with the author’s last name, followed by a comma and the author’s first name. For instance:


“Whistler, George.”

, Use title-case capitalization; this means that you capitalize all of the important words. For example:


“Whistler, George. ‘How to Store Books.’”

, ‘In’ indicates that you found the article within the book. For example:


“Whistler, George. “How to Store Books.” In The Books We Love,”

, Place the page numbers next, followed by a period.


“Whistler, George. “How to Store Books.” In The Books We Love, edited by Jess Jones and Joe Davis, 54-72.”

, Finally, add the publication year:


“Whistler, George. “How to Store Books.” In The Books We Love, edited by Jess Jones and Joe Davis, 54-72. Eugene: Ocean Books, 2003.”

, For an in-text citation, use your word processing software to create a footnote at the end of the sentence you are citing. In the footnote at the bottom of the page, you will create an entry similar to the one in the bibliography with a few notable differences.


Mainly, you are changing some periods to commas (and changing uppercase letters to lowercase letters), enclosing the publication info in parenthesis, and adding the page number at the end for that particular citation. For example:
“George, Whistler, “How to Store Books,” in The Books We Love, ed. Jess Jones and Joe Davis (Eugene: Ocean Books, 2003), 34.”

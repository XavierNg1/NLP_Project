 Step one in any ink removal process is blotting. Remove any ink that has not dried as quickly as possible by blotting it away with water-moistened paper towel.Avoid rubbing an ink spill before heavily blotting the area.
Repeat the wet-paper-towel-blotting-method several times until no more ink is transferring to the paper towel.;
, Rubbing alcohol is one of the best cleaning agents there are. If you already have some hairspray laying around, it will likely do the job just as well. It can be used on laminate, wood, metal, plastic and glass, as well as most other common materials.Fully moisten a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol or hairspray. Squeeze the excess liquid out of the ball.
Simply rub an ink stain with small circular motions until it disappears. The cotton should soak it up.
Cheap hairspray is just as good as any. It’s usually the case that the cheaper the hairspray is, the higher the alcohol content.
 Apply firm pressure to the stain while rubbing. However, don’t scrub too hard, as you’ll risk damaging the finish of the table or desk you’re cleaning.


Remove ink from metal by applying copious amounts of rubbing alcohol directly to the metal surface of the table. Use a clean cloth to rub the stain away.
 Whichever route you go, choose a small, innocuous area to test the method.You don’t need to test the ink-removal aspect of the method. Just test the cleaning method to ensure that you will not damage or otherwise mark the surface you’re hoping to clean.
Don’t rub too aggressively, as materials like cotton and baking soda have some abrasion potential and may damage some surfaces.
Remember to clean the area from which you remove a stain with a water-dampened cloth or paper towel.

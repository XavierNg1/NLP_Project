 You should pick a variety of colors and patterns to make your final product more colorful and visually appealing.
 Find an ordinary metal hair clip that is around 2--3" (5--7.5 cm) long. Take out the middle of the clip, the part that keeps the clip down. Set it aside -- you'll be putting it back later.
 Line up all of the tips of the ribbons and pinch them at the top as the rest of the ribbon hangs down.
 Place the ribbon ends over the top of the clip, facing up, and run the thread around it at least 4-5 times until its securely in place. Then, tie the thread in a knot 3-4 times to hold the ribbon down. Cut off the extra end of the thread.
 Place your thumb underneath the five pieces of ribbon and arrange the ribbon over it to create a loop that fans out at least 1" (2.5 cm). You'll be making five of these, so work out the proportions accordingly so that you don't run out of ribbon or have too much left over. You can always rework the ribbon if this happens.
 Run the thread around the unattached end of the first loop three times. You don't have to tie it again until the end.
 Continue this process until you've made five loops that fan out and touch each other. Keep securing the loops with the string before moving on.
 Run the thread over the free end of the last loop a few times and then run it in between the five loops a few times each. After that, tie the thread to itself and then cut off the excess string.
 Just place it back in its original spot.
 Now pull the pieces of ribbon out so that you can see all five pieces of string in each bow. You don't have to fan out each one perfectly. The clip will look fun and a little asymmetrical. This will make the piece of ribbon look fluffy and colorful.

 Use the simple den or princess castle and decorate it with toys, plushies, TVs, and some books. Use the grass flooring with the rainbow wallpaper (or the cloud wallpaper for non members);
,


Make sure you add a register place for children to sign in! Do this by having a table and chair with a laptop.
Put toys against the walls, a bookshelf or two for story time, a carpet with pillows on it and plushies, a mushroom chair and table with acorn tea set for playing tea time. Feast Tables and Hot Cocoa or Smoothie Machines are great for hungry or thirsty kids.
 Decorate with bird-feeders, fun-houses and other daycare-like garden features. If you want to add a detailed touch, use the anti-bullying sign as a reward for the daycare on the fence.
 If it is full go to Coral Canyons. Tell them what you will pay and how many courses.
 If they say "no" or "go away," don't get angry because sometimes people just don't want to help, or they are busy.
 Advertise your daycare by telling people: "Best daycare in the world - please come," or "Best place for your children to be!"

, When kids come, let their parents sign them in, and then start playing with them. Tell them stories, take them to other dens for mini-field trips. Make sure they enjoy themselves.

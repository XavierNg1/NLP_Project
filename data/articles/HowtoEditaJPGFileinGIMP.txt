 Assuming you have already installed GIMP, you can right click the image and on the image box you should see 'Edit image with GIMP'. Or you can open GIMP and click the upper left-hand menu selection 'File' and 'Open'. Click the file with your chosen image and double click the picture.;
, That will put it in Gimp's native format and leave the original alone. CTRL C will copy the file and then Edit >> Paste As >> New Image to get your image for working with. Close the original file.
 GIMP has a variety of tools available, such as brushes, fill colors, layers, crop, colorize, etc.
 Click the 'File' menu, then click 'Save as'. Save the image in its desired location as JPEG. If it was originally a JPEG, it will save as such. But if it wasn't, click the Select File Type drop down list and click JPEG image.

 Weighted vests are a great way to add resistance to your push up and build your muscles further. Strap the weighted vest on as tight as you can while still remaining comfortable. This way, you can prevent the vest from sagging and hindering your movements. Then do your normal push ups.You can purchase weighted vests from your local sporting goods store.
 This is a great alternative to wearing a weighted vest. Fill a backpack with books, bags of rice, or other heavy objects. The weight of the backpack should equal to 20 percent of your body weight. Then do your normal push ups.For example, if you weigh 120 pounds, then your backpack should weigh at least 24 pounds.
 While you are doing your normal push up, ask a friend to place their hand on your upper back. Tell them to apply pressure on your back as you raise yourself up from the push up.Make sure your friend applies consistent pressure for each push up.

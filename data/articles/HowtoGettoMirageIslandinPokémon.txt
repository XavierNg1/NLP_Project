 At a certain point in the game, Steven will appear to take you to Southern Island. Depending on your game, you will encounter Latios or Latias. You can catch it if you want, but it will come with you regardless of whether or not you catch it.
 When receiving your new Pokémon, you will also get the Mega Stone for the other one - for example, if you have Omega Ruby, you will catch Latios and get the Latias' Mega Stone. This will permit your Latios or Latias to Mega Evolve, which will be necessary to get to the Mirage areas., To receive the Eon flute, you must first beat the Elite Four., To play the Eon Flute, go to Key Items in your bag and select it. A short sound clip and animation will play, and then you be able to soar in the sky on Latios or Latias.

You may want to set the Eon Flute to be activated when you press Y. Don't worry if you already have something else equipped to that button - you can have up to four items equipped to your Y button, and the one you want to use can be selected with the D-pad.
 You will see little islands with red glimmers above them. Some of them might say something like Mirage Island, Mirage Mountain, Mirage Forest, or Mirage Cave. There are five different versions of each, so there are twenty different islands to explore, each with different and rare Pokémon on them.

To get Mirage Spots, you have to connect to the internet on the PSS (Player Search System) and every day, there'll be a picture of a mailbox and a number on the top right off the BuzzNav. Press it and it will tell you how many people you passed by, update your secret bases, and say if new Mirage Spots were discovered.

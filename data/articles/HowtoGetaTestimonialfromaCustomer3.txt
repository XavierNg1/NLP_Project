 Customers can click on the button at their discretion or as directed to leave positive reviews and feedback about your service.


Work with your webmaster or web developer to have a reviews button placed on your website.
 Your email can contain a link that directs them back to the feedback button on your website or a link that takes them to a survey form you created with your testimonial questions.
 Positive reviews left for you on specific niche websites may generate more business. For example, if you run a local bed and breakfast establishment, ask customers to review your business on major traveling websites.
 Websites such as LinkedIn and Facebook have built-in features that allow other users to leave reviews and recommendations for your business on your profile page.
 Search directories allow users to leave reviews about your business online, and may impact the way you rank with local search results. For example, if you are a hair salon and add your business to Google Places, customers looking for a hair salon in their local area may choose your business over others when they see you have a large amount of positive customer reviews.


Perform an Internet search using keywords such as "local business directories" to locate a search directory for every major search engine. You can then add your business to each directory and inform customers to leave testimonials on these sites.

, A phone call every Thursday, a text every so often, seeing each other at least one weekend every month.
 Don't spend all your time either seeing your partner or travelling. Keep seeing your friends, working, taking time to be by yourself.
 Some people say if relationships are hard work, they're not worth it. However, long distance relationships are hard work. Determine whether you and your partner can work on it.
 Trust is a big thing in a long distance relationship. You can cheat on your partner easily without them noticing. You'll have to trust each other to cope.
 Travel can be hard but try not to collapse on the couch. Go out to dinner, catch a movie, whatever. This will make the relationship feel a little more.. normal.
 You can try the relationship for a certain amount of time (longer than a week) and if it really doesn't work out, you can go back to being friends, no harm done. If it does work, you have yourself a relationship.

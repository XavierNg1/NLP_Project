 Before you can take a snapshot in Windows XP, you'll need to adjust some settings so that the image shows up when you capture the screen.
 This will open the Windows Media Player Options window.
 This will open another new settings window.
 This will allow you to capture images from Windows Media Player. You should only uncheck this box when you're trying to capture images, because it may cause Windows Media Player to not function properly.
 You can capture the image when the video is running at any size. You can capture full-screen video or windowed video.
 This will make it much easier than trying to time your keypresses to capture the right moment.
 If you're on a laptop, you may have to press Fn first. You won't receive any indication that your screen was captured.
 You can find this in the Accessories folder of your Start menu. This is the free image editor that comes installed with Windows.
 Click "Edit" → "Paste" or press Ctrl + V to paste your snapshot onto the blank Pain canvas. You'll notice that the entire display was captured, not just the video playing.
 Use the rectangular selection tool to select just the image from Windows Media Player. Click "Edit" → "Copy" or press Ctrl + C to copy the selection to your clipboard.
 The new blank canvas will automatically be the same size as your copied selection. Click "Edit" → "Paste" or press Ctrl + V to paste your selection onto the new blank canvas. You now have a screenshot of your Windows Media Player video.
 Click "File" and select "Save As" to save your new screenshot to your computer.

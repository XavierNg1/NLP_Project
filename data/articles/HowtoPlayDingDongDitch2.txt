 Usually, someone will step up to do it. Switch off at every house to make sure that it's fair. The person who actually rings the doorbell is taking on the most risk â€“ but that's also why this job is fun. Everyone else can wait at the car or the hiding spot.
 Have the ringer creep stealthily up to the door and ring the doorbell. Ring the doorbell once, casually, for a subtle ding dong ditch. Ring it many times to really raise the roof! Keep in mind that the prank may be more effective if the person actually thinks that there is someone at the door. If you ring their bell obnoxiously, then they might just get annoyed.


Start running as soon as you ring the bell. Don't stand in front of the door for longer than a second or two. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to get caught.
Knock if there is no doorbell. Don't hammer obnoxiously on the door. Knock like you're a visitor or a delivery person so that the owners of the doorbell think there's actually someone there.
 After hitting the doorbell, the ringer sprints away at full speed. Regroup in the hiding spot, if you want to see the person's reaction. If you're worried about getting caught, then just run to safety.

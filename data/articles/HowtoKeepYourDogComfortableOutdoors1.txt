 Your dog needs an escape from the sun, especially in the warmer months. Too much direct sun can lead to heatstroke and sunburn. During the winter, your dog will need to get away from snow or ice. Make sure your dog has some shady or covered area where they can get out of the direct path of the elements.Large trees that provide shade can give your dog a good place to rest. However, make sure that the yard doesn’t lose shade as the sun changes position in the sky. Trees may not be enough cover for snow or ice.
You can provide your dog with a covered area, like a carport or back deck. You can also build them an area to lay under to get out of the sun or snow.;
, No matter if it is cold or hot, your dog needs a place to lay that is not on the ground. During the summer, hot concrete or ground can burn them, while cold or frozen areas can be too cold to lay on. Consider giving your dog a raised bed to lay on.A raised bed also helps your dog get away from other irritants, like insects.
 If your dog is spending a lot of time outside, you should set up a house for them. This is especially important when it is cold outside. You should also make sure the roof is waterproof and doesn’t leak. A doghouse allows extra protection that a covered area can’t.A doghouse has walls and is enclosed so that it protects them from wind, rain, and other harsh weather. You can also put a flap door over the entrance to help keep the dog protected.
You can put blankets, a heating pad, or a doghouse heater inside.
Make sure the doghouse isn’t too big. They should be able to stand up or move around, but that’s it. If it is too big, it can make it hard for your dog to get warm.
 In addition to shelter, you can provide toys or bones to keep your dog entertained. This will help provide them entertainment so they won't get bored.


You can place the toys inside the dog house, in a shady area, or on a porch.

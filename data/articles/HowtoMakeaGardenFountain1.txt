 Get a 5 gallon (18.9 L) cylindrical bucket and cut a hole for a 3/4 PVC pipe at the bottom.Turn the bucket upside down and fit a piece of 24" PVC pipe through the hole, leaving about 6" of space at the bottom. Use silicon or caulk to seal any gaps. Place this structure on a large piece of spare plywood, and then center a 12" wide piece of concrete forming tube around the bucket. This is your form for the base and will be filled with quick-set concrete. Fill it until the bucket has at least 2" of material covering it and then give it a shake to remove bubbles. Let it set according to the manufacturer's instructions.;
, Get a glass light fixture globe, spray the inside with cooking spray and then fill it to the top lip with concrete. Tape off the end of a PVC tube and shove the taped end down through the center of the ball so that it sits snugly against the glass. Tape it in place until the concrete sets.
 Break both pieces out of their forms and use a flexible saw to cut off the extra PVC pipe.
 Dig a shallow hole big enough to get a plastic garden basin in. Fill it part way with river stones set a 100–155 gallon (586.7 L)-per-hour pump into the rocks and then cover the pump with a layer of rocks.
 Run 1/2" vinyl tubing from the pump and, with the base tipped on it's side, up through the PVC pipe. Tip the base into place and then insert the tubing through the ball.
 Cut off the excess tubing that protrudes from the ball and then remove the ball in order to trim the tube so that it will fit just below the lip of the ball. Return the ball to it's location and this time secure it in place with some adhesive silicon.
 Pour water into your basin and then start the pump. Ta-da! Your garden fountain is done!

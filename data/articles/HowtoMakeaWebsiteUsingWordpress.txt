 Although you can have a "free" website these days, free means many limitations. Free sites will limit your design and function abilities, and there may be ads placed on your website. You will get a sub domain with a free website, instead of a domain. In other words, instead of yourspace.com, you will get yourspace.freesite.com. Why does that make a difference? First of all, everyone has come to recognize these sites as free websites and they will assume that they are inferior. Most importantly, these free websites will not generally get the respect of the search engines. Your free website will not get much traffic from the search engines. So, get yourself a web host.;
, Create the website with Wordpress. Wordpress is a great program to make websites and blogs, and it comes with your web hosting plan. Wordpress is a new breed of website creators known as "CMS", or "Content Management Systems". These web creators require no HTML or any other programming language. Most of the design elements of the website are controlled by an intuitive menu, or icons.
 Plug in the content. The bottom line here is that you can create a very professional looking website that will generate traffic, without having to learn any programming languages. Instead, you can work on the content of your website. That is the two steps to creating your own website. Instead of needing professional help and paying thousands, you can create your own website in a short time, and pay as little as forty dollars or less. Your website can be as professional looking as any you've seen, and if you wish, this website could very well become a source of income for you.
 Wordpress takes care of some of the SEO work automatically. It broadcasts every addition you make to your website and Google search is known to like WordPress websites.

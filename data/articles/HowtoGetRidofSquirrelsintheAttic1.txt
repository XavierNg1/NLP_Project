 Patch up holes and cover spaces that are wide enough for a squirrel to get through.


Place a chimney cap or wire mesh fencing over your chimney. (Note UK domestic regulations apply to chimney terminal guards. Please seek advice of compitant persons.)
Cover any vents with wire mesh fencing.
Patch up all chewed-out holes leading to the outside of the home, except for one. You will need at least one hole to fashion an exit for the squirrels, but this hole must be covered a couple of weeks after the problem stops.
Also make sure to secure any openings between the attic and the rest of your home. A panic-stricken squirrel may find its way further into your home if it senses that the attic is no longer a welcome place.;
, Create a funnel out of a sheet of metal or fine wire mesh. Attach this funnel to the remaining hole in your attic and direct the narrow end outside. (UK regulations state no combustible materials to be introduced into the chimney, seek advice of compitant persons)


The wide end of the funnel should be placed over the hole on the outside of your home. It should be roughly 12 to 15 inches (30.5 to 38 cm) wide.
Make sure that the funnel is about 1 foot (30.5 cm) long.
The narrow end of the funnel should extend out and should be roughly as wide as the hold in the woodwork, if not slightly smaller.
A squirrel that finds its way out of this funnel will usually be unable to find its way back in.
 Make the space outside the funnel appealing by placing food, like peanuts or apple slices, near the narrow mouth of the funnel.


This may not be necessary since squirrels will likely leave the area on their own to gather food. Placing a food source nearby may encourage them to evacuate sooner, however.

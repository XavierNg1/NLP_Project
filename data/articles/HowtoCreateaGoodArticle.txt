 Writing about topics that are relevant to your interests is always a good start, and makes the article more accurate. Write about something that inspires you, or that you like to do.;
, The mechanics are very important when it comes to writing an article that people want to read. Please, for the sake of the sanity of Grammar Nazis everywhere, write carefully.
 "What's that?" you may ask. Elevated diction means, simply put, the "big words." Flaunting a wide vocabulary is acceptable in most articles and topics.
 Use descriptive terms and phrases to further explain what you're instructing them to do. Your audience can't read your mind, so when you say, "put the thingy in the metal hot box," they have no idea what you mean. Instead, say, "carefully place the bread in the toaster," or something to that effect.
 Writing articles about something you're totally unfamiliar with is pointless. Why would you tell someone how to solve a Rubik's cube if you don't even know what that is? Likewise, don't write an article on how to crochet a model of the Eiffel tower if you can't figure out how to tie your shoes.
 Don't make the article about how much you hate cats, or what kind of personalities you can't stand. Make it an honest instructional article about how to complete a task.
 Less is more- nobody will read the introduction if it's longer than the constitution, so keep it minimal. Inform the reader of what topics the article covers, and be done with it. Keep it down to about five sentences or less.

 Since your avocado is open and vulnerable to the world, keep it from turning brown and too mushy with an acidic agent like lemon juice. You want it to ripen, not ruin.
 Place the two halves back together and wrap it in plastic wrap as if it were whole. Place it in the refrigerator.


If you don't have plastic wrap, use an airtight, resealable container.
 The length of time it needs to ripen all depends on how far along your avocado was in the process. Take it out and prod it -- when it becomes soft and seems edible, give it a taste test. If it's not quite there, put it back in.

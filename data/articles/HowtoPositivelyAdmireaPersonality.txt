 Always know that when you take someone to be your role model you are trying to be like him/her. So if you choose some casual, ordinary person, there won't be much benefit. Find a person who is known to the world for his/her great contributions or marvelous achievements in a particular area.;
, This is a very important thing because if you admire someone who has nothing to do with an area that you are not interested in, it isn't worth a while. Find and admire someone who has awesome achievements in a particular area in which you want to show your talents in.
 Make sure you don't follow EVERYTHING that's written in an autobiography because it deals with even negative situations the person went through.
 This is where you learn completely about the particular person who have shone in an area you prefer. Carefully observe his/her vast achievements and also you can take down some in your personal diary.
 This is vital because anyone can simply admire somebody but to admire someone perfectly and positively needs work. So always be ready to answer a question like this. Basically the answer could be that he /she made vast achievements in some field you are interested in and helped you create a foundation to your dreams.
 You must admire this only one person not a bunch of persons. If you admire many at a time, it reduces the efficiency rate of what you are doing plus admiring many persons at a time is rather difficult.

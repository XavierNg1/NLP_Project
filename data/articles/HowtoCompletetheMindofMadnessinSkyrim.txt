 He will be wandering around the streets of Solitude, and request your help once you find him.;
, He will hand you a hip bone and direct you to the Blue Palace's Pelagius Wing.
 They can be convinced to offer you a key to the Pelagius Wing. Alternatively, if you've already helped Falk Firebeard, you can ask him for a key.
 Upon reaching a lighted corridor, a loading screen will occur and you will find yourself in Pelagius's mind.
 He will give you the Wabbajack, a powerful (and chaotic) Daedric Artifact.
 They do not have to be done in any particular order, and are as follows:


Approach the arena and shoot the two men at Pelagius's sides in order to cure him of paranoia. The atronachs fighting in the center of the arena are merely a distraction; you do not have to hit them.
Approach the sleeping Pelagius and shoot him and whatever monster appears afterward - repeat until he awakens, in order to cure him of night terrors. There's no need to shoot what the monsters are transformed into.
Approach the brawling attitudes of Pelagius and shoot Confidence twice to enlarge him, whilst also shooting his attackers, in order to cure him of anger issues. This may take awhile to get right.
 He will then allow you to leave.
 If desired, mess around with the Wabbajack as a reward for completing the quest.

 Use a handheld mixer or a food processor with a whisk attachment. It will make things much easier. You can use a whisk or a wooden spoon in a pinch.


For a less sweet buttercream, use salted butter.;
, Beat it into the butter until it is smooth. Adding the sugar a little bit at a time gives the butter enough time to absorb it. This gives you a smoother texture.


If you are using a handheld mixer, start at a slow speed. This will keep the sugar from flying out everywhere.To make the texture even smoother, sift the sugar first. This will break up any clumps.
 The vanilla extract will give the buttercream a slight ivory color. If you prefer pure white buttercream, use a clear vanilla flavor or extract instead.


To give your buttercream color, add in a bit of icing coloring. Using the gel kind instead of the liquid kind will mix easier into the buttercream ., It will take about three minutes. There should be no streaks, swirls, or clumps.


If you are using a handheld mixer, you can increase the speed to a higher one once the sugar is mixed in.
 This will depend on your preferences. If the buttercream is too thin , add in some more sugar. If the buttercream is too thick, add in some more milk. Start with a tablespoon or two at a time, mix, and add more as needed.

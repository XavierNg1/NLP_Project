 Fill a cup or bowl with water. Add a handful of fenugreek seeds to the water, and allow them to soak for six hours to overnight.For the best results, use distilled or filtered water.
 After the seeds have soaked for several hours, drain the water. Place the seeds in a seed or coffee grinder, and grind them until they form a coarse paste.If you don’t have a seed or coffee grinder, you can create the paste in a blender.
 Add the fenugreek paste that you’ve created to a bowl with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice. Stir with a spoon until the ingredients are fully blended.For best results, use fresh lemon juice. However, you can use a bottled version as long as it’s pure juice.
 Once the mask is mixed, carefully smooth it over your scalp. Pay careful attention to the areas where you’re prone to dandruff. Leave it on for 10 to 30 minutes.Lemon juice can be very drying on your hair. If your hair is extremely dry or damaged, only leave the mask on 10 minutes.
 When you’re ready to remove the mask, wash it off with warm water. Use your usual shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair as usual.Use the mask once a week to help control dandruff.

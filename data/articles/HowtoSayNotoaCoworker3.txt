 One reason you might want to say no to a coworker is because their request is unethical. Perhaps a coworker has fallen behind on a project and they want you to cut a few corners to get the project in on time. Whatever the reason, if it is going to break rules, it’s OK to say no.Other unethical requests include asking you to do more than your share on a project, to cover up their failure to perform a task, or to keep silent about an issue you know is wrong.
 Another reason you may say no to a coworker is because they want your help when you are trying to focus on another project. In this case, saying no makes sense, and it is easy to offer your help at another time when you aren’t working on this project.You may need to say no permanently if you are working on prioritizing projects and this coworker keeps asking you to work on things outside your immediate job description.
 Before saying no to a reasonable request by a coworker, make sure that you can’t help them. It is embarrassing to say no because you didn’t think about it and then decide that you can help them after all. Take your time looking at your schedule and weighing the pros and cons before answering your coworker.

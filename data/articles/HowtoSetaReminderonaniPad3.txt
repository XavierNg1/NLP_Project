 Open the Reminders app by tapping it. After touching the Reminders heading, you should see an option to create a new list.
 You can also give lists different colors to make them easier to recognize. Tap Done when you're finished naming your list and optionally giving it a color.
 Tapping the paper lets you view all of the lists you've created. Tap the list to which you want to add reminders by tapping it.
 Creating a reminder in a list is as easy as tapping a blank line and typing in the list's name, date, time, and other relevant information.

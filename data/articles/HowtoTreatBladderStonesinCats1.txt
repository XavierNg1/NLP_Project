 Certain cat breeds, such as Himalayans, have a genetic predisposition toward developing mineral deposits in the bladder.But other factors can cause bladder stones in any breed.


A diet high in acidity or calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus may cause mineral buildup.Decreased water consumption may lead to the concentration of minerals in the bladder.A urinary tract infection may lead to bladder stones.Certain medications and supplements, including Lasix, Cortisone, Ascorbic Acid, Tetracycline, and Sulfa drugs, may cause bladder stones when used over prolonged periods of time if the cat has a genetic tendency to do so.;
, It is important to be alert for signs that your cat may have uroliths. Common signs to look for include:


Straining or distress when urinating (dysuria)Bloody urine (hematuria)Frequent urination in small quantitiesExcessive genital lickingUrinating in unusual places

, Your vet will be able to diagnose bladder stones, and may be able to determine how severe the blockage is in your cat.


Report any unusual behavior or problems you've noticed in your cat.
Your vet may take an X Ray or conduct other tests, such as palpating your cat's abdomen, checking its urine, or taking an ultrasonography test.

 You will be blow drying your hair straight, but curling it inward/outward. This will create that "flipped" look.


Consider spraying your hair with a heat protecting spray. This will help keep your hair from getting damaged while you blow dry it.;
, If you want to flip your hair inward, place the brush under your hair, and the hair dryer over it. If you want to flip your hair outward, place the brush over your hair, and the hair dryer under it. Your hair should always be sandwiched between the hair dryer and the brush.


Use a round, tube-shaped brush, not a paddle brush.
 Turn the hair dryer on, and start sliding both it and the hairbrush down towards the middle of your hair. Make sure that you slide both the brush and hair dryer down at the same time. Stop when you are half-way down the hair shaft.
 Twist the brush towards you if you want your hair to flip inward. If you want your hair to flip outward, switch the positions of the brush and the hair dryer: place the nozzle of the hair dryer under your hair, and the hairbrush over your hair. Twist the brush up and away from you as you slowly bring both down.
 Take a small section of hair and position the flat iron about half-way down. Start straightening your hair. Instead of bringing the iron straight down, however, rotate it inwards/outwards as you reach the ends of your hair.


Remember to use a heat protecting spray before using the flat iron. Flat irons get much hotter than a hair dryer and can cause more damage.

 Allow the vegetables to boil until softened, but not mushy - about 10 minutes.;
, If you are making them fresh, you need to, peel, chop, then boil the potatoes. Then mash them, with butter or similar. If you are lazy or prefer artificial food, then you can make instant mashed potatoes with 1 cup of potato flakes and some hot water (follow the box instructions). Add some ranch powder, or salt and pepper, to taste.
 Fry the bacon and crumble into fine pieces.
 You can add some shredded cheese on top if you like.
 You can also cook this with some truffle oil if you like. If you have rookworst, cook it according to the directions on the package (generally the same way).
 Enjoy!

 Lay your fabric on an ironing board. Gently iron out any folds or wrinkles. Once complete, lay out your fabric on a clean, large flat surface and smooth out the fabric., Measure and mark the length of the veil. Retrieve a pair of fabric scissors. Carefully cut the fabric to the desired length.


If you wish, you may round the bottom corners of the veil., Set your sewing machine to the largest stitch length.


Sew a straight line of stitches across the top of the veil (widthwise) approximately 1 inch from the top edge. Do not backstitch or cut the bobbin thread short, but leave a long tail.
Flatten the fabric.
Sew a second straight row of stitches approximately 1.5 inches down from the first row. Leave a long bobbin thread., Gather both of the bobbin threads in one of your hands. Lose hold onto the veil at the stitch lines in your other hand. Pull on the bobbin threads as you gently push the fabric together. Stop gathering the fabric once it has reached the length of your comb. Tie each of the bobbin threads in knots. Trim the excess thread and fabric above the top row of stitches., Grab your plastic or wire comb. Set it on a flat surface so that it curves up. Place the gathered edge of the veil on top of the combâ€”make sure that the side of the veil you want showing is facing up. Thread a needle. Stitch the veil to the comb by placing two to three stitches around each tooth of the comb. Cut off the needle and tie knots in the ends of the thread., The second tier of a two-piece veil is created in the same manner. The length is only difference between the two veils. If you are creating a second, separate tier, repeat the process listed above.

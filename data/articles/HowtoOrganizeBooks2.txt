 There are two primary cataloging systems: the Dewey Decimal Classification system (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification system (LCC). In 1876, Melvil Dewey developed the DDC system. Today, it is the most common cataloging system in the world. This system provides the perfect amount of details for small libraries and book collections. If you are looking for a system that generates a more detailed call number, consider using the LCC system. In 1891, the Library of Congress developed its own system of classification. In order to keep track of its enormous collection, it needed a system that was more specific than Dewey’s. The LLC system is used by major research libraries., The DDC system organizes books by main class, division, and section. Every call number also includes a Cutter Number to identify the author and the edition date.


Main Class: 800 (Literature)
Division: 10 (American Literature in English)
Section: 3.54 (American Fiction in English)
To get the call number, add up the three numbers: 800+10+3.54=813.
Following this number, you may add a Cutter Number to identify the author (the first letter of the author’s last name) and the edition date. When this information is added, the call number becomes: 813.54 M 2007., The LCC system catalogues books by class, subclass, and topic area. Every call number also includes a Cutter Number to identify the author, a Cutter Number to identify the title, the edition date.


Class: P (Language and Literature)
Subclass: R (English Literature)
Topic Area: 9199.3 (Provincial, Local, etc.)
Cutter Number, Author: M3855
Cutter Number, Title: L54
Edition Date: 2007
Additional Information: c.2
To construct the call number, list the components sequentially like so: PR9199.3.M3855.L54.2007.c.2.

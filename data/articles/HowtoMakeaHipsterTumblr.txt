  In this day and age, it is well known that hipsters like to be original, and will often criticize others for not being so. To help you combat this issue, it is great to start off by setting an appealing theme for both your online and mobile Tumblr.  Most hipster blogs have a theme that is hip, yet simple.  For example, a popular hipster Tumblr has a white background with cartoon-looking cacti all over it.  It's out of the box, but its cool because not many people have it.  It's the perfect example of a  theme for those aspiring hipsters out there.
  Nothing screams originality better than a witty tittle that makes your followers think, "wow, this person is super cool and I wish I was that creative."  The shorter the title, the better.  You want your followers to realize how hip and carefree you are, since hipsters are supposed to be original and apathetic.,  Many hipster blogs like to reblog pictures of random items that are weird, but unique.  A popular example is a picture of boxed water that says, "Boxed water is better."  Boxed water makes no sense, but since it's unique and differs from the norm, it's cool and hip.,  If you constantly reblog hipster pictures such as Urban Outfitters clothing and bands that the majority of the population doesn't know about, you will have a successful hipster Tumblr.,  Constantly reblog funny and/or apathetic text posts that your followers can relate to.  If they can relate to your posts, then they can relate to your blog and you will most likely gain followers.  Be creative in the sense that you reblog posts that are cool and fit the hipster aesthetic as it will make you Tumblr famous.

 When choosing your puppy from a litter, try to pick a moderately tempered dog and avoid extremes (too energetic, or too withdrawn and skittish). Look for puppies that are calm, but also curious and friendly. As a breed, Cocker Spaniels are enthusiastic, agreeable, and affectionate, so these qualities should be evident the puppies you interact with.Make sure to spend some one-on-one time with your potential new puppy to evaluate it away from the rest of the litter., Before bringing home your new puppy, you should make sure that it is old enough to be taken away from its mother and the rest of its litter. Puppies need at least 8 weeks with their canine family to grow, learn, and mature enough to their full potential. During this initial period they will learn social skills, be weaned from their mother, grow teeth, and start eating solid food., Consider adopting a Cocker Spaniel puppy instead of buying one- you’ll not only save a life, but you’ll gain a new pet at a lower cost than buying a puppy from a breeder. Contact dog rescue groups in your area for a referral to other rescue groups that deal with Cocker Spaniels. Local animal shelters and veterinarian offices may also be able to provide referrals.

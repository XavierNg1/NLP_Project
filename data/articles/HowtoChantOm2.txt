 Safety permitting, you can chant Om silently in just about any situation. For example, outside or at work. Sit comfortably and keep your body still. Relax your mind before you begin., Whereas chanting aloud is usually a long and premeditated practice, chanting mentally is typically short.For instance, you may chant Om for just two minutes while sitting inside your car in a parking space.Silently chant Om whenever you feel like you need peace and centering.
 Consider the situation you are in. For instance, if you are in a movie theater, you can move your mouth with the silent chant. If you’re in a board meeting, it’s advisable not to indicate with your facial expressions that you’re meditating.If you’re going to move your lips, open your mouth wide for the first two syllables. Then purse your lips together for the rest.To chant without physically forming the word, repeat the mantra silently to yourself. Don’t move your lips or tongue.

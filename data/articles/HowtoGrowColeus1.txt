 For best results, plant the seeds indoors, 8–10 weeks before the last frost is expected in your area.In a pinch, seeds can be started in late spring or summer, but may not grow as quickly or healthily., Keep a seed tray or small pots indoors, and fill them with seed starting soil or potting soil. Coleus thrives in rich, well-draining material, so mix in peat moss or a similar, loose gardening medium if the soil is dense.
 Spread the seeds onto the soil. Cover them with a thin, ⅛ inch (3 millimeter) layer of the same soil.Do not bury them in the soil, as they require light to germinate.
 Water the seeds lightly but frequently, so the soil remains moist without becoming soggy.If the plants are kept in an arid environment, cover the trays or pots with plastic wrap to prevent them drying out.To water seedlings in small pots, soak the pot in water. The water will work its way up into the soil. This is less disruptive to the young plants.
Remove the plastic wrap as soon as you see seedlings emerge.
 Keep the seed trays at 70º Fahrenheit (21.1º Celsius) at all times, in an area of bright, indirect sunlight., Remove the plastic wrap, if present, as soon as the seedlings emerge. After a seedling has grown its first, small "seed leaf" and two sets of adult leaves, it can be safely transplanted to its own pot, or directly into the soil.Refer to the instructions in the care section below to continue handling your coleus plant.

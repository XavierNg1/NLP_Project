 If you want to do more activities, you can try to strike a deal with your parents. Tell them that you will do something and ask if they might offer you something in return.Offer to do the activity or chore anyway. Even if your parents don’t agree to give you something in return, you can earn some credit with them that you can perhaps cash in later.
 If you’ve been grounded for something, don’t do it again. Show your parents that you learned your lesson and that you’ve grown from the experience.
 Go the extra step of avoiding past mistakes by doing the opposite. For example, if you were grounded because you were out past your curfew, make sure that you arrive home before your curfew for the first month after you’re finished with your punishment. If you got caught smoking, sign up for a cancer awareness 5K run. Show respect to your parents by being considerate, aware and responsible.
 If you would like to be able to do more things, you can offer to pay for them. If you have a part time job – even babysitting or dog-walking – you can demonstrate that you can handle more responsibility. Your parents will be impressed by your initiative and maturity, so long as you keep the job.
 Responsible people are able to compromise and they don’t throw a fit when they don’t get their way. Be content with what you’ve got and be prepared to give a little to get a little.

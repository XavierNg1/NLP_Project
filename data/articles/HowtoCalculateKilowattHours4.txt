 Also called a watt meter or kilowatt meter, this device measures the actual power your appliance uses. This is typically more accurate than using the appliance's label info.


If you're familiar with electrician's tools, you may be able to use a multimeter instead. This requires access to the appliance's wiring while it is plugged in. Needless to say, don't disassemble anything unless you know what you're doing.
 Plug the power meter into the wall. Plug the appliance into the power meter.
 Set your power meter to display kilowatt hours. As long as you keep the power meter connected, it should calculate the total kilowatt hours of the attached appliance.


If your power meter only measures watts, you can use the method above to calculate kilowatt hours from that measurement.
Refer to the power meter instructions if you're not sure how to change its settings.
 The longer you leave the power meter plugged in, the more accurate its calculation will be.
 The kilowatt hours displayed on the meter is a running total from the time the device was plugged in. You can multiply this number to estimate your kWh over a longer time period.


For example, let's say the meter has been running for 5 days, and you want to find the 30-day estimate. 30 divided by 5 is 6, so multiply the kWh displayed by 6.

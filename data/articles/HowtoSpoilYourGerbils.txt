 Pet stores will often sell things that are labeled as "Premium Gerbil Food," but look at the ingredients. You don't want berries or too many sunflower seeds in it (Some are good, but too many will make them overweight).;
, Do not buy your gerbils wheels that have normal serrated edges. Their tails can get caught in them and be amputated! Try buying them a Silent Spinner wheel, several paper towel rolls (you can buy these at pet stores) or Pop-Up houses, one or two wooden houses or the new all-natural Hay and Honey house (These are at pet stores. Do not give them plastic as they can chew it up and ingest it - causing their intestines to get plugged up!), lots of Timothy hay, and several wooden blocks (for them to chew on).
 The more room you have, the more stuff you can put in it and the more comfortable your gerbils will be. Be careful though, if it's too big, gerbils will start acting territorial and fight.
 In addition, you are going to want to buy some kind of treat stand for your gerbils. Try a little marble block about one square inch in size to put their fresh fruit, veggies, and nuts on.
 Your gerbils will love to take baths in it and it will make their fur into something to be proud of.
 Put some CareFresh bedding in there along with your exercise equipment, water bottle, bathhouse, huts, food dish, etc. Put a large amount of timothy hay in the corner. This will act as a "safe spot" for when your gerbils come home. NOTE: Make sure you do this before you go out and buy your gerbils.
, Look at other gerbil guides to find out which can and cannot be used or research on the internet. Make sure that their treats do not exceed 10% of their diet and that you take them out after six hours (they can stay in for more than twenty but your gerbils don't deserve old treats). Make little designs with the treats you give them. Try making some of your own recipes, naming them, and presenting them in a way that is good enough for only your babies.

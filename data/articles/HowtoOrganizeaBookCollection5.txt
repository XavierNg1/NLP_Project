 Take a look at what books are currently sitting on your desk.


What sorts of books do you consider necessary for a desk book collection? Usually it will be books you need to reach for almost every time you're at your desk, such as dictionaries, reference manuals, computer troubleshooting manuals, guides for writing, editing or calculating, books that are currently important for an essay/report/book you're preparing, etc. Books that are not likely to be as necessary could include manuals you'd check no more than once every few months, novels you're meaning to get around to reading and books that are more interesting than what you're supposed to be getting on with! Remove anything that isn't in frequent use or is serving as a distraction.
 The basic rule of books on a desk is to keep them to a minimum. The desk is an area for papers, the computer and spreading out open books that are in use. Anything else is extraneous and risks getting in the way, especially with a small desk.


Ideas for shelves on or near desks include: a small portable shelf that can be picked up by hand with the books still on it; books held upright between portable bookends; shelving hanging above the desk on the wall; or simply leaning books up against the wall if the desk sits against a wall.
 Put the most used as near to your reach as possible, and the lesser used but still useful ones can be placed further away from where you're seated. Keep it simple.


Get into the habit of always returning books to their proper shelves after using. Books piling up on a desk can demotivate you from getting back to study or work and isn't very organized.

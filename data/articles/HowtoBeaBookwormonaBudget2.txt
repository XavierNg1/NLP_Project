 You can find many free books to download or read in your web browser. For self-published works (mostly fiction), try rednovels.com, BookRix, Wattpad, Smashwords, or forum.ucweb.com. Find classic books on gutenberg.org, or "check out" copyrighted works from the Internet Archive's Open Library.


Gutenberg only hosts books that are legal to download in the United States. A few related projects such as gutenberg.ca (for Canada) provide works focused on other countries (in both cultural and copyright terms).
You'll need (free) Adobe E-reader software or a similar alternative to read some books.
 The Overdrive app for iOS and Android lets you "check out" items from your library's digital collections. As long as you have a library account, this can be a great free source of audiobooks and video as well as eBooks.
 Check eBook stores regularly for limited time deals. If you are a frequent purchaser, explore websites that collect deals and cheap books for you to browse, such as BookBub, Pauper's Book Club, Booktastik, or BookHub.
 Some publishers sell digital copies much cheaper than the physical version. Legal free copies are sometimes available as well, if the copyright has expired.


Warning: if the book is still under copyright, most free online pdfs are illegal to download. Copyright laws vary by country.
 Although it takes some initial investment, an e-reader can be cost-effective in the long run. Some e-readers offer a subscription service, where you pay a certain amount each month to gain access to hundreds of titles. If you're an eBook fan, this could rapidly make up for the initial cost.


You can often find used e-readers for under $30 online.
Paying for an Amazon Prime account may get you access to one free eBook each month.

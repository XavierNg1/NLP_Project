 Set aside a small, stainless steel saucepan. Using a liquid measuring cup, measure Â¼ cup of water. Pour the water into the saucepan. It is important to use a liquid measuring cup, as dry measuring cups can vary significantly from their liquid counterparts., Use a dry measuring cup to measure 1 cup of sugar. Use a knife to level off any excess sugar on the top of the measuring cup. Then take your fingers and sprinkle the sugar evenly across the surface of the saucepan.
 Turn your stove burner on medium-high heat. Cook the sugar mixture over medium-high heat for eight to fifteen minutes. Swirl the sugar mixture occasionally while cooking. Hold the handle of the saucepan and make a swirling motion. This will ensure the mixture cooks evenly.Do not stir the sugar mixture as it cooks, as this will create unwanted sugar crystals.
 The sugar mixture should be done after cooking for eight to fifteen minutes over medium-high heat. You will know the sugar mixture is done when the sugar is dissolved and the mixture has turned into a pale, golden syrup with a consistency similar to honey. Once your mixture reaches this consistency, immediately remove from the heat and turn off the burner.
 After removing the saucepan from the burner, place it in the bowl of ice water for five minutes. This will cool the sugar syrup and stop it from cooking. Remove the saucepan from the ice water after five minutes. Place it on the baking sheet your prepared earlier.
 It is important that you let the sugar syrup rest for at least two to three minutes after you remove it from the bowl of ice water. Allow the sugar syrup to rest until it forms thin threads.
 Dip a fork in the syrup. Slowly lift the fork from the syrup. If it forms a thin thread, your syrup is ready. If it forms droplets, it is not ready. Allow your syrup to cool for an additional two to three minutes if it forms droplets, and then test again.

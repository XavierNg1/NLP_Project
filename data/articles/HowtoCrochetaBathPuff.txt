The exact gauge for this project does not matter.
This demonstration uses a two ounce ball of four-ply, worsted weight yarn and an H/8 or 5.0mm hook. The result is a ball about 5" in diameter.
The diameter increases more slowly, the more you crochet. Be prepared to use at least one full ball of yarn.;

The exact number of stitches does not matter much. You may start this project with any start you usually use to crochet in the round, and with any number of stitches that seems comfortable.
 Don't worry if the first ring or two doesn't look like much.

Go ahead and join rounds. There's no need to count stitches in this pattern.


The circumference doubles with each subsequent row, because you are crocheting two stitches per stitch. As the circle gets bigger, the circumference gets much bigger.
Add as many rows and as much yarn as you wish. Each subsequent row will take twice as long to crochet, but it will also make the puff curlier.
The puff will become progressively more curly, the longer you crochet. It could go further still, but it will require more and more yarn.

 This might be a food bank, or it might be a larger organization. Larger cities often have a centralized food charity that distributes food to a number of smaller organizations.If your industry donation is small, you may go with a smaller charity.
If you will have a lot to donate on a regular basis, contact the largest local charity you can. They will be the most likely to be able to accommodate your donation without it going to waste.
 Be clear and specific about what you are trying to donate. Don’t exaggerate or underestimate. For example, if you will have 100 US quarts (95,000 ml) of mustard to donate each week, say so. You might be afraid that the charity will not be interested, but you need to be truthful about the donation. Otherwise they may be stuck with something they can’t give away.It’s always good to ask about what a charity can use. You may be surprised by the kinds of things they’re looking for.
 If your donation is large enough, the charity may be willing to come pick the donation up. If they can, make sure everything is clean and organized when they arrive. If the process is a hassle for them, it may discourage them from picking up food in the future.If you deliver the food to the charity, make sure it’s delivered in a manageable form. For example, a food bank with a small staff may not be able to deal with ten pallets of 50lb. bags of potatoes before they go bad.
 Charities will almost always write you a receipt without you asking for it. However, don’t forget to take one and save it. If the charity is federally recognized as a non-profit organization, your donation can be deducted from your business' taxes for the year.

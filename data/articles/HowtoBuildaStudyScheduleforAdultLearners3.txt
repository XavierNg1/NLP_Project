 Ask yourself:


Have you forgotten anything?
Are you giving yourself travel time?
Are you being realistic about your study times?
Are there small breaks between items where you could plan to do small amounts of study, for example, you could plan to review your notes during the half-hour between between one class and travel to pick up your kids or can you study while waiting on your child to finish a practice if you have materials with you (using digital materials can make this easier to do). Mark "Study ____" at those times.



Copy all your fixed, daily living, recreation times, and study times into this calendar for the duration of the college term.
Some students find it helpful to color code certain items to help them remember, for example you might highlight the short study times you've identified between major activities, so that they jump out when you look at the calendar.

Be sure to know when your final exam is planned. Many schools hold finals at a different day and time than class meetings, so do not miss adding the correct day and time for all finals.



Will you need to plan extra time in the weeks leading up to that assignment or exam to prepare for it?
Working backward from the due date, decide when you need to begin and what you need to do in order to meet the due date, for example add "research" times three weeks before a paper is due.
Add these items to your calendar.

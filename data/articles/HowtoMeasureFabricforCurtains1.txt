 Windows come in many different sizes. Because of this, there is no "standard" length and height. Use a metal tape measure to measure from one side of your window to the other. This is the window's width. Next, measure the window from top to bottom. This is its height.;
, You will likely need to add a few inches to your window's measurements, but this varies based on a few factors:


In general, curtains extend four inches below the window. If you would like that style of curtain, simply add four inches to the finished height. However, if you would like floor-length curtains, you must measure the distance from the window to the floor. Subtract one inch from this number and add the difference to the finished height.
If you are mounting curtains inside the window frame, measure down to Â½ inch above the sill.
 If you plan to mount the rod inside the window frame, you do not need to add any measurements. If you are mounting the rod outside the window frame, select a location and adjust the width and height to match.


How far on either side do you wish your curtains to extend? Curtains generally go about four inches beyond the window on either side, meaning you will need to add eight inches in total to the finished width. However, if you want your curtains to match the curtain rod's length, measure that to get the finished width instead., If you have a fairly wide window, it's practical to make curtains that are two or more panels to cover the finished width instead of one long continuous piece of fabric. Divide the finished width by this number. Ideally, your chosen fabric will have a cut width equal to your desired panel widths. You can work with a shorter cut, but you will have extra sewing and cutting to do.

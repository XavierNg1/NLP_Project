 There are many different styles of shirtdresses out there and finding the one that accentuates your skin tone and body shape is vital to wearing it to advantage. Make sure to get a second opinion before buying your shirtdress.;
, Wearing the right clothing on your legs is just as important as finding the right shirt for your body. Shirtdresses look great with leggings, skinny jeans, or jeggings. Most shirtdresses will be versatile and can be doubled up. However, it is important that you try your shirtdress(es) with multiple styles to see which looks best with what.
 Like everything, you need the right footwear to pull off the shirtdress. Running and skater shoes, rubber boots, clogs, flip flops, and sandals are definite no-nos. However, a pair of ballet flats, boots (any style, as long as they match your outfit), or heels can look fantastic. Like the bottoms, one pair of shoes will go with a variety of styles but it is still very important that you try them out first with your shirtdress and bottoms for the best results.
 Accessories such as belts, necklaces and scarves can do wonders to a plain shirtdress and bottoms. If your shirtdress is not fitted (i.e. baby doll or just a bigger shirt), a belt can really pull it all together. A tasteful bit of jewelry or a matching scarf can also look nice.
 Sometimes wearing a shirtdress may feel awkward or weird as it is a style that not everyone chooses, though it can be quite trendy. There are also many critics of this style, particularly when paired with leggings. However, as long as you feel good in and about your new outfit, there is no reason for you not to wear it with confidence. When you go out in your shirtdress, remember that you are unique and beautiful, as is this amazing outfit that you have put together. Give it the final accessory of a smile and show your outfit off with confidence.

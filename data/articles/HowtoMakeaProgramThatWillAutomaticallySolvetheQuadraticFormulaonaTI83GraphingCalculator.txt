 This is pretty straightforward.;
, This will open the "Program" section of your calculator.
 Once in here click on Create New.
 Give it a suitable name, for this example, QUAD will suffice.
 To do this, hit the PRGM button again. Switch to I/C and select Prompt. After prompt, enter the letters A,B,C, all separated by a comma (the comma is right above the number 7 on the calculator). Press Enter to start the second line.
 For this line, a lot of math will be involved, so pay close attention to what you type and make sure it matches the picture. Hit the PRGM button again, and again move to I/C, only this time, select Disp. After you select Disp, type in (-B+√((B^2) -4AC))/(2A).
 This line is extremely similar to the one before, with one small change. Hit the PRGM button again, and again move to I/C, this time, select Disp. Type in (-B-√((B^2) -4AC))/(2A).
 This will save the program and allow you to execute it when you choose.
 Now, whenever you find an equation that requires the quadratic formula, simply input the values for A, B, and C where directed and enjoy your answers!

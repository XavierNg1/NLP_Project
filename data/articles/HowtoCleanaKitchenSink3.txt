 If you don’t have a dishwasher, it can be easy to let dishes go for a day or two (or longer). Letting dishes sit around, whether in the sink or in the dishwasher, can spread harmful bacteria at a rapid rate.If you can’t get to them immediately, let them soak to ease the process when you get to them, but try to limit it to an overnight soak., This will ensure that any gunk immediately in the drain will wash away before it solidifies, making it harder to remove later. Alternate between using very hot tap water and boiling water. This will also prevent odors from forming., Mix 1 cup each of water and white vinegar or apple cider vinegar along with juice from half of a lemon to help cut away grease and ward off harmful bacteria. Instead of lemon, try using 20-40 drops of a lemon-based essential oil (or other oils with similar properties, such as tea tree, orange, or lavender).Keep this on hand to spray down your sink after you finish washing dishes.

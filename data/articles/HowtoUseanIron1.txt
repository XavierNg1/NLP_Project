 Check the tags for ironing instructions. If the tags don't tell you which setting to put your iron, then look to see if they indicate what material the fabric is made of. Many irons order their settings by the type of material: e.g. wool, cotton, polyester.;
, Use an ironing board, if possible. If you don't have access to an ironing board, then use a flat, sturdy surface like a table or a counter. The ironing board is designed to absorb heat and moisture without taking damage. Make sure that you don't iron on a highly flammable surface.
 If your iron features a steam function, then you may need to add water. Look for a large, detachable water chamber on the top of the tool. Add filtered water nearly to the brim.








Make sure that you use filtered water! This may help you avoid calcium build-up in your iron, which could clog the steam spouts.
 Arrange the item of clothing so that it lies perfectly flat on the board. Make sure that there are no wrinkles! If you iron over a wrinkle, then you will press a creased line into the fabric.

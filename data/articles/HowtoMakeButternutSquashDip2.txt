 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. You could also use aluminum foil. Ensure that the shiny side of the foil is facing up.Consider using a rimmed baking sheet so the pieces of squash don't slide off when you're transferring them to the oven.
 If you're using a whole butternut squash, wash it and peel it. Cut the squash into large cubes that are about the same size. You should end up with 2 1/2 cups (350 g) of cubed butternut squash. Place the cubes in a mixing bowl and toss them together with:3 tablespoons of olive oil
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder

, Transfer the seasoned squash to the prepared baking sheet and spread the pieces so they're evenly distributed on the pan. Bake the butternut squash for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the sheet from the oven and use a spatula to toss the pieces. Return the pan to the oven and let the squash bake for another 15 minutes.The squash should be completely tender once it's finished cooking. If you poke it with a knife, the blade should go in easily.
 Transfer the squash and any oil from the pan to a food processor or blender. Add one pinch of ground nutmeg and 11 ounces (310 g) of room temperature goat cheese. Put the lid on the food processor and blend the mixture until it's completely smooth. Taste the dip and add more salt and pepper according to your taste.While you can use cold goat cheese in the recipe, it may make the dip lumpy if your food processor can't blend them out.
 Turn the oven down to 350 degrees F (176 C). Scoop the dip into a baking dish and spread it evenly. Bake the butternut squash goat cheese dip for 20 to 25 minutes. Once you take the dip out of the oven, it should be completely hot and creamy. Stir the dip and top it with:An extra drizzle of olive oil
3 tablespoons of freshly chopped herbs (like oregano, basil, cilantro, parsley, or sage)

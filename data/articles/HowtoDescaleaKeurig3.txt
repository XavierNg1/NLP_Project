 You will need 1 to 2 tablespoons of citric acid per 4 cups (1 liter) of water. You can find citric acid in the canning department of grocery stores. It may also be labeled as "sour soda" instead. Stir with a spoon to mix the citric acid into the water.


If you are using a smaller, single-cup brewer, such as a K10 Mini Plus or a K130 Brewer, consider using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of liquid citric acid instead.
 The citric acid will dissolve any lime scale build-up inside your machine.
 Make sure the cup matches the brew size so that you do not get any spills. You can also use a larger cup.
 The citric acid will flow into the Keurig and dissolve any build-up inside.
 Keep repeating until the reservoir is empty.


If you are using a small brewer, such as the K10 Mini Plus or a K130 Brewer, then turn it off just as it begins to brew and let it sit for 30 minutes.
 Once the reservoir is empty, take it out of the Keurig and refill it using cool water. Put it back into the Keurig once it is full. The machine will still have some citric acid inside, so you will need to flush it out. If you don't, you will get a bad taste the next time you try to brew coffee.
 After you brew a cup of hot water, pour the water into the sink and replace the mug beneath the dispenser.


If you are using a small brewer, such as the K10 Mini Plus or a K130 Brewer, then you will need to run the water through it about six times.

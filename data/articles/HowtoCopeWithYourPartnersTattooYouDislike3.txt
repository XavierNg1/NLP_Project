 Once you and your partner have talked openly and honestly about the tattoo, you need to respect that this is not your body and therefore not your decision. You may not like the tattoo, but if you want to remain in a relationship with your partner, then it is a good idea to accept the fact that you have no control over what your partner puts on their body.You can always offer your opinion, but the ultimate decision is up to your partner about whether or not to get a tattoo.
 You may decide that you dislike tattoos so much that you can no longer be in a relationship with your partner. In some instances, the best way for you to cope is to leave the relationship. For example, if your partner got a tattoo that you found offensive, you may decide that you cannot be in a relationship with that person anymore. Try asking yourself some questions to determine your feelings for this person:


“What was it that initially attracted me to my partner? Is that attraction still there, or has it changed now because of the tattoo? Why?”
“What is the true root cause of my concerns with the tattoo?”
“What emotions am I feeling that are associated with the tattoo? Why am I feeling these emotions? Are the emotions actually attached to the tattoo, or the fact that my partner made the decision without talking to me?”
“Is the root cause of my emotions/concerns something that I can control or manage through healthy coping skills? Is it something that may need to be address with a counseling professional? Or is this something I am able to resolve on my own?”

, You may be able to cope best with the tattoo if you are able to find something you like about it. For instance, maybe it is small and not that noticeable so you can learn to live with it. Or maybe the tattoo is in a non-visible location and is predominantly hidden by clothes. Try and find something positive about the tattoo to help you cope.


As time goes on you will likely get used to the tattoo.

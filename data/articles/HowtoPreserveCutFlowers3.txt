 Crush up two over-the-counter aspirin with a spoon in a bowl. Once they are crushed, put the dust in the water that your flowers are in, then add a penny to the water.

The aspirin works to increase the water's acidity, which helps water absorption.Asprin has been shown to increase the life of freshly cut carnations., While unproven, the sugar in the soda should provide the energy your flowers need while the bleach should control bacteria. Add one cup of lemon-lime soda, such as 7Up, one cup of water, and a 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of household bleach to the vase that is housing your flowers.You should still replace the water every couple of days when using homemade remedies.

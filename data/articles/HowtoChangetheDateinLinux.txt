 In most of the Debian based Linux distros, the terminal (or console) can be opened by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T. If this fails, Search for "Console", "Terminal" or "Konsole" in your search box, which is usually located in the launcher.;
, Type date into the terminal to check your current system date. The date command will print your current system date.
 To set a new date and time, you need to write it in the format DD MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS. In the format given:


DD is the new date's day in two digits. For example, if the day is 8, DD must be 08.
MMM is the first three letters of the month. For example, if the month is April, MMM must be APR.
YYYY is the year. For example, if the year is 2015, YYYY must be 2015.
HH:MM:SS will set the time. HH is the hour, MM is the minute and SS is the second.
For example, the date 8 April 2015 (Time 1PM) could be reformatted into 08 APR 2015 13:00:00


, Now, use the command date -s"DD MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS" to set your new date. Replace the text DD MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS with the date you have formatted in the previous step (including double quotes).

 With the subject's arm hanging straight down, hold the pin of the goniometer directly over the shoulder joint along the outside of the arm. Both goniometer arms should point down.
 Instruct the subject to lift his or her arm straight out and upward, raising it as high as possible without causing pain. Once the arm reaches its highest point, extend the movable goniometer arm out to match the position of the subject's arm.


Note that the stationary goniometer arm should continue pointing downward and the pin should remain positioned over the shoulder joint.
Read the rotation degrees on the center dial of the goniometer. The correct reading should lie directly beneath the center line of the movable arm.

The average for this measurement is 170 degrees, but the full range exists between 0 and 180 degrees.
 Instruct the subject to move his or her arm straight back and upward, lifting it as far as possible without feeling pain. At the top of the arm's rotation, position the movable goniometer arm so that it matches the placement of the subject's arm.


As before, the stationary goniometer arm should point down and the pin should remain over the shoulder joint.
Read the rotation degrees on the center dial, looking directly beneath the center line of the movable arm.

The full range exists between 0 and 90 degrees, but the average measurement is 50 degrees.

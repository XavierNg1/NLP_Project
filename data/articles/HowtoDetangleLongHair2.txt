 Use your fingers to gently separate your hair into sections. Consider creating one part down the center of your head and another horizontally across your head. This will make four smaller sections. Doing this will make locating knots easier and detangling more manageable., Gently pin the sections in place with clips. If clips aren’t available, you can use a scrunchy or gentle, loose hair tie.
 Using a wide toothed comb, gently comb the hair, beginning at the ends. Start with only an inch or two. Slowly work your way up to the major knot or tangles. Once you’ve arrived at a major tangle, use your fingers to gently pull the hair in various directions. This will enlarge the hair loops within the knot.


When combining, counteract the force of the pulling by holding your hair on the knot itself. This will also keep the knot from getting tighter.
 Using the same comb, slowly and gently pick away at the knot and tangle. Always start from the base of the tangle and apply light pressure.


Angle the comb so you are only using one or two teeth of the instrument. Do not try to comb through the entire knot right away.
 Rushing the process will only increase the chances of pulling out hair unnecessarily. If you rush, you could also create a more complex knot which will become a greater challenge to remove. Depending on the difficulty, it may take several minutes per tangle., Once you’ve removed tangles, you can begin to introduce more teeth into the combing process. Once you can completely comb through the entire length of your hair easily, move on to the next section., Continue the process of slowly combining and removing knots in each section. Once the entire head is tangle free, comb through all the hair at once.


If you were unsuccessful, you may have to cut the knot out with scissors. Strongly consider enlisting the help of a professional. They will have techniques to minimize hair loss.

 While some cheeses do contain excessive fats and calories, cheese can be beneficial to your diet by providing plenty of healthy proteins. When planning your diet, rather than avoiding cheese altogether, look for cheese that provides plenty of proteins. High-protein cheeses include: cottage cheese (26 grams per cup), sharp cheddar cheese (7 grams per ounce), and part-skim mozzarella cheese (8 grams per ounce).It won’t hurt to count grams of protein in the cheeses that you eat each day. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, women should consume at least 46 grams of protein daily, while men should consume at least 56 grams., Your diet should contain frequent servings of high-calcium cheese, as dairy foods are one of the best means of consuming sufficient calcium. Calcium benefits your body in multiple ways, including improved bone density. Studies have shown that individuals who receive their calcium from cheese—rather than dietary supplements—experience healthier bone mass.Provolone is an example of a high-calcium cheese. A 1-ounce serving of provolone contains 21% of your daily recommended calcium.When selecting a cheese for your sandwich, choose provolone over other popular options like cheddar or mozzarella.
 Although cheese is often a fatty dietary additive, it has been shown to benefit the heart when eaten in moderation. A 2016 study demonstrated that eating an ounce of cheese daily diminishes the risk of stroke. Eating a serving of cheese daily may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.Daily servings of cheese have been shown to bring other health benefits. These include lowering levels of bad cholesterol and potentially predicting longer life in moderate cheese consumers.

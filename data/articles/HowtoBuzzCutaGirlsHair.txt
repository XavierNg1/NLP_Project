 Chances are this is going to take a while so might as well be comfy. Use a towel or purchase a cape to use to avoid getting hair on yourself.;
, most hair clippers come with plastic guards that vary in length. the higher the number the longer the hair will be left. Of course if your after the military look use no guard and it will be 0 length. Best advice work down from the longest to the shortest until you find what you like. but traditionally a buzz cut is no longer that 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).(also if you have really long hair, it's easier to cut most of it off in a ponytail first!)

, Start with the biggest guard, start in the back and slowly work the clippers up the nape of your neck. work around to the sides,then from front to back on top. Always go over twice to make sure all of your hair is cut.

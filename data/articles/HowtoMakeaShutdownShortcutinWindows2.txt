 Right-click on your desktop. Hover the cursor over "New" and click "Shortcut" on the next menu that appears.
 Copy and paste the following into the text field: shutdown.exe -s


To create a restart shortcut, replace "-s" with "-r" ("shutdown.exe -r").
 Without changing any settings, the shutdown shortcut will shut down the computer after 30 seconds. To change the timer, add "-t XXX" to the end of the command. XXX represents the number of seconds delay you want prior to shutdown. For example: shutdown.exe -s -t 45 will create a shortcut that shuts down after 45 seconds.


To add a "goodbye" message, type -c "your message" (including the quotation marks) at the end.
 Click "Finish" when done.
 If youâ€™d rather have a custom icon instead of the default Program icon that Windows assigns, right-click the shortcut and choose "Properties". In the Shortcut tab, click the Change Icon button. Choose an appropriate icon and then press OK to confirm.
 You'll see a window counting down and your message will be shown. Once the timer runs out, all your programs will start to close and Windows will shut down.

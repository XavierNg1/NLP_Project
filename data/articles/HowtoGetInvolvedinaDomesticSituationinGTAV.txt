 The couple’s house is located at 3587 Wild Oats Dr. When you arrive, a blue dot on your minimap will indicate that the random event has been triggered. If you don’t see it, return at another time or come back as another character.;
, During a short scene, you will witness the couple arguing as the woman throws her husband’s belongings out of a window. If you wait nearby in a vehicle, the man will approach you, ask for a ride, then get into your vehicle.


Don’t fire any weapons, as doing so will cause the random event to end., To take him to the golf course, which is nearby, follow your minimap navigation. If you do this, he will reward you with $80 and will be unlocked as a potential golfing partner. If you are playing as Trevor and would rather take him to the cultists, open your map via the Pause menu, then find the Altruist Cult icon and set it as your waypoint. When you arrive, the cultists will take the man and pay you $1000.


Taking him to the Altruist Cult will contribute to another random event, which only takes place once Trevor has dropped people off there four times. This potential random event results in gaining around $100,000.
Some of the people Trevor can take to the cultists would give him a much better reward otherwise. Since this man only rewards you with $80, taking him to the cultists is a good option.If the man dies at any point during the trip, you will fail the random event.

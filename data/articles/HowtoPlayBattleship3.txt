 Draw four boxes on the graph paper, each one 10 squares wide and 10 squares long. Have each of the two players take two boxes, labeling one "my ships" and the other "enemy ships.", Hide the box labeled "my ships" from the other player, and draw a thick outline of five ships anywhere within its boundaries. Each ship is one square wide, and ranges in length:


Draw one ship five squares long (the aircraft carrier)
Draw one ship four squares long (the battleship)
Draw two ships three squares long (the cruiser and the submarine)
Draw one ship two squares long (the destroyer)

, Use the instructions above to play an ordinary game of Battleship. Instead of using pegs, draw successful hits with Xs and misses with dots, or use any system of symbols you find easy to understand. Use the box labeled "enemy ships" to keep track of the shots you've taken, and the box labeled "my ships" to keep track of your enemy's shots.

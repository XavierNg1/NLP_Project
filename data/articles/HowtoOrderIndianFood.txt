, It might be the Korma that you fancy, or the Jalfrezi or Vindaloo. Maybe you want a Naan Bread or Poppadom side order? Take your pick from a range of delicious foods. If you don't know what the dishes are and the menu does not describe them, ask the restaurant staff when you call.
 Be sure to give them your phone number plus your address. They will deliver the food to you. Specify if you want the food spicy, "hot" "medium" or "mild." If you ask for it "hot" and you are not accustomed to Indian food, it may be too hot and spicy to eat.
 Remember to tip the delivery person. Take your food inside.

Iron at the fold line.
 If appearance or exactness is important to you, you must baste twice., This step is an article in itself. The keys points are:

The thread tension and stitch length - match it the rest of the pants by practicing on some scrap material.
Follow the steps of sewing exactly on the wax pencil line and double basting. You will be sewing two layers, the feed dog will be moving the bottom layer and the tension of the presser foot keeps the upper layer still, bind the two layers together by basting on both sides of the stitch line.
Sew smoothly and evenly by feeding the material exactly the same throughout the sewing process.

Save the excess fabric, that you cut, from hemming., If you did not use a zig zag and used the regular stitch instead, cover the cut edges with fabric glue.

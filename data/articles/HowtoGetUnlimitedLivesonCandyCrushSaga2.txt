 This trick will only work if you are down to your last life, so make sure you're paying attention!


It is not possible to get unlimited lives in the Facebook version, as everything is run from King's servers. Any site claiming to provide unlimited lives is a scam.
 When you are down to your last life, open up Candy Crush in another tab in your browser. Keep both tabs open, and don't start playing on the second tab yet.
 If you lose your last life in the first tab, you can switch to the second tab for one more go.

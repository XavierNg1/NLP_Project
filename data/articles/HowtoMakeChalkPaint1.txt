 Thick sidewalk chalk works the best for this. You can also use regular chalk, like the kind teachers use on chalkboards. If you want something more vibrant, you could try soft chalk pastels (not the oil kind).


This method creates a washable sidewalk chalk. It will not work on furniture or DIY chalkboards.;
, The easiest way to do this would be with a food grater.If you don't have any graters on hand, place the chalk into a plastic bag, then smash it with a hammer until it is fine and powdery.


If you are using a food grater, make sure it's not one that you actually cook with. Use a separate one.
 Pour the powdered chalk into a plastic container. Stir in up to Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of water.If you used regular chalk or a chalk pastel, try 1/4 to 1/3 cup (60 to cc milliliters) instead.


Plastic food containers and clean, empty yogurt containers work great for this.
If the paint is too thin, add some more chalk. If the paint is too thick, add in a little bit more water.
 Dip a paintbrush into the paint, then draw designs on the sidewalk or driveway. Let the paint dry, then marvel in your artwork. To clean up the sidewalk or driveway, simply wash it down with water.

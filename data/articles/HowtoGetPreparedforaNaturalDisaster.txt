 It should include the following:



Clean drinking water. The most import part of your survival, store 1 gallon (3.8Â L) of water for each person per day. Keep it in Jerry cans or water jugs and write "Drinking Water" on the side of these containers with a permanent marker. Add four drops of Clorox per gallon to keep the water good for years.






Food. Military-style MRE's (Meals Ready to Eat) are an excellent choice.






Complete first-aid kit along with any medications needed.






A survival knife is the most important and useful tool in the kit. Be sure to keep it sharp.






Self defense weapon. Mace spray is a good economic choice, although a Taser or pistol works just as well. Keep in mind that if you choose mace, it does expire and will need to be replaced occasionally.






Waterproof and windproof matches.






Waterproof LED flashlight.






Battery or crank powered radio.







Whistle for signaling for help.






Batteries for any electronic equipment.

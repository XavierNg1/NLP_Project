 Approach a group of three or more people who are involved in a conversation. Hang around the outer edge of the group and listen to what they’re saying., While someone is talking about something of interest, ask them to elaborate a bit. For instance, if the speaker is telling a story about traveling down the Mekong River, you might interject with a question like, “Is the water deep?” or “Did you go with a group or were you alone?”The best questions will show the speaker that you’re interested in what they’re saying, and will enable them to talk more about their experience.
 If someone in the group is sharing a story that you can relate to, or discussing an experience similar to your own, listen attentively. After they’ve concluded, share your own feelings or tell a related story. For instance, if someone is talking about their trip to the Eiffel Tower, you could jump in by saying, “Ah, yes, did you go to the top? The view is amazing.”

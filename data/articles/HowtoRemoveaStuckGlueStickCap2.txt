 A cup of water should be enough.
 Wait for the water to stop moving and making sizzling sounds. This is to ensure that the glue stick will not melt as soon as you place it into the boiling water.
 Place the cap end of the glue stick into the bowl and wait 30 seconds.
 Check to see if the glue residue has melted.
 If the cap still remains on the glue stick, leave the glue stick in the water for longer at a higher temperature.
 Do this before the glue residue hardens again.

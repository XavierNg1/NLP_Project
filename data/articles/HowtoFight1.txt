 If there are no rules in your fight, then your only goal should be to win. If you just want to win a fight, then you don't have to follow Fighting Etiquette 101 -- just try to get your opponent to be hurt, crippled, or to fall to the ground, giving you enough time to get away. Here are some ways to do it:Knee your opponent in the groin. This is guaranteed to stop him in his tracks.
Low-kick your opponent in the groin, knee, or abdomen. Kick him using the bottom of your foot. Just make sure to do it quickly and to stay on balance -- you can easily be thrown off your game while you're kicking.;
, The face is another highly vulnerable place to attack. Hurting your opponent's eyes, nose, and face can be a great way to cause great pain and to slow down your opponent tremendously. Here are some methods to try:Headbutt your opponent's face. Use your forehead to slam your opponent across his nose. This can break his nose if you do it the right way.
Poke his eyes with your fingers. This can cause excruciating pain and can blind and disorient your opponent for enough time for you to escape or cause more damage.
Punch him in the nose. This is a highly-effective place to cause some serious damage.
 Hitting your opponent's neck and face is guaranteed to stop him cold, if only for a short period of time. If you really want to cause some harm, try these indelicate moves:Punch your opponent in the back of the neck to make him black out temporarily.
Punch your opponent in the middle of his throat to cause damage to his airway.

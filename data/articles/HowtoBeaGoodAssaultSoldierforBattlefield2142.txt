 The Krylov is a more powerful version of the Voss and it has a better reputation. The SCAR is known as the BS gun. It is the default cousin to the Baur. Many people believe it can't kill, but it is quite powerful if you know how to use it (Semi-automatic).;
, The heavy assault has the Baur, the Herzog shotgun, Airburst rockets, and the Netbat helmet. The medics have the advanced medical hub, smoke grenades, the defibrillator, and the Voss (although everyone's first unlock should be the fragmentation grenades or the defibrillator).
, If you are the medic, try to get the rockets; they are extremely useful. They can easily take down a low flying gunship or a Fav.

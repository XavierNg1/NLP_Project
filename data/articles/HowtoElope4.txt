 Still with low-key or no fuss and small budget expenditure in mind, find a suitable way to draw in the people who really matter for a small celebration after the fact. Some examples of what you might do include:


Host a backyard barbecue to celebrate the nuptials with those in your lives, surprising them with the announcement on napkins, signs or during a special toast.
Plan an intimate dinner party or cocktail gathering to announce your marriage.
Have a trusted friend plan a housewarming or money tree “come-and-go” that family and friends can attend to celebrate your new marriage.
Go for a game of golf or bowls with your family and friends, and have a picnic or easy lunch included.
 If you are inviting people who felt very let down by your elopement, there is a benefit in waiting before celebrating. A few possibilities include:


Consider waiting until it's time for a baby. You can celebrate both your baby's arrival and your wedding, by which time a lot of hurt will have mellowed and people will be more receptive (they can always make the excuse they're there for the baby).
If you don't plan on having children, waiting for an anniversary might be another option––time does heal, especially when the two of you are still clearly very much together.

 If you’re obsessed with a crunchy crust, consider baking the pizza on a skillet. Place a cast-iron skillet over medium heat until the pan gets hot. Place one or two slices of microwaved pizza on the skillet using tongs. After about thirty seconds to a minute, use the tongs to lift the pizza and check the bottom.Cook until it’s as crispy as you like it.


Don’t crowd the pan. If you put too many slices of pizza in the pan at once, the crust won’t crisp evenly.
If you want a crunchier finish, melt half a tablespoon of butter in the pan before heating up the pizza. This will add a buttery, deliciously flaky finish to the bottom crust., If you use a waffle iron to reheat your pizza, you can skip the microwave and oven entirely. First rearrange the toppings on the pizza. They should be clustered together in the upper left corner of the pizza slice near the crust. Then, fold the pizza. Bring the bottom point up to the top left corner and press the pizza to make a fold. Finally, press your pizza into a pre-heated waffle iron and cook for about five minutes, continually checking for doneness.If you have small pizza pieces or a large waffle iron you don’t need to fold the pizza or rearrange the toppings. Instead, sandwich two pizza pieces together and press them in the waffle iron.
 Fresh ingredients such as basil leaves and sliced mozzarella are excellent additions to any pizza. Also consider adding some traditional pizza toppings such as olives, anchovies, and sliced bell peppers. Finally, try experimenting. Add leftovers such as diced chicken or taco meat to the top of your pizza for a fun twist.


If you don’t want to add new ingredients, consider using a dipping sauce such as ranch or bleu cheese dressing to spice up your leftovers.

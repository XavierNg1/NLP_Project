 Chances are your rabbit will want to rule the house. While you can’t expect the kind of submission you can get from a dog, you must have the respect of your rabbit in order to train it.


The most common way rabbits try to assert dominance is inappropriate nipping or biting you to try to herd you or get you to leave your sitting place. If this occurs, let out a short, loud, high-pitched squeal and either put your rabbit down on the floor (if it has jumped up where you’re sitting) or pick it up and move it out of the way from you (if it is on the floor already). Do this firmly, but gently. You don’t want to hurt your rabbit or make it fear you, you simply want to assert that you are in charge. If your rabbit continues the behavior, put it in its crate for a “time-out.”

, First, approach your rabbit calmly so you do not elicit a fear response from the rabbit. Hang out on the floor with your rabbit. Have some treats on the floor. Reward the rabbit for coming closer to you. Leave your hand down. If the rabbit comes up to you and does not seem afraid or does not try to bite you, try to gently stroke the rabbit's head for just a few seconds.


If you do not back down and avoid the reflex to “run away” if the bunny charges you, the rabbit will learn that this behavior does not work to intimidate you.Never hit the rabbit. You and your hands are the sources of food and pleasure, like petting on top of the rabbit’s head.
If you are afraid of being injured, wear long pants, shoes, long sleeves and gloves if necessary to protect yourself from bites., A change in your rabbit’s behavior, including aggression, should be investigated to eliminate the chance that there is a medical issue causing the problem.Consult with a veterinarian familiar with rabbits to rule out pain, for instance, as a cause for misbehavior.


Hormones can also influence bunny behavior and having your rabbit spayed or neutered may help decrease territorial aggression, for instance.

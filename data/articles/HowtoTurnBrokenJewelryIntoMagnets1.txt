 Even though you may have a piece that is precious it may not be large enough to make a singular statement. You could group smaller pieces together to make one large magnet or use the smaller pieces for another project.;
, You want whole pieces that may have broken off a chain or hook but are still in good condition. Avoid using cracked or shattered pieces as they may be too delicate for everyday use.
 For example, you wonâ€™t want to turn a broken ruby ring into a magnet so be sure you separate the extremely valuable pieces from the rest.
 Especially if the jewelry sat in a jewelry box for some time, it may have tarnished or could use a good polishing. Determine if it's a job you can do on your own with simply jewelry cleaner or if a professional should attempt to clean it.
 You want the item to be a singular piece that makes a statement on its own. Use a pair of pliers or even scissors to remove any other hooks or pins before using.

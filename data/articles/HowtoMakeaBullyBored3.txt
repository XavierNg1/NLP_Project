They will intervene and help you, especially if you have witnesses or evidence to show the bullying., If things do not improve with your bully after involving other adults in your life, for safety purposes, you might need to involve the police.

However, don’t feel embarrassed if you do have to contact the authorities in the end. Remember that you are not the one in the wrong, and you have a fundamental right to feel safe when you leave your home or are online.

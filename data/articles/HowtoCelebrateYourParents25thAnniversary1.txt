 One way you can celebrate your parents’ anniversary is to throw a big party for them. You may send out invitations to family, friends, and loved ones to join you in celebrating your parent’s love. Use your home as the venue for the party or rent out a hall so there is enough space for everyone to attend.You may ask your siblings to help you plan the party, especially if there are going to be many guests in attendance. Elements like food, drinks, chairs, and table settings will all need to be arranged for the party.
Consider if you are going to surprise your parents with the big party or involve them in the planning of the party. You may opt for a surprise party if your parents enjoy surprises and involve them if they are not as into being surprised.
You and your siblings may also share the hosting duties, taking turns introducing family members or loved ones who want to give speeches or toasts in honor of your parents. You may create a loose schedule for the party so there is a mix of speeches and fun moments throughout the event to celebrate your parents’ marriage.;
, If you would prefer to keep the celebration small, you may plan an intimate gathering in honor of your parents. Having a smaller gathering may be more your parents’ style. If you are trying to plan an event on short notice, a small party with five to ten guests may be easier for you to arrange.You may host a cocktail party at your house or a sibling’s house to celebrate your parents, complete with snacks and fancy drinks. Or you may plan a small dinner with close family and friends at a restaurant that your parents like.
Decide if the gathering will be a surprise for your parents to celebrate their love. If you do not want to make it a surprise, you may involve your parents in the planning of the event.
 You can make the event feel more special and celebratory by having a theme for the party.

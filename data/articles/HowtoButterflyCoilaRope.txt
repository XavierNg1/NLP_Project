 Find the half point of the rope and fold the entire thing evenly in half. This is done so that once the rope is coiled, you can use the two free ends as shoulder straps. It can be time consuming, but you won't spend as much time coiling later on. You can skip doubling the rope and still follow these steps, but in the end you will have only one strap and will need to improvise when securing it to your body., Grab both ends of the rope and measure 1 1/2 - 2 arms' length (the distance between your hands when you hold them out straight sideways). Let this section hang loose so far, as it will be used later to complete the coil.,, When you are holding the rope up, one end will be the short loose end that you set aside earlier, and the other end will be the long one that needs to be coiled.






Grab the long end with the opposite hand (without letting go of the rope you're already holding).






Measure out your arm's length and put that length behind your neck, never letting go of the rope you grabbed.






Repeat this process, alternating hands because every time you coil the rope, you'll be bringing the long end to the opposite side. You'll find more and more rope accumulating in each hand, which could make this task difficult if you have small hands and a long length of thick rope.
 Fold it in half by putting your hand in the center (where your neck was) and letting the ends hang loose., Don't remove your hand from the fold because you will need it there for the next step., Pass the free ends through this loop and tighten. This cinches the rope together securely., Then bring one loose end over each shoulder as carrying straps, like a backpack is carried.,,

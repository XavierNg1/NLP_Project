 These two factors will help you decide the exact quantity needed for the entire project. Once you decide on the material to be used, you will be able to ascertain the budget of the raw materials. Let this total cost be ‘A’.;
, Contact your fabricator and get a quote according to the material, quality, and the job to be performed. The supplier will provide a quote based on the number of sheets to be fabricated, the equipment to be used, the skill set required for the job, and the time taken to fabricate the sheets. Let this total cost be ‘B’.
 The shipping costs either will have to be borne by you, or will be factored into your entire fabrication and raw material cost. It is important to determine the cost that the supplier and manufacturer are charging you. If you think this is excessive, you can choose to outsource the shipping to a different service provider. Let this total cost be ‘C’.
 For example, you might have to pay extra for quality certificates. Let this total cost be ‘D’.
 Calculate your overall cost by adding the estimations worked out in Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, and Step 4. Therefore, Total Cost = A + B + C + D.
 This step applies if you are acting as a supplier yourself and the final product will be sold to a third party.Decide on your profit percentage. Calculate the exact profit of your total cost. For example: If you decide that your profit percentage should be 20% of your overall cost and your overall cost is $1000.Then, profit is (20 ÷ 100) × 1000 = $200. Therefore, your total cost, after factoring in your profit will be = Overall Cost + Profit Which is: 1000 + 200 = 1200Therefore, your overall cost would be $1200.

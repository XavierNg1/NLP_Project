 If the ham is not already sliced, you will need to make marks in the top of the ham before putting it in the slow cooker. Use a sharp knife to cut a grid or diamond pattern on the top of the ham. You should only cut 1/4 inch deep into the ham.This will allow the glaze to reach deep inside the meat.
 The glaze will both flavor the ham and keep it moist. You can use the glaze as a baste as well. Brown sugar, maple, pineapple, cloves, and honey are all popular ingredients in ham glazes. Some recipes you can use for a glaze include:



Maple Brown Sugar: 1 cup dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup pure maple syrupPineapple: 3/4 cup pineapple juice, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup Dijon mustard, 1/3 cup whole grain mustardHoney Mustard: 1/2 cup brown sugar,1/2 cup honey, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, If you want a thicker glaze, you can heat the glaze in a sauce pan on the stove. Keep the heat slow, and heat the glaze until the sugar dissolves. Stir as you heat to prevent the glaze from sticking to the bottom of the pan., The glaze can be added either before you start heating the ham or thirty minutes before the ham stops cooking.A glaze added sooner will impart more flavor the ham, but it may become thin and runny during cooking. A glaze added towards the end will sit at the top of the ham, but it will be thicker. Decide what your preference is, and add the glaze at the appropriate time.
 Once the ham is done cooking, place it under the broiler for between five and seven minutes. This will caramelize the glaze. Keep an eye on the ham as it is below the broiler to prevent burning or overheating.


If you don’t want to use the broiler, you can also place the ham inside an oven heated to 425 °F (218 °C) for eight minutes.

 People with IBS have good days and bad days. One way to be there for them is to check in with them. See how they are doing and whether you can be of any assistance. You might try asking:“How was your day?”
“What do you feel like doing today?”
How is your new diet working?”

, If they become hospitalized, remember to pay them a visit. Bring flowers and remind them that they are not their condition. At this time, it is especially important to communicate your care and support.


Tell them: “I care so much about you. I will be here when you get out to help you get settled back into your apartment. It might take some time, but you can definitely get over the worst of this and get back to your normal life.”

, If they have a lot of trouble at work because of their IBS, remember to listen to their stories and be there for them. Work life can be especially difficult for people with IBS and they may not have people who listen to them or understand their experience at work. So it is important to offer an attentive and empathetic ear.You might try asking:


"How did your meeting go this afternoon?"
"How are things going at the office?"
"Do you get any home work days with your new job?"

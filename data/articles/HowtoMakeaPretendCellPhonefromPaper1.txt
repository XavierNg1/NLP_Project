 The paper should be in the shape of a cell phone (this means that you cut it so that the phone is as small or as large as you would like the play cell phone to be).;
, Make sure that they fit on the colored paper pieces just cut, with a small gap in between. Make the top white square smaller than the bottom one. This piece forms the screen and the bottom forms the keyboard.
 Make a grid on the big piece of white paper that is two lines down and three lines across. This is your keypad. Now fill in the grid with numbers so that they look like this: 2abc, 3def, 4ghi, 5jkl, etc. Each square should have one number and three letters of the alphabet in alphabetical order inside.
 In the gap between the screens, draw a little circle; this is going to be your Home button. You may also like to draw a couple of other buttons around this, depending what model of a phone you want

, For example, you may want to draw up a "background" with "apps." Really, this is where you can get creative! Draw your dream phone and what you want on it!

, To extend its lifespan, the toy cell phone can be covered in clear book covering laminate or you could paint Mod Podge or craft glue over it to form a sealant layer.
 Once the phone is made, it can be played with.

 Someone who's lying may unintentionally try to distance themselves from the words they use. Instead of using the words ‘I’ or ‘me,’ they might overuse ‘they,’ ‘we,’ or ‘theirs.’ This is an indication that the person subconsciously wants to separate from the lie., If the person is using phrases like, “To tell you the truth,” or “I honestly,” they may be lying. Unless these are normal idioms that the person uses, this affirmation of the truth can be a sign they are actually lying. It is an attempt to convince you, and themselves, of the lie., Liars tend to talk more. They will use extra words to keep you distracted from what they are actually saying. They think this allows them to get by with the lie.For example, if someone says “I went out to the park on the far side of town to take a nice relaxing walk,” instead of “I took a walk in the park,” they may be lying about their whereabouts.
 If the story is unbelievable, that could be a clear sign of a lie. Also, if the story seems to have small details that don’t add up, it may be fabricated. These inconsistencies are a sign of an underdeveloped lie., If the person is telling you needless specifics, they may be trying to convince you of the richness of the truth. Unless the person is usually verbose, they may be trying to fill in gaps with unrelated data. It also shows that they have put a great deal of thought into the story.In practiced liars, the opposite can be true. They may only offer the very bare bones of the story. Keep in mind that only about four percent of people are talented liars.

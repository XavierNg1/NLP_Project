 Allow the program to load completely.;
, After iTunes has finished opening, pop your CD into the computer. Wait a few seconds for iTunes to recognize the CD. If your computer is connected to the Internet, iTunes will look up the CD information online and supply it inside the program. If not, the program may prompt you to connect to the Internet or ask you if you want to skip the step.


The information that is included if you are connected to the internet includes the album name, artist, song titles, composer information, and album artwork.
 A dialog box should pop up, asking you if you want to import the CD. Click "Yes" if you want to import all the songs from the CD into your library. If you only want to import certain songs, click "No" and manually uncheck the boxes of the songs you do not want to import. When finished, click on the "Import CD" button in the lower right corner of the screen.


iTunes may give you a second dialogue box with options for importing the songs. The default options should already be selected, but you can change the import settings at this point if you want.
 The program will show you the progress of each song as it imports it in a loading bar at the top of the screen. Depending on the length of the CD you are importing, this process will last anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour. When the CD is finished being imported, iTunes will give a small tone/beep to alert you.
 View your music library in iTunes and scroll down to the location of your imported CD. Check to make sure that all album info was imported along with the music files. If they were not, you can manually add them by right clicking a song or selection of songs, and clicking the ‘get info’ button on the menu.

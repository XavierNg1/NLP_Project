 Try to get name brand clothing. However, name brands aren't everything and now is a great time to realize that an astute shopper can buy very affordable quality items by knowing that fabric and stitching quality are important things to focus on, not the label alone.


Avoid clothing that can be easily identified as cheap.;
, They should be comfortable, well made and long-lasting. Spending a little more on a quality shoe can keep your feet in good condition for the year and the shoes will last longer.
 Stay fresh by using deodorant. Brush your teeth twice a day and brush your hair, too. Keep your hair well brushed. Have a bath or shower every day.
 That should do the trick for makeup. Too much makeup can make you look like a clown and spoil your dewy young skin that doesn't need a drop of makeup. Even lip gloss isn't essential, so if you don't want it, that's fine.
 Be nice and appreciate them. Try to compliment others. Telling a person their hair looks good or you like their shoes will make them happy and want to hang out with you more.


Dont be self-centered, remember other people have feelings too.
 Be polite, thoughtful and funny. Complaining all the time or being a gossip will scare people off. Be a cheerful sort of person, but realistic and helpful too.


Don't swear or act inappropriately. Do not put anyone down, even if they make you angry.
Don't act too hyper as it can make people feel uncomfortable. Have an even and mild manner most of the time, although it's fine to be excited sometimes.
 This will make things easiest for you at school and others will respect your ability to get work done well.
 Choose a sport or two that you enjoy and become involved in it regularly.
 Doing both won't classify you as a nerd or an athlete. It will help people too see you as diverse and easy to be around. You can do more than one thing, you adapt.

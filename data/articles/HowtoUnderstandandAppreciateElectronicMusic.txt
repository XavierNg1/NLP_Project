 To generalize trance or house as "techno" is like generalizing death metal as "rock". Be willing to listen to new music and search "What is electronic music?" In the broadest sense, any music incorporating electronic elements ("instruments", samples, synthesis, effects) can be considered electronic. Most popular music today could meet this definition.;
, Electronic music commonly uses drum machines, samples (sound clips), and/or synthesizers and effects processors.
 Tempo (song speed) is often measured in Beats Per Minute (BPM), and electronic music songs may vary widely in BPM.

 This gets the blood pumping and prepares the players both physically and mentally for the session. There are many ways you can achieve this:


Get them to run some laps. This doesn't require much supervision or guidance, so you can set up drills for the rest of the session at the same time. And you don't even need cones!
Another fun way to get them warmed up is games like 'Stuck in the mud'.;
, This helps stretch out the joint to reduce the risk of injury and it means they are still moving about, so they don't get cold.

This also gives them a short rest after the pulse raiser.



This could include simple passing between pairs or getting them to line up and take turns shooting on goal, with or without a goalkeeper.



Divide the kids into teams, of as equal ability as possible.
Play games where they have to work together as a team to achieve a goal, for example reaching a certain number of passes without losing possession.

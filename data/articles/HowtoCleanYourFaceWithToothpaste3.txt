 Toothpaste does contain ingredients that can help dry out spots, but you can buy products that are specifically designed to work on your spots without causing the kind of irritation that the other ingredients in toothpaste can cause. Rather than using toothpaste, try an over-the-counter acne cream or gel to tackle excess oil.


In particular, you should consider treatments that contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as the active ingredient.You can buy these products at your local pharmacy or drug store.
Having a good skin care routine is a better way to help prevent spots and have clear skin, than experimenting with home remedies.
 If you are having consistent problems with your skin and have been unable to find an over-the-counter treatment that works for you, you can make an appointment to see your doctor or dermatologist. These experts will be able to closely asses your skin and give you advice about what treatments are most suited to your skin-type.You may be given a prescription for a topical treatment and/or some medication to take orally.
Commonly prescribed topical treatments include retinoids, antibiotics and dapsone.
You may also be prescribed antibiotics to take orally., If you are still keen to try a home remedy to help you get clear skin, tea tee oil is one of the best things to use. Tea tree oil is often used in skin care products, but can be bought individually from a drug store or pharmacy. There is research which suggests that tea tree oil can be as effective as benzoyl peroxide when used as a topical treatment for acne.Gently dabbing tea tree oil with a q-tip onto a spot is likely to be more effective than toothpaste.
There will also be less potential for negative side effects and skin irritation.

 Bubbles look beautiful when the sun highlights their rainbow colors, so it's best to blow them outdoors. Blowing bubbles inside the house is usually not a good idea, since bursting bubbles make a mess that's difficult to clean, especially if they're made with sugar or food coloring. Plan to blow your bubbles in an open space, like your backyard or in a park.
 Whether you're using a store-bought bubble kit or you made your own solution and blower, the technique for blowing small bubbles is the same:









Dip the part of the wand containing a hole, whether it's a circle or another shape, in the bubble solution. You'll see a thin membrane of solution stretched over the hole.
Hold it up to your mouth and gently blow.
The membrane will form a bubble and detach from your wand to float away in the breeze. Blow faster to make lots of tiny bubbles. Blow slower to make bigger bubbles!

, Pour a few inches of bubble solution into a shallow tray. Lay your giant bubble wand in the solution, then gently lift it up. You should see a thin membrane of swirling bubble solution stretched across the wand. Gently wave the wand through the air so that the solution membrane begins to stretch out behind the wand. Eventually the membrane will form a giant, undulating bubble.









Try walking quickly or running with the wand to make an even bigger bubble.
Hold the wand high above your head so the bubble has more time to float around before it hits the ground and bursts.
 Invent some fun and imaginative games to play with your bubbles. Have a contest for who can blow the most bubbles, whose bubble is the biggest, who can pop the most bubbles, and whose bubbles last the longest.

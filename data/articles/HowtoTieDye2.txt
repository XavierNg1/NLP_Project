 An advantage of knotting your tie dye is that you can tie as many knots as you want. This is especially useful for long strips of fabric. Dyeing knotted fabric creates a design where fine lines of white, like the irregular shape of cracked glass, run throughout your dye colors in random directions., Hold each end of your fabric in your hands so the length of it is stretched between. Then twist each hand in opposite directions in a wringing motion. Continue twisting until the fabric cannot be twisted any more., You might want a large, central knot at the center of your fabric to create a focal point in your design. You could also tie many knots to create a series of burst-like points throughout your fabric.Be careful while twisting and knotting your fabric. You'll want it to be tight, but knotting it too tightly can cause the fabric to rip or warp.
 After you tie each knot, pull it tight. Hold the tightened knot with one hand to keep it from loosening. Then, with your free hand, reinforce each knot by looping rubber bands over them.

 This is a good place to start. Determine what world your story will take place in. Is it a our world? Our world with a few changes, or perhaps 3000 years ago? A fantasy world with no humans at all, or a world with humans, elves, orcs and demons? This decision will have a major impact on the life of your wolves.


Currently, wolves are scarce in most parts of the world and human hunters pose a major threat – something you can use in your story to create conflict and tragedy. Perhaps you will want to write the story of a wolf set on taking revenge on humans for what they have done to the wolf species.
In a fantasy world, humans may have such powerful magical skills that they need not fear wolves in the dark winter night. Or the wolves are magical or perhaps even have wings. How might this impact the relationship between wolves and humans?

, Determine how sentient the wolves in your fiction will be. Do they have clear thoughts and speak of the past and the future, just like we humans do? Or are their thoughts without words, but rather full of scents, images and basic urges like hunger?


If you are aiming for werewolf fiction – how does your werewolf character’s mind change when they transform? Are their minds the same, or does it change entirely? Is the mind of an un-shifted werewolf the same as a human?

, Take a minute to think about why you are going to write wolf fiction. Why are the characters in your story wolves? Why are they not humans, tigers or horses? What do you want to show or have said with your story, and how does having a wolf character help in conveying that message? Figure out what the wolf adds to the fiction.

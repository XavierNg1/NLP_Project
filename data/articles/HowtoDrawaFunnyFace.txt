 Long ovals usually work best, but play around with it and make it your own.;
, Big, small, long, short, wide, and skinny. Feel free to mix a couple together.
 I like round noses the best but others are okay. They could be square or even straight.
 Wide open smiling mouths with just the top row of teeth are the best. You could also make a wavy line to make them look sick. If your character is a bad guy make a mean mouth.
 Your ears should be about twice the size of the eyes. go with just one curved line inside it. Bald is usually my pick for hair but spiked is alright to.

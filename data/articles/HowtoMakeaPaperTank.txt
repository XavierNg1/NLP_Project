 You will end up with a rectangle piece of paper.


Before committing to a hard fold, make a soft fold to be sure it is properly placed.The larger the paper, the larger the tank.
If you are doing this for the first time, using a larger sheet of paper (at least 8.5 x11 inch) will make the process easier.You can also use origami paper.;
, You can discard the other half or save it to make another tank.
 With this fold you are making a long rectangle.
 Take one corner and fold diagonally to create a point. Unfold and repeat, folding the other side diagonally. When you unfold you will see the creases form an X. Repeat on the other end of the paper. 







, Push in the sides of the paper where you made the folds (the X at each end). The paper will fold in on itself and create a point. Do this on both ends of the paper. Both ends now have an arrow shape.
 Fold both of the long sides of the paper once inwards towards the center. Take the inside edge and fold once again outwards, creating a flap.
 Choose one end of the paper. Fold the ends of the arrow up and towards the middle. Leave a small gap in the center.
 The smooth side (without the folds visible) should be facing up.








Fold each end up.
The end with the larger point (which looks like an arrow) should rest on top of the smaller end.
 The larger (arrow) end will rest in the gap created when you folded the first part of the turret.
 Fold the points of the arrow under the turret points, locking them together to form the full turret.
 With your finger, gently unfold the flaps that are the wheels. Do this on both sides.
 Insert a straw into the narrowest end of the top.








You can also use a small piece of rolled up paper.
 If the gun falls out, you can use tape or glue to secure it.

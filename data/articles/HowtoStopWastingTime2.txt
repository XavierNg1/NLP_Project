 Now that you have a collection of steps to help you stay focused from Method 1, the repeat test is a great way to test how effectively you use them. Start by creating a spreadsheet or even simply drawing a form on a piece of paper or a whiteboard. Make one column with the hours in your day listed, and then make a wider column leaving space to the right of each hour., This test requires you to take a minute or two at the top of each hour to evaluate how you used the preceding hour.Set a timer if you need to ensure that you stop long enough to fill in the form.
 During your evaluation period, consider what you completed over the previous hour. This can be anything from an exercise routine to studying for a test to spending the hour in front of the television. Be honest with yourself regarding how you spent the hour.
 This is the step from which the test draws its name. Once you’ve taken stock of the hour, simply ask yourself if you’d repeat it.The question essentially seeks to make you ask yourself if you believe you spent the hour in a productive manner. You’re less likely to repeat the hour if the answer is no.
 Keeping a written record of the day to see how many hours you would repeat and how many you wouldn’t is also an effective motivational tool. Write a few words about what you did with the hour in the righthand column and as well as your repeatability evaluation., One of the drawbacks to the repeat test is that you can quickly fall into the habit of judging every hour by its overall utility. A class where the instructor doesn’t cover new material, an unproductive work meeting, and other parts of your day can start feeling like frustrating time wasters in themselves.Try to remember that you don’t have complete control over every hour of your day sometimes and that meeting an obligation—such as being present for the unproductive meeting—can still count as a necessary portion of your day.

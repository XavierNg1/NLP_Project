 Your teacher has just talked to you and you are crying. This is bad...especially if it is at the beginning of the day, because then you'll just have the worst day ever. You need to take a breath and dry your eyes. This time is about you. Ask if you may go to the restroom, if you need a few minutes to yourself.;
, The whole world does not need to know what just happened. That is your information and for you to know and them not to find out.
 Don't make excuses and DON'T try saying you didn't do it, because they might think you are lying. Just explain what happened and tell them that you are sorry. Let them know, even if you don't truly, that you understand why you are in trouble. Tell them--and be true to your word--that you will not let it happen again.
 Start by asking them how many detentions them and their spouse have ever gotten. Let them know that even Einstein got in trouble every here and there. You aren't the first good student to get in trouble, and you won't be the last.
 I understand I made a mistake. Would you please just let me explain what happened?"

, Talk in your big boy/girl voice, or else they will think you aren't ready to explain. Tell the full story--even your mistakes. Tell them what you told the teacher--about how you understand that you made a mistake and you promise you won't let it happen again.
 Depending on your school, you can do different things. If you can draw--great! See, you can already do something semi-fun, depending on the mood you are in that day! I would advise getting any homework you have for that day--and your textbooks. Then you could hang out with friends and chill after you serve your detention. Bring books also; at least two. If you finish all of your work and can't draw, you will want to read a good book.
 If you are not, that is a good way to have to serve another detention--and get grounded.

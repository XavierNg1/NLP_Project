 You can avoid a lot of problems by arranging a meeting with parents at the beginning of the season. Explain your coaching philosophy, your way of deciding which players spend the most time in the game, and any other policies you have. If parents know what to expect from the beginning, they’ll be less likely to get upset with you later.Type up a summary of your coaching policies for parents to take home after the meeting.
 As coach, your attitude has a big influence on the way parents feel about the sport and their child’s team. Make it clear to team parents that your goal is to help their kids improve their athletic skills and develop as people, not just win every game.When parents want to talk to you in overly competitive terms, redirect the conversation to something more positive. Say something like, “Yes, it’s too bad we lost, but I’m really proud of how Ava has been playing on defense lately. She’s really improved since the start of the season.”

, Parents are less likely to get upset with you if you make a point of communicating with them throughout the season. Make sure everyone has your contact information, and emphasize that team members and their parents shouldn’t hesitate to get in touch with you., If a parent raises their voice, threatens you, or otherwise fails to behave like an adult, don’t engage with them. It’s impossible to have a productive conversation with someone who is being unreasonable.Cut an angry parent off if you have to. Say something like, “I’m not going to talk to you if you keep shouting at me. Please calm down.”
If the parent refuses to calm down, tell them, “I think we should have this conversation another time when your emotions are under control.”

 This one may seem like common sense, but start an exercise plan. Cover everything you possibly can in your workouts. Don't switch off days for strength and cardio, you won't get those opportunities in Ranger School to pick what you feel like doing. Do EVERYTHING, and take the next day off. That way, you'll learn how to function and perform with pain, even though your other muscles are still sore and aching. With your exercise plan, don't leave any exercises out. You may not like doing sit-ups or you hate push-ups, but you're the United States Army's for the length of your contract. The Army can't make you do anything, but they can make you wish you did.;
, Start off relatively simple, but include a lot of different exercises. Such a list might include: push ups, squats, lunges and other calisthenic exercises.
 Try to get access to a pool. If you join a gym, make sure you can get access to the pool, because you will have to pass Water Confidence Tests.
, The recruiter can recommend books to study from.
 Just because you want to join a Special Operations force doesn't mean you can do 150 push-ups in a row. Take it easy, don't hurt yourself in a way that your muscle doesn't grow, and don't get discouraged.
 DON'T SIGN ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE.
 If you're positive about your decision, sign up, do the best you can on your entrance exam, and be a leader and a model soldier.

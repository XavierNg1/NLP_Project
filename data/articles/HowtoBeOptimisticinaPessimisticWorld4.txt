 As scary as the world can seem, it's easy to feel like things will never change and there's nothing you can do about it. But you can! Volunteer your time at an organization that supports the things you believe in. Feeling like you're actually helping make the world a better place is a good way to feel less pessimistic about the world.


Websites like VolunteerMatch.org, Idealist.org, and HandsOn Network are all good places to start when you're looking for a volunteer opportunity., The 24-hour news cycle can make it seem like bad things are happening all the time, and it can make the world seem like a pretty pessimistic place. If you're feeling down and overly pessimistic, try unplugging for the day: no internet, no social media, no phone. This can help you recharge and focus on the good things in your life.Going to the park (if it's nice outside) or a library (if it's not) and spending some time reading a book is a good way to unplug without getting bored. Getting lost in someone else's world for a while can help you feel less pessimistic.
Playing a game with your friends - football, a board game, cards - is a good way to entertain yourself without relying on electronics.
 Practicing self care basically means making sure you take good care of yourself and plan some "me" time. When the world feels particularly pessimistic, it's so easy to focus on the bad and forget to take of yourself.


A lot of the steps above are examples of self care: working out, eating a balanced diet, going outside.
Making a playlist of your favorite upbeat music and listening to it when you're feeling pessimistic is another great example of practicing self-care.

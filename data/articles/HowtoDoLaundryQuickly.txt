 Never start your laundry during the day when children are home and needing your time and attention. Instead, use the time to focus on your family and do the laundry when you're alone.;
, Always organize your laundry before you do it. Use that time to separate the laundry (colors, whites, delicates), load the machine, put the detergent in, and leave it there, and have it ready for later. Then, you can just press the start button when you're ready.
 Wash the clothes that you need the most first. Focus on taking care of everyday clothes that you're very likely to use before you start washing things such as dress clothes or bedsheets.
 Laundry doesn't always have to be a solitary activity––you can invite children, a spouse, or even a friend to help out. They can help separate the clothes and place the clothes in their places. This will also be a good time to get some social time with others while still being productive. Plus, if you have kids, it can increase their sense of responsibility.

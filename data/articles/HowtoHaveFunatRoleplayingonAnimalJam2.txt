 This way, you can still meet people to hang out with (as long as you're not very shy).
 Just don't embarrass yourself or brag. If you were a prep or jock in real life, you wouldn't act like a total snob of a prep or a bully jock. That's mean, unrealistic, and way too stereotypical! You are also not a queen - so don't act like one!

, Don't dress in ways you don't want to, but dressing up a little can help you roleplay more convincingly. For jocks, boys wear a football shirt, helmet and baseball shoes, swords, tail armors, etc. For girls, try a designer skirt of your favourite colour and maybe a nice head flower or beret.

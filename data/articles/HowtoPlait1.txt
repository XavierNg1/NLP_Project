 Have smooth hair for this hairstyle, so condition your hair when you wash it, then brush it out before you start.;
, Take all of your hair and divide it into three sections: left, middle and right.
 Carefully holding all three strands, cross the right section over the top of the middle section. Now it should look like the right section is the middle section and the middle section is the right section.
 Next, cross the left section over the new middle section. They should now be switched, as they were with the previous section.
 Cross the right and left sections over the center, repeating until you run out or low on hair.
 Using a hair band, ribbon, clip or other styling choice, tie the hair off at the end, where the hairs become too short to fit in the plait.

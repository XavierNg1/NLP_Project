 Mice are generally afraid of people, so minimize how often you handle your mouse. When you do pick up your mouse, do so in a safe fashion. Grab a mouse by the end of the tail (not the tip) and gently lift it with one hand. Then, set the mouse in the palm of your other hand. Keep your hand on the base of the mouse's tail at all times to keep it from escaping. You can then pet and interact with your mouse. If your mouse is squirming and nervous, place it back in its cage.Never grab a mouse by the tip of its tail and do not squeeze a mouse with your fingers.
 Mice are active animals that need plenty of exercise to stay healthy. An exercise wheel is vital for any mouse's cage. However, always opt for a plastic one over a wire one. Mice can easily get trapped and injured or even killed in a wire wheel.You should also provide toys. Inexpensive toys, like cardboard rolls from paper towels and toilet paper, are safe for mice to play with. You can also pick up commercial toys from a local pet store.
 Mice should be active and alert. They should eat and drink regularly and breathe and walk steadily. If you notice any of the following changes in behavior, see a vet:Lack of appetite
Lethargy
Discharge from the eyes or nose
Diarrhea
Weight loss
Skin lesions
Overgrown teeth

, Extreme temperatures can cause health problems and even death in mice. Make sure you keep your mice in a area in your home that's room temperature. If anything causes a sudden change in temperature, such as a heat outage, move your mouse to a location where temperature is stable., Household pets like cats and dogs may view mice as prey. Pets like ferrets and snakes may also prey on mice. Keep mice in separate rooms from other pets and make sure their cages are secure at all times.

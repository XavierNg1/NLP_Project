 Cut one of the toilet-paper tubes in half, lengthwise. Squeeze and manipulate it so it’s approximately half its original diameter. Tape it in place.
 Punch two holes ½" from the end, opposite each other. Insert a pencil through the two holes, twisting as you go.
 Take your other toilet paper tube and draw two ½" parallel lines straight down from the rim. Use scissors to cut along the two lines. You will now have a tab.









Draw another set of identical lines on the same end of the tube, opposite the lines you just cut. Cut on these lines.
Push a rubber band into one set of slits so one end wraps around the tab. The long end of the rubber band should hang outside the tube. Repeat on the other side.
 Fit the smaller tube into bottom of the larger tube. The pencil should be located at the bottom. Hook each rubber band around an end of the pencil.
 Place a marshmallow in the top of the barrel, making sure it is on top of the plunger. Hold the barrel and pull back on the pencil to stretch the rubber bands. Release the plunger and watch as your marshmallow sails across the room!

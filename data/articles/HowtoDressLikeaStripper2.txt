 Boxers are not form-fitting enough, and for whatever reason, many people are not particularly attracted to men in thongs.Buy contoured, well-fitting briefs that accentuate your body.
 There are fewer clothing options out there for men, and this tends to be a less important part of male strippers’ lives.The most important thing to remember is to show a lot of skin, and to wear clothes tight enough to show off the muscles underneath., This is one of the defining qualities of the clothes worn by male strippers. While you can buy pre-made tear-off clothes, any clothes can be turned into tear-off clothes. Purchase clothing 3 or 4 sizes too big, and install Velcro along the outer seams. If you are crafty you can do this yourself, but if not a tailor will easily be able to help., Some strippers cultivate a persona for which facial or body hair is appropriate, but as a general rule most strippers are pretty hairless. Consider keeping your face shaved clean and getting your chest waxed.
 Not all male strippers use makeup, but if you are performing in a club you may find the stage lights wash out the definition in your facial features. If so, one way to increase your tips might be to start applying a little stage makeup. If done right, this should enhance your features, rather than making it immediately apparent that you are wearing makeup.


If you do have facial hair, use an eyebrow pencil to give it definition.
Apply a neutral foundation under your cheekbones to exaggerate their shape.
Line your lips with a neutral foundation. You may also want to apply some lip balm to keep them from drying out.
Brown eyeliner can make your eyelashes appear thicker. Stop before you get to the corners of your eyes—if the lines meet, the effect will be too obvious.
Lightly mist yourself with a glitter spray to draw eyes to your muscles.

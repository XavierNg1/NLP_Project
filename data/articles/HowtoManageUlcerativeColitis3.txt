 Stress does not cause UC, nor does it increase the inflammation that produces your symptoms. Stress does, however, impact your digestive system in other ways.If you are already suffering from diarrhea associated with UC, you’ll want to avoid the additional bowel movements that stress can produce!



Reduce your stress levels with meditation or pursue other relaxation and breathing techniques. Take a few moments during the day to close your eyes and focus on something peaceful and relaxing. This will help to relieve stress and calm your bowels.
Use a biofeedback machine to reduce muscle tension, slow your heart rate, and decrease your stress.Take up yoga or tai chi.
 Even mild exercise will reduce your stress levels, relieve depression, and help improve your bowel function. Consult your doctor to develop an exercise program that is right for you.While hydration during exercise is important for everyone, if you have UC it is especially important to consume adequate water before and during exercise., Chronic diseases can be difficult to cope with because they are life-long conditions. Not everyone is interested in becoming an advocate, and if you’d prefer to deal with your illness in private that is perfectly fine. Some UC patients find strength and comfort in working to educate others, support fellow UC sufferers and raise money for UC research. If you believe you would benefit from such activities, research the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation or other advocacy organizations.

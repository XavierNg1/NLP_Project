 This step might seem obvious, but it is still important to have a good understanding of the keystrokes required to work the game properly. Here is a breakdown of the default controls:


WASD to move
Space to interact with objects
E to toggle flashlight
Q to view checklist
Left Shift to run
Left Ctrl to crouch.;
, Look at your checklist and think about the locations of all the items. Try to do as much as you can downstairs before going upstairs.
 The best way to do this is with practice.


Some objects, like the diamond ring, have many locations in which they can spawn. Others, like the bicycle, have only one location.
 In the room between the kitchen and the garage, there is a box with three wires. Severing the blue wire turns off the alarm for the safe upstairs.


The green wire is for electricity in the house. Cutting it turns off the electricity. This is optional.
The red wire activates the alarm. It should not be cut unless the blue wire has been severed.
 The office key has many spawn points, including the end table in the family room, the couch in the living room, the end table in the master bedroom, the dining room table and more.
 Once you have the code, you can open the safe and get the gold bar as well as the many stacks of money.


The code changes every time, so be wary of this.
 The owner comes home four minutes into each round (or earlier if the alarm is set off). The clock will chime at about two minutes in, allowing you to judge what you can and should do in the remaining time.


Holding an item in front of you and/or crouching will sometimes hide you from the owner, and he will go away.
 Once you have all the items you need, or the owner has arrived at home, you can leave the house. There are two exits - the front door and the garage door. Once you leave, you will be told your ranking and the worth in dollars of the items you stole.

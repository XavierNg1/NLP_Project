 If you primarily seek durability, saddle blanket seat covers are known for being tough, so your money goes a long way. If you want seat covers that can be thrown in the washing machine in the event of stains, a polyester-cotton blend may be best.
 The color can be different from the shade of your original car seats, but it should complement the exterior of your car. Keep in mind that lighter covers tend to show stains easily, while black covers may feel particularly hot on warm days.
 This is an ideal way to show some personality in your car. For example, a Hawaiian pattern can display your fun side, while camouflage can provide your car with a masculine look.

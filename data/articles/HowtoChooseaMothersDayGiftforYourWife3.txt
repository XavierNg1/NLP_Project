 Before she wakes up in the morning, you can make her breakfast and serve it in bed. Children can also help out by mixing ingredients and serving. Later on, you can make her dinner or dessert. Try surprising her with her favorite food or make a new recipe you think she’ll enjoy., Consider what your wife does around the house. For Mother’s Day, at least, tell her you’ll take care of her chores. If she is the person who handles the dishes in your home, take over for her. Assure her she won’t have to work at all this Mother’s Day.


You can also give her an IOU on this. Make a slip that she can turn in on some days where she’d rather relax. Pick up her chores on those days throughout the year.
 This sounds like a strange idea, but many wives do enjoy a peaceful day without stress. Draw her a warm bath, light some candles, and leave a fluffy robe. Take the kids out for the day. Let her spend the day in bed without having to worry about work or children. You can couple this with another gift, such as personal care items or a box set of her favorite show.Instead of leaving her alone, you can spend time together but still allow her to choose what to do during the day.
 Rather than take care of her household responsibilities for one day, consider doing it throughout the year. Professional maids can be hired for a day or for regular cleaning. Your wife will have less responsibilities to stress her.

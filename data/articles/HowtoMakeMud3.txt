 You'll need cornstarch, water, and food coloring or cocoa powder.
 If you're using food coloring to get the brown, dirt look, use equal amounts of red, blue, and yellow food coloring (2 drops of each should suffice).
 Starting with 1-2 cups of cornstarch, mix in the cocoa powder if this is how you're getting the brown color. With those ingredients mixed, or minus the cocoa if using the food coloring, slowly add in water and mix the two together. Stop adding water when you get the magic consistency, where it's hard when you touch it but melts when you don't.
 If you want, you can add in real dirt for texture or other kitchen materials, like rice flour or baking soda. This will give your play "mud" a grittier texture, like real mud.

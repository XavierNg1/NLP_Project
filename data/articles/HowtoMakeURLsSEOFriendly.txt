 (Keywords are the few words you expect people to type into the search engine when looking for what your web page will give them.) Certain common words are ignored by search engines. In SEO, these common words are called "stop words." Remove any stop words from your keyword list.;
, Too few keywords won't help you much, but too many will produce keyword spam, which is off-putting to search engines and live visitors alike. Many websites offer "density checker" tools to scan a web page and tell you what the top keywords are, but you'll also want to use online resources to check how stiff the competition is for those keywords.
 URLs have to reinterpret special characters into a code, which doesn't work well with many social networking sites. (For example,Â %20 is the code for a space in a URL.)

, Periods aren't recognized by search engines, so they don't affect your URL SEO. Including the period can confuse programs about what file type your web page actually is.
 Use all lower-case letters because that is what most people generally will look for, and URLs are case-sensitive.

 Remember singing is all about breathing, so if you are wearing something so tight you can't breathe in fully, you won't be able to sing your best. Try to avoid belts as they can restrict your lower abdominal movement (stomach breathing). Dresses with tight bodices prevent your rib cage expanding when you breathe, leaving you unable to breathe deeply. The last thing you want to do is run out of air, or even faint, because of the clothes you are wearing., High heels put the pelvis and upper body in a tilted position, which changes the way you have to breathe. Practice in your heels as much as you can, or wear flat shoes. Remember, the height of the heels changes the way you have to breathe, so practice with the actual shoes you will wear., Your hair can be in any style, as long as it is neat and doesn't cover your face. Singing is about acting and telling a story, and the casting director(s) want to be able to see the integrity in your face., Makeup is useful to accentuate your features, giving you a better ability to be dramatic, but keep it natural looking. Try to apply makeup with a knowledge of the space you will be auditioning in. If you will be fairly close to the casting director(s), keep the makeup light because they will be able to see your features easily. The further away they will be, the more you should put on. If there will be strong lights, everything will be washed out, so you will need more. Don't put on so much makeup that it is distracting or looks strange.

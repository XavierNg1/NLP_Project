 The butter will eventually harden up, but you need it to be liquid in order for the cocoa powder to dissolve properly.
 You can use a whisk or an electric mixer. Keep mixing until the cocoa powder is completely blended in and you have a uniform color.
 Keep mixing until the mixture is frothy and foamy.
 Over time, the frosting will stiffen up and become more buttery in texture.


If the frosting is too stiff, add some more milk, one teaspoon at a time, until you have the desired softness.
If the frosting is too runny, add in a bit more powdered sugar.

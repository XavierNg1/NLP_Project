 Declaring a person's strongly held belief as outright false is not likely to change the belief and may cause the individual to become more defensive. This will increase conflict and may contribute to the person being suspicious of your motives and intent..


Some beliefs may be so unusual they seem ridiculous or funny to you. Laughing or making comments like "That's crazy!" are belittling and dismissive and should be avoided.
 Offer alternate explanations of circumstances the individual identifies as suspicious or concerning. For example, if he believes someone is following him, suggest the possibility the stalker lives or works nearby and may take similar routes.If the person becomes agitated when offered alternative explanations, abandon this strategy and instead note the current absence of the stalker to help him feel safe at the moment.
 Divert conversation and attention from delusions and hallucinations by asking the person to assist you with an activity or accompany you on an errand, like grocery shopping.Be sure to acknowledge the person's emotional experience before changing the subject to express empathy. Before introducing the distraction, try saying, "That's really scary, but you're safe here."

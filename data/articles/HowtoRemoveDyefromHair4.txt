 Be sure to use plain white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is less acidic, so it won't be as effective.








Most dyes are meant to handle alkaline substances, like soaps and shampoos, but not acidic substances. The acidity of white vinegar will help to remove the dye.
 Over a sink or tub, douse your hair with the vinegar and water solution. Get your hair good and saturated.
 Use a shower cap or plastic bag to wrap up your wet hair. Allow your hair to soak in the vinegar mixture for 15 to 20 minutes.
 As you rinse, you'll see color running out with the water. Once the water runs clear, shampoo it again. You can repeat this entire process several times if you need to.

 If you use a large suitcase or more than one item of luggage, you will need to check bags. If, however, you have no more than one small suitcase and a small additional carry-on item like a backpack or purse, then you can carry on both your suitcase and your other item and avoid checking any bags.


See if you are traveling with knives, large containers of liquids, or similar items. You will not be able to carry these items onto the plane and will have to check them, regardless of the number of items you have.;
, Check in online with your name and birth date or with your confirmation number that you received when purchasing the tickets. This will usually require you to specify how many bags you will be checking and choose or confirm your seating assignment. Once you've finished checking in, you will be prompted to print your boarding pass. Doing so will save you time at the airport, especially if you don't need to check bags.
  This will include your passport or other ID, plane tickets or boarding pass, travelers' cheques, cash, travel itineraries, and any other necessary documents like a vaccination certificate, if you're going to a country where this is required. Make sure you check with your airline so that you have everything you need.

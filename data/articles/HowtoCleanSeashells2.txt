 Cover the shells with water. Make sure the pot has a little space remaining so that it does not boil over.
 Let the shells boil for several minutes. If you are boiling a lot of shells or very large shells you might need to wait a couple extra minutes.
 Take them out one at a time using tongs. You will need to use tongs because the shells will be very hot.
 Hold the seashell using a towel and pull gently on the sea animal to remove it. Using tweezers to remove the organism might help if it is too hot to use your fingers.

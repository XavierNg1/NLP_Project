 If you have the make and model of your bike, a Bicycle Shop can probably supply you with the correct brake pads for your bike. There are "universal" pads available at discount stores, but these typically only work on inexpensive bikes.
 On most bikes, this can be done without removing the caliper from the bike frame. If the caliper must be removed to allow space to work on it, remove the nut at the top center of the caliper, slide the assembly out, and replace the nut on the stud without allowing the assembly to come apart. This keeps all washers, spacers, and the caliper arms in the correct position while working on it.
 To prevent the pads from squeaking, toe the pads in slightly, so that the trailing edge contacts the wheel first. Make sure the pad height is near the center of the metal rim of you wheel. Pads mounted too low may slide off the rim, causing a dangerous situation, or if they are mounted too high, the pad will rub against the sidewall of the tire, which is also undesirable.

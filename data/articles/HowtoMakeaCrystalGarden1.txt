 You’ll need a plastic container (a to-go dish works well) to hold your sponge pieces or cotton balls. To make the crystals you’ll need salt, water, ammonia, and laundry bluing (one brand, “Mrs. Stewart's Laundry Bluing,” is usually recommended). Food coloring can also be added, but is not necessary., The crystals that will be grown will be made from a solution of salt, water, ammonia, and laundry bluing. The ammonia is included to speed the evaporation of the solution and thus also the growth of the crystals.


In a separate container, mix two tablespoons of salt with four tablespoons of water. Stir for two minutes to dissolve as much salt as you can.
Then, add two tablespoons of ammonia and two tablespoons of laundry bluing; continue mixing. The mixture will now be fairly viscous and blue in color.
 Some salt may remain undissolved at the bottom of the mixture, be sure to include this when pouring over your sponges or cotton balls. The salt which is topmost on each piece may begin to turn back to a white color, but this is nothing to worry about.


If using sponge pieces, wet them first and then ring them out so that the mixture sticks better.
If using cotton balls, try not to drown any of the pieces to avoid deflating the balls; use enough on cotton balls to cover the top only.
If using food coloring, place one drop on top of each sponge piece or cotton ball after the mixture has been poured on top.
 Have the container sit uncovered in a room temperature environment overnight. By the next day, your crystal garden should be fully formed.


If you’d like to have it continue growing, you can re-make the mixture just described at a lower ratio. Add this mixture to the base of the crystals already formed (not on top to avoid damage) to encourage extra growth.

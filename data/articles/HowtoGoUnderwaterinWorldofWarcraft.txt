 While the right mouse button is held down, moving the mouse will change the camera angle, and the direction of your character's underwater movement. Face down and move forward, and you should enter the water and start to swim. While swimming, use the same controls to change your direction of movement.


You can use the left mouse button or your forward movement key (default W) to move.
On some mice, you can hold the middle mouse button (or push down on the mouse wheel) instead.;
, If you prefer keyboard controls, press X to enter the water or to move to a lower depth.
 When you reach the surface, you will automatically break through.


Alternatively, hold the right mouse button and turn the camera to face up, then move forward.
 When the breath meter runs out, you'll drown. Return to the surface to get some air before this happens.


Some spells and items increase the amount of time you can stay underwater. Undead characters always have an extra-long breath meter, and Druids in Aquatic Form can stay underwater indefinitely., If you swim too far out to sea, you'll see a fatigue meter appear. This is a warning to turn back before you die. There is no way to bypass the fatigue meter; its purpose is to show players where the boundaries of the area are.

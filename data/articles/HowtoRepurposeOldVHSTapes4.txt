 The endless miles of tape inside VHS cassettes can be turned into cool wall art.
 The tape inside the VHS can be manipulated into all sorts of fun designs. For example, huge wall flowers can be made using miles of jet black VHS cassette tape and colorful accessories. Or, consider such designs as bows, animal shapes, cut-out scenery,

,, Begin pulling the tape until you can no longer pull anymore and use scissors to cut remove from the cassette. This part is fun!

,, Work with the tape the same way you might work with any other stringy type material. For example, if you want to make a large black heart, begin by rolling the tape between your hands until it forms into more of a rope shape. Then lay the tape on a flat surface and “sketch out” the base of your heart with the tape. Consider using duct tape or another adhesive substance to join ends together. Build upon that base with subsequent pieces of VHS tape that’s been rolled into a rope until you have a 3-D black heart.

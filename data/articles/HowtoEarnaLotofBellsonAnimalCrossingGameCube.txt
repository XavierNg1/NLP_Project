 They'll pay more than just money for task like: Furniture, Stationary, Clothing, and more!;
, Fruit from your town is 100 bells each. And fruit from other towns is 500 bells each.
 They will drop 100 bells and if lucky 1,000. You may get furniture, and if you're unlucky and quick enough, you can catch bees.
 Each gold spot gives at least 1,000 bells and if you're REALLY lucky, you may get 10,000 bells.
 Ok here's how it works:


First find a gold spot.
Then grab the gold out of it but DON'T REBURY IT! If you do, you have to wait the next day.
Bury the money you just got into the hole.
Take care of the sapling and you get 3x the amount of what you buried into the hole!

, Everyday there is one rock in your town that gives you money when you hit it with your shovel or axe. Dig a hole in front or behind you, and a hole beside you.

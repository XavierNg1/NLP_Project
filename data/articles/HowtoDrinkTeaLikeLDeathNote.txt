 You don't actually have to buy everything, you can borrow it from someone or make do with what you already have.;
, It is recommended that you use two kinds of tea blended together for the best "L" flavor. The best brands to use are Stash green chai tea and (any type of) English Breakfast tea or Earl grey. Try to get a tea with matcha infused in it. Matcha is a Japanese green paste that is used in traditional Japanese tea.
 The tea L drinks appears to be very dark.
 Put out your teapot and set your teacups and saucers on the table as well (in the anime, L sets up the teacups for a few more people but never shares....for shame, L). Don't get a sugar bowl! Instead, get a regular, white bowl and fill it with sugar cubes.
 Sit like L, keep the saucer on the table, hold your teacup by your index finger and thumb on your RIGHT hand and take loud sips of tea. Add as much sugar as you dare. Try to look like L with your emo eyes and sitting position.

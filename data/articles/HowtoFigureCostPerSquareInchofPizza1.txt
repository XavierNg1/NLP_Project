 The formula is A=π(r2){\displaystyle A=\pi (r^{2})} where r{\displaystyle r} equals the length of the circle’s radius., Pizza sizes are measured by their diameter. To find the length of the radius, you have to divide the diameter in half.

For example, if you are ordering a 20 inch pizza, calculate 20÷2=10{\displaystyle 20\div 2=10}. So the radius of the pizza is 10 inches.
 Remember to substitute for the variable r{\displaystyle r}.

For example, if the radius is 10 inches, your formula will look like this: A=π(102){\displaystyle A=\pi (10^{2})}.
 To square a number, multiply it by itself.

For example, if the radius is 10 inches, you would calculate 10×10=100{\displaystyle 10\times 10=100}, so your formula will now look like this: A=π(100){\displaystyle A=\pi (100)}.
 You can use a calculator, or use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }. The result will give you the area, in square inches, of your pizza.

For example:A=π(100){\displaystyle A=\pi (100)}A=3.14(100){\displaystyle A=3.14(100)}A=314{\displaystyle A=314}So, the area of a 20-inch round pizza is 314 square inches.
 This will give you the cost per square inch of the pizza.

For example, if a pizza costs $32 and has an area of 314 square inches, you would calculate 32÷314=.101{\displaystyle 32\div 314=.101}. So, the cost per square inch of pizza is about .10, or 10 cents.
 When comparing value, the best value is the pizza with the lowest cost per square inch. This is only true, however, when comparing pizzas with the same toppings. A cheese pizza is likely to be cheaper per square inch than a pizza with several toppings, but that doesn’t necessarily make it the best value.

 When applied to damp hair, sea salt sprays can add texture to your tresses or enhance your natural waves. To achieve just-came-from-the-beach waves, begin by washing your hair. Instead of towel drying your locks, which leads to frizz, remove excess water with a microfiber cloth or a cotton t-shirt., Retrieve your bottle of sea salt spray. Lightly spritz your hair from the middle of the shaft to the ends. Spraying too much on your hair will weigh it down.
 To produce waves in your sea salt treated hair, you must tousle your locks.

Gather your ends in a cotton t-shirt. Scrunch your hair as you lift it up towards your head. Repeat this process until your waves are defined.
If your waves require heat, you may blow dryer with a diffuser attachment in addition to scrunching it with a t-shirt. Place the diffuser onto the nozzle. Set your blow dryer to a low heat setting. Place your ends on the diffuser and move the tool up towards your head.,

 Pour some of your sample from its original container into a glass or beaker. This way, you will not contaminate the rest of the sample by dipping the litmus paper. Make sure that the sample you choose is aqueous (dissolved in water), otherwise the litmus test will not work.For example, orange juice is comprised primarily of water. A litmus test will be effective in this case.
Another liquid, vegetable oil, is not aqueous. Thus, the litmus test will not yield any results.;
, Dip a piece of red litmus paper into the liquid. If the paper turns blue, your liquid is a base (pH > 7). If the paper stays red, your liquid is not a base.Ruling out a base does not definitively tell you that the liquid is an acid (pH < 7). It could also be neutral (pH = 7).
 Dip a piece of blue litmus paper into the liquid. If the paper turns red, the liquid is an acid. If the paper remains blue, the liquid is either a base or is neutral., By using both tests, you can determine if the liquid is an acid, a base, or neutral. To do this, you have to analyze how each paper reacted to the liquid. For example:


Base - Red paper turns blue. Blue paper does not change.
Acid - Red paper does not change. Blue paper turns red.
Neutral - Red paper does not change. Blue paper does not change.

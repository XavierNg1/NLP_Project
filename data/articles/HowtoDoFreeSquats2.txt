 If not done carefully, squatting can put a lot of strain on your lower back. Protect your back and ensure proper form by keeping your core muscles firmly engaged. Imagine you are contracting your belly button toward the middle of your back. As you keep your tummy tight, this should help you to hold your chest upright. Imagine that you are trying to let sun shine on the top of your clavicle and chest., Descend with control and ascend in any manner, however do not ascend without braking at the top. When you see professional or elite athletes doing squatting movements very fast, they are moving with control.
 Build your squatting ability over several workouts by adding a repetition or two every workout. Squat as often as twice a week and as infrequently as once every three weeks. Begin by doing just one set of 10-13 reps (or repetitions). Add a couple of reps, or a set, each time you work out. Build up strength and increase your reps slowly in order to protect your spine and avoid injury.

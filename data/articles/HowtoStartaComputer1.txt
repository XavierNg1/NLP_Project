 If you're using a desktop computer, you cannot turn it on without first plugging it in; laptop computers can run on battery power, but should be plugged in to negate a low battery or other problems while starting up.

If you're plugging into a surge protector (e.g., a power strip) instead of a traditional wall outlet, you'll also need to make sure that the surge protector is on.
A laptop's charger typically plugs into the left or right side of the laptop's housing.;
, The power button symbol resembles a circle with a vertical line through it. Power button location will vary from computer to computer, but you can typically find the power button in one of the following locations:


Laptop - Left, right, or front side of the housing. Sometimes the power button also appears as a key near the top of the keyboard, or as a button in the area above or below the keyboard.

Desktop - On the front or back of the CPU, which is the box-shaped piece of hardware to which your computer screen connects. Some iMac desktops have the power button on the back of the monitor or the keyboard instead.
 You don't need to hold down the power button to turn on the computer. You should hear the computer's internal fan and disk drive begin spinning; after a few seconds, your computer's monitor will also light up and display either the start-up screen or the login screen, depending on whether the computer was off or sleeping.

For a laptop, you'll first need to open the screen by pulling it up and away from the laptop's housing.
If your desktop computer doesn't turn on, try pressing your monitor's power button as well. It may be the case that your computer is on but the monitor is not.

 Many online jewelry retailers offer printable charts that show a number of circles of different sizes.If you print the chart from the jeweller you plan to order from, you’ll know the sizing on the chart will match the sizing of their products.


In order to ensure that the size chart is not distorted in printing, make sure any scaling options on your printer are turned off.
 Choose a ring that fits snugly, but isn’t too tight. Make sure the ring fits the correct finger; even your two ring fingers can be different sizes.
 The circle should match the inside of the ring for the perfect fit.If you are having trouble choosing between two close sizes, you should opt for the larger size.

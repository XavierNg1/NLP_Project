 It can be difficult to talk with your child about a weight problem, but focusing on health rather than weight can really help make the conversation easier.


Avoid judgmental statements about their weight. Don’t focus on your child’s appearance. Rather, say something like, “I want you to have strong muscles,” or “Wouldn’t it be good to be able to run faster at the playground?” That way, they’re focusing on what their body can do, rather than how it looks.
 Remember, there is more to your child than their weight problem. Be sure to stay positive about their other noteworthy traits, like being good at school or being a good friend.


Say something like, "I loved the way you included the new boy in your game at the park today."
Or, you could note how your child is always responsible: "I really appreciate all of your help cleaning the house this weekend."

, Your child’s weight problem is certainly a serious concern, but it is only one aspect of their life.


During the weight-loss process, be sure to still spend quality time with your child and enjoy those things you’ve always done together.
Once your child has successfully worked on being healthier for a while, plan a special trip or outing to celebrate.

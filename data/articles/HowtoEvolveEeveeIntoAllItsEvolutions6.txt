 Leafeon is not a difficult Pok√©mon to evolve. In fact, you can capture Eevee and evolve it right away just with one level up. All you must do is ensure that you level the Eevee up in the same area as a Moss Rock, of which there are several in the game. Below are a list of locations:


Sinnoh: In the Eterna Forest
Unova: In the Pinwheel Forest
Kalos: In the Winding Woods
Hoenn: In the Petalburg Woods
Alola: In the Lush Jungle

, You don't have to go to the Moss Rock itself - you can level up your Eevee anywhere in the area that contains the Moss Rock. Your Eevee should evolve into a Leafeon!


Leafeon's highest stat is its Defense, and its ability, Leaf Guard, prevents status problems when the weather is sunny.

 Start by getting your pet's name out there. The more people that you interact with and follow, the more exposure for your pet's page. Commenting in a specific or humorous voice is usually a way to pique people's interest in your account.Using puns like "I've got a bone to pick with your opinion" may make people laugh and follow your dog's page.
Announcing landmarks for your dog's social media page is also another great way to thank followers or fans.

You can say something like "Thank you, everyone, for helping me reach my goal of 1,000 followers!"



, If your posts don't show up on other people's feeds, your dog's page won't grow. Keep a consistent posting schedule and post for your dog at least once a day. Consider optimum posting times, depending on the platform that you'll be using for your pet.

The best time to post on Twitter is 3 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.
The best time to post on Facebook is 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and on Saturday and Sunday between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m.
The best time to post on Instagram is 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. Monday through Friday., The first step in catering content specifically to your target audience is to understand your audience. Try to cater the content that you put out for that audience. Take note of which posts get the most likes, shares, or comments. Pay attention to trends to figure out what content is most successful on your pages.When a post gets a lot of likes or comments, you should try to create similar content in the future. For instance, you may get few likes or shares on long posts comprised of text, but many on cute pictures of your dog in funny costumes.

 You only need enough water to cover the caramel. This is best done immediately after you finish using the pot, before the caramel has had a chance to fully solidify.
 Cover it, and allow the inside to soak for an hour.
 If, upon inspection, you still notice a considerable amount of caramel stuck to the pot, try using hotter water.
 Again, you only need enough to cover the caramel.
 The water should simmer but not quite boil. Allow the water to simmer for at least ten minutes.
 Scrub away any remaining caramel with a dish sponge.

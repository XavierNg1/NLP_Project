 Dental insurance doesn't often cover a large percentage of dental procedure costs, but some plans do cover a fraction of the overall cost. Although it may not be a lot, every penny the insurance company will pay will help in the long run.


Call your insurance company to discuss the best way of paying for your dental implants.
It is important to determine if going to an in-network provider will affect the amount the insurance company will cover.;
, Let your dentist know if the cost of the dental implants is unattainable for you. Some dental offices that do implants may consider offering you a payment plan that would make the implants more affordable. Approach the payment office at your dentist and see if they allow such plans.Scheduling multiple implants at once is recommended to promote the healing process and for improving benefits for a long term result. Scheduling multiple implants at once might also help you save on the cost of office visits, anesthesia, and other charges.
Asking your dentist for a temporary solution until you can afford to get the implants is also a possibility.
 Some dental offices have packages available to help make implants more affordable for their patients. Inquire if they have packages available, or if they provide discounts with multiple implants.
 Dental implants involve many steps, and many times require both a surgeon and a dentist. If you can find a dentist who performs both the surgical and restorative work, you may save money, and there is one person who takes all the responsibility for the entire procedure, which is really important. You also save time this way because the provider is able to combine the visits.

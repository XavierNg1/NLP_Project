 Twitter is a good way for new teachers to join an online community of more experienced educators.
 Whether you are drafting a syllabus for a college class or choosing a lesson on shapes and patters for the preschool bunch, you can reach out for input and feedback.
 There are several that occur on regularly scheduled dates and times. Everyone participating in the chat gets to vote on which topics to cover on a given day or evening.


Try the original edu-chat on Twitter, which takes place on Tuesday evenings. What began with 100 participants is now up to over 2,000 educators. Educational powerhouses such as Alfie Kohn and Diane Ravitch join occasionally.

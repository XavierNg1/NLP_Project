 These usually have to be renewed each year.
 Clean the inside and outside hull of any barnacles or debris, and look for dents or cracks in it, particularly on the bottom and around rivets. Also inspect the drain plug to make sure it still seals the drain hole properly and that any onboard lights and electronics work correctly.
 Test the engine to make sure it runs and there are no fluid leaks, replace any necessary parts, and in the case of inboard or larger outboard motors with 4-cycle engines, change the oil. Also, clean the propeller of any debris and make sure it turns freely. Inspect the crank battery for your main motor and the deep-cycle battery for your trolling motor for leaks and to make sure they hold a charge.
 Make sure the wheels and tires are in good shape, along with the winch and pads. Be sure the trailer taillights work as well.
 Check all life jackets for any tears and your children's to see that they still fit. Check the batteries in your weather radio and that your fire extinguishers are properly filled and in working order.
 If you don't have the time to inspect your boat yourself, or if you notice something you're not sure is a problem, you can have your boat inspected by a mechanic or outdoor retailer equipped to do inspections. Boats used for saltwater fishing can be inspected by marine surveyors accredited by either the National Association of Marine Surveyors or the Society of Accredited Marine Surveyors.

, If you keep mixing up the buttons, you will not improve. The more you play, the more familiarized you will get with the controls. Consulting the manual helps too.
 It makes the game a lot simpler by not needing the knowledge of what does what.
 Start on easy with all the necessary aids on so that the game is really easy, and slowly build up.
 Your opponent will predict what you will do if you use the same plays again and again. On offense, mix up passes with rushes. On defense, mix up blitzes with different types of coverage.

 Greenhouse gases are atmospheric molecules that prevent light and heat from escaping the earth. These gases include things like carbon dioxide. An increase in greenhouse gases can lead to warmer global temperatures.Though greenhouse gases are produced naturally (e.g. a volcanic eruption), the majority of the scientific community claims that human activity (e.g. burning fossil fuels) adds significant amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Skeptics of this theory argue that greenhouse gases produced by humans do not significantly impact climate.
 The amount of light and heat that the sun gives off is subject to fluctuations. These changes directly impact the earth’s climate. Energy given off by the sun is another variable in climate change over time.Scientists have measured the levels of energy given off by the sun over time. The data shows that the amount of solar energy reaching earth fluctuates, resulting in changes to climate. However, in most scientific models, this does not account for the degree of climate change that has been measured in the last several decades.
 The earth reflects much of the sun’s light. This helps to keep the planet cool. Some places (e.g. polar regions covered in snow) will reflect more light and remain colder. Other regions (e.g. metropolitan areas) will absorb more sunlight and keep higher temperatures.The impact of urbanization is also subject to the climate change debate. Again, skeptics of human-driven climate change claim that the amount of urbanization in the world is too insignificant to affect climate. People who consider human activity to have a direct impact on climate generally take the stance that increased urbanization leads to more sunlight being absorbed by the planet (making it warmer).

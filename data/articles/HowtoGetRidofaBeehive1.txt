Honey bees will typically have from 10,000-50,000 or more bees in a hive.
You may only see a small portion but the hives can be deeply hidden in walls, trees, chimneys, roofs, etc.
Some bees are more aggressive than others and will swarm or sting if the hive is threatened or if someone gets too close. Yellow jackets, though not a bee, will do this.
Removing a large hive can be very dangerous and requires great skill, training and experience.;
, If you are allergic to bee venom then this may not be a safe task for you. If allergic, a bee sting may cause swelling of the throat or lips which may cause difficulty in breathing. Some bee stings have even induce vomiting and diarrhea. If you are highly allergic a bee sting could be fatal. So please proceed with caution., Honey bees are on the decline and they may be willing to relocate the bees for free or a nominal fee.


Look online or in the Yellow Pages (Bee keeping may not be well advertised in all areas, you may need to search). Search for beekeepers or apiaries for your local area.
Ask someone at a locally owned market or general merchandise store for bee wranglers or bee keeper contact information.
Call your local farmers market or nursery as they deal with bee keepers.
If a bee handler doesn't remove bees, they probably know of someone who does.

 In a bowl, mix 2 parts window cleaner with one part warm water. This diluted solution should be sufficient to clean the microwave both inside and out.
 Dip a sponge in the cleaning solution and use it to wipe the inside of the microwave. Remove the spin tray and wipe the base of the microwave until all the spots and stains have been removed. Wipe the vents of the microwave oven from the inside to remove any gunk that has collected there.









Make sure the microwave is unplugged while you work.
Soak tough stains and spots in the window cleaner solution for 5 minutes before scrubbing them away.
Make sure the upper shelf and ceiling get wiped down, since food tends to splatter onto the top of the microwave.
 After the inside is sparkling clean, soak a clean rag in fresh water and wipe it out completely. Make sure to clean up all of the residue left by the window cleaner, since it contains chemicals you don't want in your food next time you use the microwave. Go over it one more time with a clean, dry rag.









If a few tough spots remain, using a cloth soaked in olive oil to clean them.
Be careful what other cleaning products you use inside your microwave. For example, you should not use pre-soaked scrubbing pads inside the microwave because the loose particles will catch fire and explode your microwave.
Using unsafe chemicals can also cause the unit to catch fire or cause other safety hazards. Stick to window cleaner or a natural solution like vinegar or lemon juice.
 Leave the unit to dry after wiping it out with a clean rag. Smell inside the unit to see if it is safe to use. If you smell window cleaner, take a clean rage soaked in fresh water and wipe it out again.
 Window cleaner can be safely used to clean the microwave door, the handle, the buttons, and the sides. Wipe everything down thoroughly once you've removed the grime.

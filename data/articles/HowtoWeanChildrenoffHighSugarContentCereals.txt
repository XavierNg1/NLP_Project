 At the same time, look for its "plain Jane cousin" that has less sugar, colorants, additives etc. For example, if you want to buy cocoa pops, buy rice krispies/rice pops at the same time. Even better if you can buy a health product version with less additives than the supermarket shelf version.;
, Make the mixture 2/3 rice pops and 1/3 cocoa pops. Always stick to this ratio; the healthier cereal being two-thirds and the sugary cereal being one third.
 If your child has a variety of foods to try, then there will be less temptation to eat too much of the sugary treat.
 Children who are denied things often crave them intensely; this little compromise is a half-way meeting that can serve as a good lesson in eating healthily with a small splurge now and then. And it also teaches them a little about moderation in life, although that is a lesson we all have to keep reminding ourselves of lifelong!

, Cereal breakfasts are a convenience but not a necessity. There is no harm in foregoing cereal some mornings and having bowls of fruit, toast with varied toppings, egg dishes, fish and meat or protein plant substitutes, etc. Variety is healthy.

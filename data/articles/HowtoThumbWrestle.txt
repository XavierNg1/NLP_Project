, Start each game politely, showing respect for your opponent by bowing thumbs to one another. Yes, it's silly but it reflects the amusing nature of this mini-wrestle.


The bows traditionally follow the cadence of the verse "One, two, three, four / I declare a thumb war!" and occasionally "Five, six, seven, eight / Try to keep your thumb straight!"

, Try to catch one another's thumbs. It sounds easier than it is. Once the wriggling and giggling commences, this game is anyone's!


It helps if you lie your thumb down and then go around you opponents thumb when they swoop down to press down
Use your thumb to your advantage

, The only way to win in this game is to pin down the opponent's thumb for a set count. A count of 5, at the same pace as counting seconds, is ideal. Any less is usually too easy. Another option is to follow the cadence of the verse "One, two, three, four / I win the thumb war!"

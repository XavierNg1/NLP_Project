 To do this, click or tap on the picture of your avatar at the top-right corner of your screen. A drop-down menu will appear. Click on the name of your Twitter handle (or, on the mobile site, tap on "Profile"). You will now be on your Twitter profile, which contains the history of all of the tweets, replies, and retweets you have made and received.
 Scroll through your Twitter profile to see the full history of your retweets. You can recognize which tweets you have retweeted by looking below the tweet for the retweet icon: two green arrows pointing in a circle.
 This will "undo", or remove the retweet you made from your profile, so that neither you nor other users will see it on their Twitter feeds.


This will not delete the original tweet from the user's timeline.

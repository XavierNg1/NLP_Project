 The right film title is crucial as it will make it easier to market your screenplay and convey to the audience what the film is about. This can be established at anytime of the process.
 If you are unsure what the theme is, it's the key lesson the protagonist has learnt by the end of the film.
 Write a short sentence (15 words or less) of the fundamental concept which drives the plot.


Whose story is it?
What do they want?
What’s stopping them getting it?
What’s at stake?
The premise for E.T. could be 'A lonely boy is befriended by an alien'.
Seek feedback on your premise before you develop your film.

 People who have hurt you by betraying your trust or being overly critical can and often should be ignored. People who have actually hurt you physically or emotionally do not deserve to be let off so easy.


Yes, you should absolutely cut off contact with someone who has physically or emotionally abused you. But do not hesitate to contact the proper authorities if you feel unsafe or believe this is a pattern of behavior likely to be repeated.;
, There is a fine line to walk here. You should never feel like you deserve to be mistreated, but you can consider what role you may have played in another’s lack of concern or care.


For instance, you shouldn’t blame yourself for your boyfriend cheating on you, but you can examine how your jealousy, lack of attention, or some other factor may have given him an excuse to justify his hurtfulness.
People seek out the type of relationships they had in their childhood, even if they weren't productive relationships. This process is mostly subconscious. See if you're pursuing relationships with people who remind you of your past relationships.

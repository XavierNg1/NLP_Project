 Before you apply insect repellent all over your kids' skin, rub just a little over a small patch of skin. Watch the skin for any irritation. Avoid applying the repellent if you notice:Redness or rash
Blisters
Hives

, Squirt some of the insect repellent into the palms of your hands. Rub your hands onto your child's skin. Don't apply it near the mouth, eyes, or hands (since kids often put their hands in their mouths). Only apply a little repellent near their ears.Don't let your kids put their own insect repellent on since they may accidentally get it in their eyes or mouths.
Avoid applying insect repellent to cuts or irritated skin.
 If you're using an insect repellent spray, ensure that you apply it in a well-ventilated space (like outside) and avoid spraying near the mouth. This will reduce the risk that your kids will breathe in the repellent.You may want to avoid using repellent sprays on small children since it will be harder to stop them from breathing in the spray as you apply it.
 If you're using insect repellent on younger children, you may want to apply an insect repellent lotion or rub an insect repellent stick on their skin. These will give you more control in applying the repellent.


You may want to give the child something to look at or play with while you apply the lotion. This can distract them long enough for you to apply the repellent.
 If your child has skin or eye irritation, stop using the insect repellent. Talk with your child's doctor about a safer alternative to repellents. IR5353 and DEET can cause mild irritation. If you think your child is having an allergic reaction to oil of lemon eucalyptus (hives, swelling, rash), stop using the repellent immediately and contact the doctor.

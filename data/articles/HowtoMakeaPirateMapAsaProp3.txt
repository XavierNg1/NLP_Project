 There are lots of possibilities:


Is this a map of the sea, of land, or of both?
Do you want the map to show standard map legends or do you want to make up your own? Either is fine.






Do you want to make this into a treasure hunt map or just something that depicts where your pirates have traveled?







, This will allow you to erase errors and make changes as you go. Give yourself plenty of time and artistic license for this part of making the pirate map––it's the fun part.


Make up names for lands and seas, specific features etc. Use calligraphy styles to write them in place.
Add compass points to show where North, West, South and East are.






Use traditional symbols such as ships, sea monsters, and the like to keep the pirate feel of the map.
 Stick with neutral colors for the most part, as old maps were not terribly colorful. However, you can use calligraphy and for important parts such as "X marks the spot" where the treasure is, you can use colorful pens and metallic markers to emulate the brighter colors calligraphers once used.


Outline all land, sea trenches, etc. with a fine marker pen to make them easier to see.
 This could be cryptic, such as a poem line, or pictorial, etc.

 Do you want your locker to be calm and relaxing, to relieve you from those stressful classes? Or do you want your locker to be fun and exciting, colorful, or maybe you want it to show some of your rocker spirit. If you don't want to express anything, pick a theme. A cool theme could be 70's, giraffe's, dogs, teddy bears, monkeys, cheese, birds, school, cats, your favorite band/book/movie, candy, etc.;
, Some useful items would be a mirror, a dry erase board, a magnetic pencil case, some paper lining for the inside, and decorations. Be creative. For example- if you decorate your locker with candy, like Skittles, than you can get lots of Skittles wrappers, and paste them to the wall lining.
 Use sticky tack, since that isn't permanent and is still strong enough to hold things.
 Some schools don't allow this without special permission, so ask your principal or headmaster before doing this.
 You could use felt, carpeting, wrapping paper, cardboard, etc. Do not glue or staple this in; that might damage the locker and then you will have to pay for the damage.

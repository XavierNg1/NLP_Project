 Which functions are you going to be using? If you're going to be using this for an exam, read the specification to find out which calculators are allowed and which aren't.;
, However calculators can be more expensive than you think - an auction website is a good place to look if you want a bargain.
, If you type the model numbers into Google you can often find complete hardware specifications. Compare the ones you are thinking of buying to see which spec is best for you.
 Search for your model number, and if this doesn't work try adding words like demonstration or demo to your search term.
 Is the calculator you're looking at within your price range? If not you may be able to find one on an auction website.
 Check it works correctly. To guard against case-swapping (placing the body and workings of one calculator in the case of a better one), always check the specification of your calculator immediately. How to do this varies between calculators; it is often found on the Settings, About or Hardware Specifications menus.
 It may not be something you normally do, but many calculators have functions you wouldn't expect in strange places. The best calculators will have huge instruction booklets, so read through a section at a time when you want to use a particular function. Learn the basics first, but a few of the 'coolest' things too when you want to show off to your friends. For example, if you've just bought a TI-89, find out how to do basic calculations, algebra and graphs first so you can use it in lessons, but also find out how to do 3D graphing with animation too. It looks smart even if you don't understand it!

, Take good care of it and it'll be yours for years to come!

 Yes, you may get more attention upfront if you post a picture that hides the weight you've gained. However, when you go on a date, you may end up in a tense situation if the other person feels deceived. Just be upfront with your picture, and you'll have a much happier time when you do get asked out., Like intentionally deceptive photos, using old photos sets up an expectation that you won't be able to meet. That being said, using a photo from 5 years ago or so is probably fine, as long as you still look mostly the same. However, you don't want decades-old photos., While group shots can be good if you have other solo pictures, you don't want an unlabelled shot. Make sure you point out where you are in the shot, so the viewer doesn't have to spend time hunting you down., Photos with a group of friends is fine, but you don't want a photo with just one other person of the sex you're attracted to. That is off-putting to many people because they may think you're not over that relationship.

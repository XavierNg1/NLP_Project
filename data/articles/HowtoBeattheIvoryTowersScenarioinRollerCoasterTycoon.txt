 Once you start this scenario, you'll find that this park has reached its breaking point. There's lots of vandalism of every park object, lots of vomit and litter all over the park and there are no bathrooms. Your first step is to hire lots of handymen and some security guards, placing them throughout the park.
 As your handymen and your security guards deal with the mess, you should then rebuild your park's benches, trash cans, lights, etc.

You can also elect to demolish the footpaths and redo the area all over again. In addition, you should also get food stalls, drink stalls, bathrooms, etc built right away.
  Make "Tree Topper", the Steel Mini Roller Coaster, have only one train as it can break down with Station Brakes Failure (or then set a safety mechanic patrolling the exit and add brakes before the station).

You should consider removing Force 9/Hurricane; the park's suspended coaster as this is fairly intense. With the money you get from removing this ride in the game, you can build a new coaster in its place easily.
Your second option is you can also change the trains on Force 9/Hurricane to two cars; which theoretically should make the ride less intense due to reduced velocity, and if you elect this method, it should be a popular and profitable coaster. In the event of a Safety Cut-Out, however, you may run across stalled trains at the end of the track. In one way or another, if you remove it or not, it shouldn't become a problem.
 Once you're absolutely sure all of the park's problems are taken care of, you can then move onto the rides. Begin by building some gentle and thrill rides around the park.

If your hired staff are taking too much out of your pocket, go ahead and sack a few of them, but leave enough around to keep things in check. Be sure to hire a few mechanics as well.
After you recover mostly from the problems, you might build another coaster, preferably a cheap one. This will bring in more guests and increase your park rating.

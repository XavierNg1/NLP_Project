 Don't overfill or the bag will burst open when being prodded or when frozen. Then seal tightly.


Check that it is free of holes first!
Do one bag for each shoe.
 Be careful not to squeeze too hard, lest the bag burst open and soak the shoe.


Push the bag into the nooks and crannies of the shoe as far as possible.
 The area needs to be large enough to accommodate your shoes.


Make sure that nothing else in the freezer will lean against the shoes. Anything touching the shoes could leave a stain or cause freezer burn marks if you have to pull them apart later.
 Let freeze overnight. As the water freezes, the bag will expand into the shoes and will provide a gentle shoe stretch.
 Allow to thaw for half an hour, then remove the bags.
 If you're happy with them now, they're good to go. If not, repeat the freezing process once more.
 This conditioning will restore any depleted moisture caused by the freezing process.

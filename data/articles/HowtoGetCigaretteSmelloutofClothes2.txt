 Or, just use a large plastic bag that you can tie or tape shut.



Some dryer sheets, especially scented ones, may possibly stain clothes if left in contact for a long period. Consider using a large enough bag that you can place the sheet(s) inside without touching the clothes.
 Check for smoke odor daily, and replace the dryer sheet(s) at least every couple of days. The longer you wait, the more odor neutralization will occur.
 Or, use both in combination.Baking soda is known to absorb odors, which is why people put open boxes of it in the freezer.


Use one tablespoon per 1-2 clothing items.
Add it to the clothes inside the bag, then shake the bag to distribute evenly.
Shake the excess baking soda out of the bag (outdoors, ideally) at least every couple of days, and replace.
 Shake off excess baking soda if desired, but it wonâ€™t hurt to leave it on the clothes in the wash.

 A random scattering of large and smaller rocks works well. Try to select at least two or three very large rocks to highlight your rock garden. Depending on your tastes, you may want to try to pick rocks that are all the same color and variety, as this can look more natural.


Support larger rocks with bricks or smaller stones.
 As mentioned earlier, you can create a natural look by trying to replicate how the rocks you select would be spaced in nature. If you want something less natural and more formal looking, consider creating a frame of rocks around your plant bed. This will help to define the area you will be working in and can look quite striking.
 Once you have your rocks in place, put a layer of topsoil in between the rocks. For an even more natural look, try to submerge the rocks in the soil so that they donâ€™t look like they are just floating in your yard.


Use weed-free topsoil. You may also want to use a topsoil that is 30% grit so that your soil drains well.
If you are using topsoil repurposed from another area of the garden, it may not be weed-free.
 Press the soil into the earth and water it with a garden hose to make sure air bulbs are removed. Wait a few days before planting your garden, as your rocks may shift and settle a bit.

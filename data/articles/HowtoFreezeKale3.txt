 Cut your kale into quarters and transfer a few handfuls to the blender. Measure out 1 cup (237 ml) of water and drizzle some over the kale. Turn on the blender and pulse a few times to break up the kale. Add a few more handfuls of kale and another drizzle of water. Repeat until you’ve pureed all the kale, using up to a cup of water if necessary.You can blend the kale raw or after you’ve blanched and scorched it, but make sure it’s clean.
Frozen kale puree is great for adding to soups, smoothies, and other dishes where you don’t want to notice the kale.
This method isn't suitable for salads, kale chips and other such dishes, because you won’t have access to whole kale leaves.
 To make the kale puree easier to use, distribute it evenly among ice cube trays, muffin pans, or mini muffin pans.Transfer the pans to the freezer and let the kale puree freeze, about three hours.


To freeze the kale puree in specific portion sizes, use a measuring cup to pour the kale into the mold.
 When the puree is frozen through, remove it from the ice cube trays or muffin tins and transfer it to a sealable plastic freezer bag. This will free up your ice cube trays, and make the puree easier to store.To prevent freezer burn, press out as much air as possible from the bag before sealing it.
Place the bag into the freezer to preserve the kale for up to a few months.

 After killing the dragon, quickly go back to Whiterun and go inside the Dragonsreach.
 Jarl Balgruuf the Greater will be standing at the center of the Dragonsreach hall. Approach and press the “Action” button on your controller to talk to him.
 The Jarl will praise you for your heroic act of killing the dragon. He will then name you Thane of the city—a special title given to individuals for their honorable acts. With this, he will give you the Axe of Whiterun as proof that you are indeed the city’s Thane.

 Avoid using wilted ones, as they won't take up the dye as well. You can use more carnations if you want to., It would be even better if you submerged the stem in water first, then cut the ends off underwater. This will prevent air bubbles from forming at the base of the stem. Air bubbles can clog up the stem, and prevent the colored water from flowing as well., You will need at least Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of water. How much you use depends on the size of jar you are using. The flower will soak up warm water much faster than cool water., You will need 20 to 30 drops of food coloring per 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of water. Stir the food coloring into the water with a spoon until the color is consistent.If you don't have any food coloring, you can use liquid watercolor instead (but not regular paint).
 How fast the petals change color depends on how "thirsty" the flower was and what color you are using. Some colors show up much faster than others. It also depends on how long the stem was to begin with; the longer the stem, the longer it will take.The flowers won't end up a bright and solid color; they will be streaky with patches of white.

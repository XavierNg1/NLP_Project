 To recognize less than ( < ) think about the point of the arrow pointing to the smaller number.


In the example 3 < 6, 3 is the smaller number so the arrow is pointing to it.
A silly way to think about it is thinking of the arrow as an alligator’s mouth. The alligator always eats the larger number!;
, Equal to ( = ) is the easiest symbol to understand! When numbers have the same amount as the other, equal to ( = ) sign is used between the numbers.


This includes whole numbers (4 = 4) as well as decimals (2.75 = 2.75).
 More than ( > ) is the opposite of less than ( < ) and the the wide end of the arrow is open to the larger number.


For example 680 > 45.
To go with the alligator analogy again, the alligator’s mouth is always ready to chomp the larger number.

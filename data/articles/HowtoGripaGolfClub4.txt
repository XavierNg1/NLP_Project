 But first rest the head of your putter on the ground. Unlike most standard grips, the cross-handed grip begins with your right hand. With your right palm facing upwards, allow the club to rest across your right palm so that the heel of your hand and the end of the club are even.The cross-handed putting grip is especially effective and assisting with an even putting stroke. If you have difficulty with even strokes in your putting, this grip is recommended., Your right hand, at this point, should be loose and your right thumb should be in line with the handle of the putter. Your fingers should be arranged closely together so there is no space between them., Your left pinkie finger will need to be sandwiched between the knuckle of your right forefinger and middle finger. Keep the remaining fingers of your right hand loose and uncurled around the handle. You'll first want your left pinkie link to your right grip with a hold that is comfortable, yet firm., The remaining three fingers of your left hand will curl around the handle. Your left thumb should lay atop the thumb of your right hand. Both thumbs should follow the length of the shaft of the club so both are in alignment with it.


Holding the club in this fashion will help keep your left wrist firm as you putt. This will encourage more even putting.
The cross-handed grip can look or feel awkward while you are getting used to it. It may take you some time before it becomes natural.

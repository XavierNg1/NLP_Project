 You can do it yourself. Cheernastics is best done in the summer and before school cheerleading tryouts. Complete all of the steps above, but by yourself. You can teach yourself jumps, stunts, kicks, motions, and some tumbling.
 Since you are by yourself, beg your parents to sign you up for a summer gymnastics class. If they won't give in, see if you can do a summer cheerleading or gymnastics camp. In these camps, you will learn tumbling, jumps, moves, and flexibility that you will need to become a cheernastics star. If they won't even sign you up for that, search the internet. There has to be online videos to help you learn basic tumbling and cheer skills. Never give up.
 Even though it won't be as fun by yourself, you get to do what is right for you, it will fit your schedule, and you can do what you like. So, begin your practice by jogging around your backyard. Then, do the exercises recommended to build leg and core strength along with pushups. Do some weight work if you can with bicep curls, tricep extensions, and flies. Throw a few jumps and practice a cheer. Then, stretch out your whole body, head to toe. Now, you are done! Do everyday along with the aerobics, strength, and stretching.
 Since you don't have a team, you have yourself. So, you can choose a stage name or use your nickname. If your name is Emma, go by your first and middle name or by Emmy. Jazz up your current name. Or, you can do your school's team name, especially if you will be trying out for a school sport. Same thing with the logo, you can do your school's or your own original thing.
 Perform in front of your parents, siblings, or the video camera!

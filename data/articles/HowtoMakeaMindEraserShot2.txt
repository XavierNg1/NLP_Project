 As with the shot, a mind eraser cocktail is made with equal parts vodka, coffee liqueur, and club soda. The cocktail, however, is not layered. It's mixed in a shaker, allowing the ingredients to blend together. If you want to make mind erasers for a big group, you may want to make a large batch in a mixer.


Keep in mind the fun of a mind eraser is using it as a shot. Most people prefer a layered shot, drank with a straw, to a full mind eraser cocktail. However, if guests seem to enjoy the taste of the shot, they may enjoy a mind eraser cocktail as well.
 Place 2 to 3 ice cubes into the shaker. This will chill the ingredients slightly. Then, add the coffee liqueur, vodka, and club soda. As you'll be mixing the ingredients together, the order in which you add them is of less importance here.


The amount of liqueur, vodka, and club soda you use here depends on the number of cocktails you're making. When making a cocktail for one person, stick to about 3/4 of a shot glass of each ingredient. However, if you're making two or three mind erasers, you can add more shots. Just remember to keep the ratio 1:1:1.
 Add your ingredients and shake the mixer for 10 to 15 seconds until the drink is mixed. Pour your mind eraser shot into a tumbler glass, typically used for cocktails, and enjoy your drink.

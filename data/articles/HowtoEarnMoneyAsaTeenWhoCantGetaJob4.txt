 When you need money and don’t have another way to get it, you can always ask to borrow some from family or friends, like many teens do.

You are more likely to get them to agree if you can say the specific purpose for the money, and tell them when you will be able to pay it back., Asking your parents for an allowance isn’t always easy to do. However, they might be more likely to agree if you have been doing well at home and school, and if you offer to do chores or something else in return for the allowance., If you have some money that you don’t want to or need to use for a specific purpose, you can consider saving or investing it. Savings accounts, bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and other investments can earn interest and increase the amount of money you have.However, these methods require you to not use your money during the time that it is invested.


Many investments carry some degree if risk that you might lose money, so make sure you can handle this possible outcome. In other words, you might not want to invest money if you know you need it for something else.
Depending on your age and the type of investment, you might need an adult to help you open an account.
If your parents support the idea of you investing, you might ask them to match the funds you put away. For instance, you can ask them to contribute $25 for every $100 that you save, so that you will actually save $125 every time instead of $100 each time. You can also promise not to withdraw the money for a certain amount of time, such as until you are 25.
Saving even a little bit can make a difference over time. Consider trying hard to make yourself save at least a little bit whenever you can, instead of spending all of your money.

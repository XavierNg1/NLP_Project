 Choose a stem that has a growing tip with at least two pairs of leaves under it. Snip the stem off just above the set of leaves that are third from the top. The cutting should be about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) long., Use a sharp knife to remove the extra leaves sticking out from the leaf node, as well as the stem below the leaf node.
 Apply hormone powder to the cut portion of the stem by quickly dipping the end into the powder. Rooting hormone encourages the development of roots.
 A well-drained and nutritional mix, like one made with compost and vermiculite, works well. Use a 2.25-inch (7.5-cm) pot for one cutting or 3-inch (7.6-cm) pot for three to four cuttings.
 The cuttings need plenty of light to thrive, but direct sun can cause more harm than good. A good place to let them sit would be beneath a sunny window with sheer curtains.
 Use a spray bottle and apply enough water to keep the surface of the growing medium moist, but do not soak it. If the plants sit in water, the stem may rot.
 Once the plant has several stems growing off it, the roots should be sturdy enough to transplant. Carefully pry the plant—stems, roots, and soil—from its current container. Transfer each plant individually into separate pots that are at least 3.5 inches (9 cm). Make sure that the pots have been previously filled with the same growing medium.


Note that instead of planting the fuchsia cutting into a smaller pot and later transplanting it into a larger, "middle stage" pot, you can also plant the cutting directly into this middle stage pot. You will need to be more vigilant about proper lighting and watering conditions in order to ensure that the cutting takes root, though.
Continue keeping the soil moist, and provide the same type of sun you provided while in the beginning stages.

 Most items for sale at Able Sisters ring in around 200–300 bells a piece, so this will require you to buy quite a bit.


You could save these wardrobe choices in your closet to prepare for Gracie’s fashion checks, gift them to your villagers, or you could simply sell them back at Re-Tail for a loss.
By spending money in the shop, you are supporting the town’s local economy and enabling the Kicks shop to open next door.;
, Kicks will be built in your town as long as it has been at least 10 days since you first started the game and created your town.


Kicks sells shoes and socks, which are important items to have down the road to coordinate for Gracie’s fashion checks.
 The 10,000-bell requirement can be split between Kicks and Able Sisters.
 Once you’ve spent 10,000 bells and waited 10 more days, Shampoodle will be built on top of Able Sisters.


Shampoodle will take 4 days to be built, and once it’s done, you can enjoy tweaking your character’s appearance.

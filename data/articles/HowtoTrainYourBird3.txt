 You may not have realized it, but you can house train a bird! Other than the benefit of cleaning up fewer messes, house training your bird will enhance your bond with him and allow you to have a better understanding of his body language. The command you choose should be short, such as ‘go potty’ or ‘go poop.’Each person in your household should use the same command., Your bird’s cage probably seems like an obvious place for your bird to defecate. However, if you have him outside of his cage often, you may want to choose another object, such as newspaper or a wastebasket, where he can relieve himself.Whichever location/object you choose, use it consistently as you are house training your bird.
 Your bird will let you know when he has to go to the bathroom. For example, he may crouch his body. He may also move his tail, fluff his feathers, or step backward.Being able to recognize this body language will let you be one step ahead of him and give him the command before he defecates.It would also be helpful to make a note of when he usually goes to the bathroom. Most birds will defecate first thing in the morning, after meals, and when they are taken out of and placed back into their cages.Smaller birds tend to go the bathroom more frequently than larger birds., As soon as you see your bird making motions to relieve himself, command him to step up on your finger and move him to the area where he should defecate. Give him the verbal command and reward him immediately after he relieves himself.Practice this each time your bird needs to defecate so that he forms the association between defecating in the right location and being rewarded for it.Do not punish him if he defecates in the wrong location. Doing this may backfire—he might defecate in the wrong place just to get your attention.

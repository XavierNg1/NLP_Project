 Prepare your carpet for odor-removal treatment by thoroughly vacuuming it first. If your carpet is holding a lot of dirt, sweep it first with a broom to lift the fibers and loosen the dirt, then vacuum.
 Carpets can be effectively cleaning using products you probably already have in your cabinets. Mix the following ingredients in a bowl you don't plan to use again for cooking:


1 cup borax (available at hardware stores)
2 cups cornmeal
1/2 cup baking soda

, Fill a spray bottle with a solution of half vinegar, half water and spray the areas that need the most help. Be sure not to completely douse them with liquid, since you don't want unevaporated moisture to lead to mold growth.
 Spread it evenly around the carpet, focusing on the areas that tend to get dirtiest or smell the most. Leave the room and let the mixture sit on the carpet for an hour.


Keep children and pets out of the room while the mixture sits on the carpet.
Don't use more powder than your vacuum can handle. A light sprinkling should be enough to remove odors and light stains.
 Run the vacuum several times over the carpet to clean up the cornmeal mixture. When you're finished, discard the vacuum bag.

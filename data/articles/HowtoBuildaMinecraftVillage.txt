 It's important because you'll get the idea of how large to build, preferably around 50x60. You can break this afterwards, yet having a wall around your village will help protect it from mobs. Having a gate will allow access to the outside of your village.


It's better to have somewhere for your White House, so make more places for the White House, probably 55x70. But you can decide how big is your White House.;
, Preferably, you will be the mayor as you built it all, so it can also be your house. However, this is optional.
 You can also build city roads if you think your village needs to be better.
 Size and the amount of houses in the street is all up to you. If you have a small foundation, maybe 3 cottages on each side. If it is large, maybe 4 houses on each side.
 The basic ones:


Shop/Market/Supermarket
Restaurant/Cafe/Pub
Bank
School
Church
Jails/police stations/hospitals

, You didn't build a village for yourself, so spawn some villagers by using /summon villager command. You can change the attributes of villagers upon summoning them.
 It depends, really. What are your community lots? Having a shop will allow shopkeepers, and a school will allow teachers. Think about that.
 You provide a nice shelter for your citizens, so use the imagination to create laws for your village. Also, think of some punishments for those rebels who break your law(s).
,, Have fun playing as a mayor!


Be creative! You can also try building some cool skyscraper houses!

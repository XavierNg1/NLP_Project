 If you have a set schedule, then your body is much more likely to sleep even with the stress of a big event. A normal routine lets your body knows when it needs to go to sleep. Some of this may be conditioning, some of it may be natural inclination.Avoid trying to sleep when you’re not tired. If you lay in bed fully awake, then you will toss and turn, which could cause you considerable more stress. If you are still awake after fifteen minutes, get up and find a relaxing activity to do such as light reading.Be rigid. Variability can be ruinous to developing routines.
 It’s best to have everything you need for the big event, like clothes or items, ready long before you go to bed. Avoid staying up late to gather what you need as it will cause stress and keep you up.Write it all down.
Avoid this if you know you have a tendency to be obsessive.
 A ritual will help tell your body that it’s time to go to bed. It will also help clear your head so that your fall asleep faster. Create a schedule for the two hours before bedtime. In this schedule, set-aside 30-minute blocks for relaxing activities.


For instance, if you went to bed at 10 pm, make that the time when you turn off any electronic or blue screen devices is at 8 pm.
At 8 pm, take a warm bath.
At 8:30, take time to reflect on the day and any pressing thoughts.
At 9:00, do a relaxing activity such as reading a book or stretching.
During the last thirty minutes, write down anything that is still troubling your thoughts. Write out possible solutions or outcomes to this problem instead of reiterating the problem.

 For your contour shade you want to pick out a foundation, concealer, or bronzer that's a bit darker than you down skin. Test the shade in a small patch of your skin to check the color on your body. This will help assure you the area on your face where you put the makeup isn't too dark or light.;
, You'll need to have a brush that you can use for whichever makeup you choose from above. A foundation brush is good for liquid concealer and foundation. An angled brush, or slim brush would be best for the bronzing and highlighting powder.
 You will want to apply the makeup on the sides of your nose, blending it softly for a more natural look. Do not get any on the bridge of your nose. Also try not to get the bronzer too close to your cheeks. You can also apply it on the bottom or tip of your nose, depending on what you want to emphasize.


Apply foundation to both sides of your nose if your nose is too long. This will help it look shorter.
If your nose is too wide, add the darker foundation to the area underneath your nostrils. This will help your nose look narrower.
Also drag the color up and into the hollows of your eyes to give a more chiseled and defined appearance.
 Subtle highlighting can help to complement the contour of your nose beautifully. Pick out a shade that is 2-3 shades lighter than your natural skin tone, then apply the highlight on the bridge of your nose and the optional brow bone.


Once again be careful not to touch the main part of your nose and the bridge, because you're trying to slim things down.

Fill a tin can 1/3 full of sand. Use masking tape to affix your balloon inside the can on all sides. Smooth down the masking tape wherever there are bumps. The can will serve as a neck to your paper mache head.
 Mix 1 part water with 1 part flour.


Most paper mache recipes suggest 2 parts water to 1 part flour. You want your recipe to be a little bit thicker for your paper mache head, but feel free to dilute it with more water to make it easier to work with.
 Tear a few larger squares and set aside.

,, You should have done 4 paper mache coats on your mannequin head. Allow them to dry completely.

 There are a few options.


Spray your mannequin head with a light coat of spray adhesive and cover the head with fabric. Cut off at the bottom edge of the can so that the can will stand.






Paint the mannequin with colored paint. For light colors, make sure to do more than 1 coat. Use spray paint for a fast application.






For a detailed painted mannequin head, use different color paints to draw features.






Take a plain or patterned nylon sock or tights. Stretch it over the head of the mannequin head and the can. Knot it at the back of the can. This is the fastest way to cover your mannequin with a layer of fabric, as it does not require any drying time.

 Here's what you'll need to make ginger ale using the old-fashioned method:


1 cup (225 g) sugar
2 tablespoons (30 g) freshly grated ginger root
Juice of one lemon
1/4 teaspoon (1.6 g) fresh granular baker's yeast
Cold, pure water;
, Leave the funnel in place until all the steps are complete and you are ready to cap the bottle.
 Use any brand that you might buy in the health food store.
 Shake the bottle to disperse the yeast grains into the sugar granules.
 Use the side of the grater with the finest teeth.
, Lemon is important to keep the pH level low and ward off unwanted microorganisms. If you don't like lemon, try grapefruit juice instead.
, It may stick in the funnel. Don't worry, the next steps will wash it into the bottle.
 Add the rinsing water to the bottle.
 This helps activate the yeast and gets the carbonation process going.
 Leave about an inch of head space, then securely screw the cap down to seal. The head space is necessary to leave room for gasses that will be produced during fermentation. Invert the bottle repeatedly to thoroughly dissolve sugar.


Check the bottom of the bottle because the sugar tends to stick in little pockets there. The ginger root will not dissolve, of course.
 The warmth is necessary for the yeast to be able to ferment the brew. But don't forget about it! Too long and the alcohol concentration starts to increase and the taste changes greatly.
 If it dents in as in the picture, it is not ready; the fermentation produces carbon dioxide (like in sodas and seltzers) that will inflate the bottle and make it difficult to squeeze.
 Refrigerate at least overnight to thoroughly chill before opening. Crack the lid off the cool ginger ale just a little to release the pressure slowly. You do not want a ginger ale fountain!

 Lay out all of the livers youâ€™re trimming so that they are flat. This might require that you unfold the livers, as they often come out of the container balled up., Livers have connective tissue running through them, similar to what you might find on a chicken breast. This tissue is usually white or pink and is stringy.You should also look for any greenish parts on the liver, as these will cause the liver to taste bitter., Using a sharp knife or scissors, trim the meat away from the connective tissue. This might take more than one or two passes with the knife, since each liver can have multiple areas with connective tissue.

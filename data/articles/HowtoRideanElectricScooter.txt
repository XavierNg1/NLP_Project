 Most charging ports on electric scooters are at the base of the handle bars, way at the bottom. While the scooter is charging (3 hours-overnight) you should read the manual.;
, This sounds dumb but it is a common mistake. Turn your scooter on. The switch should be near the charging port.
 On your right handle bar should be the throttle. Slowly turn the throttle towards you and kick off with the foot still on the ground.
 Steer it just like a bike.
 Try to plan trips accordingly.

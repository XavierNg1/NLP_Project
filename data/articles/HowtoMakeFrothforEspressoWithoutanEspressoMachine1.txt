 Pour your desired amount of milk into a glass jar that has a tight-fitting lid. Use 2% or nonfat milk for the best foam.Use any size glass jar, but make sure your milk fills no more than half of it, as it will take up more space when frothed.;
, Screw on the jar lid tightly and shake the jar as hard as you can for 30 to 60 seconds. It should look frothy and approximately doubled in volume.
 Take off the lid and put the jar into the microwave for 30 seconds to set the foam and make it warm for adding to your espresso.
 Use a spoon to hold back the foam at first, allowing the portion of the milk that is still liquid to pour into your espresso. Then spoon the thicker milk foam on top of your espresso and milk.For a cappuccino, you want about the same amount of warm milk as milk foam added to the espresso, and for a latte, you want twice the amount of warm milk as milk foam. To achieve this, you may need to warm up more milk in the microwave to get the right amount.

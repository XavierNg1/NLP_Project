 This recipe calls for the following items:


One large pot
One cup of cornstarch
One pound of baking soda
One cup of water
1/8 teaspoon of cooking oil
Food coloring

, Stir thoroughly to make the mixture as uniform a consistency as possible., Keep a close eye on the mixture so it does not burn. Stir as needed until the mixture becomes "mealy" in texture., Transfer the dough to a plate and cover it with a damp, clean cloth until it cools., Once the dough becomes cool enough to work with your hands, you'll want to knead it to make it malleable., Once the dough is cool, keep it in an airtight container while it's not being used. Sandwich bags or plastic storage containers work best.

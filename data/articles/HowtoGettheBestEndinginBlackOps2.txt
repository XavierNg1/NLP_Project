 In the mission “Pyrrhic Victory,” Woods had disappeared while he was helping rebels fight against Angola’s Marxist government; you must successfully rescue Woods.;
, In the mission “Old Wounds,” you have to resist shooting Kravchenko; instead, interrogate him.


After the interrogation, though, Kravchenko will still be killed, but he has to be killed after he admits that he was associated with Menendez and that his men were inside the CIA.
 In the mission “Suffer with Me,” instead of shooting the person in the head, who is actually Mason, shoot him in the leg. This will cause Menendez to shoot both of Woods’ legs, crippling him.


You might have to shoot Mason in the leg twice.
,, In the mission “Celerium,” you have to recover the Celerium Worm.
 In the mission “Karma,” you have to successfully save Karma and prevent DeFalco from escaping, and kill him.


If you fail this mission, you have a second chance of saving Karma by doing the “Strike Force” mission of saving Karma.
 In the mission “Achilles’ Veil,” you have to let Farid live by killing Harper. Lynch’s/Karma’s survival is dependent on Farid’s survival.
 In the mission “Odysseus,” you will be playing as Menendez. You have to shoot Admiral Briggs in the leg. This will cause JSOC and SDC to enter an alliance, allowing SDC to assist JSOC later.


Since SDC and JSOC have allied, the SDC assists in defending Brigg’s ship, “Barack Obama,” by sending their drones.
 In the mission “Cordia Die,” when Menendez is able to hack into USS Obama, he also sent the hacked drones from the ship to attack Los Angeles, where a meeting of G20 leaders is taking place. As Section, all you have to do is protect the president, who is en route to the meeting.
 In the mission “Judgement Day,” JSOC is able to trace the source of the hacking of drones. Section leads JSOC forces to apprehend or kill Menendez. In order to get the best ending, you just have to capture Menendez, NOT kill him.

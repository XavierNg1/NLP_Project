 You can't expect to pull off a bold lip look if your lips are chapped and cracked. You want to make sure your lips are extra smooth. The first thing you want to do is exfoliate your lips. This may seem tedious and pointless, but it's really a lot of help. You can make your own lip scrub by mixing together sugar and honey and spreading it on your lips with a toothbrush. After rubbing it in well, wipe it off with a tissue.;
,, Make sure it matches or is darker than your lip's natural color. Make the lines very thick and precise.
, Don't be afraid to use candy colors and metallics. Also, there are many ways to do a rainbow lip. You can do horizontal or vertical stripes. So start by getting a very small tiny lip brush and your eyeshadow palette.
 It can be stripes, swirls, or even tie-dye. Look at the pictures for ideas. Don't forget to clean your brush after each color.
 For example, if half of your lips are blue, line that side of your lips with blue. If the other half of your lips are red, line that side with red. This is a really simple and easy trick because it's much better than going out to the store and buying multiple lip liners for one look. You can also use wet wipe to wipe away any color that is out of the lips.
, That might ruin and smear the design. Smacking or rubbing your lips together in this look is only okay when you want the colors to be swirly.

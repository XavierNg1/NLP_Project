 You'll need a small container of flour; a soft, fat makeup brush (like a blush brush), and clear tape to lift the prints. When you're ready to dust for prints, sprinkle a tiny bit of flour on the object.Use your brush to gently sweep away the extra powder. The fingerprint should appear clearly. Don't brush too hard or you can smear the print.
Use a strip of clear tape to lift the fingerprint. Tape it to a piece of black paper and bring it back to headquarters for analysis.
 The gloves will ensure you leave no trace behind as you gather clues or steal important evidence. Use the tweezers to lift clues and store them in the containers.
 You may find a tiny clue--a colored thread, a suspicious substance, or something else that requires close examination. Your magnifying glass will help you see things that others might miss.

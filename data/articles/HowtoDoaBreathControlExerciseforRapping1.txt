 You’ll feel your chest depress slowly as the air escapes your lungs; this will feel uncomfortable at first but you’ll quickly get used to it.


Start slowly when first performing this exercise. It’s possible to hurt yourself if you release the air too quickly or too strongly. If you feel discomfort or pain, stop immediately.;
, In doing this, you are fully extending the muscles in your diaphragm. This helps to condition and strengthen your diaphragm. It will improve your endurance and make you less likely to run out of breath.As you hold this position, your reflex will be to inhale. Resist this temptation or you’ll limit the exercise’s effectiveness.
 Inhale as soon as you’ve held your breath for 5 seconds. Once your lungs are completely filled with air, hold this position for 10 seconds. Filling your lungs this way helps to expand your lung capacity, meaning you’ll need to take less breaths when you rap., This helps re-establish normal oxygen levels in preparation for your next repetition. You shouldn’t perform the exercise multiple times back to back without resetting; this could injure your respiratory system.
 Between the exercise itself and the recuperation between each “rep”, you should be able to perform about 15-20 reps per 20 minute set. Your 3 daily sets don’t necessarily have to be performed one after the other; feel free to perform them throughout the day. For instance, you can perform one when you wake up in the morning, one around lunch and one just before bed.


If you perform this exercise daily, you should see noticeable results within 4-8 weeks as your diaphragm becomes stronger and more flexible.
Doing this will allow you to flow stronger for longer periods of time. As you’re not constantly rushing for breath, you’ll sound more confident when performing and have the ability to add more emphasis to your lyrics.

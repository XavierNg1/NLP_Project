 Pick out fillets with the skin on, since it becomes deliciously crispy when you sauté fillets. Buy fillets with metallic pink skin and firm flesh. You will need 1/4 to 1/3 pound per serving size.
 Pat the fillets with a paper towel to make sure they're completely dry, then sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper., Heat the oil until it's hot, but not smoking.
 When the oil is hot, slip them into the pan. Cook them until the skin is golden brown, about three minutes. Monitor the heat while they cook to make sure the skin isn't getting burned. If it turns brown right away, reduce the heat.
 The fillets should cook on the other side for about three more minutes. The fish is done when it’s no longer translucent and flakes easily when poked with a fork.
 They're excellent with melted butter and lemon juice.

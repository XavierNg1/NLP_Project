 As mentioned before, having a dewy, moist look is essential for Korean beauty. Lip glosses and tints, rather than a drier lipstick, are the way to go. Although very natural makeup looks are the norm, many people wear bright red lip gloss/lip tint., This is a style first used on a Korean drama that has since grown hugely popular.Apply a bright pink color lipstick to the inside of your lips. Apply a little foundation to the outside of your lips. Blend the two products across your lips, so that they form a consistent gradient. Once you've gotten practice, try other colors like red, orange, peach, or brighter pinks. This is probably the most ubiquitous Korean beauty trend. Despite its popularity, it's sometimes considered a bit weird-looking to Westerners, so don't be surprised if you get confused glances.

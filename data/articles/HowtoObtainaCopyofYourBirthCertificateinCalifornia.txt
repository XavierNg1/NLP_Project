Here you will see all the steps you need to follow. You can download all the necessary forms directly from this website.;
, Depending on who you are, and whose birth certificate you are attempting obtain, you will be able to obtain either an "authorized copy," or an "informational copy" of the document. In California, “authorized copies” can only be obtained by the person named on the birth certificate, parents of the person named on the certificate and a few other people.The other people who can obtain authorized copies of your birth certificate are: your children, your grandparents, your grandchildren, a member entitled to a record of your birth by court order, a licensed adoption agency complying with Section 3140 or 7603 of the Family Code, a representative of the law (such as a police officer,) your attorney or anyone court appointed to act on your behalf.
All other requesters may obtain an informational copy only. An informational copy contains the same information as an authorized copy, but is not a valid document to establish identity.
All birth certificates issued—whether authorized or informational—are certified., The next step is to download a pamphlet for obtaining certified copies of birth records from the CDPH website here, which is available as a PDF here: http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/birthdeathmar/Documents/Birth-2015.pdf. This pamphlet is a comprehensive guide to the processes and fees. It also includes answers to some frequently asked questions.

The pamphlet includes the application form, and sworn statement, which you need to complete and submit.
Be sure to read through all the instructions on how to complete the application before you get started.You can also download the application form and the sworn statement directly here: http://www.cdph.ca.gov/pubsforms/forms/CtrldForms/VS111.pdf.
 Now you will need to complete the application form in full, following the guidelines given. You will need to state what kind of copy you require, authorized or informational, as well as stating your connection to the person named on the birth certificate.

You must provide personal information about the person applying for the birth certificate. This includes the name and address, as well as the reason for requesting the certificate.
You will be asked to the name, city of birth, date of birth, and parents of the person named on the certificate, to the best of your knowledge., A notary public is someone who is legally authorized to perform legal formalities. If you're ordering an “authorized copy”, you must have your sworn statement notarized. This means that you need to take your sworn statement to the notary public. They will authorize your sworn statement and seal it.You can access a full and updated database of Notary Publics in California by visiting the Secretary of State's website: http://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/notary-public-listing/.
You can also look up Notary Publics by city, zip code, and county through online search tools.You don’t need to do this if you are only ordering an “informational copy,” but you must indicate this on your application.
If you do not state that you want an “informational copy,” and you do not present a notarized statement, your application will be sent back to you and you will have to send it in again with the proper information., A certified birth certificate fee must accompany your application. Requests received without the appropriate fee will be returned. The current fee for a certified copy of a birth certificate is $25.

Do not send cash. CDPH won't be responsible if cash is lost in the mail.
Know that if no record is found, the CDPH will issue a statement stating Certificate of No Public Record, and will keep the fee for the search, as per state law., You should send in your completed application, your notarized sworn statement (if you applying for an “authorized copy”), and the check or postal order for the certified copy fee to the California Department of Public Health.

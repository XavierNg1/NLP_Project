 To pick the right one we need to think about how your going to use the gun in game. The M16 fires very accurate 3 round bursts, so using it at mid to long range would give you the biggest advantage and also give you room to breath if you miss. Knowing this, lets take a look at each attachment.;
, This is a close range attachment and we are using a long range gun, so if you find yourself in a situation where the launcher becomes useful you’ve made a mistake in choosing a spot. Not to mention its going to eat up a spot in your perks.
 You don't want a silencer when you get into 1v1 fights since it hurts your range. You do want the silencer when you peek through windows or perches to get pick kills.
 It doesn’t effect anything important on your guns stats so that gives it an advantage over the others.

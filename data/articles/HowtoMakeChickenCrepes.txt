When the asparagus breaks, cut the tender portion with the tip into two-inch pieces.

 Heat 6 tbsp butter in 2-3 quart pan over moderate heat. When the foam subsides, whisk in flour. Cook for several minutes (5 to 10) until mixture has a nice golden appearance. Gradually add milk, wine and chicken broth and simmer for 5 to 8 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup and set aside.
 Add black pepper to taste. If mixture becomes too thick, slowly stir in a little more milk until it's smooth enough to fill crepes with.
 Repeat with remaining crepes. Arrange the assembled chicken crepes side by side in an oiled baking dish. Pour the reserved bechamel sauce over the top of crepes. Bake for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Before serving, sprinkle parsley over the top of each crepe for garnish.

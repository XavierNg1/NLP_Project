 Some individuals experience psoriasis flare-ups after any skin irritation. This may include overexposure to the sun's UV rays and minor abrasions to the skin.Wear long sleeves/pants for several days after receiving a vaccination. Try to limit your overall exposure to the sun.
 When you bathe, you're removing scales and simultaneously soothing your skin. This can dramatically reduce the symptoms of a psoriasis outbreak and improve your skin's appearance.Try adding colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts, or Dead Sea salts to your bath water.
Use lukewarm water instead of hot water to soothe your skin and reduce the chances of irritation.
Do not use harsh soaps/oils, as these may further irritate your skin. Instead, use mild soaps with added fats and oils.

, This can easily become a Christmas wreath with red and green yarn colors, an Easter wreath with pastels, a spring wreath with pale green, blue and yellow, etc etc.,,,, There are two easy ways to handle this.





 Preformed base Wreath.

1–If using a wreath base, you can simply hot glue or wire each ball onto the base in a pleasing pattern.
2–If using galvanized wire,







Cut your base wire to a length that will form a circle of the size you want plus 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) extra for fastening.






Poke the wire through each ball of yarn to "string" them onto the wire.






Poke the ends of the wire into the "end ball" to finish it off. Hot glue the ends together if you're concerned about the circle widening.

 Open a new tab on your web browser and go to the Twitter website. Two text boxes will appear on the center of the login page. One is for entering your Twitter username and the other is for inputting the password.;
, The account username is your Twitter handle, the one that begins with @. You can also use the email address or phone number you registered with Twitter.
 Do this in the second text box. Make sure that it is the password for the Twitter account that you want to recover, and that it is correct.
 As soon as you are logged in, your account is reactivated. Your home page is automatically displayed when you successfully log into your Twitter account.

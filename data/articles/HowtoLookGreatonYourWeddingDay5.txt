 Just before you go out and begin your wedding, take a few deep breaths. You want to feel and appear relaxed. Remember that it's normal to feel wedding jitters, just about everyone does! Close your eyes and focus on your breath, allowing tension to escape your body. This will ensure that you appear confident and graceful as you begin the service., This is one of the most important days of your life, so don't forget to smile! Let everyone see how excited you are to start the next chapter of your life with the one you love. Smiling truly brings out your radiance and beauty, and can even make you more relaxed and confident. , You just got married! You probably don't have your appearance on your mind, but after the service and before the reception, you should do a quick touch-up. The passionate kiss you shared with your spouse may have shifted your hair or makeup, and you want to make sure everything is on point for the next part of your day. , During your reception, you will no doubt be eating a drinking. Avoid spilling anything on your dress or suit by eating carefully. Make sure you are eating over your plate and not leaning back to much. Place any beverages in front of your plate and try not to do any reaching. Place a napkin in your lap and make sure it covers your entire lap.


If you drop something on your dress or suit, immediately got to the kitchen or bathroom. Get a clean napkin or towel and moisten it with water. Then dab the area repeatedly until you see the stain coming out. Do not vigorously rub or scrub the area. Though it seems counterintuitive, dabbing is actually the best way to get out a stain.

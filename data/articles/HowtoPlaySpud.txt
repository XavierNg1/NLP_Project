 They will not be it for the whole game, just to start out. It must secretly give each player a number, including themselves. Although numbers work best, sports, colors, and animals work as well. Try to make the numbers in a certain range, usually 1 to 10. If you have at least 8 players, use 1 through 12. Make sure that each player has their own number.
 It must then shout out a number while throwing the ball in the air. All players, including "it", must run away from the ball. But, if your number is called, you must catch the ball and say "Spud!" When you say "spud", everyone must freeze., Now, they have to throw it at that player. If they miss, or the player catches the ball, the thrower gets an "S". If the player gets hit, they get an "S". The player that they hit (or missed) is the next thrower., If a ghost number is called, everyone must rush up to the ball and touch it. The last player to do so gets a letter., For each letter a player gets, spell out S-P-U-D. If you spell out S-P-U-D you lose. The last player standing is the winner.

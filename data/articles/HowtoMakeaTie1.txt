 You do not have to limit yourself to a certain type of fabric to make a great tie, but heavier fabrics do tend to wear better. For one tie, you'll need at least 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of fabric for the front of the tie and about 5 x 6 inches of fabric for the back liner.Silk is a popular choice for tie liners.
For a casual tie, go for patterned cotton, linen or denim.;
, Ties are made with a material called interfacing, which is sewn or ironed into the inside of the tie as a liner. It allows fabrics to keep a firm shape. You will need 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of interfacing in a color that matches the tie fabric.For fusible interfacing, you will put the glazed side face down on the tie fabric to permanently adhere it to the tie. Be sure to buy sewable, fusible interfacing because you will be sewing the tie later on.Interfacing that is sewn-in does not have a glaze on it. It is sewn to the inside of the seam line so there won't be visible stitching on the outside of the tie., In addition to the fabric and interfacing, you will need to buy the following supplies:


Fine thread that matches the tie fabric
A good pair of fabric scissors
Either a needle (if you're sewing the tie by hand) or a sewing machine
Straight pins
Measuring tape
Iron

, There are many tie patterns available for you to choose from. Once you find a style you like, you can print the outline for it online for free. The alternative to printing a tie outline would be to use a ruler to trace another tie out yourself.








When tie outlines print, they will continue onto more than one page because the length of the tie will be longer than a standard sheet of printing paper. Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric.
You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam.

 Before starting any diet, schedule an appointment with your doctor. They can advise you if you are healthy enough for the raw diet. Ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian who may can help you create a meal plan to make sure you’re getting enough protein on a raw diet.


Be honest with your doctor about your plans to be on a raw diet as well as the reasons why. Ask any questions you may have about the diet’s safety for your personal health.
 Every individual needs protein to maintain his or her health and wellbeing. It helps you build muscle and make things like hair, blood, connective tissue, and antibodies. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of protein for an individual is 0.8 g per kilogram body weight. Aim to get your personal RDA every day.Calculate how much protein you need by using an online protein calculator, such as this one from United States Department of Agriculture: http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/. Keep in mind that the RDA is for a sedentary adult., For any person, it’s important to vary his or her food choices. This ensures you get the broad range of vital nutrients to maintain your health and wellbeing. As someone on a raw food diet, eating a variety of foods is especially important because there are many things you can’t eat. Aim to incorporate as many different (naturally) colored foods as you can at each meal.Try having a smoothie for breakfast with an avocado, some fresh berries, a handful of spinach or kale, and some spirulina. You can mix this with either fresh pressed juice or ice. For lunch, have a big mixed salad with foods like watercress, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, some pumpkin seeds and almonds. You can have sashimi for dinner with a cold soup such as gazpacho. If you don’t eat meat or dairy, have some peanut butter and a selection of cut fruits and vegetables.

 Sometimes, your cat will get something in its eye that will cause irritation. It could be a splinter, for instance. It could also be something like sand, glass, metal, or really any small object that attaches to the cat's eye.You'll see watering, of course, as well as redness and swelling. The cat may try to scratch at its eye, and the eye might twitch a bit.
 Cats are sometimes able to get scratches or ulcers in their eyes. They can accidentally catch their eyes with one of their own claws, or an eye could be scratched by another cat (either in play or in a fight). They can also catch their eye on other objects. Even not enough tears can cause a cat to get an ulcer in its eye, as the eyelid rubs against the eye without lubrication., The veterinarian will obviously need to remove any object in your cat's eye. A simple flush may do it, but they may also need to use tweezers. In some cases, the eye may need to be sewn up. The vet will also likely prescribe antibiotics, either in eye drop form or a pill.In some cases, the eyelid may need to be sewn closed for a period to heal.
 Sometimes, the eyelids or hairs around the eyes are what cause the eye to tear up. In those cases, it may be appropriate for the cat to have surgery to correct the issue, though it cannot always be corrected., Sometimes, a cat will just have watery eyes that cannot be changed. If your cat is this way, you should wash around the cat's eyes each day with a warm, wet cloth. Make sure to dry off the area, as well.Your vet may also suggest tetracycline to help when the tears are particularly irritating. Your veterinarian might recommend other anti-inflammatory or antibiotic medications.

 This operation is called mastopexy.Under general anesthesia, the surgeon removes excess skin, lifts your breasts, and cuts away the nipples to position them higher on your chest. Because it involves cutting around the nipple tissue, you will risk losing sensation there. As with any surgery, other risks are infection and blood loss. You can minimize the risk of blood loss by telling your doctor if you are on any medication to thin your blood, and by refraining from drinking alcohol and taking aspirin prior to the procedure.


The recovery time is about three to five days for normal daily activities and four to six weeks to resume your exercise program.
 In this new procedure, the surgeon uses the laser to cut away just the outer layer of the skin so that the tissue just beneath can be cut away. He or she then attaches this tissue under the breasts to form an internal bra. This process is called "pedicle de-epithelialization."Many surgeons prefer this technique as it reduces blood loss and tissue damage while also improving the skin's firmness.


Like traditional breast lifts, it is done under general anesthesia.
The recovery time is the same as with a traditional breast lift.
Since the nipple is not removed, you won't experience any loss of sensation.
Some plastic surgeons claim that the results are longer lasting that a typical breast lift because of the internal support.
The risks are the same as with any other surgery.
 This procedure involves the surgeon placing a cup made of hard silicone inside and under the breasts.The surgeon then secures the cups with silk straps screwed to the ribs. This forms an invisible bra that holds the breasts in a perkier position. Three women in the United Kingdom have had this done so far.


This procedure is still experimental, and it may be a while before it becomes available to everyone.
No one knows how effective it will be in the long-term, as well as what the long-term risks are.

 Pat the pork loin steaks dry with paper towels and set them aside. Pour Â½ to 1 cup (60 to 125 g) of flour onto a shallow plate. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of ground pepper onto the flour. Use your fingers to mix the salt and pepper into the flour.If your steaks are thick (over an inch tall), turn on the oven on to 400 degrees.;
, Place a heavy bottomed skillet or cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add 1/4 cup of vegetable or canola oil and let it heat up. There should be enough oil to cover the entire bottom of your pan. If there isn't, add more oil.Avoid pan-frying the steaks in olive oil or butter. These will burn over the high heat.
 Lay each steak into the seasoned flour so that that it's coated. Turn each steak over so that they're completely covered in the mixture. Lift the steaks up and shake off the excess flour mixture. Wash your hands with soap and water after handling the raw steaks to prevent the spread of disease.It's a good idea to handle the steaks with one hand while using your other hand to sprinkle the flour mixture over the steak. This keeps one hand dry so the flour mixture doesn't stick to you.
 Once the oil is hot and shimmering, carefully lower the prepared steaks into the pan. Cook the steaks for 3 minutes on medium-high heat. Use tongs to flip the steaks over and cook for another 3 minutes. The steaks should be golden brown. If they're thin, they should be finished cooking. If they're thick, transfer them to the oven to finish cooking for another 6 to 10 minutes.Regardless of thickness, the pork loin steaks should be at 145 degrees F (60 C) before they're ready to serve.
If you're finishing the steaks in the oven, ensure that the pan you use is oven safe.

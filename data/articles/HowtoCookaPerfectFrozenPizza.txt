 This way, your oven will be at a steady temperature when you put the pizza in.
 If you were to take the pizza out of the freezer before you put it in the oven, you would be letting the cheese and any other toppings defrost. When this happens, the pizza won't taste as good as it should. Only allow the pizza to defrost when you put it in the oven; that way, it cooks evenly, making sure that everything is thawed at the same time., If you aren't careful when doing this, the excess cheese that you need to make the pizza taste extra delicious will fall off or get stuck to the packaging, and you will be left with a bland pizza, which won't taste as good as it deserves to., When putting the pizza in the oven don't pick it up with your hands from the cardboard. If you do this you could risk breaking your pizza into pieces. Instead, when putting it in, slide it gently off the cardboard into the oven, so that it is nicely laid onto the pizza pan for heating. Also make sure that it is placed in the middle of the oven., When baking the frozen pizza, you are given a requirement of about 20 to 22 minutes for the pizza to cook. To make your pizza even better, you may consider cooking it for up to 23-27 minutes for total cooking time. This will brown up the cheese a little more and hardens the outside of your crust, if you're into crunchy crusts.

 If you have ever heard of Summer and Winter fairies, you can write about them; or you could write about fairies of elements such as Water, Wind, Fire, Wood, etc. You can do a quick Google search on fairy legends and folklore for more inspiration (or go further than Google and Wikipedia, if this subject really interests you). Take bits and pieces of the fairies you come across that you like. Go to the library to see how other authors have written their fairies before you.;
, A good place to start looking for names is their element or theme. The name "Pearl" might fit a water/sea fairy, "Breeze" for a wind fairy, or "Sparks" for a fire fairy. These fairy names are all fairly simple; don't be afraid to think outside the box! Keep in mind that their name doesn't necessarily have to be based on their element, but it is a good starting point.
 Transformation stories can go anywhere- a human turning into a fairy, or vice versa. Or the plot could be more complicated- two fairies fall in love, one has a curse that turns the fairy into a human, the fairy-human dies, and the two characters can't be together. (These are only ideas to get you started-- the possibilities are endless.) Write the story that makes you want to write; when that doesn't work, write because it's the story you want to read.
 Time and place play a very important role in your story: they set the stage for your characters' lives. Try to think about what your favorite place is, or what era you're fascinated with. If it's a setting that can be researched, research it! It's important to make fictional stories as believable as possible, and getting your facts straight wouldn't hurt.
 Write as much as possible, whenever possible. You never know which idea is the one you keep at for years and years until it's a full story. It's a good idea to keep a note pad with you at all times to write down anything that strikes your fancy; ideas, like fairies, are hard to catch and even harder to keep.

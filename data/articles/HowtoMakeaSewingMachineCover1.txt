 Place your sewing machine on a hard, flat surface. Use a tape measure to measure the distance from this surface to the top of your sewing machine. Write this measurement down.


Note that any retractable spool pins should be pushed down, along with any other retractable or removable sewing machine accessories that might change the height of your machine. Keep the machine in the state it will usually be in during storage.
 With the sewing machine facing you normally, use your tape measure to measure from the right side to the left side of the machine. Write the measurement down.


It's important that you measure from the furthest extended portions of the machine. This measurement needs to include the entire base of your machine as well as the flywheel along the upper side. Any other element that sticks out on the left or right side must also be accounted for.
 Use your tape measure to measure the distance from the front of the machine to the back. Write this measurement down, as well.


Make sure that the nearest portion of the front and the furthest portion of the back are both accounted for in the measurement, even if one side sticks out more at a particular area than the other side does.
Try to hold the tape measure straight as you measure instead of bending it around the curves of the sewing machine.

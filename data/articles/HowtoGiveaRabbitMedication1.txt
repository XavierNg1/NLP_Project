 Your rabbit may have an easier time consuming medication if you conceal it within their food. You can try sticking a whole pill inside of a banana, or coating it with peanut butter. Then present this food to your rabbit the way you normally would, and watch to make sure they finish it.Peanut butter should not be a staple in your rabbit’s diet, but a small amount used to occasionally to administer medicine is OK.;
, Some medications are designed to be given whole, while others can be crushed. Check any packaging or directions for labels like “Do not crush” or “Administer whole.” If you are not sure, contact your veterinarian to ask.
 Using a mortar and pestle (or a spoon and a ceramic mug) grind the pill into a fine powder. Press the end of the pestle (or the back of the spoon) into the pill until it becomes a powder.


You can also buy a commercial pill crusher at most pharmacies.
 Once the pill is crushed to a powder, add it to soft food like applesauce, peanut butter, or mashed banana. Use as little as possible to disguise the medicine. Offer this food to your rabbit, and make sure they consume all of it., Another option is to crush a pill or tablet and dissolve this in a small amount of water or juice. (The amount will vary according to the size of the pill, and is not specific. Simply use enough liquid to create a solution.) Then administer the solution using a syringe, just like you would for any liquid medication.

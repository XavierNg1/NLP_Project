 In general, pendants tend to work better on taller people. If you're below 5'4", a pendant may look overwhelming. If you are on the shorter side, opt for a pendant necklace that sits above your collar bone. This way, it will add a touch of decoration to your outfit without overwhelming you.People of average or tall height can generally get away with a variety of different necklace sizes. If you want a longer pendant, one that goes below your collar bone, this can be flattering if you're average height or tall.
The size of the pendant itself does not make a big difference depending on height.;
, Different styles go better with round, oval, or heart-shaped faces. Look in a mirror and see if your face forms a circle, oval, or heart. Use this to decide which type of pendant would work best with you.Opt for a longer pendant if you have a round face, preferably one with a heavier charm. This will tug the chain downward, creating a v-effect.
Rounder faces would benefit from slightly shorter chains and lighter pendants. You want the chain to be rounded slightly to match your face.
If you have an oval face, you can wear any type of pendant.
 Shorter necks, or necks with lots of wrinkles, benefit from longer chains. Opt for a pendant necklace between 20 and 24 inches in length. Longer necks can generally wear any length of necklace., If you have a fuller figure, a pendant necklace may look awkward. It also may draw unnecessarily attention to your chest. Go for a smaller, less noticeable charm if you're fuller figured and want to wear a pendant necklace.For example, opt for a small orb rather than a large, decorative pendant. This may be more subtle, preventing unnecessary attention from being directed at your chest.

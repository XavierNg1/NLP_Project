 Choose your gender, name, and pick a starter. Choose wisely, because this starter will be with you the entire game.

Nickname the Pokémon. It's tradition in a nuzlocke to give a nickname to your Pokémon, so that you have a closer bond with them. That way, them dying will be more serious.
Don't just randomly pick a starter. Think of it's advantages and disadvantages in the game. For example, if you're going to be fighting Team Aqua, having a Blaziken as your choice might be harder than having a Sceptile.;
, Since you have only one Pokémon, you need to be ready for anything that's thrown at you. Take the time to level up a bit before moving on to another route.

Remember weaknesses and advantages. In a fight, you need to use the best move possible before your Pokémon takes too much damage.


You cannot catch any other Pokémon, as this is a Solocke. The only exception is an HM Pokémon, because a Pokémon like Blaziken, for example, cannot learn Surf. You'll need an HM Pokémon to learn this move. These HM Pokémon cannot fight in battles though!
No Revives. Once you die, it's over.
No soft resetting to avoid death. It's cheating, and the point of Nuzlocking is the challenge!

,

Try selling things you don't need or can't use. Revival items can be sold for a fair price.
Have a wide move pool for your Pokémon. Use TMs and Move Tutors to give it an edge against anything that it might encounter.
If you're in Gen 6, then use Super Training to boost your Pokémon's stats. Go for a high Attack or Special Attack, or try a strong Defence.
Remember to have fun!

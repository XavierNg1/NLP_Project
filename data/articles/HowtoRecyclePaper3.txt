 Shredded newspaper can be turned into an effective cat litter. All you need is some baking soda.


Shred the paper, preferably in a paper shredder.
Soak the paper in warm water. Add a small amount of biodegradable dish soap.
Drain the water and soak again without the soap.
Sprinkle baking soda onto the paper and knead the mixture together. Squeeze out as much moisture as possible.
Crumble onto a screen and let dry for a few days.
 Use old newspaper to wrap gifts. The Sunday comics are especially effective due to the many colors.
 Use old paper to stuff a package for shipping. Wrap fragile objects in layers of paper, and fill the gaps in the box with crumbled wads so that everything stays snug.
 You can use paper bags to make book covers for your old and new hardbound books that you can decorate however youâ€™d like.

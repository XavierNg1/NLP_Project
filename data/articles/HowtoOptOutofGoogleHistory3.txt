 Open your app home screen and browse for the Google app on your iOS device. The icon is a blue square with a white lowercase “g” on it. Tap on the icon to launch it.


The Google app is not usually pre-installed on Apple devices. However, it is available for free download from the iTunes App Store.
 When the app loads, tap on your profile picture. Alternatively, tap the gear icon on the upper left corner of the home screen. The Settings screen will open.
 This will open a menu where your Browsing and Location history are configured.
 Do this by tapping the “Browsing” option on the Privacy menu.
 On this screen, you will see several settings you can turn off or disable in order to completely opt out of any of your history being recorded.


The most important option on this page is "Turn off On-device history." Tap the toggle button to set this option to "OFF." Your search history will no longer be recorded. If it's already "OFF" and greyed-out, you don't need to bother with it.

 In Florida, the process of purchasing a Handgun is slightly more regulated than the process of purchasing a long gun. In addition to meeting all the restrictive criteria for buying a long gun, a person who wants to purchase a Handgun must also be 21 years old — not 18.


Technically, a Handgun is a firearm designed to be held and fired with one or both hands (not against the shoulder like a rifle). This includes most semiautomatic pistols and revolvers.
 Just as with long guns, the State of Florida doesn't require any sort of special license or permit to sell hand guns commercially. However, the same federal licensing rules apply as with long guns, so only purchase from dealers that are licensed by the ATF.


Additionally, hand guns require the same background check as with long guns. This is true regardless of whether the purchaser has a concealed license permit from Florida or any other state.
 Florida is one of ten states that imposes waiting periods on people who wish to buy guns — however, unlike certain other states, in Florida, the waiting period only applies to handguns. After the completion of a background check, the purchaser must wait three days (72 hours) to be able to receive their gun. This law is designed to prevent impulsive acts of violence like suicide and murder by giving potential perpetrators a chance to "cool down" before they get potentially lethal firepower.Note that weekends and legal holidays do not count as part of the 72-hour waiting period — only business days.
Note also that there are two major exceptions to this rule: you are not required to wait 72 hours for your gun if you have a permit that allows you to carry concealed weapons or if you are trading in a handgun.

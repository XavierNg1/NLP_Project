 Start off with a 8.5" x 11" (21.5 x 29 cm) sheet of cardstock and then trim it down as you see fit.


Make even, firm creases when you fold the cardstock so the card looks professional and well made. If possible, use a bone folder to make even creases.
If your creases aren't even, start over on a new piece of cardstock.
 The middle panel will become the front of the card later. The size of the item you want to display in the window will determine the size of the window.


Generally, the window should be less than half the size of the card.
 A display item could be another piece of pretty paper or embroidery, a doily, or a photograph.


Choose an item that fits with the overall theme of the card that will look nice in the display window.
To add a ribbon, use a hole punch to make two holes in the middle panel, above or below the window. Thread your ribbon through the holes and tie it into a bow. The bow should be facing away from you when you lay the card down.
 Run glue or tape along the edges of the item to make sure it is secure in the display window.


Make sure the glue or tape is on straight and isn’t visible from the front of the display window.
 Fold over the side panel, while also pressing the tape in place.


Your item is now sandwiched between the two panels and the middle has become the front. The left side is now the left inside panel of your two-paneled card.
 Feel free to write on both sides or only one side of the card.


Try to create a message that matches the display item. If it’s a cute or funny image, include a cute or funny message. If it's a simple or elegant image, include a simple or elegant message. The tone of your card should be consistent with the theme of the card.
For a cleaner look, create a "Happy Birthday" message in a word processor program and then print and cut it out and include it in the card.

 Just as though you were actually whitewashing, you should sand and clean the surface to be brushed. Remember to place the furniture over something that can catch any spilled paint.


Since you'll be applying paint instead of stain, you do not need to thoroughly remove old finish (sealant) unless it is flaking off. In that scenario, see instructions for chemical stripping under Whitewashing Furniture or thoroughly sand the finish off.
 Use full strength (undiluted) paint. The goal is to barely have enough paint on the brush to spread. Wipe it off on a rag if you get too much paint on it.


If you can't find a balance between being able to spread the paint and keeping the layer of paint very thin, dip your brush in water and shake it (not on the wood) before applying., If you pause during the painting or make the initial contact between brush and wood too heavy, you will get uneven blotches of paint. Try to move as rapidly and lightly as possible.Be especially vigilant while brushing the corners. It's easy to slow down while trying to reach the edge of the surface, but that will cause an uneven paint layer.
If you want to avoid the appearance of brush strokes, make your strokes as long as possible, but maintain an even speed and light touch., Still using a quick, light touch, find any uneven or overly thick spots and gently brush them into their surroundings for an even appearance., One or two coats of a water-based sealant will preserve your furniture without altering its color. Wait for the paint to dry completely before applying.

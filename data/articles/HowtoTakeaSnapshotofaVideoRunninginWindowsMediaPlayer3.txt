 Some hardware configurations just won't let you take screenshots of video that is playing in Windows Media Player. If this is the case, you can use a screen capture program to take your screenshots. Popular free programs include:Jing
Fraps
PicPick

, This will make it much easier to capture an image without worrying about the timing of your keypress.
 With your new screen capture program running, all you'll need to do to capture your screen is to press the dedicated screenshot shortcut. The exact key varies from program to program, and can often be set by the user.
 After capturing the screenshot, you'll be able to use the capture program to edit the shot so that it only shows the image from Windows Media Player. You may also be able to perform additional edits and annotations using these programs.
 After you're finished capturing your image, you can save it to your computer using the capture program's "Save" command.

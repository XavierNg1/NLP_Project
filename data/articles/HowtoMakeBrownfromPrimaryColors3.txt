 Mix them in equal proportions to create a royal purple. This will be a darker shade of purple.
 Yellow will lighted up this dark shade until it turns into a yellow-tinted brown. Add just a dollop of yellow at first, and mix it in a bit more if you'd like to lighten the brown.
 To continue lightening the brown, mix in more yellow paint. To darken the brown, add a bit more of the purple.

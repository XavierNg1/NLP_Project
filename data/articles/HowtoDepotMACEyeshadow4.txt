 Isopropyl alcohol can help dissolve the adhesive that holds the eyeshadow pan in the plastic housing. Take a small dish, and pour a few tablespoons (45 ml) of 99% isopropyl alcohol into it or enough for all of the shadows you plan to depot.While you can use different percentages of alcohol, such as 70% isopropyl alcohol, the higher the percentage, the more quickly it will dry and dissolve the adhesive.
 Take a medicine dropper and pick up a small amount of the alcohol. Run the medicine dropper all around the eyeshadow pan to dispense the alcohol between the pan and the plastic housing. Allow the alcohol to work on the adhesive for 30 seconds to 1 minute.If you don’t have a medicine dropper, use a cotton swab to absorb some of the alcohol from the bowl. Run the cotton swab around the pan, pressing gently to squeeze the alcohol between the pan and the plastic housing.
Don’t worry if you get alcohol on the eyeshadow itself. It won’t harm the makeup. In fact, isopropyl alcohol is often used to mend shattered eyeshadows, blushes, and powders.
 Take a craft knife or other pointed tool, and press it between the pan and the plastic housing. Run it all along the pan to gently loosen it from the plastic., Press upward with the knife to carefully pry the eyeshadow pan out of the plastic housing.If there is dried adhesive on the back of the eyeshadow pan, run a little more alcohol over it, allow it to sit for a minute, and then use your tool or finger to scrape off the glue.

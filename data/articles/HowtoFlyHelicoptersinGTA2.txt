 You can get inside a helicopter the same way you get inside a car. Stand beside a helicopter and press the Y button on your Xbox controller to board it.
 Press your finger and hold the Right Trigger (LT) button on the topside of your Xbox controller, and the helicopter will take off. Keep your finger on this button until you reach the desired altitude.
 Use the left analog stick on the controller to go left or right, forward or backward. Steer the vehicle while keeping your finger pressed on the Right Trigger (RT) button to keep moving without losing altitude.
 Aside from the left analog stick, you can make sudden left or right turns by pressing the Left Bumper (LB) or Right Bumper (RB) buttons, respectively, on your controller.
 Military and police helicopters are equipped with mounted firearms like machine guns and missiles. Just press the A button on your Xbox controller to fire these weapons. You can adjust your aim by steering your vehicle with the left analog stick towards your target.
 Camera angles can be adjusted while in mid-air, switching from first, second, or third camera view. Just press the right analog stick on your controller to change camera views.
 To land, press your finger and hold the Left Trigger (LT) button to slowly descend the aircraft. As you descend, use the left analog stick to steer and help you land the helicopter on the targeted spot.

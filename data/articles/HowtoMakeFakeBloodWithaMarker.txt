 Your table should have newspaper and you might want to wear old clothes or an art shirt. This project will get messy. Include rubber gloves to wear so the ink doesn't stay on your fingers or hands.;
, It has to be a simple red. Bright red or dark, it doesn't matter. But if you use a brighter red, you might need a green marker to balance the color to look like blood. When you have your marker/s, pry the top off with scissors.
 It will be a plastic cylinder with ink inside. Pull that out and place it on your table. You need to have a disposable cup and a baby medicine feeder ready.
 Get as much as you can and keep it in the disposable cup. When all the ink you can squeeze is out, take the baby medicine feeder out and use that to get out whatever else you can.
 Some inks are too thick to be blood, so you need to thin them out with a little bit of water. Don't put too much in, or it will ruin the color and feel of the ink.


If your "blood" is too bright, follow steps 1-4 with a green marker. Mix only until the color is dark enough. If your "blood" is too dark, follow steps 1-4 with a white ink. Its difficult to find a white marker, so instead of doing that, you could put in a lot of water.
 Make sure there are no leaks or holes in the container, not a good situation. When that is done, use the "blood" to do what ever your little heart desires.

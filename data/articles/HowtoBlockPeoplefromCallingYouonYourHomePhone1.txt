 You can identify the caller before picking up the phone and, if it is an unwanted call, hang up or let the call go to your messaging service.;
, Nearly all phone companies have ways in which you can block calls from specified numbers. With some companies, it can be done by entering a code and then typing the number to be blocked. Check with your telephone service provider to see their procedure., If you have a "trap" applied to your phone , incoming phone calls will be tracked back to their real destinations (not the fictitious tracking information that robocalls provide on caller ID) and can be blocked in the future. Trap lines are now offered by private companies and many telephone service providers., While many people know of the national Do Not Call list, private companies are also mandated to remove anyone who asks from their call lists. As with the national Do Not Call registry, your request must be renewed every five years., If your phone company has failed to protect you from unwanted calls so far, ask to be put in touch with their Annoyance Desk/Annoyance Department the next time you talk to one of their representatives. Most companies have a such special group, and usually they largely deals with harassing calls.

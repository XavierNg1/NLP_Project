 If your toaster oven has a "broil" setting that heats from above, this gives the cheese an extra crisp. In a regular oven, the "broil" setting is worth a try if it's located at the top of your oven, but the high heat can turn the cheese rubbery.Here are your options:









Oven (normal bake): Preheat to 250ºC (480ºF).
Oven (overhead broil): Do not preheat. Move the oven rack to the lowest position to reduce heat.
Toaster oven: Do not preheat. If there's a temperature control, set it to 250ºC (480ºF).
 Any white bread will do. Thick slices are another barrier against burning, but pre-sliced grocery store bread works fine.
 This step is essential to make the toast golden brown and slightly moist., Cook until the butter has melted and the bread is just starting to turn brown. This takes about 2–3 minutes. Remove it from the oven., Select a strong-tasting cheese, such as a sharp cheddar. Use a cheese slicer to make several thin slices. Lay them on the buttered bread, overlapping slightly. Cover every inch of the bread to make delicious bubbling cheese hat, instead of a layer of charcoal.








Grated parmesan works well too.
 Return the bread to the oven. Watch it like a hawk until the cheese has completely melted and started to get bubbling, brown patches. This takes another 3–5 minutes or so, but even one minute too long can turn it black.









This may only take 1–2 minutes if using a powerful broiler.

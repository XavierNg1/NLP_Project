 Wait for your oven or toaster oven to heat to 350ºF or 175ºC.


Optionally, use the broiler setting to cook the nuts from above. This makes it easier to check on the progress of the nuts, since the toasted side is easily visible.;
, Pour the nuts onto a tray or baking dish with sides. Keep them in a loose, single layer to allow air circulation. Place the tray, ungreased, in the oven.
 For most nuts, stirring every five minutes is enough to avoid burning. Stir the nuts or shake the tray gently to move the nuts at the edge to the center, and vice versa.


The smaller the nuts, the easier they are to burn. Check on pine nuts or chopped nuts every two or three minutes.Toaster ovens tend to have less even heat distribution. If using one, you may need to stir two or three times to avoid burning.
 The nuts are ready once golden brown with a strong, toasted smell. Check on them often once they approach these estimated times, or the nuts can quickly turn bitter and burnt:Pine nuts: 5 minutes
Pistachios: 6–8 minutesAlmonds: 8 minutes if sliced, 10 if whole
Walnuts, pecans: 10–15 minutes
Hazelnuts, macadamia nuts: 12–15 minutes
Brazil nuts: 15–17 minutesPeanuts: 15–25 minutes bare, 20–35 minutes in shellChestnuts: 20–30 minutes

, The thin, papery skin on many nuts becomes looser during roasting. If you'd like to remove it, fold a towel around the nuts and rub vigorously until the skin flakes off. For large batches, finish by spinning the nuts in a salad spinner to remove small pieces.If the nuts are still in the shell, crack them with a nutcracker or by wrapping in a towel and pressing down. The shells may be softer when hot, but be wary of escaping steam.
 Roasted nuts are still soft fresh out of the oven. Let them cool to near room temperature to develop a crunch.Transfer leftovers to the fridge once completely cool, in a sealed container.


Roasted chestnuts are best eaten soft and warm.

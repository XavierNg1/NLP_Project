 Another thing you can do if you want to type accents in a word processor is to open up Microsoft Word and select "Insert," then "Symbol," and then "Symbol Browser". You can browse through the symbols to select the accent you want to use. Though this isn't the most efficient method, it's perfect if you just want to type one or two accents.
 Find an accented symbol online, select it, copy it (by selecting "Edit" and "Copy" in your Internet browser or simply pressing "Control + C") and then paste it wherever you want it to go (by selecting "Edit" and "Paste" in your Internet browser or by pressing "Control + V"). You can select a symbol online and paste it in a word processor, or select a symbol in a word processor and paste it in an Internet browser, and so on.

 You can buy your own measuring device, like Clarks Foot Measuring Gauge, or you can print off sizing charts from the internet.


Place your child’s foot (one chart per foot) along the curved line drawn at the bottom of the chart.
Ask your child to stand still so their toes are relaxed.
Measure the length from your child’s longest toe; for example, if your child’s longest toe touches the number 4, then her size is 18.
Alternatively, go to a store that specializes in children’s shoes, because they will employ a professional who can measure your toddler’s feet accurately.
 Your child won’t normally wear shoes without socks on, so you need to buy shoes that will accommodate their feet in socks too.


This will stop you from purchasing shoes that are slightly too small.
 Depending on how much space is available, you will be able to determine if your child's shoes are too small or too large.


If the space is too wide, the shoes are too big and your child's feet might slip out of the shoes, causing them to trip.
If the back of the shoes presses too close to your child’s heel, then the shoes are too tight and might cause strain or painful blisters.
 Gently press the part of the shoes that cover your toddler’s toes.


Sometimes, toddlers curl their toes inside the shoes so you have to make sure they’re well splayed inside.
You want just about a centimeter to about half an inch of space in this area between the shoes and the toes (with socks).
 To best determine if the shoes are tight or loose, check the tongue of the shoes and the laces or Velcro when tied, and they should be parallel to each other.


If there is too much room or space between them, then the shoes are tight.
If they overlap too much, then the shoes are too loose or big.
 If your toddler can walk, ask them to stand and walk while wearing the shoes, or help your child walk with the shoes on.


Try to get your toddler to tell you how he or she feels about the shoes.

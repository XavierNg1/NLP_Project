 Be prepared to turn over your keys, credit card, I.D. badge, cell phone, and laptop. Make sure your correct mailing address is on file. This is so your tax information can be sent to you next year.;
, Read what you sign also, to make sure that you are not giving up your legal rights. Keep the copy in a safe place.
 Don't say anything that could be construed as a threat, such as "You'll be sorry that you laid me off."

, Don't gripe at those remaining; it isn't their fault and your departure will almost certainly create extra work for them.
 Most employers won't object to you taking the name plate from your desk or door, but make sure to ask first.
 Don't deliberately misplace important documents in a childish attempt at revenge. You don't want to burn bridges or affect your future job prospects unnecessarily.
 You might need it later on. Once you're gone, your boss will quickly forget your hard work and years of service to the company.
 This is standard procedure in most companies.

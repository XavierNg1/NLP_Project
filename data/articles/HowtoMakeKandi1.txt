 Although any kind of bead could be used to make kandi, typically plastic beads are used. There are many different kinds of plastic beads though, and each offers a unique and interesting looks for your kandi!









Pony beads are the classic; big, round-edged beads that we all used as kids. These will give a chunky feel to your kandi.
Perler beads are smaller than pony beads but equally classic. These are the ones that could be placed in a mold and ironed over to create a solid, rainbow-hued plastic figure. These have straight edges, but are good for creating patterns in a cuff.
Peyote beads are similar to perler beads but have rounded edges and are sometimes made of glass. Think of them as a wider, smaller version of pony beads. These will give you the most intricate patterns, but are also the most difficult to work with.;
, Most styles of string will do as long as they have a bit of elastic in them to allow for stretch.









Using an elastic plastic string gives you the opportunity of continuing with the plastic theme the beads have, but is not as comfortable as cloth string. Plastic string begins to dig into your wrist over time and is therefore not preferred.
Cloth string with a bit of elastic is a good option as long as the string is not too wide.
Be sure that whatever string you use is thin enough that it could easily fit through any one of your beads twice.
 These will include a pair of scissors and, should you choose to use them, clasps to close the bracelet with.

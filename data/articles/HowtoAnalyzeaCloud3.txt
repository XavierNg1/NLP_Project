 While cumulus clouds float through the sky resembling puffs of cotton candy, stratus clouds are more like a sheet strewn across the sky. This makes it much more likely that they will directly cover up the sun. This coverage will look different based on the height of the cloud. Low-level stratus clouds will often block the sun’s light so much that you can’t even tell where the sun sits in the sky. The mid-level altostratus will block most of the sun’s light, but you will likely see a bright spot in the cloud where the sun is trying to shine through. Higher clouds, known as cirrostratus, are usually so thin that you can still see the sun clearly through them.Do not look directly into the sun. This can damage your eyes.
 If it is raining, you are likely seeing a low-level stratus rain cloud, or nimbostratus. It is possible for rain to fall from the mid-level altostratus, but this isn’t common. Rain does not fall from the high up cirrostratus clouds.If it is thunder storming , you are looking at a cumulonimbus, not a nimbostratus.
 Depending on the height of the cloud, you will be able to see more or less of sky through it. Low-level stratus clouds are very opaque, and you can see very little, if any, of the sky above them. Altostratus clouds appear more translucent, allowing you to glimpse just a bit of the sky above, and the cirrostratus is almost transparent.

 For this project, you will need an assortment of glass beads. Open all of the packages of glass beads you purchased for this project and pour the contents of the packages into the bowl. Use your hands to mix the beads., You will string the beads onto a long length of stretch cord, or elastic. 50 inches is an ideal length for this style of bracelet. Unravel a few inches of the elastic from the spoolâ€”do not cut the cord. Begin stringing the beads onto the stretch cord in a random pattern. Continue unravelling the cord and stringing beads onto the elastic until you have reached the desired length for your wrap bracelet.


This method allows you to easily set aside your bracelet without worrying about the beads falling of the other end. It also allows you to alter the length of the bracelet at any time., Once you have finished stringing the beads onto the cord, unwind the cord so that there are a few extra inches of elastic on each end. Use a pair of scissors to cut the cord from the spool. Grab each end and tie the bracelet together in a double knot. Cut off the excess cord., Slide your wrist through the bracelet. Twist the bracelet in half and slide the new loop onto your wrist. Continue this process until the bracelet is completely wrapped around your wrist.

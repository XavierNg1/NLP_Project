 If you have music files that you purchased through Windows Media Player, they may have DRM protection. You can remove this DRM protection by burning the music to a CD and then ripping it back off of the CD.


Avoid programs that claim to remove DRM. Since it is not possible to crack the DRM that's in place, most programs don't work. Instead, they often come bundled with adware that you don't want.
 By burning the music to a disc and then ripping it, you'll be able to remove the DRM on it. A CD-RW is recommended for large libraries of protected music, since you can reuse it many times.
 If you aren't already in Library view, you can enter it by pressing Ctrl+1.
 This will display the burn list.
 You'll only be able to burn 80 minutes of music at a time (less for some CDs).
 Windows Media Player will begin burning the songs to the CD. This may take several minutes to complete.


If you are unable to burn the songs due to the DRM restrictions, see the next section instead.
 You can change Windows Media Player's CD ripper settings so that ripped songs are automatically converted to MP3 format, saving you a few steps:


Press Alt and click "Tool" â†’ "Options."
Click the "Rip Music" tab.
Select "MP3" from the "Format" menu.
Drag the "Audio quality" slider all of the way to the right. Click "Apply" to save your changes.
 After the CD finishes burning, it may auto-eject. Reinsert it and then click the "Rip CD" to begin copying the music back to your computer.
 Windows Media Player will begin extracting the audio from the CD and converting the files to MP3 format. You'll be able to find these files in your "Music" folder. The MP3 files will not have any DRM protection.

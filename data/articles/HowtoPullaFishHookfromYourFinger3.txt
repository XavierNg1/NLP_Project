 Figure out how deep the hook is stuck in your skin. If the hook is stuck deep in the tissue, simply removing the barb and pushing the hook through will not work. If this is the case, you will need to an alternative method to remove the hook., If the hook is stuck in deeply, take a foot-long piece of fishing string and make a loop around the bend of the hook. Try to do this without moving the hook around too much. You don’t want the injury to hurt more or get the hook stuck in deeper because you were being careless., Hold string in one hand and push down on the eye of the hook with the other hand. Essentially, you are trying to keep the hook exactly where it is for the moment. Again, make sure you don’t push the hook in deeper when applying pressure to the eye of the hook., Whoever has the hook caught in his skin is not going to like what comes next. Have him focus on something else, look away, or tightly close his eyes. You may want to have the individual take a shot of alcohol, if available, to help take the edge off.
 Pushing down on the eye of the hook keeps the barb from ripping a much larger hole on the way out. While still applying pressure to the eye of the hook, yank as hard as you can on the fishing wire you attached to it. This will rip out a sizable chunk of skin, but the hook will come with it.Be aware the hook can spring out with a lot of speed. Make sure the remover and bystanders are as clear as possible from the trajectory of the removed hook.
Irrigate the wound as soon as the fish hook is removed by pouring clean water or normal saline on it. Let it bleed freely.
 Once the wound has been irrigated, make sure to hold pressure on or below the cut to stop severe bleeding. Make sure to apply pressure for five minutes to 30 minutes after ripping the hook out. If bleeding has not slowed by then, you may need to seek medical assistance.

 This works well if you are sitting or walking next to each other, but make sure his/her hand is at his/her side. Hold your hand very close to his/hers, even maybe touching a bit, but look straight ahead. Don't freak out or stare down at your hands.;
, Close it around his/her hand. This would be a good time to look up at him/her. If he/she just stares at you, smile. If he/she pulls away, just quit all together. He/She is just not ready to do this yet.
 He/she is comfortable with this, and if you think you are ready, intertwine your fingers in his/hers. He/She will eat this up!

, You are holding hands with your cutie! If he/she doesn't like it, don't worry! He or she is nervous and just not ready! If he or she pulls away, do not try to hold hands with him/her again that day!

, This is a slower process. Do not move into this too fast. If you do, he/she will think that you are a creep and will make fun of you behind your back.
 It's okay if he/she either jerks away, or looks down. Everyone has his/her own speed. If you freak out he/she will understand. But just keep trying different days until he/she is ready. If you don't feel comfortable, you are okay! Holding hands isn't the most important thing to do in a relationship.

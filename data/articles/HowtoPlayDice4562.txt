 In this version of the game, there is no banker. Each player puts a matching stake into a single pot. These rules are recommended for two player games, or for groups looking for a more tense game with a top-heavy prize.
 Roll all three dice until you get a 1, 6, pair, or triple. For any other result, reroll all three dice until you get one of these results.
 Each player rolls in turn, following the same rules. Roll until everyone has a meaningful score (a 1, 6, pair, or triple).
 In this version, there are no automatic wins or automatic losses. Whoever has the higher result wins the pot. Here are the results from highest to lowest:


4+5+6 is the highest roll.
6+6+6 is the next highest, followed by all the "trips" from 5+5+5 down to 1+1+1.
Any pair + 6, down to any pair + 1.
1+2+3 is the lowest roll.
 If two or more players tie for the highest score, they each reroll to break the tie. The highest reroll wins, ignoring the earlier rolls. There's also a special rule for breaking ties with "pair + third die:"


The higher third die always wins, no matter what the pairs are. 1 + 1 + 4 beats 6 + 6 + 2, because 4 > 2.
If the third die is the same, the higher pair wins. 3 + 3 + 5 beats 2 + 2 + 5, since 3 > 2.
 Whoever got the highest roll that round wins the entire pot. Put up stakes again and begin the next round.

 Be sure you know how, and read the safety information before you set out.
 You should try different spots, and remember to ask around. It also helps to have a fish finder or underwater camera.


If it is the summer, rock bass can be found on gravel or on rock bars in about 6–15 feet (1.8–4.6 m) of water.
If it is fall, the rock bass will be in about the same depth water, and in thicker vegetation or along a deeper rock stretch.
 You should have a slower jigging motion, but it should be constant if you are using a jig. If you are using a small spoon, its best to let the spoon drop to the bottom and jerk it up while you retrieve. Either way, the motion should be relatively constant.
 Make sure you don't set it too hard, or you can rip the hook out of the fish's mouth.
 Usually, you can just flip the fish into the boat, but it does help to carry around a small net, just in case.

The first-generation Mustangs were manufactured from 1964 to 1973, and they were referred to as the "original pony car."
If you are looking for a "Pony Interior," the vehicle will have a running ponies design on the front seat. It also has armrests, woodgrain appliqu√© accents as well as a round gauge cluster.
The 1966 was the best selling convertible model.
Mustangs prior to 1979 in Germany are referred to as the T-5, or the pre-production name of the vehicle, because of copyright issues in that country.
Vehicles from 1967-1968 and older will give you a larger cargo and seating area.
Revisions to the cars in the 1970s made them heavier vehicles.
Whatever year you choose, you can select a hardtop, sports roof or convertible model.;

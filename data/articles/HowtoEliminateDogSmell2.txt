 One of the best ways to thoroughly clean your whole house and rid it of pet odor is to regularly clean your house with a general disinfecting cleaning product that uses an enzymatic cleaner to break down pet-related odors.Some of the most popular brands of enzymatic cleaning products include Nature’s Miracle, Urine Off, Pawsitively Clean, Biokleen, and Rug Doctor., One of the biggest things that contributes to pet odor is the accumulation of hair that your dog sheds on the floor. If you have hardwood or tile floors, you’ll be able to see the dust bunnies that form out of clumps of dust and dog hair over time. If you have carpet these are more difficult to see, but you’ll still need to clean them up regularly.If you have carpet, vacuum it once every few days (at least once a week) or as necessary. Consider steam cleaning your carpet once every couple of months or whenever you start to notice the dog smell more.
If you have tile or hardwoods, you should sweep it once every few days and consider a more intensive cleaning (like mopping) once every month or so.
 If your dog has a blanket or a dog bed that it sleeps on regularly, you should wash it at least once per week. If the dog spends much time on it, then its hair and dandruff constantly rubs off on it and settles into the fabric. This traps the dog odor inside the dog bed, but washing it will greatly decrease the pet smell in your house.


Additionally, if your dog sleeps on your bed with you, consider washing your own bedding once every week or so. This will help cut down on any odor that gets into your bedding at night.

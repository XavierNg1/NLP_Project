 To rehydrated dried morels, you’ll need a small bowl that’s large enough to hold all of the mushrooms. Fill the bowl with enough boiling water to cover the morels.If you prefer, you can use warm chicken stock or cream to rehydrate the morels.
In most cases, 3 ounces (85 g) of dried morels usually equals a pound (454 g) of fresh mushrooms.
 After you’ve filled the bowl with hot water, add the morels to it. Allow them to sit in the hot water for at least 15 minutes, or until they’re soft and pliable.You can also tell that the morels have soaked long enough if they no longer crack when you bend them.
 When the morels are finished soaking, dump the bowl out into a colander or sieve. Shake the mushrooms well to ensure that you remove the excess moisture.You may want to reserve the soaking liquid from the morels. It has plenty of flavor, so you can mix it into recipes for extra seasoning or use it as a base for soups and sauces. If the liquid has dirt in it, strain it through a sieve or coffee filter to remove the debris.
 After you’ve drained the morels, run your fingers over them. If they feel gritty, place them in a colander or sieve and rinse them under cool water before cooking with them.Be sure to dry the morels thoroughly before cooking with them.

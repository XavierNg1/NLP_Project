 Sunflowers have deep roots and prefer infrequent, heavy watering to frequent, shallow watering.Adjust your watering routine on particularly hot or cloudy weeks. Your sunflowers should bloom in mid to late summer, between two and three months after planting.
 Once the seedlings are tall enough to mulch without breaking them, cover the soil with a layer of seed-free straw or other mulch to retain moisture and prevent weed growth. Top up the mulch after heavy rain.If you're growing sunflowers as a seed crop or to display in flower shows, mulch with 1.5 inches (4 cm) of well-rotted manure or compost once the plants are 20 in. (0.5 m) tall.
 If you live in a windy area or your stalks lack strength, consider staking the plants with wood or bamboo stakes to support the weight of the plant.
 Though relatively free of insect susceptibility, a small gray moth may lay eggs in the sunflower face. Simply pick out the small worms to remove them.


Sunflowers also have the ability to contract mildew and rust. If either of these issues occurs, spray your flowers with a fungicide.
Deer and birds are also known to eat sunflower plants. Put up netting to prevent these animals from destroying your plants.
 To enjoy the flowers in a vase, cut the stalk at an angle in the morning before the flower fully opens. Change the water in the vase every other day to keep the flowers looking fresh.
 If you want edible seeds, cut the flower heads off when they begin to droop, or when the back of the head begins to turn yellow. Hang them upside down by the stem in a dry, breezy place and cover with cheesecloth or a paper bag to catch seeds as they fall out.


For delicious roasted seeds, soak overnight in water and salt. Then drain and place on a baking sheet. Roast in a low-heat oven (between 200°F and 250°F / 90 to 120ºC) until slightly browned.

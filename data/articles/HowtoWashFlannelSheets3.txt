 Once stains set into a soft surface like flannel, they can be next to impossible to remove completely. In the event of spills, leaks and other accidents, blot the affected area with a damp cloth while it’s still wet. Afterwards, clean your bedding as usual, adding one quarter to one half a cup (60-120ml) of white vinegar to the washing machine as it fills.Use a mixture of warm water, hydrogen peroxide and mild liquid detergent to deal with substances that are likely to leave stains, like coffee or red wine.Be careful not to scrub the sheets too forcefully—over time, it’s possible to wear holes into the fabric.
 Though they may sound like a good thing, the chemicals in fabric softeners have a tendency to coat and stiffen flannel fibers. Over time, this can leave your sheets feeling waxy. It’s also a good idea to say no to dryer sheets for the same reason.To keep older flannel sheets soft to the touch, try throwing a couple (clean) tennis balls into the dryer with them. The movement of the tennis balls will help loosen up clumped fibers.
One of the main selling points of flannel is that it’s already soft, so there’s no need to use a lot of conditioners and other products to keep it that way., Rather than constantly washing and reusing the same set of sheets, invest in one or two additional sets and cycle them out between uses. Each set will last longer, and you’ll appreciate the fresh new look your bed gets every time you do laundry.Remember to keep lights, darks and colored sheets separated in the wash.

 A quick vacuum is usually a good idea. If there are any stains and the rug will be in storage for a bit, have them cleaned off before moving the rug.
 The best way to roll a rug is to roll it face out because this alleviates strain on the backing.

A rug should never be folded unless you really don't care how shabby it ends up looking. The fold marks will stay and the fibers will weaken at the fold points.
, Plastic or canvas make good rug covers; just be careful of humidity and vast temperature changes if using plastic, to avoid the creation of condensation on the rug., If the rug has curled, attach double sided tape to the floor and the rug to help it lay flat.

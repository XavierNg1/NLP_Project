 Make sure they know they are going to use shovels and do some labor.;
, The soil should be rather loose -- not clay or rock -- and have plenty of open space with a few obstacles like trees or rocks.



Figure out what shape you would like your trench to be. It just be a straight line or an L-shaped ditch, or U-shaped, or virtually anything you want it to be.
Make sure the trench is deep enough to hold a person squatting down. Dig down about 3 to 3 1⁄2 feet (0.9 to 1.1 m). You may find there are rocks or even boulders that need to be moved. Since players will jump into a ditch rather quickly, it's best to remove these hazardous objects to a safer location.



Determine where you want the holes to be placed. They should be about 3 feet (0.9 m) deep and wide enough for one or two people to stand or lay in.
Pile the dirt you dig up around the hole to make a barrier.
 You might try medium-sized tree trunks, plywood, or broad-leaved plants.
, Then you can invite more friends (or enemies) and have fun!

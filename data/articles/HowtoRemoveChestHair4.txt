 Depilatories are available in a wide range of forms though all serve the same purpose. The chemicals break down and dissolve your hair, which you can then easily wipe off. Popular brands for men include Nair, Magic Shave, and Nad’s.
 You could have chemical allergies you’re unaware of, so it’s always best to test new topical cosmetics in small quantities before beginning regular use. Dab a small amount on the inside of your elbow or another inconspicuous part of your body, then wash it off as you would during normal use. If you notice any redness, irritation, or swelling, discontinue use of this product.


Most depilatory products are designed to remain on your skin for roughly five minutes before being removed.
 Whether you went with a spray, a cream, or a roll-on applicator, you should apply the depilatory—as your selected product directs—to your chest.
 There will be a short period of time during which you’ll allow your cream or spray to work its chemical processes, after which you’ll simply wipe the area clean. Your hair should come away with the cream.


As mentioned above, the said period of time will often be as short five minutes; brief enough to perform in the morning before work, should you need a hairless chest for any reason at work.
Many depilatory products are sold with special tools for scraping the hair and product off though any towel you’re willing to ruin can work as well.
 Rinse away the remnants of your handiwork and admire the view! Good job, you. Now go and put a shirt on.

 Add water up to 3/4 of the glass and leave for a minute.;
, Knead well by hand until you get a nice, smooth, flexible dough.
 In the winter it takes longer to rise so wait until you see it double in size.
 Knead each part a bit and create 5 balls, leave on a floury surface for about 30 minutes to rise again.
 Brush (or by hand) the egg on top of each circle and bake in a pre-heated oven (200c) for 20-25 minutes. You will know when it's ready when the smell will spread all over the house and the top of the bread will be a golden brown colour.
 Then eat with your meal or wipe with salads (houmous, tehina, matbucha, fried aubergine and many more options), if you want to use the bread a day or two later keep sealed in a plastic bag, or a few days later - freeze and than re heat in the oven until hot and soft.

 Now open up the StepMania Tools Main Menu that comes with StepMania, and click on the very last option that says "Create Song". Find the music file that you want to be your new dance song and select it! It should say "Success. Created song <file location>";
, Go to "Edit/Share Songs" in the main menu and find the song that you just created. Select the dance-type and the difficult you wish to edit and choose "Create With Blank", OR you can start with a source of a different difficult and go off that (meaning that your taking the exact steps of one difficult of that song, and using them in the difficult you choose and you can add on). Edit those steps!

, All is explained in the program, how to change the bpm, add/remove steps, even add mines. The basics push a number 1-4 to insert an arrow. 1=Left, 2=Down, 3=Up, 4=Right. The up and down arrow keys change the beat your on, left and right changes the what part of the beat your in (1/4, 1/8, etc.) Push F1 for more help.
, Congratulations! You just made a new song with a step chart!

 Hair and soap often accumulate underneath the strainer, which is located in or over the drain. Though many strainers can be removed manually, some have screws that will need to be removed, too. Remove the screws with the proper screwdriver.


If you do not know which type of screwdriver to use, match the screwdriver to the screw head.The size and shape of the screwdriver head should easily fit into the screw.
Turn each screw surrounding the strainer until all are loose. Then, place the screws in a safe location while you unclog the drain.;
, Some drains have tub stoppers instead of strainers, and these are also located in the drain. These are easier to remove because they are not held down with any screws. Simply remove the stopper by twisting and lifting it., A lot of gunk may have accumulated on the strainer or stopper over time. Clean any hair or soap scum; you may have to scrub the strainer and stopper depending on how dirty they are.
 When the drain stick is inserted deep enough, it will hit a drain trap, which is a curved part of the drain.Keep pushing the drain stick through this trap. The stick is flexible and will bend.
 The claw has many small interlocking hooks, so it will grab hair and allow you to pull gunk out. Clean the gunk off of the drain stick if you want to save it to use again in the future. Hair and soap can build up in as little as a few months, so having a drain stick often comes in handy.
 Water should now go down the drain properly. If this method did not work, try another method.
 If the drain claw worked, you can now replace your strainer or stopper. Strainers will need to be screwed back onto the top of the drain, whereas you can just place the stopper back in the drain.

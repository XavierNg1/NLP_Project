 Since thick hair traps a lot of sweat and grime inside, it needs more attention than other types of hair. However, washing it every day will strip out its moisture immediately.
 Make sure it helps you. If you don't have dandruff, buying dandruff shampoo would be a waste. Some cheap yet good brands are Herbal Essences, Clear, Head and Shoulders, Pantene, Loreal, and Tresemme.


If your hair is dry, you would love any shampoo with argan oil.
 Most shampoos have a matching conditioner, but if there isn't, buy one that helps your hair. Let the conditioner sit for a few minutes before rinsing it off to let it take full effect on your hair.
 Natural honey can be mixed with your favorite shampoo for a healing, protecting shampoo.
 Comb it first to free the tangles and undo the knots. Then you should brush it to give it shine and volume. Always carry a comb and/or brush with you in case your hair gets messed up.


Avoid getting sweaty or exposing your hair to direct sunlight. That will make it dry and frizzy and will give it additional grime.
When swimming, put your hair in a swim cap to protect it from harmful chemicals such as chlorine.
 However, ONLY get it trimmed 1/2 or 1 inch. You don't want to lose your precious locks.

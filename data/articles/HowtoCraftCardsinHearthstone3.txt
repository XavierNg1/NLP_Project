 Different cards require different amounts of arcane dust to craft. The higher the rarity of the card you are trying to craft the more arcane dust you will need to craft it. If you have a particular card in mind you want to craft, but do not have enough dust to create it, you will need to disenchant more of your cards until you have enough dust.

Keep in mind that when you craft cards of high rarity, you will be sacrificing many other cards into to craft. Make sure you don’t accidentally disenchant too many cards and leave yourself with nothing to put in your deck to complement your newly-crafted legendary card.
 A menu will pop up that will show much arcane dust it requires to craft. If you already have that card in your collection you will also be able to disenchant it from this menu. Click “Create” and the card will be added to your collection, allowing you to add it to your decks.

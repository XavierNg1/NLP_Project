 You can choose whatever color combination you like for a reverse French manicure. The first layer of nail polish you add will be the color that shows up on the half-moon shapes near your nail bed.Apply one thin layer of this color to every nail. Move slowly to keep your nail polish smooth and even.
 You do not want to paint over your nails until one color has dried completely. If your nail polish is not dry, the band-aids you use later can peel off the polish. Wait until your nails dry completely to move forward.It generally takes one to two hours for nail polish to dry, so plan ahead if you want to do a reverse French manicure., Slowly add a second coat of polish to your nails. This will make the color stand out more and fill in any gaps. When you're done, wait for the polish to dry completely before proceeding.

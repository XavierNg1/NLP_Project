 Pick flowers from your garden or someone else's with their permission; or you can gather wildflowers from a field. You can also buy flowers from a florist if you want a certain type of flower that doesn't grow in your region.









Pick the flowers either in bud or as soon as they open. This is when the color is best. Choose blossoms and petals that haven't been bruised, torn, damaged by insects, or wilted.
Flowers with naturally flat faces, such as pansies, violets, or apple blossoms are easier to press than flowers a more 3 dimensional shape like orchids, lilies, or peonies. However, you can take a flower apart to press, and then reassemble it when you want to use it.
 Flowers that are still wet with dew or rain will be more prone to molding in your press. Flowers picked in the hot summer afternoon sun will be more prone to fading.

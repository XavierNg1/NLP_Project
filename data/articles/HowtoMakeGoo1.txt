 The great thing about goo is that it's simple to make. The only two ingredients you need are a 16 ounce box of cornstarch and a pitcher of water. To make this experiment even more fun, you can add some food coloring, too.;
, Choose a big mixing bowl, so that the goo doesn't overflow the sides when you add water. Go ahead and pour the entire box of cornstarch into the bowl.
 Pour some water slowly into the bowl of cornstarch and mix it with a spoon or your hands until it is thick, with no clumps. Try forming it into a ball with your hand. If it still feels stiff, add more water. The goo is gooey enough when it starts to drip through your fingers after you form it into a ball.









If you add so much water that the goo is too drippy, open another box of cornstarch and add some more to thicken it back up.
Experiment with different levels of gooeyness. If you like being able to form the goo into shapes, don't add a lot of water. If you want it drippy, add as much as you want.
 Pour in some food coloring and start mixing it in. Remember, a little food coloring goes a long way. Stir it with your hands or with a spoon.
 After you've finished making your goo, you can store it in a sealable Ziploc bag so that the goo doesn't dry out.

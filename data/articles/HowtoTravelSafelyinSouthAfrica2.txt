 Safety begins before you depart by leaving prepared. Know where you are going to stay before you depart and know how you intend to get there. Loitering tourists have been victims of crime near travel facilities.
 South African airports have a reputation for luggage tampering and theft, as can be seen in news reports. It is sensible to use tamper evident seals to check if your luggage is intact upon arrival.
 Offers of car transport should only be accepted from airport counters or a staffed taxi rank / marked vehicles.

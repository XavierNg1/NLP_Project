 By killing these bots, you are Skulling and risking whatever you bring, and therefore should bring as little as possible. This being said, have about 70 magic. You cannot do this method if you are above around 90 combat, as you won't be able to attack the bots

, You are trying to keep your risk as low as possible, so buying an air battlestaff and using wind blast is recommended. Have a ring of Kinship in your inventory, and about 5 pieces of food.
 Travel west from until you reach a gate to the wilderness. Go through the gate, then travel north until you see the bots.
 Use your magic abilities and kill the bots. They will run south and try to home teleport, however your attack will interrupt it. When they die, pick up their dragon bones and green dragonhide, and teleport back to Daemonheim, rinse and repeat.
 You made money and helped clean up RuneScape! Be sure to report the bots before you kill them

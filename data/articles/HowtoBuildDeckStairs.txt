 The stair stringers should not be more than 16 inches (400 mm) apart. Set the foot on either a 6 x 6-inch (150 x 150 mm) treated wood timber or roofing paper (if set upon concrete) to prevent rot.


Ideally, the stair tread should be built from a composite wood material designed for exterior decking for its durability.;
, This will give you the number of steps you will need to make.

Adjust the height until the height and steps balance out (since you can't have a half or quarter of a step). Take the number of steps and multiply that by 10.5 inches (266.7 mm). That gives you the length of stair stringer necessary. Take that length and project it out from the deck. Now you have the location for the footing of the stair.
 Set the riser for the height determined by your math and the step by 10 inches (250 mm).
 Use a hand saw to finish the cut.
 Establish the riser boards using 1-inch (25 mm) thick treated wood screws beginning at the bottom riser.


Stringers and risers put into place begin with installation of the treads using composite wood designed for decks (best used for durability and strength). This decking, made from specially prepared compressed wood particles comes in what is referred to as 5/4 thickness. This is 1.25 inches (32 mm) thick and comes in variable widths. Secure all with 3" (75 mm) deck screws.

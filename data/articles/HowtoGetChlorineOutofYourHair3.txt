 Baking soda will effectively remove chlorine and other chemicals from your hair.


You can make a solution with one tablespoon (15 grams) baking soda to one cup (250ml) water, or a paste with one tablespoon (15 grams) baking soda and just enough water to make a paste.
Wash your hair with the baking soda solution. Your hair may feel a bit slimy when shampooing, that means it's working.
Rinse your hair thoroughly, then follow your normal hair-care routine.

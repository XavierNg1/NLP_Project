 A plastic ketchup bottle would work fine, but a squeeze bottle—like you would find in restaurants—works best.;
, Some people like to use several dyes on their shirts, but only one is necessary. Each color dye will consist of:


1 tbsp (15 ml) organic nitrogen (to help conserve the color in the dye)
1 cup (236.5 ml) warm water
1 ounce (28 g) color dye

, For every gallon (3.79 l) of water, mix in 1 cup (236.5 ml) of soda ash, also known as sodium carbonate

,


Make sure that the entire shirt is wet; any part of the shirt that is dry will not absorb the dye.
Wring the shirt out well, so it is damp.
 There are several different designs you can choose from when making tie-dye, among them the spiral design and the sun design.

 Skyrim is also available for PS3 and Xbox 360, but unlike Skyrim for the PC, there is no console screen you can use to type in cheat codes. Instead, there are game glitches or secrets that you can use and abuse. These glitches are minor faults during the development of the game that was included in the released version. Here are some known glitches in Skyrim:


Easy armor level-up—This glitch lets you easily level up your armor. Set the game’s difficulty to Novice and go outside the world. Find a weak enemy and let it attack you while you are healing. The damage you receive will be less than your healing rate. This will help you increase the armor level and Restoration without getting killed.
Quick Speech skill level—This increases your Speech skill quickly. Fast travel to Riften and look for a male Dark Elf called Ungrien inside the city. Once you find him, talk to him and select “Tell me about Maven Black-Briar” and persuade him (X button for PS3 and A button for Xbox 360). After the first persuasion, the Persuade option will still be available, and you can keep using it to level up your Speech skill quicker.
Unlimited arrows—Look for any character anywhere in the map that shoots arrows on training dummies. You can usually find one inside towns. Use Pickpocket (crouch behind it and press the interact button prompted in the screen) on that character, take all the arrows in its inventory, and replace it with any amount of the type of arrow you want. That character will keep on shooting arrows, but this time, it’s the type of arrow that you’ve put inside its inventory. Approach the dummy and collect the arrows.
 Just like cheat codes, there are tons of glitches available in the Internet, and more new glitches gets discovered every now and then. Visit sites like www.pcgamer.com to keep updated on the latest glitches available for your console.

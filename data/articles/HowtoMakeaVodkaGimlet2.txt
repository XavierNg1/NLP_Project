 Pour 2 ounces (60 ml) of vodka, 1 ounce (30 ml) of fresh lime juice, and ¾ ounce (23 ml) of simple syrup into a cocktail shaker. Finish off by adding enough ice to fill the shaker.To get ½ cup (30 ml) of lime juice, you usually need 3 to 4 limes.
You can purchase premade simple syrup, or make your own by combining equal parts sugar and water over heat until the sugar melts.
 Once all of the ingredients are combined in the shaker, shake them well to ensure that they’re fully mixed. It usually takes about 20 seconds of shaking to properly mix the gimlet., When you’re finished shaking the cocktail, use a cocktail strainer to strain it into an old-fashioned glass. You can garnish the gimlet by adding a lime wedge or slice to the glass.If you prefer, you can pour the gimlet over ice to ensure that it’s cold.

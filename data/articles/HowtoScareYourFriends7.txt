 The goal of this prank is to leave a creepy message on the bathroom mirror that only becomes visible once the room steams up when someone showers. Here’s what you’ll need:Liquid dishwashing detergent
A cup of water
Some cotton swabs

, This is what you’ll use to write your message., Ensure that the swap is fully saturated with the soapy water. Make sure the solution isn’t too soapy though, otherwise it won’t be invisible when it dries., Do this in any style you want — thicker or thinner lettering, for example. You might even want to let the water drip down a bit so it mimics dripping blood. Examples of what you might write:

”Help me”
”I see you”
”Hello?”
”Stuck in here”
”Watching you”
”Die”

, You could even write your message backwards to suggest that it was written from the other side of the mirror. Messages like “Help me” or “Stuck in here” or even “Watching you” would be good., The message won’t be invisible until it dries, so make sure that you write it on the mirror when no one will need to use the bathroom right away. Give yourself at least 30 minutes to let it dry.

You can use a blow-dryer on it to help it dry more quickly, if you’re in a rush.
 Ideally your victim will have a shower and steam up the bathroom, and the message will appear. Maybe they won’t scream, but it might still creep them out., When your victim asks you about the message, play stupid. Ask to see it and then act afraid, too. You might even tell them a story that goes with the message.

For example, you might say that you heard a cracking noise last night when you were in there, and have been feeling uneasy going in there since, like something is watching you.

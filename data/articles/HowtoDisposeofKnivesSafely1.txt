 If you're going to throw your knife away, bubble wrap is your best option. This safely coats the blade, preventing injury and accident during disposal.


You might want to wrap the knife in butcher paper first. Then, wrap the knife in a few layers of bubble wrap.If necessary, wrap a layer of duct tape around the bubble wrap to keep it secure.;
, You should consider adding an additional layer of cardboard when disposing of a knife. Place it in an old shoebox or other cardboard container before throwing it out. This may also be effective if you plan on donating the knife., If you do not have cardboard or bubble wrap, you can use newspaper, old clothes, socks, or any material you can easily wrap around the blade. Simply wrap the knife in a few layers of your chosen materials. If necessary, wrap some tape around the material to keep the knife in place.

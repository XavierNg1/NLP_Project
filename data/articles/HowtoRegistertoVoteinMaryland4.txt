, When you arrive at the location you want to register to vote, ask for a registration application. The application will be identical to the one you would fill out if you were sending it through the mail. Therefore, it will be filled out the same way with the same information., When you are finished filling out your application, hand it to the responsible employee where you are. The employee will make sure the application gets where it needs to be.
 As with any registration application you submit online or through the mail, you must generally register at least 21 days prior to any election. However, if you are unable to register in a timely manner, you may be able to register, in person, during "early voting." To register to vote at an early voting location, go to the location located in the county where you live and bring a document that proves where you live (e.g., a driver's license, ID, paycheck, utility bill). With that information in hand, you will be able to register at the polls.

 So something really embarrassing just happened to you. Maybe you tripped while walking in a busy area, or you said something wrong during a class presentation. Your first instinct is probably to blush, run away, or maybe, if it was really bad, to break down in tears. These are all perfectly natural responses, but if you can, try to keep yourself from showing how humiliated you feel.
 If you saw someone who had just done whatever you did, how would you react? You would probably think it was a little funny, and maybe giggle along with everyone else, but you wouldn't judge the person at all. You'd probably forget all about it a few minutes later. Try to apply the same concept to yourself. Looking at yourself through someone else's eyes, it's easier to acknowledge both the humor of the situation and the fact that it's not the end of the world., Depending on how quick-witted you are, a great thing to do is to think up something super funny to say to poke fun at your situation. Something like "And he sticks the landing!" after slipping on ice and landing in a decidedly less than graceful position. This will make everyone laugh at your joke instead of your situation., Give up your self-consciousness and have a good, long laugh. Let's face it––you're probably in a pretty ridiculous situation, and being able to see the humor in bad situations is one of the most important skills in life. Other people will admire you for being able to laugh at yourself, and they will consider you a likeable person with a good sense of humor. And best of all, no one will remember the embarrassing situation you got yourself in in the first place!

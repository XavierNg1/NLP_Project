 Ants are interested in anything sweet and nutritious. Ants will eat honey, colored corn syrup, and anything in between.
 Some sources claim that mixing impure honey into methylated spirits or other alcohol will dissolve it and make the solution milky, while pure honey will stay undissolved at the bottom. Other sources claim the exact opposite! This myth dates back at least to 1893, and was not accepted by professional beekeepers even then., There are several myths around the internet about only pure honey turning clockwise when poured, or only pure honey forming hexagons when left on a plate and covered with water. There is no scientific evidence that impure honey will behave differently in these situations.
 There are many anecdotes floating around about different ways you can test honey for purity, and many of them have not been scientifically tested. If you think something sounds plausible, try testing a jar of honey you think is pure. Then mix it with agave syrup, sugar syrup, or some other added sugar and perform the same test. If you consistently get different results with the diluted syrup than with the pure honey, the test might be useful. Keep in mind that no one household test can detect every possible additive in honey, however.

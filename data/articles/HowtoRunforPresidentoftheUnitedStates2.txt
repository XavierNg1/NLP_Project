 If you spend or raise over $5,000 dollars for your cause, you are then automatically considered a candidate by the FEC (Federal Elections Commission). Go to their website and start the process rolling.You'll have to keep the FEC updated with financial reports on income, personal spending and debt settlements for the entirety of your campaign. If you can, hire someone now to do this for you. You'll be too busy wining and dining, schmoozing and boozing, and meeting and greeting to balance receipts.
 Do this in all 50 states. This may be difficult and expensive, but hey! This is probably the only time you'll run for president, so it's best to go big or go home. Think of it as an investment in yourself. Or, rather, everyone else's investment in you.


Each state is different. You must contact each state's Secretary of State for the forms needed to be listed. Getting signatures and support across the state is the goal. As always, there's a website to help you get started with that, too., This is (usually) a nonprofit organization to find out if your campaign will actually work. Choose a campaign manager to delegate the necessary duties. Make a website explaining what you plan to do, your perspectives, and why you're running. Make it very convincing and be honest. Get your name into opinion polls. All in all, start spreading the word.


Assemble a team of ground workers. They'll go knocking door-to-door, spreading the good news of your name and getting a feel for the area. Do this in as many metropolitan areas as possible to feel out the competition and the areas you may need to concentrate on for your campaign.

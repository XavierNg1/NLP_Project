 To ensure that your oven is properly heated when the cauliflower cheese casserole is ready to bake, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the correct temperature. Most models will sound an alert or flash a light to let you know that they’re preheated.;
, Take 1 medium head of cauliflower and cut it into quarters with a sharp knife. Trim away the tough core that’s at the center of the head from each quarter. The cauliflower will fall apart into large florets when you cut out the core -- cut them into 1- to 2-inch (2.5 to 5 cm) florets.While a knife makes cutting the large florets into small ones easier, you can often use your fingers to snap the florets into smaller pieces as well.
 Place the cut cauliflower into a medium pot and add enough water to cover the pieces. Bring the pot to a boil on medium-high to high heat, and allow it to cook for approximately 10 to 15 minutes or until the cauliflower pieces are just tender.It’s a good idea to add some salt to the water before boiling to help season the cauliflower. Mix in 1 ½ to 2 teaspoons (8.5 to 11 g) before turning on the heat.
 Once the cauliflower pieces have boiled long enough to just become tender, remove the pot from the heat. Pour the cauliflower into a colander to drain it, and then set the pieces on a towel to absorb any additional moisture as you work on the sauce.

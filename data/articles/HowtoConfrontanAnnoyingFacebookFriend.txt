 Does he or she share ever detail of his or her life, no matter how mundane? Does he or she pressure you to like every single post that he or she makes? Take time to think about why your friend bothers you so much before proceeding.;
, It's inadvisable to confront your friend online about issues like these, because misunderstandings could happen online. Instead, it's best to wait until you can see your friend face-to-face. If need be, you could call your friend, or send an email explaining that you want to talk, but do not give any details other than that.
 Be polite yet direct. You could say: "I've enjoyed being your friend on Facebook, but I would also appreciate it if you could please stop (whatever is bothering you). (Explain why that behavior is bothering you)". For instance, if your friend is pressuring you to like every single post that he or she makes, you could say "I've enjoyed being your friend on Facebook, but I would also appreciate it if you could please stop pressuring me to like every single post that you make. I have liked several of your posts, but I have other friends on Facebook and their posts appear on my news feed, too, and I don't have time to check for your posts all day".
 If the behavior continues, you could ask to see your friend again in person. This time, be a little more direct with him or her, but remain polite as usual. For example, you could say: "The last time we talked, I asked you to stop (doing whatever what is bothering you). I'm not sure why you ignored my request, but please heed it from here on forth".
 If the behavior continues even more, that would be an appropriate time to unfriend the Facebook friend.

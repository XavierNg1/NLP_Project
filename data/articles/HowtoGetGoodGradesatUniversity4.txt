 Your attitude can actually make a big difference when it comes to academic success. Try to feel positive about school and learning. You should also feel confident that you're able to succeed. This can help you have the energy necessary to get good grades.If you have a setback, see it as an opportunity to learn and bounce back rather than a defeat. Remind yourself that it's normal to get one bad grade or struggle with one subject. This is how you'll learn to be strong.
Remind yourself of the benefits of an education. You're learning to have a more nuanced understanding of the world while assuring yourself future success.
 Many people neglect sleep in college, but you're unlikely to be an academic success if you're tired all the time. Consistently running on less than 4 hours of sleep will inhibit your ability to concentrate.Stick to a sleep schedule. Try to go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day.
Avoid electronic screens before bed, as these can stimulate brain activity and make sleep difficult.
 If you're unorganized, this will make everything about school more difficult. Try to keep all your course materials well organized. This will make studying and doing homework easier.Invest in a large planner. Store material from different courses in different folders in your planner.
Never throw anything out until the end of the semester. You never know when you may need something. Have a folder or section of your desk for old papers, notes, and other class materials.
 A healthy diet can help give you the energy you need to earn high marks. Avoid processed foods and sugary foods. Have a salad for lunch instead of a slice of pizza. Snack on things like fruit, vegetables, and nuts over chips and other junk foods. You will be surprised by how much more energetic and confident you feel when eating a diet of healthy foods.

 During the fall allergy season keep your windows closed in order to prevent unwanted ragweed pollen from entering your home. August and September can often be fairly warm months so it is best to use your air conditioner to beat the heat. Air conditioning can also help reduce humidity in your home which will prevent mold from developing inside which can often aggravate allergy symptoms. It is also recommended that you keep your car windows closed and use the air conditioner while driving.
 AC and furnace filters help to limit the number of airborne pollutants, such as dust and pollen. These filters, over time, can become blocked by particles making them less efficient. By replacing your air filter regularly you can help ensure that allergens are being removed from the air in your home. High efficiency filters are recommended as the best type of filter to help with air quality.
 Once you have been exposed to allergens it is a good idea to immediately wash your hands, face, and clothes after coming inside. If you were outside for a long time you may want to shower and change into new clothes. , Pets can often carry pollens and other allergens into the house. Pollen will cling onto the hair and enter your home undetected. By keeping your pets inside during allergy season, or minimizing their time outdoors, you can help to limit the amount of pollen that enters your home. Keep pets off the furniture and out of your bedroom to ensure they don't track ragweed pollen into the areas you use most in the home.

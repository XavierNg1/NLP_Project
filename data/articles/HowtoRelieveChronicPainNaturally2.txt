 Mild to moderate exercise such as Tai chi, Qigong and yoga as well as walking, gardening and low-impact exercise may help to relieve chronic pain. Speak to an exercise specialist about specific types of exercises because some exercise types can make the pain worse instead of making it better.


Exercise releases natural pain killers such as endorphins. These chemicals can relieve pain as well as providing many other positive health benefits., Acupuncture has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years. The basic concept of acupuncture is that if there is a blockage in qi (oneâ€™s life energy), then illness or pain is the result. The very thin needles used in acupuncture and the pressure in acupressure can unblock these energy pathways and restore the easy and unimpeded flow of qi.


Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for chronic pain, cutting pain levels by as much as 50%. , Practitioners of chiropractic medicine are trained in the structure and mechanics of the muscular and skeletal system, using this knowledge to correct and re-align the muscles and bones. Recent studies have indicated that chiropractic manipulation and other approaches can be very effective for low back pain, neck, shoulder, hip, and knee pain.While many chiropractors work on spinal alignment, all chiropractors are also trained to:


use manual adjustment or manipulation
provide guidance on exercises to restore strength and function
provide nutritional advice
use ultrasound and laser therapies to treat pain

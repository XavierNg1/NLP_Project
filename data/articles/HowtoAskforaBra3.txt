 Sports bras are a smart first choice because they are easy to shop for and are comfortable as well. They will also offer support for your breasts without being constricting. A training bra is similar to a sports bra in that it is generally made from a breathable cotton-blend fabric and offers comfortable support. However, if you are a larger bust size you may need the support of a traditional, underwire bra.If you are not sure that you want a bra quite yet, then you may want to consider buying a few camisole tops. These are light shirts made out of soft fabrics, such as cotton, that have bra support built in., If you feel overwhelmed by the whole process of asking and then shopping, you may just want to go online with your own money and purchase a bra for yourself. Of course, you’ll want to make sure that making this purchase solo will not upset anyone, including your parents. But, you can take your own measurements and then test out at least one option without any pressure., Most stores have bra fitters on staff and they will help you by measuring both your bust and band size. Don’t be nervous or embarrassed about allowing them to measure you as they do this for a living and are used to women of all shapes and sizes. They will then help you to select a handful of bras that fit your body and budget., After you have a bra in your hand in the store, try it on in the dressing room and take some time determining how well it fits. You want a bra that does not squeeze you in an uncomfortable way. You will also want to watch to make sure that the straps are not cutting into your shoulders or back., You should probably buy a handful of bras, somewhere between four to six, when you decide to start wearing them daily. This will allow you to wash them after wearing and will keep the bras in good condition. Don’t feel as if you need to buy all of these at once, you can add to your undergarment wardrobe over time.

 There are several quality levels available to purchase at a very minimal cost. If you opt to make your own, you can use a water jug, milk carton, or a clear plastic tube.;
, This will allow you to get the water into the tube.
 Begin sucking on the tube to get the water flowing. Siphon, or suck, on the tube hard enough to get the water moving but not enough to get a mouthful of liquid. Once you get the water moving a little, it should flow freely.


Alternatively, get a bucket (or use the bathtub or kiddie pool), and put the whole tube into the bucket slowly from one end, so it fills with water.
 Make sure you perform this action before the tube is completely full to prevent the water from spilling as you are moving around.
 Tap your finger along the tubing to loosen and expel any trapped air bubbles. Hold the ends of the tube even with one another, and verify that the water lines up equally. If it does, you are ready to go. If it does not, you need to continue tapping the tube, as it's likely that air bubbles are still trapped.
 The person must hold the tube against the surface you are leveling at a predetermined height. For example, if you are trying to draw a straight line on a wall, choose a height you want the line at, and have the person hold the tubing at the desired height.
 Have your helper move further along the surface you are leveling, hold the tube up to the predetermined height, and mark the spot where the water line is.

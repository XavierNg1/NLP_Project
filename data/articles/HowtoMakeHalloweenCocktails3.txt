 Place one martini glass in the freezer until it's cold and frosty. If you don't have space in your freezer, fill the martini glass with ice water and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Pour out the ice water once the glass is frosty.A frosty glass will make the drink look spookier and will keep the cocktail colder.
 Pour 0.5 ounce (15 ml) of dry vermouth into your frosty martini glass. Hold the glass by the stem and carefully swirl the dry vermouth around the glass. Pour out the vermouth.This will prevent the martini from tasting too strongly of vermouth. If you enjoy the flavor, consider leaving it in the glass or adding it to the shaker with the gin.
 Fill one cocktail shaker with ice. Pour 2.5 ounces (75 ml) of gin over the ice and cover the shaker with a lid. Shake the gin well to thoroughly chill it. Strain the gin out into your martini glass.You can easily multiply this recipe to serve more cocktails. If you'd just like to make the single cocktail, consider using a small cocktail shaker.
 Take a cocktail skewer or cocktail pick and stick it through one pickled baby beet. Place the skewered baby beet into the cocktail and serve or drink it immediately.The pickled baby beet may stain your fingers, so consider putting on gloves or handling it carefully.

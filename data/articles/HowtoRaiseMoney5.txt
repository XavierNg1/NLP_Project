 Grants are, essentially, free money. You don’t have to pay them back like you do a loan. However, they are often competitive and difficult to get, so be ready to put some work into it. Search for grants which apply to you, where the money is intended to fund people like you or the sorts of things you want to do.


You can find grants through a number of websites, through your local library, or using university or college resources. Just be sure that whatever you’re applying for is from a reputable organization. You should never have to pay money in order to get a grant.
 Filling out the applications can be time consuming and complex, so prepare for that. There is often a large associated writing element, generally in the form of an essay or letter describing what you are doing and why (and how!). It may be helpful to hire or find a grant writer or at least someone who writes well, as this will increase your chances of getting the grant.
 Grants will often have a long list of requirements that they want met. Rise to meet those requirements and be sure to use the money for what you said you would. You can find yourself in a lot of trouble if you don’t.

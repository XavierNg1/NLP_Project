 For example, a disco-themed party invitation could feature a large disco ball. People are likely to look at your invitation and make a quick first impression -- you want that first impression to be informative and fun.


If your party doesn't have a theme, have the invitation mirror the formality of the party. If you're throwing a black tie soiree, keep it simple with a plain border, a fancy font, and to-the-point text. If you're throwing a rave, make your invitation as wild as you'd like.
You can also send a mail to your friends and relatives to give an invitation for a party.;
, That's usually the time and date of the party, location, where to call for more information, and whether or not the guest needs to RSVP are all important. And do they need to bring anything (food, swimsuit, etc.)? Does the party have a specific time it ends?


You may want to include a few selling points if applicable. Will you be having awards for best dressed? Provide beer and wine? Will there be 50 varieties of European cheeses? Give your guests a slight clue as to what you have planned for the evening to whet their appetite.
 A formal party should require a more formal invitation, such as a letter. An informal party invitation is up to your discretion â€“ a phone call, email, or social media event would all work fine.


Formal events generally require a bit of advanced notice -- preferably around 2 weeks.
 There are several things to consider when thinking about a party's size and attendance:


How big is the space where your party will be? Can your apartment hold 10 people, 50 people, 200 people?
Is it okay for the people you invite to bring friends? How many friends?
Do you have a say over who those friends are?
How many people can you feed and have drinks for at your party? Does this include friends of friends?
If you're having your party at a club, bar, hotel, rented room, etc., does the owner have limits on the number of people that can be there?

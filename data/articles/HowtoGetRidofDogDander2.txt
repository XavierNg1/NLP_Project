 Just like humans, dogs constantly shed dead skin cells. Bathing your dog, preferably outside, once a week with a dog-specific shampoo will help reduce the amount of your dog’s dander in your home.Here are some tips for bathing your dog:Apply a gentle conditioner to your dog’s fur and skin after the bath. The conditioner will keep your dog’s fur and skin moisturized and reduce dander.
Don’t bathe your dog too frequently. Frequent baths can dry out your dog’s skin, increasing the amount of dander.
 Regular brushing will spread healthy oils throughout your dog’s fur and skin. These oils will keep the fur and skin healthy and help reduce shedding and dander. Regular brushing will also remove loose flakes of dead skin.Brush your dog outside to reduce the amount of dander in your home.If you are allergic to the dander, ask someone who isn’t allergic to brush your dog., When you let your dog outside or take your dog for a walk, wipe it down with a damp paper towel before coming inside.Wiping down your dog can loosen and remove flakes of dead skin. Doing this outside will help keep dander out of your home.

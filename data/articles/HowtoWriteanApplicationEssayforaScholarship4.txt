 Don’t wait until the last minute to write your essay. This will make you rushed and lower the quality of your work. It will also take away from the time that you could have spent perfecting and editing your essay. How much time you need is really dependent on you, but do make sure that you give yourself enough.


Take into account that it might be harder than you thought. It could also be that you end up being a lot busier than you thought. You may not have as much time available as you plan to so make sure to leave yourself lots of wiggle room.
 Don’t sound cliché, and don’t use all of these overused descriptors. You really need to make your essay stand out so use language which is active, exciting, and engaging. A good way to do this is to follow the advice above about making it personal and passionate.
 Make sure that everything you write clearly ties back to the question you were asked and the unifying statement of your answer. You don’t want someone to get to the end of your essay and say, “What did I just read?” In fact, if you get too off topic, they probably won’t finish reading it at all.
 Don’t make your essay into some sob story. It shouldn’t be about someone giving you money because you’ve had such a hard time. Everybody has had a hard time at one point or another. You should instead make your story one of triumph in the face of adversity. They will want to give you money if they see you as someone who can defy the odds.Having a sob story and then defying the odds by trying to go to college isn’t really enough, by the way. Having a really tough time and still getting good grades or managing to hold down a job during high school is much better.
 This gives the impression that A) you have a very unrealistic view of yourself and your abilities or B) you’re lying or C) you’ve never had to work through problems and will be unprepared to handle the stress of college or whatever it is you’re studying.

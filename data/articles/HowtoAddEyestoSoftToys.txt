 If you are making an animal, the eyes should be representative of the animal. More human-like eyes are suitable for dolls. Some eyes will change the mood, look, or character of the toy, so it is a good idea to hold up different sets of eyes to see what overall look is created.;
, There are lots of possibilities for making eyes for soft toys. Some ideas include:


Embroidering eyes
Sewing on beads or buttons
Making raised eyes out of the same fabric as the toy, with felt additions
Safety lock eyes
Googly eyes (glued on firmly, not suitable for under 5's)
Marker or fabric paint drawn eyes (but be careful or this can look kitsch)

, Embroidered or marker made eyes tend to be the safest as there is nothing to pull off and swallow.
 To prevent eyes from coming off, use strong thread such as waxed buttonhole thread or dental floss. Be sure to stitch on tightly and firmly.
 They should look as realistic as possible and should be spaced as they would be on a real human or animal, or at least give a sense of perspective to a human viewer. Consider the possibilities of how eyes come across through positioning; for example, eyes that are large and wide apart have an innocent and naive look, whereas eyes positioned closely together can look stern and mean. Play around a bit before settling on the final positioning.
 This will make it appear more realistic and appealing. It also helps to define the whole facial features.

 Chlorine bleach, which is the most common kind, is a strong acid. Bleach will burn your skin if you get it on yourself. Wear gloves that go up your forearm to protect from splashes.Even after you dilute the bleach, it’s best to wear gloves.
 Just as bleach can burn your skin, it’s also harmful if you breathe its fumes for a long period of time. Open the windows when you can, and set up fans to move the air around.If you have any breathing problems, wear a mask to reduce the intake of fumes, or avoid using bleach altogether.
 Undiluted bleach will fade and ruin many different materials. Never pour it over a wood floor or carpet. A stainless steel sink or a plastic wash tub is the best place to dilute your bleach., If you mix bleach with hot water, you’ll increase the fumes that are released from the bleach. This worsens the already hazardous breathing situation. In addition, hot water decomposes the active ingredient in bleach making it essentially useless., Bleach is highly concentrated and is not meant to be used undiluted. Without diluting bleach with water, you’ll likely do more damage than good. Bleach is strong enough to still be effective even in a diluted state.

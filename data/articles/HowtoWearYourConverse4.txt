For a sleek look, tie a knot beneath the tongue of each shoe and tuck the lace ends into the shoes to hide them.
For a casual look, lace all but the last two lace holes.
For a sloppy look, loosen all the laces and leave them untied, tucking the ends in if necessary.
For a grungy look, lace high-tops to the top (or near the top), wrap the ends of the laces around your legs, and tie them without bows.
For a clean look, remove the laces altogether, sew the tongue halfway up the sides, and turn your Converse into slip-ons.

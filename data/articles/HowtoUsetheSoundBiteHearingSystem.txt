 The SoundBite consists of two parts: the behind-the-ear (BTE) microphone, and the in-the-mouth (ITM) device. The BTE microphone is a hearing aide-shaped plastic piece that goes in the ear, and the ITM device is a plastic retainer that is in the shape of the back molar teeth and goes in the mouth. The BTE microphone absorbs the sounds coming from the outside environment and wirelessly channels these sounds to the ITM device. Once the ITM device receives the channeled sounds, it transforms them into sound vibrations that move via the molar teeth and skull bones to the cochlea.

Part A of the BTE microphone holds the rechargeable battery that powers Part C, which is the actual microphone that picks up sound. A short, plastic tube labeled Part B secures these parts onto the ear.

Part D carries the rechargeable battery that enables Part F to vibrate. Directly connected to Part D is Part E, which is an imprint of the patients teeth that fastens the ITM device into the mouth.

, Make sure Part B is going towards the top of your head.

, Â 

Part F of the ITM device will be placed on the opposite side of the mouth than the deaf ear. So if you are deaf in your left ear and have the BTE microphone on your left ear, you will place Part F in the right side of your mouth.

You may now eat, drink, and talk normally as you would if the SoundBite hearing system was not in place.

 If the original window was an older, weighted window, there may be pulleys at the top of the jamb that need to be removed. Clear any dust from the bottom corners of the frame to ensure a good bond with the sealant.
 If there were weights, remove the pulleys and apply a small amount of caulk to any holes.

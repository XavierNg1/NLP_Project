 Place a large saucepan on the stove and set the heat to medium-high. Cut the butter into smaller cubes, then add it to the skillet. Gently stir the butter as it melts., Keep stirring the mixture with a rubber spatula until the marshmallows melt., Keep stirring until the cocoa powder is evenly mixed into the butter and marshmallows., Gently fold the cereal and chocolate chips into the mixture using a rubber spatula. Save the rest of the chocolate chips for later., The best pan to work with would be a square-shaped, 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) pan, but you can also use anything that is similar in size., You can stop at the chocolate chips, but you can give your rice crispies a nice touch with some chocolate drizzle. Simply melt 3 ounces (75 grams) of chocolate in the microwave or in a double boiler, then drizzle it over the rice crispy cake. You can do this using a spoon or a squeeze bottle.If you wish to use a microwave: place the chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl, and heat on medium-high for 1 minute. Give the chocolate a stir, then microwave it at 15 to 20-second intervals until it is smooth. Stir the chocolate between each interval.If you wish to use a double boiler: fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a heat-safe bowl on top. Add the chocolate into the bowl, and let it melt over low heat., This will help harden the chocolate, and prevent the rice crispies from getting too gooey. If you are in a hurry, stick the pan in the freezer for about 20 minutes., The rice crispies will be fragile, so cut them in the pan first, then serve them using a spatula. If you try to take the entire thing out of the pan, you risk breaking it. You have enough to make about 16 to 24 servings.

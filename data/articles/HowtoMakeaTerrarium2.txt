 If the container was previously used, wash it thoroughly with soapy water and rinse it well to remove all soapy residue. A dirty terrarium grows bacteria over time, so use an anti-bacterial soap if you can.
 Mix the gravel/pebbles with a generous handful of charcoal. Put a layer about an inch high of this mixture inside the terrarium container.
 Moss will prevent soil from filtering down into the gravel.
 Depending on the size of the terrarium and the length of the plants' roots, you should be adding about two or three inches of soil. Gently pack it down to remove air pockets and level the surface. Dig small holes into the soil where you will put the plants.
 Remove a plant from its container and tease the roots gently apart to remove excess soil. Nestle it carefully into a hole you made previously and add more soil around it, patting it down gently. Repeat with the rest of the plants.
 You can also add moss or pebbles to neaten the top of the terrarium.
 Lightly water your terrarium and you're done!

, Once you know what search engine you would like to use, you will want to visit their home page. For example, if you want to use Google, visit google.com then continue to the next step. Visiting the search engine’s page will add it to a list that will appear later on.
 In the upper right-hand corner of the Edge browser window you should see three dots. Click this and click “Settings” at the bottom of the list to open the basic browser settings. A menu should pop in from the right side of the page. Scroll down this menu, and click the “View advanced settings” button near the bottom.
, There should only be one option currently in the list, followed by an “<Add new>” option at the bottom.
 A menu will open, and from this menu, you should see the compatible search engines listed.
 Not every search engine on the Internet can be used as a search provider. Microsoft says that only search engines that support OpenSearch standard can be used as a search provider. The Edge browser detects this automatically upon you visiting a search provider’s home page, and these will be added to this list if compatible.


After clicking the “Add” button, you should be taken back to the Advanced settings for Edge.
 You should still see Bing listed there by default.
 Click the drop-down box again. Now instead of just Bing shown in the list, you should see the search engine you added. Click the new search provider, and everything is all set. Edge will now use this as your new default search engine.

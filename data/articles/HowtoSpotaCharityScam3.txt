 Email is not secure, and a good charity will not pressure you to share sensitive information via email. If a charity asks you to email any sensitive information, like your social security number, online, this is probably a charity scam., Charities want donations to come through secure, legitimate means. Legitimate charities also track donations carefully to make sure they're following legal regulations.

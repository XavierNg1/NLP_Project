 Quitting always has consequences. Sometimes, these are good (e.g. relief). Other times these consequences are regrets and missed opportunities. Discuss the consequences with your child, but allow them to decide if the consequences warrant quitting or pushing through.For example, you might say something like, “Do you understand that if you quit, you cannot change your mind next week?”

, If your child does insist on quitting, you should insist that they discuss it with their teacher, coach, etc. Do not opt to have that conversation for them, and do not let them simply stop showing up. By having a conversation with the person leading the activity, they may find that they can work through the problem and continue the activity.You could tell your child something like, “I support your decision to quit, but only after you have had a conversation with your teacher about your concerns.”

, If your child chooses to quit an activity, allow them to feel the consequences. Consequences handed down by parents often seem random and misplaced to children. Natural and logical consequences are easier for children to understand, because they come as a result of an action (or inaction).An example of a natural consequence to quitting might be that the child no longer gets to see their friends at practice each night.
Remind your child that they chose to quit, and that these consequences come with quitting. You can say something like “We discussed this before you quit. I respected your decision, but now it’s too late to rejoin the swim team. You’ll have to wait until the next season.”

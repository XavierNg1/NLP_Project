 Consider the size of the target, the number of potential entry points and the security mechanisms that may be in place. A hacker should think about company names and subsidiaries, phone numbers, domain names and their IP networks.;
, For example, identify startup companies that most likely have weak security, especially those recently acquired by large companies. Hacking into these smaller companies may provide information about the unrestricted virtual private networks the larger target companies.
 Many TCP and UDP services send data that will identify the running application as a response to random data. You can find exploits by cross-referencing the data you find in vulnerability databases, like SecurityFocus.
 You will need a password and user account, which is usually acquired through a sneak attack. That is, many hackers will take information from a company website and directly contact an employee by phone, pretending to be the help desk or a web technician. Many unsuspecting employees will give valuable information to a person who sounds authoritative.
 For example, you can enter with the user's name and password and replace an everyday piece of software like Notepad.exe with a piece of Trojan code. This code can allow a hacker to become an administrator in the system, so that the next time that the hacker logs on, they will automatically be added to the administrators' group and will have instant access to "admin only" information.

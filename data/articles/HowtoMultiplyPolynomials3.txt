 A problem involving a two binomials will involve two polynomials, each with two terms that are separated by either a plus sign or a minus sign.


A polynomial problem involving two binomials will look something like: (ax + by) * (cx + dy)

Example: (2x + 3y)(4x + 5y)

, FOIL is an acronym used to explain how terms are distributed. Distribute first terms, outside terms, inside terms, and last terms.


After this, your rewritten polynomial problem will effectively look like: (ax)(cx) + (ax)(dy) + (by)(cx) + (by)(dy)

Example: (2x + 3y)(4x + 5y) = (2x)(4x) + (2x)(5y) + (3y)(4x) + (3y)(5y)

, The constants refer to the numerical digits in the problem. These are multiplied as they usually would be according to the standard times table.


In other words, during this part of the problem, you are multiplying a, b, c, and d together.
Example: (2x)(4x) + (2x)(5y) + (3y)(4x) + (3y)(5y) = 8(x)(x) + 10(x)(y) + 12(y)(x) + 15(y)(y)

, The variables refer to the letters in the equation. When you multiply these variables, different variables will simply be combined together. When you multiply a variable by a like variable, though, you raise that variable by another power.


In other words, you are multiplying the the x and y portions of the equation.
Example: 8(x)(x) + 10(x)(y) + 12(y)(x) + 15(y)(y) = 8x^2 + 10xy + 12xy + 15y^2

, This type of problem is complex enough to potentially produce like terms, meaning two or more end terms that share the same ending variable. If this happens, you should add or subtract the like terms as needed to determine your final answer.


The result will look something like: acx^2 + adxy + bcxy + bdy^2 = acx^2 + abcdxy + bdy^2

Example: 8x^2 + 22xy + 15y^2

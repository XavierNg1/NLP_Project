 Table salt bears the chemical formula NaCl, as it is comprised of one sodium and one chlorine atom. To determine the polarity of table salt, you can find that the electronegativity of sodium is 0.9 and that of chlorine is 3.0. You will find the difference between the two electronegativities to be 2.1, which means that table salt is held together by an ionic bond (and thus is polar).

You could also make a reasonable assumption that the bond is polar simply by noticing where each atom lies on the periodic table.
 Start by looking at a periodic table that lists electronegativities. You will find that of hydrogen to be 2.1 and that of carbon to be 2.5. The difference between the two is 0.4, meaning that a carbon-hydrogen bond is (slightly) polar., To accomplish this, you must look at a periodic table that lists electronegativities. Locate two atoms that have identical electronegativities. These two atoms will form a covalent bond.

For example, hydrogen and tellurium will form a covalent bond.

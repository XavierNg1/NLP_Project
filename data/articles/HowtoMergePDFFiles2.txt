 Most computers have Adobe Reader or Acrobat Reader, but Acrobat was created specifically for editing and managing PDFs. As of 2015, the only Adobe product that can merge PDFs is the paid program Adobe Acrobat DC.However, many computers come with the program pre-installed. If not, you'll need to buy it or move on to other methods. You can use the Standard or Pro version.


If you are not sure if you already have Acrobat DC, right-click (PC) or Ctrl-click (Mac) on the one of your PDF's and hover over "Open With." All PDF compatible programs will appear.
While Adobe now charges for Acrobat, you can download a 30-day trial that will let you merge PDFs immediately if you are in a pinch., If you don't have "Create PDF" on your toolbar, go to "View" → "Tools" → "Create PDF." This is for newer versions of the program.


If you do not have these options, try navigating to "View" → "Task Buttons" → "Show All Task Buttons."

, From the "Create" menu, choose the "Merge Files..." option. It may also be labeled as "Combine Files" This will allow you to pull multiple files from your computer and merge them into one PDF.


If you've got the unpaid version of Acrobat, you must click on "Tools" under "Create PDF." You'll see "Combine Files" in the following menu, and clicking on it will bring you to a page offering for you to buy the appropriate software., Locate the files on your computer. Once you click OK on a file, it will flow into the white box on the right. This is your organizing section for the entire merged document.
 Once you've pulled all the files you want to merge, use the "Remove," "Move Up," and "Move Down" buttons on the left to organize them in the correct order.


Uncheck "Include all open PDF files" if you don't want Adobe to include a PDF file you might have open in the background.
 Your PDFs will be organized in one file. Be sure to click "Save As..." under File and name your new PDF file.

 Your readers will be most interested in topics that are dominating the news, such as politics or pop culture, and not some obscure event that’s no longer relevant. Stay on top of the news cycle and be ready to jump in with your own opinion.Scan the headlines of a couple of newspapers and magazines and see what events are most frequent amongst them. These issues that are occurring frequently across various media are ones that the general public will be interested in.
Often newspaper columns are about politics, but they can draw on social issues also, such as prison conditions.
 Providing your readers with a fresh approach to a story can make your column appealing. Thinking about new angles for a topic on current events will be sure to speak to readers.Don’t be afraid to include yourself in your topic. Look at your own personal history for a way to contribute something unique to your column.Dive into the details and see where they take you. Looking closely at details may provoke a new idea.Focusing on local angles is a great way to make your column relevant to your reader., Have the conviction to suggest a solution or two for the opinion you’ve stated. Readers are looking for answers when they pick up a newspaper column, and it’s your job as the columnist to provide them.If, for example, you’re going to say, “Social media use by students during school hours is crushing student productivity,” you’d better be prepared to offer a solution to get students to put aside social media and concentrate on the tasks at hand.
If you’ve got a strong point of view on a particular topic, but have no solutions to offer, you should wait to write the column until you’ve got more concrete solutions.

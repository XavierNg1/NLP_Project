, Cornmeal can help remove dust and grime from very dirty flowers. Fill a Ziploc bag with four to five tablespoons of cornmeal. Corn meal can act like a tiny sponge and remove unwanted grime from flowers. Place the flowers in the bag and seal it. Shake the bag for about 60 seconds. When you remove the flowers, shake them lightly to remove excess cornmeal and then remove the flowers. Dust and dirt should be removed., Compressed air can be used to remove small amounts of dust and dirt from silk flowers. You can buy compressed air at most department stores and then use it to remove dust and dirt from silk flowers.You can use the compressed air to blow light coverings of dust and dirt off the flowers.
However, you should avoid compressed air on very delicate silk flowers. It may cause petals to crumble.
 If you have a hairdryer, you can use this on silk flowers. This may work on very delicate compressed flowers that would not respond well to compressed air. Turn the hair dryer to a low setting and use it to blow any unwanted dirt and grime from the flowers.This is very effective with very light layers of dust. Heavier dust or dirt may not respond as well to a hairdryer.

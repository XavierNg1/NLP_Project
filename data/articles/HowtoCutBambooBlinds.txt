Inside Mount: Measure the width of the window frame's inside edge at the top, middle and bottom and use the smallest of the three measurements. Typically, a set of inside mount blinds should measure about 1/2-inch less than the width of the window frame.
Outside Mount: Measure the width of the window frame and ensure that the blinds will extend over the window opening at least 2 inches (5.1Â cm) on each side. This will allow for adequate light gap coverage.;
, Most edge bindings are sewn into place and may need to be cut for removal.



Roll and fasten the bamboo shades tightly around the headrail. You may use a rubber band or masking tape to secure the blinds at the center point.
Cover the ends of the blinds with masking tape to prevent chipping or splintering of the delicate material.
Measure and mark the appropriate width. You will want to cut the excess length equally at each end, so measure and mark carefully.
Cut the blind slats and bottom rail using a hacksaw. For maximum efficiency, you may choose to use a miter box as a guide. Cut one end, tamp the blinds, then cut the remaining end.
 If not, trim individual elements as needed to ensure a consistent width.

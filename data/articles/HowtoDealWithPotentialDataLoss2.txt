 In the best-case scenario, you or someone else could have deleted the file accidentally. If this happened, it’s likely to be in the recycle bin, unless that was emptied too. If you find the item, you can bring it back by clicking “Restore Item” in the right-click item menu.
 Majority of the operating systems will have a backup program that regularly create backups of your files. Use a tutorial to show you how to restore data from those backup files if you are using Windows. Mac also has options for creating backups e.g. on Time Machine and iCloud. You can find instructions for Time Machine retrieval on Apple support.
 If you try to retrieve lost data from a previous version, but the option for restoration is not available, try to open the file and save it to a different location from the one saved in. This may actually do the trick.
 If you did not have a backup on your system or you do not have System Restore, you can purchase and install file recovery software. These programs can help you to retrieve data lost to different situations e.g. malware and viruses, power failure, bad sectors on the drive or logical drive damage.


However, you should not attempt to use recovery software on mechanically damaged drives, e.g. a drive ruined by dropping or soaking in water. Only use recovery software where the drive is functional. With such extremes, you may have only one shot at recovery, and any careless action you take may cause you to lose it forever. Package it carefully and transport it to specialist data recovery agents as soon as you can.
Instead of purchasing the recovery software, you can take it to a company that specializes in data recovery or get the software from companies that specialize in selling file recovery software.
Steer clear of free data recovery software, as they may contain hidden spyware that may infect your computer causing you further damage in other areas.

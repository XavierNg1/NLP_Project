 This will set Google as the default search engine. Google is Opera's default search engine out of the box.


To change the search engine to a specific country's Google search, click the "Manage search engines" button. Select "Add new search" and then fill out the fields. Use www.google.com/search?q=%s as the Address, and replace .com with the country's extension (i.e. co.uk).

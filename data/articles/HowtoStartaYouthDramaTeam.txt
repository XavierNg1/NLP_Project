 Do you want to perform comedies? Tragedies? Modern pieces? Shakespeare? Improv or Comedy Sports? Make sure you know what direction you want your youth team to go in. If you'll need a script, pick one out. If you want to wait until you have a group and have them decide, at least have a direction in mind.;
, Will this be a recurring troupe, with actors constantly going from one show to the next rehearsal? Will this be a seasonal thing? Will this be a yearly thing? Make sure you have an idea of how long each show will run for, as well.
 See if you can use a theater, or if you're in the summer, outside theater is also very cool. The performance space isn't as important right now, but make sure you have a space for you and your actors to at least rehearse in.
 If you need some pretty serious lights, or really any lights at all, make sure you can find a light design artist and a light board op. Same for sound, costumes, sets, props, etc.
 If you're raising money for a cause, or you're paying for the space you're in, you'll want to charge admission. Otherwise, communities always appreciate free things to do.
 Some rehearsal spaces may only allow you to rehearse there if you have an adult present. You may want an experienced adult with a theater background to have to help you guide your team. Then again, if you feel having that adult isn't necessary, then feel free to go without.
 Post up posters! Talk to people! Get a piece of your school website or newspaper to advertise for you! If you don't want people to audition in, and you'd rather just have a collective group of actors, advertise a first meeting for everyone. Be sure to put down your contact info for people who are interested but can't make it.
 Let everyone have a say, but try to avoid having a split group. Have a direction in mind and ask everyone to go along. Feel free to make executive decisions, if necessary.
 Perform! Have fun with your youth theater troupe!

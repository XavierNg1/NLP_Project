 Take some quiet time a the end of each day and visualize the uber-pro (top-pro) skills you are going to flaunt tomorrow.;
, Train your skills at least six hours a day taking breaks of about thirty minutes or one hour every two to three hours

,,, After eight to fourteen months of this, your skills should have developed enough to become slightly pro.
 You could be a pro at FPS, but if you're still a newbie at RTS you're eventually going to get "pwned".
 Once you have uber-pro skills at video games you can use the skills you have gained at video games to help you in real life: have a school bully? Challenge him to some Halo and "pwn" that "nubcake."

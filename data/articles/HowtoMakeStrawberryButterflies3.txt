, You'll have extra slices leftover, just make use of these to make more butterflies.
 You will need two larger circles and two smaller circles.
 This forms the center body, so it should be a slimline shape as much as possible.
 Build the butterfly on a plate or cake topping, as follows:


Place the blackberry or raspberry body piece in the center.
Place the two large round circles opposite each other, each side of the base of the body piece. The top of these circles should commence at the middle position on the body piece. These form the base wings of the butterfly.
Place the two large strawberry halves, pointed end downward on the center of the base wing circles. Angle the large top end of these pieces outward (away from the body piece), to form the top wing shapes.
Place the larger small round pieces in the center of the large top wings.
Place the smaller small round pieces in the center of the smaller lower wings.
 Angle two blanched slivered almonds on top of the body piece.

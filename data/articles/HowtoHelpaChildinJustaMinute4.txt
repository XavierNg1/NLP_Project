 So often, the opportunity to help a child (or an adult) comes before us, and we miss the moment. Not because we’re blind, but because we are moving too fast. But what on your to-do list is more important than helping a child, especially if it only takes a moment? Instead of talking to yourself like Alice in Wonderland’s White Rabbit, (“oh no, I’m late, I’m late!”) just take a deep breath and focus. Believe you have all the time you need, and that interruptions may be opportunities. Use your time to help children realize their potential too.

 If something flames up in the oven or the nuke machine, stay calm. Turn off the device, close the door, and watch it closely. Closing it off and eliminating the heat source should make small fires die down quickly. Get your fire extinguisher and watch it closely.


If the fire doesn't die down, open the door very carefully and spray it with the extinguisher to put the fire out. If you have any trouble whatsoever, call the fire department immediately.

, If you've flamed up something in the skillet, use the lid (or a lid of larger size) to clap on quickly and smother it. This is the quickest and most effective way of stopping the fire.


Consider moving the pan outside if it's creating a lot of smelly smoke. Rinse it out with the hose when it's cooled down to keep the mess from stinking up your kitchen. Make sure you put on a heating pad or oven mitt first before trying to grab the handle.
 If you're frying bacon and the grease catches on fire, it can be a tricky proposition. You can use the lid method, or use a slightly damp towel to smother the fire, but usually the safest and quickest (though not cleanest) method is to sprinkle a liberal amount of baking soda or salt onto the grease to quickly absorb it and eliminate the fire at the source.


You should also feel free to use a fire extinguisher on grease fires. It works particularly well. Stand at a safe distance from the grease and activate the extinguisher.
Avoid using water or flour on grease fires. Flour can ignite, making the fire worse, and--since water doesn't mix with oil--water can cause the oil to spray elsewhere, throwing flaming oil onto other nearby surfaces.
 It's extremely dangerous to try to control or extinguish electrical fires yourself, because they're very difficult to anticipate and trace the source of. Get out of your home immediately, getting everyone to safety, and call the fire department.

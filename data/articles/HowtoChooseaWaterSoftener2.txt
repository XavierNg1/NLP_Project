Note that whole-house systems generally cost a minimum of $1,000 and upwards. , Professional installation, at an additional cost, is required for water softening systems. If systems are not installed by qualified installers, their warranties may be voided. Be sure to inquire about installation fees, which can add to the total price of a system considerably., When looking for a water softening system, resist any companies that employ a high pressure sales approach. Be sure that the company is reputable, has good reviews (online or from other people in your neighborhood), and uses installers that are certified by the Water Quality Association. In addition, make sure that the company offers a money-back guarantee on their systems., If buying a water softener is too big of a decision for you, contact companies to inquire about the possibility of renting one of their systems.

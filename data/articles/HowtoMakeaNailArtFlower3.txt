 This is incredibly important, because trying to apply a top coat too early or bumping your wet nails on something will distort your beautiful flowers. Some nail polishes are specifically marketed as quick drying, but others will take at least half an hour to dry fully.

To speed up the process, dry your nails with a hairdryer. The trick is to set it on “cool.” Hot air will actually keep the polish from hardening, so cool air is the way to go.The drugstore sells special polish-drying sprays, so pick one up if you’re desperate to get your nails dried quickly., This is entirely optional. If you have green nail polish, use a super thin brush or a clean toothpick to create a small stem snaking its way from the flower. You can connect multiple flowers with stems, and even add little leaves!








There are special nail polish pens that make intricate details like stems and leaves much easier. Check out your local drugstore or beauty supply store if you are interested in purchasing these.
 If you want to add even more individuality to your nail design, go ahead! You can use the toothpick to add tiny dots to the background, or other thin designs. Combining floral patterns with geometric backgrounds is extremely trendy.If you have a sheer glitter polish, you can paint a coat over the design to give it some sparkle., After your flowers are finished and your nails look flawless, it’s important to seal it all. Find a polish specifically marketed as a topcoat to finish off your manicure. A good topcoat protects the polish from every day wear and tear, and it acts as a barrier to prevent chipping and other damage. Additionally, a topcoat adds a beautiful shine to your nails.








Because you’ve applied several different kinds of nail polishes, a topcoat also helps to smooth out the entire design and help it look more cohesive.

 From your research, establish your trip destination and dates, even if these are flexible. Also make sure you have your payment information and the personal information for yourself and your fellow travellers on hand. For example, you may need to know all of the travellers’ birthdates and passport numbers.
 Ask your friends and family for recommendations if you haven’t worked with a travel agent before. If you can’t get a personal recommendation, search online for a travel agency with good reviews., Depending on the travel agency, you may be able to go in-person or you may work with someone over the phone. Ensure your travel agent is knowledgeable, friendly and service-oriented. They should be able to answer all of your questions and have experience booking similar trips to the one you want to go on.
 Provide your travel agent with the destination and dates of your trip. If you are flexible with nearby destinations, multiple stopovers or similar dates, ensure you tell your travel agent that information.


Also let your travel agent know about your preferences and any required accommodations. You can tell them your seating preference, such as aisle or window, if you need special accommodations, like a wheelchair, if you're interested in purchasing add-ons, like hotel stays and car rentals, and if you need to purchase insurance.
 After receiving your information, your travel agent will present you with some flight options for your trip. Select the best option for you and continue speaking with your travel agent to finish booking your airline tickets. The agent will need your personal and payment information.
 Your travel agent will likely choose to email you your receipt and confirmation of your airline ticket purchase. If you don’t receive an email shortly after booking, call your travel agent. You may also be able to request your receipt and confirmation in hard copy if you don’t have access to email.

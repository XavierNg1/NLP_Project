 You will want to add some kind of storage and counter space behind the bar, as the included instructions don’t provide any. You can do this in a number of ways. You could add a counter supported by brackets. You could find a stand-alone kitchen which fits in the space. You could build a series of shelves which fit into the space. It is also possible to simply leave it like it is. The decision is entirely up to you.
 If you want to add a footbar, you can do that. Simply be sure to add the additional 6” support blocks when building the frame, as described in the instructions. Attach the footbar using whichever method is recommended by the manufacturer. Get advice from your local hardware store staff.
 You may want to consider various ways to customize the appearance of your bar. You can do this by using a unique bar-top surface (such as one made from stone or colored glass) or by painting or staining the wood. The recessed panels are another opportunity for customization, since you can add contrasting material (like tile) to add interest to the bar.

 You should never nail a pot rack into dry wall. Dry wall cannot carry a lot of weight. If you simply nail a pot rack into dry wall, as you would nail it into a ceiling joist, the rack will inevitably fall. This can cause a lot of damage to your ceiling and kitchen and potentially hurt a pet or person standing near the rack when it falls. Always use ceiling anchors when attaching a pot rack to dry wall.
 You should wear safety googles throughout the process of hanging up a pot rack. Safety goggles can protect your eyes from small bits of paint or debris that may fall from the ceiling during the installation process., When checking how much weight a toggle can hold, do not just consider the weight of the pot rack on its own. Remember, you'll be hanging pots and pans from your pot rack. Make sure the toggle bolt can hold more weight than the total weight of the pot rack.

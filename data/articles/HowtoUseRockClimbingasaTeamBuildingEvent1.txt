 Decide who is included in the team. In large corporations, this may not include the whole company, but rather departments who work together as a unit.;
, If the team is fairly young, generally fit and ambitious, then rock climbing is a great activity for them. If you have any disabled, overweight or chronically ill members of staff, then you should avoid this as a team building activity and choose something that is less physically demanding, such as board games or a scavenger tour of the local area.
 The leaders of the event should be able to speak with you and establish goals for the day. Since they are the experts in rock climbing, they will be leading a session where the primary goal is to develop team confidence rather than exercise.


You may want to compare rates for local gyms that offer this. It can be expensive, since a section of the rock climbing gym will need to be reserved for the duration of the event, and the gym will lose out on money from members and other climbers.
Look for a program that includes communication and listening skills, conflict resolution, trust building, confidence building, increasing motivation, stress reduction, creating roles, achieving goals and building time management skills.
 Encourage them to be excited, but tell them to come to you, or management, with any doubts they have. You may find hidden disabilities will prevent others from taking part in the activity.


If everyone cannot do the rock climbing session together it will not be a useful team-building adventure. Exclusion may lead to office problems or other team problems, such as feelings of discrimination in the future.
 This amount of time will seem like a nice adventure without being tedious.
 Make sure they read them well and know the company is not responsible for any activity that includes horseplay or is deemed unsafe at the gym.

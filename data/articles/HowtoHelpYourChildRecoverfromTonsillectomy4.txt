 In order to help your child’s throat heal, it needs to be kept moist. At first, your child may not want to eat or drink anything because it is uncomfortable to do so, but it is important that she at least takes some water.


If she will not drink water, you could ask your child to suck on some ice. Give her small pieces of ice so that she does not have to open her mouth too wide to suck on them.
 Your child’s doctor will most likely give you a list of foods and drinks that you should give your child while she recovers. In particular, you can give your child cold foods, like ice cream, sorbet, or Italian ice. These cold treats actually help to numb your child’s throat, and will most likely make your child a much happier camper.Other foods include clear liquids and brother.
Fruit juice.
Jello and pudding.
Most children tend to avoid acidic or salty foods, like tomato bisque, after surgery because they irritate the throat, but if your child seems to be ok with these items, they are safe to feed her.
 You can begin giving your child soft foods when she feels she is ready. Give her a small amount and see if it causes her any pain; if it does, stick to the foods mentioned in the previous step for a couple more days. Soft foods include:


Regular soups like chicken noodle (however, you can also puree these soups to make them creamy). Serve soups lukewarm, or even room temperature, to make sure that they do not irritate your child’s throat.
Applesauce.
Pudding.
 Your child will most likely take two weeks to return to a normal diet. During this time, and for a couple days after the two weeks are up, avoid giving her any crunchy or rough food, as these types of foods could cause pain.
 It is a good idea to plan meals so that they are served 30 to 60 minutes after your child takes a dose of medication. This will give the medication time to get into your child’s system, so that she feels less pain when she swallows her food.

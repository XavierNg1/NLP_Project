, Temperature changes can be a big reason why the baby will awaken. If the air is too cold, or the air is too warm, are two main factors that play a part.
 The more communication that goes on with your child, the more they'll react, and the better chance that they will awaken during the change.
 Instead, slide the diaper underneath the baby's rear end as if it was a pull-up styled diaper. It may not look that great, but given all other factors, it's better than leaving your child in wet diapers and exposing their skin to diaper rashes that cause greater pain.
 Unless you are using natural lighting in the area, don't use other sources of interior light, as bright lights can bring the baby to an "awake" stage.
 Periodically check the child's diaper during the night to make sure this delayed stage isn't the case.
 Cloth diapers won't creak and make sounds that can awaken the child (unlike that of disposables). Yes, the rubber pant may make some noise, but with some practice, you can actually get around this and not allow it to make any noise during the change.
 Store-brand disposable diapers always seem to make unnatural sounds that may awaken the baby. Popular brand name diapers work best, and don't seem to creek as much as those people using store-brand diapers.



Lavender and chamomile smells aren't a problem in many situations. These scents can be used to effectively calm the baby and still keep the diaper-changing problem from even being noticed, both during the daytime and during nighttime situations.

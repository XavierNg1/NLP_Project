 You could suggest that they color in, do a project, play a game, make a craft, etc. They say yes and it's time to put your entertaining skills into overdrive!

, Take out the thing they want to do. If you are doing a project or coloring and you have messy toddlers, let them help put down newspaper or a plastic mat to protect floors and tables. Have fun and they will be able to tell and enjoy the babysitting time more and will give glowing reports about your engagement with them.
 If they don't want to do something in particular, find something else for them to do!


Ask the kids what they want to do. Give them options and let them choose and they will be a lot happier. They may have different opinions on what is fun and what's not than you do.

 Allow your loved one to explain the symptoms to the doctor. If the doctor does not identify hypochondria, then you may want to take the doctor aside and briefly explain your concerns.


The doctor may refer to it as Illness Anxiety Disorder because this is the DSM-V term for hypochondria., Hypochondria may be treated with antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, and/or psychological therapy. Make arrangements for the person to see a therapist around once a week if possible.


Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be an effective approach as well as gradual exposure therapy., People with hypochondria may also experience anxiety disorders and/or depression.Consider getting your loved one screened for these conditions as well.


If your loved one is nervous, assure them that the screening just means filling out a form about their symptoms. Remember fear is a big part of the disorder but listening to their concerns will often help with this.
 A person with hypocondriasis may be able to locate a nearby support group for individuals with this condition. It may also be helpful for your loved one to attend a support group for anxiety, as the two are closely related.There are support groups offered for both the person with the condition and the family support members. Make sure to ask the professional treating the hypochondriac for suggestions of a local support group.

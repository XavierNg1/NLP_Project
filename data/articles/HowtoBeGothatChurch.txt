 Avoid shirts with extremely noticeable skulls, and band shirts, no matter how much you love your music.;
, A small mohawk or small spikes or studs are probably fine for guys, while just any hairstyle is great for girls. Don't do anything too shocking.
 Goths can wear any color; your clothes don't have to be black! However, keep it fairly neutral . And in some churches, jeans are perfectly acceptable to be worn to services, even with rips! Just make sure the rips aren't too out of control.
 This is disrespectful.
 There are many bits of Gothic jewelry with crucifixes, crosses, and Ithacus on them, so use the opportunity well. In terms of other jewelry, keep it fairly low key. You'll have plenty of opportunities to wear your spikes outside of church.

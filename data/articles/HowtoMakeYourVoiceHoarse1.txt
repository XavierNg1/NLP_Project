 Cheer on your favorite sports team at the top of your lungs, or go to a loud concert and try to have a conversation with your friend. Use a loud voice for a long time and you will likely hear the effects the next day.You may need to continue speaking at a high volume for several hours to achieve a hoarse voice.Your voice will return to normal in a day or two. It heals more quickly with the use of throat spray, lozenges and hydrating with 64 ounces of water per day.;
, When you sing, your vocal chords vibrate. The higher the pitch the more rapid the vibrations. Too much of these vibrations can cause irritation to the vocal folds, which will fail to come completely together, leaving your voice raspy.You will need to sing beyond your vocal range to achieve this goal.
Sing a note as high as your voice can reach, then push it further with as much breath as you can muster.
Continue this for several hours.
 Whispering can be more stressful on the voice than speaking normally. When you whisper, you squeeze the vocal chords together more tightly and cause strain on your voice.
 Crying for an extended period of time will take its toll on your voice. This is especially the case with children or infants who have been crying all night. Their voice will likely be hoarse by the morning.

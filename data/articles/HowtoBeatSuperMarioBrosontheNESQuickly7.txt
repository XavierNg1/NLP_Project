 Jump over the first Koopa and the Spiny thrown by Lakitu simultaneously and then immediately slip under the 2nd approaching Koopa Troopa.
 The trick is to land on top of as many as possible, avoiding every Bullet Bill.
 Timing is of the essence to ensure clearing each jump. The third large tube is placed after a huge ravine. Land in front of the tube and slow down slightly in order to perform a “clean jump”. This is the only part of the game that requires you to slow down!

, In order to clear a sequence of Koopa Troopas, it will be necessary to run under the first and then jump quickly to land on the single cannon while instantaneously jumping the gap immediately after it. (if you have trouble with this part, you can also take the warp tube to clear all the Koopas)

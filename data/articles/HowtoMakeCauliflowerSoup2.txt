 Rinse the cauliflower, cut off the stem and leaves, then chop it into florets. Rinse the carrot, cut off the leaves, then shred it. Lastly, rinse off the celery, then chop it into ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) pieces.
 Give everything a stir to combine. You can use either chicken or vegetable bouillon.
 Turn the heat up to medium or medium-high, and let the water come to a boil. As soon as it starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, then let the water simmer for 12 to 15 minutes. You are ready for the next step when the vegetables turn tender.


Do not pour the water out. You will be using this as part of your soup base., Make sure that the saucepan is large enough to hold the rest of your ingredients, including the milk. Stir the butter occasionally with a rubber spatula to help it melt.
 Use a whisk or fork to mix in the flour so that it doesn't clump up too much. You can vary the amounts of salt and pepper to suit your personal tastes.
 2% milk is recommended for this recipe, but you can use whole milk for a richer soup, or fat-free milk for a lighter one. Be sure to stir the mixture well so that the butter and flour mix in evenly.
 Turn the heat up to medium, then wait for the mixture to boil. Let it boil for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. You are ready for the next step when the mixture thickens.
 Turn the heat down to low, then add the cheese. Stir the mixture with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the cheese has melted and mixed evenly into the milk.
 Use a whisk to blend the two mixtures together. Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined.
 You can serve it as is, or you can garnish it with some croutons.

 RTMP (Real Time Messaging Protocol) is a method of streaming video online that is much more difficult to download than a standard YouTube video. If you find a video online that KeepVid or DownloadHelper cannot access, chances are it is an RTMP stream. You will need special software to download these videos.


Orbit Downloader and Replay Media Catcher are two of the more popular programs for capturing RTMP streams. Unfortunately, neither of them are free, but both offer trial versions. Orbit Downloader will only download the first 50% of a movie in the trial version, and Replay Media Catcher downloads very slowly in the trial version.
 These programs need to be running before you navigate to the video you want to download. Keep the programâ€™s window open, and then open a browser. Navigate to the video that you want to stream, and start the video. The video file should appear in the download program, and begin downloading automatically.

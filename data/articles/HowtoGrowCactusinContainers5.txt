 Grow lights may help indoor cactus if your house is dark.


Refrain from placing potted cactus in direct sunlight as it can become scorched and the roots will overheat.
If your cactus is placed in full sun, use white or light colored pots to help avoid overheating. Young plants will do best in partial sunlight.



Simulate natural conditions in the desert by watering well but infrequently in much the same way as that of an infrequent desert thunderstorm. Over-watering will cause your cactus to rot.
 A cactus will go dormant if it is too hot or cold. Bring outdoor potted cactus indoors if temperatures are too cold.

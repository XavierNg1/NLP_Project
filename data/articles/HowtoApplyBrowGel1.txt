 Clean your face using your usual facial cleanser, and follow up with some toner and moisturizer. If you plan on wearing any foundation, put it on now. You can do your lips and blush as well, but hold off on the eyeshadow for right now.;
, Start by tweezing out any stray or unruly hairs. Next, take out a clean spoolie, and comb the hair on on your eyebrows, following the direction that they are naturally growing in. For most people, this would be straight up on the inner corners, outwards along the arch, and down towards the tail end.
 Filling in your brows is completely optional. If you already have thick, full brows, you probably don't have to do this. Start with a medium taupe shade; it works well with dark and light-colored eyebrows without appearing too pale or too dark. If your eyebrows are red, consider a light, reddish brown pencil or powder instead.Use a lighter shade if you have very dark eyebrows. Never use straight black. Instead, opt for a very dark brown or charcoal. It will look softer, more natural, and less harsh.Very the shades on your brows. Make them lighter towards the inner part, and darker, more defined towards the ends., You can use the spoolie that came with your tube of clear brow gel, or you can use a new spoolie. Following the same technique as before, comb the spoolie upwards at the inner part of your eyebrows, straight towards the arch, and back down towards the tail.


If you applied eyebrow pencil or powder, it might be a good idea to use a new spoolie brush each time you dip into your tube of brow gel. This way,you won't risk tinting the clear gel with any residual eyebrow pencil or powder.
 Now that you have your eyebrows done, you can finish putting on the rest of your makeup, such as your eyeshadow and eyeliner. Of course, you can always skip those if you want something more natural.

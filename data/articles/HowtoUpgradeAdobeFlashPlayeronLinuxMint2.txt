 Flash is integrated into Google Chrome for Linux, and this is the only officially-supported version of Flash on Linux now. Any updates will automatically be installed when Google Chrome updates.
 Chrome normally updates automatically, but you can force it to check for an update.
 Select "About Google Chrome".
 Chrome will search for and install any available updates. You may be prompted to restart Chrome after the updates are finished.

 You can use an empty squirt bottle you have at home, but try to avoid any bottle that had harsh chemicals in it. Make sure you clean the bottle thoroughly to prevent your cat from having any skin reactions to chemicals left in the bottle.
 Grab a large handful of your fresh lavender and put it in a clean container. Fill it with water and let it sit overnight.A mason jar with a secure lid works well.
 Use a small screen or tea strainer to separate the lavender from the water you let sit overnight.A funnel can make it easier to pour the lavender water into the clean spray bottle.
 Saturate your cat with the lavender mixture.Your cat might not like the spraying noise or the feeling of being wet, so it can be helpful to have someone hold the cat still and prevent it from running away or clawing you.
Avoid the eye, mouth, and nose area so the lavender water does not sting these sensitive places.
 Make sure to run the comb from head to tail and concentrate on the nape of the neck, face, armpits, under the chin, and belly. These are places where fleas are often hiding., It's good to spray your cat and comb them with the flea comb once a day.

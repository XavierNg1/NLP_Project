 An easy way to catch a wild lizard is to use a glass lizard trap. You can do this in a few easy steps:


Clean and prepare a glass box. You want a box large enough to catch the native lizards in your area.
Cover the top of the box with plastic wrap. You want the lizard to be able to walk on the top of the box.
Slice a small slit in the top of the plastic wrap. Lizards like to crawl into holes and if a lizard is well fed, it will be more likely to look for a place to rest.
Locate a lizard habitat. Place the box in your backyard if you’ve noticed a lot of lizards in the area. The more lizards in the area, the better the placement for the trap.
Put insects or other lizard food on top of the top, near the slit in the plastic wrap. This will entice the lizard to check out the trap.
Check your trap frequently. Make sure you do not leave a trapped lizard enclosed too long without food and water.
 This is also known as using a lizard “noose."Use a long stick. You want the stick long enough to serve as a handle.
Attach a piece of string or waxed dental floss to the end to the stick. This is will help to not scare the lizard when you try to catch it.
Tie the end of the string into a slip knot. This knot will be able capture the lizard safely without hurting it.
Slip the noose around the lizard’s head and pull. This will tighten the knot and capture the lizard.
Gently remove the noose from the lizard’s head. Grasp the lizard in your hand and remove the nose from around the head. Be very careful if the lizard has sharp teeth!

, If you know if you have safe lizards in the wild, you may be able to catch them by hand.


Know that lizards move very quickly! This is especially true in long grass. Take some time to observe the habits of lizards before you try and catch it.
Try and entice lizards closer to your hand by placing lizard food (insects) by your hand.

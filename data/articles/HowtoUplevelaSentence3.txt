 “But,” “so,” “and”, and “yet” are all good connectors you can put in a sentence to give it more detail. Always put a comma before the connector.For example, you may write, “She wanted to go to the party, but she had homework to do first.” Or you may write, “He finished dinner early, so he went for a walk around the neighborhood.”
Another example would be, “They ran through the square shouting, and it angered the locals,” or “We needed another person, yet we resisted asking our mother.”

, Compound sentences is when two independent clauses are brought together. Use a colon to separate the two clauses so they are still distinct and easy to read. Only combine two clauses that relate to each other directly.For example, you may write, “I was tired: I hadn’t slept in two days” or “She was confused: she hadn’t seen the smoke in the woods.”

, You can also make a compound sentence with “some” and “others” using a semicolon instead of a colon. This is a good option if you want to compare two groups or perspectives in one sentence.For example, you may write, “Some people love swimming; others can’t stand being in water” or “Some enjoy talking; others prefer to listen.”

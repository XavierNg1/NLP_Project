, It's in the top left corner of the screen. If you aren't already signed into your Google account, you'll need to do so tapping Sign In at the top of this menu and then typing in your Google email address and password.
 It's at the top of the screen.
 If you haven't yet added a work address, the phrase "Enter an address" will appear below this option.


If you already have a work address here, you'll need to tap the x to the right of it to remove the address first.
 If it's the same as your Home address, entering it as "Work" will remove it from the "Home" category.
 Doing so will add the work address to your Google Maps' saved locations. Now when you ask for directions to work, you can simply type "work" into the "Search Google Maps" box rather than typing out the full address.


In some cases, Google Maps doesn't recognize the work address when you type "Work" in as a destination. If this is the case, tap the user menu icon (☰), tap Your places, and then tap ⋮ to the right of "Work" to view your options (e.g., Directions).

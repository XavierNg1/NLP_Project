Be careful setting these up. Light traps could never seriously injure anyone, but it's still quite painful to be zapped by them.
 Flies avoid the smell of vodka. So, try hanging bags of vodka around your porch or any other recreational outdoor area.Quarter gallon freezer bags, tied with string to a gutter, work well.
Any cheap vodka will work.
You can also try putting small amounts of vodka on your skin, although beware of the pungent smell and your skin drying.
 While some plants simply repel flies, others actually eat flies: Venus Fly Trap, Pitcher Plant, etc.
 Flies are deterred by the scents of some plants, so keep potted plants on your patio or near your doors that repel flies: Basil, Elderberry, Lavender, Mint, and False Indigo.
 Spiders eat flies, but if you destroy their webs, the flies lose a natural predator.

, The smell of cloves repels flies. Decoratively placing cloves on an outdoor dinning table can deter flies from landing on food., Flies are strongly attracted to the smell of meat and will swarm your barbecue grill the minute you bring meat outside to cook it.


Keep all meat covered tightly when it is not on the grill.
Keep the barbecue grill lid closed while the meat is cooking.
Protect your grilling tongs and utensils—flies will smell the meat and land on them. (If you see flies have landed on your grilling utensils, take them inside and wash them before you pierce or turn the meat with them.)

 One of the simplest and easiest ways is to break SEO down into two parts: Optimization and Authority.This method includes a lot of terms such as "site" and "search engine" and is best for clients who are already familiar with the internet and how it works.
 Your client needs to understand that optimization allows reputable search engines to read his or her website, and then evaluate it. You can say something like this:


"Optimization allows a search engine to read the content of your website. The search engine will then display your site in the results when someone searches for the keywords that appear on your site."

, Your client also needs to understand that having authority proves to the search engine that his or her website is the best website. For example, you could say:


"The more authority your website has, the higher up on the search results it will be. Having your website appear on others will prove to the search engine that your site is better than all others on the same topic."

, After you have broken down SEO into "Optimization" and "Authority," you want to repeat all that you have said in a shorter form: "SEO is two things: allowing search engines to display your website when people search for it, and convincing search engines to place it before other sites in the results."

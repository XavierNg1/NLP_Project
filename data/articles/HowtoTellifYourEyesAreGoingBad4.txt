 Vision problems are primarily caused by light not focusing properly in the eye. Eyeglasses help redirect the light to focus properly onto the retina. , Contacts are smaller lenses that are meant to wear directly on the eye. They float on the surface of the cornea.


There are many options you can choose from, for example some contacts are daily wear (one time use), others are designed to last longer.
Some contacts come in different colors and are designed for specific types of eyes. Consult your healthcare provider for the appropriate selection to meet your needs.
 While glasses and contacts are the more traditional method for correcting vision, the surgical method is gaining in popularity as well. There are SEVERAL different type of surgeries for the eye. However the two most common are Lasik and PRK.


In some cases surgery is suggested because contacts and eyeglasses are not effective enough to improve vision. In other cases corrective surgery is suggested as an option to wearing long term glasses or contacts.
Lasik is formally known as laser in-situ keratomileusis. This surgery is used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. This surgery replaces the need to have contacts or eyeglasses. The FDA has approved Lasik eye surgery to be done on patients 18 years or older with an eye prescription of at least one year. Despite this, most physicians will recommend waiting until the mid-20â€™s because they eye are still changing.PRK is formally referred to as photorefractive keratectomy. It is similar to Lasik in that it also treats nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The age requirement for PRK is the same as Lasik. , For most common eye conditions, nearsightedness, farsightedness, presbyopia and astigmatism, medication is not used. For more serious problems your healthcare provider may prescribe a medication usually in the form of eye drops or pills. If you need further treatment seek your healthcare provider for more information.

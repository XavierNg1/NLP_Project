 To make a very simple and traditional saddle soap that will effectively clean leather, you will only need two ingredients: a block of glycerin and some cream or milk. You will also need an airtight container to store your finished saddle soap.
 Break the block of glycerin into chunks and place in a microwaveable bowl. Heat the glycerin on medium power for 30 seconds, then remove and stir. Keep microwaving for 30 second intervals until the glycerin has melted.
 Add the cream or milk to the melted glycerin and stir to combine. You will need approximately 1/4 cup of milk or cream for every 2 cups of melted glycerin., Pour the glycerin and milk/cream mixture into the container and leave to cool and set before using. The glycerin will prevent the dairy from going rancid.

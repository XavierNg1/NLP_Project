 A cat who is suffering from arthritis may lick the joint that is causing him pain. This arthritic pain can be controlled by giving your cat pain killers, which should reduce his desire to lick the affected area. Talk to your vet if you think your cat is suffering from arthritic pain.
 Meloxicam (Metacam) belongs to a family of drugs called NSAIDs (Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs). Meloxicam works by inhibiting an enzyme, COX-2, which triggers prostaglandin release, which in turn limits the inflammation that leads to fever and pain. This medication may help reduce your catâ€™s arthritic pain.


Talk to your veterinarian before giving your cat this medication.
 Meloxicam should only be given to well hydrated animals. Dehydrated animals may have impaired renal function and the additional decrease in blood supply to the kidney caused by the medication may tip the animal into renal failure.


Likewise, meloxicam must be given with or after food.
Do not give your cat meloxicam if he is taking other NSAIDs or steroids of any kind.

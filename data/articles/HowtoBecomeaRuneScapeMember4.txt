 Many Member items tend to cost more money than Non-Member ones. An upside you will find is that some items, armor sets and weapons will actually cost less in Member Worlds than they did in Non-Member Worlds.
 Do quests, make friends with players that have more experience than you, and explore a little. Indulge in your curiosity, and do a few new quests. Quests revolving around Member skills and areas can be a great way to get to know the game around you.

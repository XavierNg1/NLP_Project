 Before you try to be grunge in school, make sure to review your school's dress code. Dressing grunge can be fun, but you do not want to end up in trouble over your new style.


Oftentimes, things like wallet chains are banned by schools. They can be considered weapons in some schools. If your school has a zero tolerance policy for weapons, a chain could land you in trouble.
Make sure any t-shirts you have do not have foul language on them. Sometimes, band names can be sexually suggestive, and could land you in trouble if you wear them in school.
Certain types of jewelry or accessories may also not be allowed in your school. Read over the dress code policy in your school's handbook carefully before adding any jewelry to your outfit.
 As many grunge kids carry large handbags, make sure these are permitted in your school. Many schools have policies that forbid you from carrying a handbag to class. You also may be required to keep purses or handbags in your locker during school hours. Teachers and school officials worry about students carrying items like weapons or alcohol in handbags, so make sure to review policy first before adding a grunge handbag to your wardrobe.
 Many schools do not allow students to listen to headphones during class. Make sure to review the headphone policy in your school. As so much of grunge culture revolves around music, you may be tempted to listen to music between classes and carry a headphone and iPod or MP3 player with you in school. You want to make sure this is permitted first.

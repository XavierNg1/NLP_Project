 Admit when you have made mistakes and accept the punishment that you have received for doing so. Don’t whine about how unfair things are for you. Taking responsibility for the things that you do are part of growing up., Don’t talk back to them or make comments under your breath. Above all, don’t start yelling and name-calling. Demonstrate how you can be calm and respectful.Your parents want to see a good attitude from you. It can be hard to do this when you’re grounded, but you will find that there will be times throughout your life when you need to control your temper and be respectful, even when you don’t feel like it. Use this as a chance to prove your maturity to your parents.
 Your parents might tell you to do extra chores along with your regular chores. Do these without grumbling or whining about them. Tell your parents when you have finished a chore so they can check your work., If you see something that needs to be done, do these without being told to do them. If you see fingerprints on the front window, then get some glass cleaner and a paper towel, and go to work cleaning the window.


Some chores can be a good way to get out of the house for a few minutes. Offering to walk the dog or taking your little sister to the park might give you a chance to get some fresh air and a change of scenery.
 Ask to have a calm, sit-down conversation with your parents so that you can talk about why you were grounded. Make sure you are not just focusing on your opinions. The key here is that both sides listen to each other.Don’t get defensive or start name-calling or yelling. Remain calm and respectful. The goal here is to demonstrate that you understand their perspective and reasoning for grounding you.

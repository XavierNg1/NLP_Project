 Boffers are cheap, but latex weapons are more detailed, and are more realistically weighted.;
, A basic broadsword is great for blocking and thrusting, but slashes are harder with a heavier blade. Daggers are hard to use for beginners, as they require being very close to possibly more experienced enemies. If you want to try a new thing, use daggers. Scimitars are curved, lightweight, and great for slashing and thrusting. Since scimitars are thinner, it is usually best to avoid strikes rather than block them.
 Have your dominant arm close to your body, and your sword pointed at your opponent's chest or head.
 The third closest to the hilt is the forte. Then, there is the middle and the foible.



To do a hard block, put the forte of your blade in the path of the opponents strike. Hard blocks cannot thwart thrusts, however.
To do a parry, use the middle of your sword to connect to your opponent's middle or foible. Maintaining this contact, maneuver your enemy's sword off of it's course.
A beat is an exaggerated parry. To do a beat, you club your opponent's sword as hard as possible with your own when they try to strike. If you beat hard enough, you can disarm your enemy.



To thrust, hold your sword level, and lunge forward.
To slash, swing your sword over your head, or to one side.
To fight with a two handed sword, you use many of the same techniques, but you have to calculate for slower strikes and blocks, as your sword is heavier.
,, You need to practice with both hands, so both hands are equal.
 Block and strike at the same time.
 One exception, catching a blade in an "X", then scissoring down to strike is a neutral action.
 Just remember, everything you'll see is some form of the basics. If you remember this, you can find ways to beat anyone.

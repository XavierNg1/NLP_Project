The pod will first appear as a bright, medium shade of green. As the pod matures, it will "puff" with the growth of the seeds.
The color of the pod will phase to a dull yellow-green and when the seeds are fully mature, the pod will turn light brown. (About the color of a paper bag.)
At this light brown stage, they may be pinched from the plant. Place the pods on a plate and allow them to dry indoors for several days. (Adjust timeframe for the humidity in your own environment.)

, The pods will begin to split open at their seams as they dry. You can encourage the pod to open by running the edge of your fingernail along the pod seam, and then spreading the pod open with your fingers to reveal the seeds.
 Allow them to dry on the plate for a few more days.


Dry indoors away from drafts.
A tray will work just as well as a plate. The item should have edges, to help keep the seeds in place.
 Store them until you are ready to plant them.

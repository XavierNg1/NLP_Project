 Boil 2 cups of water either on the stove or in the microwave. This may take about five to ten minutes if youâ€™re boiling the water on the stove, or about three to four minutes in the microwave.


If you boil your water in the microwave, you may need to hold the water in a medium sized bowl rather than a coffee mug.;
, Add two bags of chamomile tea to the boiled water. Let the teabags sit in the water for approximately 10 minutes.After 10 minutes, remove the tea bags from the water and allow the water to cool.


You may have to wait approximately 20 minutes for the tea to cool down enough. The tea should cool down to be on the cooler side rather than the warmer side. For example, the tea should be cool enough where you could easily stick your finger in the tea, and not burn or hurt yourself.
 Consider transferring the tea to a spray bottle so you can easily spray and coat your hair with the tea. Separate your hair into sections, and evenly distribute the tea onto your hair. Once your hair is completely covered, let it sit on your hair for approximately 15-20 minutes.You could also dip your hair into the bowl of tea, but this does not coat your hair as evenly as a spray bottle.
 After sitting on your hair for 15-20 minutes, rinse the tea out of your hair with lukewarm water. Consider spraying your hair with tea multiple times before you wash your hair with shampoo to see a significant difference in your hair shade.

 Cut up an apple and a pear to use in this autumn smoothie. Peel the fruit first so that you don't end up with tough skins that will be difficult to blend.
 This wholesome smoothie tastes best with a thick, rich texture. Use a cup of whole plain yogurt with a creamy top.
 Adding 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to this smoothie gives it the flavor of fall. Use 1 tablespoon (14.8Â ml) of maple syrup to sweeten it.
 Place the apple, yogurt, spices, and maple syrup in the blender. Blend the ingredients until they are completely smooth and creamy. Add a little milk if you want to thin it out.
 Pour it into glasses. Sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top for garnish, then serve.,

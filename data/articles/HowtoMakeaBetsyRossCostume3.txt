 We'll use Early America for this example, since "Betsy Ross" costume was what the article request was for.
,, (probably Linen or Wool in early America, not much light weight cotton would have been available, as cloth was handwoven in the early 1700's.)
How did they fasten their clothing? (probably no zippers in early America, most likely buttons or hooks.)
How do people look in portraits of the time? And remember that portraits were usually only painted of rich people wearing their best clothes. Day to day wear would have been less elaborate and probably easier to keep clean.
 Expect to make some pattern alterations, as modern patterns have evolved considerably from "old timey" clothing patterns.
 This may entail finding a craftsperson who still weaves with a loom if you are determined to be authentic. Many costume designers draw the line here... they will use modern weave and sewing machines to create a costume from an old pattern... Generally only museums or hardcore collectors will go the extra mile to get fabrics made on a loom, hand cut and hand stitch the costume together, etc. because of the amount of work involved.

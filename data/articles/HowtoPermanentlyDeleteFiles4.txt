 Eraser is one of the most popular free secure deletion utilities. Unlike the "permanent" deletion option available from the Windows Recycle Bin, this utility allows you to securely and completely delete files and folders so that they are no longer recoverable. You can download Eraser here: http://download.cnet.com/Eraser/3000-2092_4-10231814.html?Eraser works by overwriting your information with random patterns repetitively until the data is so scrambled that the original patterns are no longer able to be retrieved.
 Navigate to the file or folder you want to delete. Right-click on the icon to open a pop-up menu.


Take a good look at your pop-up menu. It should resemble the menu you are used to seeing, but now that Eraser has been installed, you should also see an Eraser sub-menu above the "Open with" option of the menu.
 Hover over the "Eraser" option on the original pop-up menu until another menu pops out to the side. From this menu, select "Erase" to permanently delete that file or folder.


The erase task will be immediately executed. When done, a pop-up window will appear to let you know that the task has been completed and that your selected files have been securely and permanently erased.
You can also click on "Erase on Restart," which will not erase the file immediately but will do so the next time you restart your computer.

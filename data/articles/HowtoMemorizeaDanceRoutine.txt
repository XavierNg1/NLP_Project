 Try to remember the lyrics, or at least the parts when some big step is coming up. Write down those lyrics you need and make sure you can get a CD with your piece of cut music so you can practice at home. Play the song a few times and get the beat in your head.;
, Look closely at your instructor and take note of how his/her feet are pointed, how her arms are bent, and detail. Take a mental note and make sure you write down each move and correction later. Take a notebook to class if you have one so you can write down little corrections you need to make and practice on. This really comes in handy at home. Know the moves and when to do them. This is very important, and in your notebook, write down each step and put the lyric of that part beside it.
 At home when you're watching TV and a commercial is on, or when you're waiting for your bagel to pop out of the toaster, practice your moves! In your notebook, pay attention to every little detail and if you practice, you will improve. Get the gist of the moves in your sad so you know you're going in the right direction.
 Your instructor may make corrections and give you helpful tips. Know what you're supposed to wear and how to do your hair, as this is very important too! Bring your notebook to rehearsal in case anything changes.
 Hand them your notebook and crank up the music and ask them to pay close attention. Let them make corrections, and list the pros and cons of your dance. You will also get good practice in front of an audience.
 Ask her how you did and listen carefully and hang on to every word she/he says.
 Smile and enjoy, but have your parent's, friend's, and instructor's voice echoing you head, and say the steps in your head as you do them. You should do fine and make each and every move just perfect!

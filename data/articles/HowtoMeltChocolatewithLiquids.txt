 The problem of seizing tends to occur with small amounts of liquid falling or being poured into the chocolate. The ration should always be 1 tablespoon of liquid to 2 ounces of chocolate.


This ratio will ensure that the dry elements in the chocolate (cocoa and sugar) don't bind and form lumps ("seizing").;
, Extremely dark chocolate may need more liquid––therefore, judge it quickly and add more if needed.
 Do not add small portions because this is what causes the seizing or thickening of the chocolate.
 If you don't own one, you can easily make one by using a bowl and pan. See How to make a double boiler for instructions.


A double boiler is also known as a bain marie.
 Tap water is just fine.
 When its water begins to simmer, remove from the heat.
 Allow to melt, then stir to combine with a spatula. This will help the melting process.
 Keep stirring the melted chocolate. It is ready for use once shiny and smooth to the eye and when it is all melted.

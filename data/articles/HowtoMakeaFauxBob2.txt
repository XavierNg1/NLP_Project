 Adding curls to your hair is an excellent way to increase the volume of your tresses and the texture of your locks.


Allow your 1 or 1 Â¼ inch barrel curling iron to heat up.
Use the hot curling iron to create 1 inch curls throughout your hair. If you want a sleek faux bob, curl each section of hair from the bottom of your ear to the ends of the shaft; if you want a more relaxed faux bob (i.e. messier), curl each section of hair from the roots to the ends.
Once the curls are cool, carefully brush through them., Backcombing, or teasing, is an excellent and quick way to add more volume to your hair.


After blow drying and or curling your hair, use a comb to section of a 3 inch band of hair at the nape of your neck.
Use a duck bill clip to keep the hair above the part securely out of the way.
Tease the hair at the nape of your neck with a long tail comb. Do not move the comb back and forth in your hair. Instead, place the comb three to four inches from your roots and move it towards the scalp. Once it reaches the scalp, remove the comb from the hair and repeat the process.
Lightly spritz the teased sections with hairspray., Spritzing sea salt spray onto your damp or dry locks is an easy way to add additional volume and texture to your tresses. Whether your air-dry, blow-dry, straighten, or curl your hair, applying sea salt spray to your hair should always be the last step in your styling process.


Before misting your hair, shake the product vigorously.
Divide your hair into sections.
Mist one section at a time from the middle of the shaft to the ends.
Use your hands to scrunch the section up towards your scalp.
Repeat on the remaining sections.

 You can prevent altitude sickness by allowing your body to adapt to the change in oxygen concentration at higher altitudes over a period of time. Climb to higher levels at a slow pace so your body gets used to the altitude.Start at below 10,000 feet and walk to high altitudes, rather than drive or fly. When you climb or hike above 10,000 feet, you should increase your altitude by no more than 1,000 feet a day. Try to have a rest day scheduled for every 3,000 feet gained, or every three days of climbing.
If you climb more than 1,000 feet a day, you should come down to sleep at a lower altitude. Follow the mantra, “Climb high and sleep low.”

, You should drink at least three to four quarts or 12 to 16 cups of water a day. This will ensure you are well hydrated as you climb to higher altitudes.You should also avoid consuming alcohol, tobacco, and sleeping pills when you are climbing to higher altitudes.
Try to maintain a diet that consists of more than 70% carbohydrates, as this will ensure you get enough nutrients at higher altitudes.
If you are at risk of developing low oxygen levels in your blood, a medical condition known as anemia, your doctor may recommend you take an iron supplement to help maintain optimal blood oxygen levels on your climb or hike.
 You should bring oxygen tanks with you as part of your gear if you are planning to climb or hike above 10,000 feet. You should have enough oxygen to last several days.You can buy oxygen tanks at your local outdoor store or online.

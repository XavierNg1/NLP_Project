 You will need a Skype account and an Internet connection to use the app though. Make sure your friends have Skype too, no contacts equals no chats!;
,, Ask your friends what their Skype address is. Never add somebody you don't know just to get more contacts. A good way to find some contacts is to look at your friends Facebook walls, they might have written their address on there. If not, just ask them for it.
 Use the IM (Instant Messenger) in place of texting, and call or video chat people in place of phone calls.

 Stand in the shower under a stream of warm water. Lather up some of your cleanser in your hands so you get a good foam. Make sure the water is warm, but not hot enough to burn your skin.

Instead of showering, you can also wash your ears while leaning over your bathroom sink., Lather up a clean washcloth with your soap suds. Gently scrub the skin behind your ears.It may help to use one hand to pull your ear forward (gently!) so you have more space to clean back there.

If you have sensitive skin, try just lathering up the area with your fingertips. A cloth may be too rough for you.
 Stand under the warm water or splash warm water onto the area to clean it. Make sure you rinse all the soap off – leaving soap suds behind your ear may irritate your skin or cause crusting., Use a clean, soft towel to thoroughly dry the skin behind your ear.Pat the area dry - don’t scrub it. Dry inside any folds of skin back there, and don’t be afraid to gently pull your ear forward to access that small space.

If you blowdry your hair, you can also dry behind your ear with the hair dryer on a cool setting.
 Put a drop of tea tree oil on a cotton ball. Gently wipe the area behind your ear that you just cleaned. This can help to remove any leftover soap residue.You can get tea tree oil at most drug stores, pharmacies, or some health food stores.
If using tea tree oil causes redness, itching, or pain, stop using it right away. Tea tree oil may be too harsh for sensitive skin.

 In order to make the best wrapping paper, you will need good quality supplies. Here are some useful items to amass in your craft cupboard:


Base paper: The most important item is the base paper for the gift wrap; choose white, which can be found in rolls at many dollar stores and stores that sell wrapping paper. Solid colored paper is another possibility, depending on how you're going to decorate the paper.
Pencils and eraser: Use pencils and an eraser if you plan to create your own design. A ruler might also be useful.
Decorative items: Gather together colored markers, Sharpies, glitter, stickers, paints, stampers, and anything else you want.
 To make your wrapping paper look more professional, decide on a theme. Color schemes also help and add to your main theme. If you're making a structured design, then it is best that you sketch it out first with your pencil. Don't worry about making mistakes - you have an eraser!

, It's part of the fun to enjoy the design process when creating your wrapping paper!

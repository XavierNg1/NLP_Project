 Here's a great way to prop up your camcorder when you don't have a tripod and you want a low angle shot from the ground. A regular doorstop works perfect. You can move the wedge design up and back to set the shot higher or lower. And because it's made of rubber it stays put.;
, Here's a cheap way to get a soft look effect without expensive filters. All you need is a regular set of pantyhose. Cut out a small square with a pair of scissors and apply it over the lens using a rubber band. By adjusting how tight it is you can change the intensity of the softness.
 You don't want people tripping so you have to tape it down. You don't want to use duct tape, that leaves a nasty residue. Regular gaffer's tape can be pretty expensive, but an alternative is to pick up a roll of Scotch Blue Painter's Tape. You can find it at your home improvement store. It's easy to apply and remove, and its bright color makes it very visible.
 Unless you have a professional tripod, it's hard to tell if your camera is level. But instead use a small bubble level for under two bucks. Use some double sided tape, stick it to your tripod, then you'll know if your camera is level all the time.
 Here's a compact easy to use replacement for a tripod in a pinch. You can use an eye bolt that matched the threads of the camcorder. Then tying about a five foot length of bungee cord to the eye bolt you can make a convenient camera stabilizer. By stepping on the cord and pulling it tight while shooting it steadies the camera pretty well. It's easy, portable, and works great.

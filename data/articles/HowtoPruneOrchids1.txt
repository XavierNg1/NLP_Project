 You should only trim the orchid after its flowers have died off. Ideally, the spike attached to the bloom should also show signs of yellowing.


Usually, the flowers will last roughly eight weeks before they die off.;
, Follow the spike down until you see the point at which it emerges from the pseudobulb. This will usually lie somewhere between the pseudobulb and a leaf.


The pseudobulb is a notably thickened portion of the stem with an oval or bulb-like shape. It typically lies just above the ground.
 Hold the spike upright and still with your non-dominant hand. Use your dominant hand and a sharp cutting tool to cut the spike as close to the pseudobulb as possible.


Be careful so that you do not cut your fingers or cut into the pseudobulb. You can leave as much as 1 inch (2.5 cm) of old spike behind.

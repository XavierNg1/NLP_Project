 You should call up your lender and ask that the loan be transferred into your name alone.The original parties to the contract must agree to the novation.This means that your ex, who is a party to the original loan, must agree as well.
 At the same time that you substitute a new loan, you should try to get a better deal. Try to negotiate a lower interest rate, for example. Alternately, you could agree to a longer repayment period if you need to reduce the amount of your monthly payment., If the lender agrees to a novation, then they should send you paperwork to fill out and sign. Keep a copy for your own records. Also notify your ex that they are no longer responsible for the loan.

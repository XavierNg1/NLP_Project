 Take a shower, dry your hair, and straighten it or you can curl it or wave it others look good with different styles. If you don't want to do to much with your hair, just google some how to's on some braids, that will make you look effortless and gorgeous.;
, Make sure it matches your outfit. Maybe even borrow an outfit from your friends! If you are going to get a manicure, make sure your nails are dry before doing anything with your hair.
 Wear short sleeves, and jeans or if its in April, use shorts. If this dance is something such as your eighth grade promotion, don't forget to dress semi-formal, while also keeping it cool.
 Do it normally. Don't overdo it! Make sure to use waterproof because by the end of the night it will be melted and down to your chin and you'll look like a painter fell asleep while painting your eyelashes. Keep everything light and airy.
, This will keep you smelling clean and fresh throughout the night, and if you're a heavy dancer, this is a must have step

, not too much, and nothing to heavy, but enough to smell good the whole night. keep a little bottle in your coat pocket.
 You'll be dancing and your feet will be killing you. i recommend boat shoes or moccasin.....uggs are too flat, heels are heels, people will step all over your feet in flip flops, and wooden clogs just plain hurt.

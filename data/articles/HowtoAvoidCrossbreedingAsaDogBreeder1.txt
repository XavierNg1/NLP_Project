 To avoid crossbreeding, the main thing you have to do is to breed your dog with a dog of the same breed. Both dogs must be purebreds and have no other breed mixed into their bloodline in the past.This can be determined through pedigree papers presented to you by the breeder.
For example, if you have a dachshund, only breed your dog with another dachshund. If you breed them with a chihuahua or yorkie, you will have a crossbreed.;
, When you are deciding to breed purebred dogs, you need to choose each dog carefully. Odds are, you probably own one purebred dog. If you are sure the dog is a purebred, you should look for another purebred dog to mate them with.Research the dogs carefully before you decide to choose them as the mating partner. If you make a hasty decision, you could miss something and end up crossbreeding your dogs.
When you are looking for a dog to mate with your dog, don't take the breeder's or owner's word for it. Instead, go see the dog, ask for their papers, and check their pedigree.
 As you look for a potential mate for your dog, make sure to only work with responsible and respected dog breeders. Responsible breeders will have papers, pedigrees, and registrations for their dogs. Good breeders will also only specialize in one, maybe two, breeds of dogs. They will also be recommended by the local kennel clubs or vets.Ask the breeder questions about the breed. If they are a respectable breeder, they will be experts in the breed.
Find out how many litters the breeder does in a year. Most breeders only produce one to two litters per year. If there are more, it may be a "puppy mill" instead of a respectable breeder.Choosing a good breeder ensures that you are getting a purebred dog instead of a crossbreed that looks like a purebred.

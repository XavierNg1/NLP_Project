 Search around your campsite for logs and large branches. The logs should be thick – about the diameter of your leg above the knee. Make sure to use dry, clean logs; avoid wood that is rotting, mossy, or waterlogged. Prop three or four logs against each other so that they provide shelter for your kindling, but also allow plenty of air to flow through your fire.Set aside extra logs for later. They will form the primary fuel for the fire once you've gotten it going.
if you want a fire just for the evening, use softwood—pines, firs, and other trees with needles—as it will burn faster. If you want your fire to burn through the night, use hardwood: trees with leaves, like oak and birch.
 This is the first part of your fire that will catch.Make sure that they are completely dry. Depending on the ecosystem, it may take time to find enough twigs – so be patient. Search beneath trees and bushes where these bits may have fallen. Make a small pile of twigs near the campfire site. Then, when they are gathered, carefully stack them in the center of the fire pit, between the legs of the "tipi."

, These should be no thicker than an inch in diameter – about as thick as your thumb. Collect an armload or two of these branches. Once you have these branches, put them on top of your dry twigs in the fire pit.


If you are burning hardwood, you want to use only fallen branches that are dead and very dry. If you are burning softwood, you can take the branches directly off the tree, needles and all.
 This is the flammable material that you will burn to get the fire going. You can use thin bark, dry leaves, newspaper, cardboard, pine needles – anything that will catch fire quickly and ignite the wood.Think of it as "fuse" that leads to your bed of dry twigs and leaves. Set aside plenty of tinder so that you can light the fire in several spots.

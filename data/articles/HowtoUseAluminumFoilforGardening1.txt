 Base the number of sheets on the square footage of planting beds in your yard/garden.;
, You want a few strips of foil for every few feet of mulch in your garden bed.
 If you havenâ€™t already laid the mulch, pour mulch into a wheelbarrow and then add foil. Use a hoe or gardening tool to mix the foil into the mulch.


Scatter the mulch in the garden bed. Mingle the foil into the mulch, evenly scattering pieces throughout the garden bed.
 Use a garden hoe to integrate foil into the previously laid mulch, scattering the foil thoroughly.

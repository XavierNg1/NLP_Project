 Many people assume that the best art is created by white men. For example, many book reviewers publicize novels written by men over those written by women.This can hurt the public's ability to understand women's stories and perspectives. Resolve to consume just as much art created by women as that created by men. Go to the library and check out books written by female writers, seek out female journalists, and pay attention to the works of female sculptors, visual artists, musicians, and filmmakers. You might find that new worlds open up to you.


Try to look at this art as true art made for the world: not as niche art made solely for women. Resist the idea that men are the only ones capable of speaking to all of humanity through their art.
 Try to focus on the women who have helped you in any circumstance, no matter how small or large. Such positive female influences may include your mother, grandmother, school teachers, college professors, and co-workers. By making this list, you will begin to see the positive contributions women have made to your life. Express your gratitude to these women who have made a positive impact.
 Read a book about women's role in society throughout history, or take a course on women's history at a local college or university. This will help you to embrace and recognize how women have been treated over the centuries. It will help you recognize and sympathize with the difficulties women have faced in the past. If you have a negative or misogynistic perspective on women, you can overcome this attitude by learning about how far women's rights have come and the benefits this has brought to society.


Be aware that much of women's history takes on the perspective of white women instead of women of color. Try to seek out women's history that focuses on minority perspectives to ensure that your sense of history is balanced.

 Depending on how many details your miniature has you might want to use less or more primer. The more primer you use, the more your colors will pop once you start painting. However, if you use too much primer you’ll also fill in some smaller details of the miniature accidentally.. , For colorful models prime with a white primer. If you’re painting a darker model you can try to prime with black or gray. Remember two or three thin coats are better than a thick coat that might fill in details. Let the model dry between coats.


In general, use a white primer. This will allow your colors to pop once you start painting your miniature.
 Most miniatures come with a separate base. If the base is part of the entire miniature that normally means the miniature will be unstable and tip over. You want a stable base, especially if you plan to use your miniature for board games. You can buy a separate base online or at a craft shop. You don't need to remove the base of your miniature if it came with one, just attach it to a larger base. Bases that are already connected to a miniature are usually quite small.
 Thick consistency crazy glue is recommended because it can fill in the small gaps between the miniature and the base. Avoid putting it in area where it will obscure details. Consider buying a super glue accelerant at a hobby shop to make this process faster. Not having to wait is a huge help.

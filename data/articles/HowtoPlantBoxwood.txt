This does not change the manner of planting drastically, but the mobility of a potted plant might suit your needs better than boxwood rooted in the ground.;

Fall is the ideal season for planting boxwood, but it can also be successfully planted in spring or early summer.


Depending on the type of climate in your region, you might be limited in where you can plant boxwood. If you live in a colder area, boxwood should be planted in a location where it will receive full sunlight. Also consider positioning the plant where it will be protected from cold wind.






In warmer areas, boxwood should be planted where it will receive partial shade. In all regions, boxwood should be planted exposed to the north or south.



The optimal pH level of the soil is slightly acidic, around 6 or 7 on the scale. Thick, fertile soil is best. The soil should also drain well, as boxwood's short roots require quick drainage so they do not drown.



If the plant is a transplant, skip this step.



If you are planting the boxwood in a pot, place the root ball into shrub soil about 2 inches (5.08 cm) deep.

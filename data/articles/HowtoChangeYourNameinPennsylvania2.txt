 An Election or Notice to Resume Maiden Name form for an adult who wants to change her name after a divorce is generally available in most Prothonotary offices in each county. Filing this form will allow you to change your name from a married surname to a prior surname if you are newly divorced.The Prothonotary’s office will charge a fee to change your name. This fee typically ranges from $19.00 for a person who was divorced in her county of residence, to $42.00 for a person who was divorced in another county or state. However, these fees vary by county.
 If you wish to resume using your maiden name following a divorce, you must provide a copy of your birth certificate that shows your maiden name., If your divorce was filed in another county or state, you will need to place a certified copy of your divorce decree on file in the Prothonotary’s office. You can get a certified copy of the divorce decree from the Prothonotary office in the county in which you were divorced, or from the county clerk’s office if you were divorced in another state. If your divorce was granted in the county in which you are filing for a name change, you do not need to provide a copy of your divorce decree to the Prothonotary’s office., Once you have filed the required paperwork, you have effectively given notice of your intent to return to using a prior surname. This is all you have to do to start using your prior name under Pennsylvania law.

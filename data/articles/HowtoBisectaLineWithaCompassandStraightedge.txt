 If the line segment is not already given, you will need to make it using a straightedge.;
, If you open the compass completely, and it spans one-half the length of the line or less, you need to choose a bigger compass.
 To do this, place the needle of the compass on either endpoint. Open the compass so that it spans a little more than half the length of the line., Make sure the needle stays on the endpoint, and that you do not adjust the compass setting.


The length of the arcs does not matter.
 Make sure you do not change the compass setting.
 Make sure the needle stays on the endpoint, and that you do not adjust the compass setting.


The two sets of arcs youâ€™ve drawn should intersect.
 To do this, place your straightedge on the point where the arcs above the line intersect, and align it with the point where the arcs below the line intersect.
 The line you draw between the two arc intersections bisects the line at a ninety degree angle.
 You have used the compass to outline two congruent circles centered over either endpoint. The intersecting arcs represent the endpoint of a radii from the center of either circle.


The length of the radii will be the same, since the circles are the same size.

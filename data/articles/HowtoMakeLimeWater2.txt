 You will need about five limes for this.
 The pitcher needs be able to hold about 3 quarts or liters of liquid.
 Give the lime water a stir with a long stick.
 This will give your lime juice some extra color and make it more interesting to look at. It's a great option for parties. Simply take a lime, scrub it well, then cut it into thin slices. Add the slices to the pitcher.
 You can add a few sprigs of mint, or a handful of fresh mint leaves. The mint leaves will give the lime juice some flavor and extra color.
 Lime water tastes best when it is cold.
 You can add some ice cubes directly into the pitcher. You can also fill a glass with some ice cubes, and then pour the lime water over it.

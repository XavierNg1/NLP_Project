 Use a shaving razor or a pair of scissors to distress your jeans.If you want clean holes, cut horizontal lines across your jeans. If you want white threads to show, scrape the edge of the blade across the jean to expose white threads.








Keep your cuts half an inch to three quarters of an inch apart (about 1.3 to 2 centimeters).Remember, only make a few cuts if you're distressing the sides of jeans and stay away from the side seams.
 Once the cuts are made, pull away excess fabric with tweezers until the holes are covered by bare strands of thread. Pull out as many threads as you can, only working in the areas where you cut. Try to remove all the colored threads so only white elastic threads are spread across the holes.








You will not be able to remove all the colored portions of the thread. There may be some fuzz leftover around the edges of holes when you're done as well. However, these come out in the wash, so do not worry if your jeans are not perfect the first time.
 There is usually loose fabric and thread on the jeans after you cut and tweeze them. Take a lint roller and roll it over the areas where you distressed the jeans. Roll the lint roller as many times as you need to remove excess fabric.
 Washing the jeans right after distressing will help remove any more debris and thread. Use a cold wash to protect your jeans. Warm or hot water should not be used on distressed jeans. You can dry the jeans as you usually would before wearing them.

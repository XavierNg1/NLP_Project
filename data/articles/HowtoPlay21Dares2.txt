 21 Dares: Situation, Truth, or Dare Edition is an exciting variation of the classic party game. You can play this game with a small group of BFFs at a slumber party or a big group of friends on vacation. Once your group is seated in a circle, select a person to start the game., As a group, players take turns counting one, two, or three numbers in sequence from 1 to 21. The player that has to say “21,” loses the round and has to tell a truth, complete a dare, or answer a situational question. The numbers you say are entirely your choice—there are not any set patterns that you must follow. Examples of this counting process include:


Player A: “1, 2, 3.” Player B: “4, 5.” Player C: “6, 7, 8.” Player D: “9.” Player E: “10, 11, 12.” Player A: “13, 14, 15.” Player B: “16, 17.” Player C: “18.” Player D: “19, 20.” Player E: “21.” In this instance, Player E was forced to say “21.”
Player A: “1.” Player B: “2, 3, 4.” Player C: “5, 6, 7.” Player D: “8, 9, 10.” Player A: “11.” Player B: “12, 13, 14.” Player C: “15.” Player D: “16, 17, 18.” Player A: “19.” Player B: “20.” Player C: “21.” In this instance, Player C was forced to say “21.”
Player A: “1.” Player B: “2, 3, 4.” Player C: “5, 6, 7.” Player D: “8.” Player E: “9.” Player F: “10, 11, 12.” Player G: “13, 14.” Player H: “15, 16.” Player A: “17, 18, 19.” Player B: “20.” Player C: “21.” In this instance, Player C was forced to say “21.”, Present the player forced to say “21” with three options: Truth, Dare, or Situation. If they pick truth, ask them a question which they must answer truthfully. If the player chooses dare, dare them to do a specific action. If the person selects situation, give them a situation with four distinct options. When a player refuses to answer a question or complete a dare, they are out of the game. You will remain in the game as long as you complete a dare, tell the truth, or answer the situational question. Examples of situations include:


”If John, Graham, Dave, Eric were inside a burning building, who would you save?”
”If Jenna, Heather, Leah, and Alexa each asked you to the dance, who would you say “yes” to?”
”Who is your favorite cousin: Grant, Patrick, Ali, or Zeke?”
”If you could take one friend with you on spring break, would you pick Rodrigo, Mason, Saul, or Manny?”, The round is over after the player completes the dare or answers the question. Select a new player to start the next round. Count from 1 to 21 as a group, present the loser of the round with a truth, dare, or situation, and repeat. You may continue playing until only one player remains or it is time for the next activity.

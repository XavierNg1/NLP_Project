 Search for them by name or website in the top search box, and then click the "Follow" button on their profile. Tweet them with a greeting, using the "@" followed by their username.


Many people get emails when someone new follows them on Twitter. They will receive a short description of your profile, so they can decide if they want to follow you as well.
 You can look by subject or profession. Follow 5 to 10 new people at a time, so that you don't get too overloaded by following all the new posts on your Twitter feed.
 Click the reply button and state an opinion, ask a question or say "Thanks" for a helpful industry post. The only way you will gain followers is by thoughtful interaction.
 Professionals like to follow Twitter users that know up-to-date industry news, tweet thoughtful comments and retweet or respond occasionally. People who tweet every 20 minutes can clog a Twitter feed, and find themselves with fewer followers.
 If there is any big news in your industry, or you know of an upcoming professional event, look for hashtags related to that event. Tweet about the event while using the hashtag, so that your tweet shows up in a search of the hashtag link.


A hashtag is a hash "#" symbol, followed by a word or 2 that identifies and important topic. For example, if you are using an Oracle database and you have a question, you can tweet the question and include "#Oracle" in your tweet. Either someone from the company, or an industry expert may answer your question.
 If you regularly message with each other, you should take the extra step to connect with them face to face. Start a hashtag and arrange a meeting with people on Twitter, if you want to go the extra step.

This is good move to help set you up for punches to the gut or knees to the groin.
 One sure fire way to knock the wind out of a bully is to give a powerful blow to the abdomen area. If you do it fast enough, your bully won't see it coming and will not be ready for your punch. This will bring your bully down to the ground and show your ability to defend yourself.

Just be sure to be quick, and aim accurately for the genital area., Do this with a short jab to their Adam's apple. Make sure you hit with your index and ring finger knuckles. A wrong punch could break your hand.

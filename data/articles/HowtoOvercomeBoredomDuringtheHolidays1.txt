 There are likely to be board games in the family home or at your friend's house. You can stick to the tried and true ones like Monopoly, Clue, or Snakes and Ladders. Or you can get more deeply involved in role playing or strategy games, like Agricola, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico or Settlers of Catan.


Some of the more famous board games are now available for playing on the iPad. This can be useful if you can't find the real board game at home––simply download the game (such as Monopoly), place the iPad down on a table you can all sit around and begin to play. You can pause for breaks and even come back another day, all without losing your places!;

Make someone say something without realizing you're manipulating them. For example, see How to make someone say carrot by way of example.

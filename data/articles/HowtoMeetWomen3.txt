 Even though it is said that nobody should judge a book by its cover, first impressions count enormously when people don't know one another yet. It is always in your favor to look your best.


In those first moments, you will be sized up and categorized depending on what you're wearing, how much you've groomed yourself and whether you've cleaned your shoes, no matter how much you may resent this reality! To help yourself meet women, stay well groomed and dress stylishly, according to your own tastes.
When looking to meet someone, wear clothes that represent you. They should be in good condition, pressed if needed (obviously not all clothing needs pressing, so use your instincts), free of holes and without stains.
Keep your hair in good shape. Take time in the morning to style your hair, shave, and get a haircut every 8 weeks.
Leave the grungy workshop or gardening clothes at home. Unclean, messy clothing reduces your confidence and doesn't help you to stand out. Grungy clothing on either sex tells the world, "I'm not interested at the moment, thanks."
Go easy on the cologne. She shouldn't be able to smell you from across the room.
 Be the type of man a woman would want. Take small opportunities to show her you're a gentleman. Then, of course, follow up with casual conversation.


If you see a woman with her hands full, offer to help! A courteous stranger will be sure to pique her interest.
Any situation can be an opportunity to converse. Explain a bus schedule, inform her of a better value down the street, or offer her spare change when she's fumbling through her purse. Don't expect anything in return, however; allow her to reciprocate.

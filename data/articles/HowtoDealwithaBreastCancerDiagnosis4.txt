Do not make it personal
Write every promise down and check understanding. This is important especially if you work in a corporation with lots of personnel and rule changes.
Keep a record of every conversation you have about the topic, documented by date and time and the name of the person that had the conversation with you.
 The workplace might accommodate you and might not - or after a month or two, they might change the so called "accommodations."


Please be aware your coworkers are human and may make mistakes or misinterpret what's happening (especially if you keep your medical information confidential, which you have every right to do). Work with your manager and have the support to obtain the "accommodated" shifts. If you notice discrimination, let your manager know.

 Learn everything you can about the foundation making the grant. Find out what types of philanthropy the foundation has engaged in before, and learn about the foundation’s history and its milestones so you can think of the ways your vision is consistent with theirs.It’s not always easy to learn much about a non-local foundation, so try some unconventional tactics, like reading their press releases and searching their Form 990 filings (tax forms). You can look for 990s at http://990finder.foundationcenter.org/.;
, Writing the proposal concurrently with the letter of inquiry doesn't harm the proposal and only helps the letter of inquiry. Even though your proposal will be modified according to the grant you're applying for, the broad outlines should remain the same.The details you learn from conducting the research and writing for your proposal should help you design a more effective pitch in the letter of inquiry. Knowing those details makes you seem more competent and knowledgeable.
 Your organization or academic department may benefit quite a bit if you are awarded the grant. Even though the department or organization as a whole will benefit, most foundations don't want to write a check for general operating expenses. Instead, they want to be able to point to something specific that their grant accomplished.


Think in terms of a building constructed, a study completed, a program launched, or services rendered. While your complete proposal will include a detailed budget, you should explain any major shortfalls in funding. For example, if you're applying for a $15,000 grant and it's supposed to help build a clinic, the foundation will want to know where the rest of the money will come from.

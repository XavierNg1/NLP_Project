 Make a list of any diplomas, degrees, certifications, credentials, and experiences you have that may be interesting to potential employers.
 If you are uncertain how to properly construct a resume, consult a career counselor, friends and family, or trusted online resources.
 Look for jobs in fields that interest you by performing daily searches using some combination of resources like:
Online job boards.
Employment agencies.
Networking events.
Friends and family.
"Help Wanted" signs at local businesses.
Sending letters of inquiry to companies that interest you but haven't posted employment opportunities.

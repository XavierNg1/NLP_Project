 In your rice cooker, combine 3 cups (555 g) of white rice, 1 tablespoon (15 g) of Dashida seasoning, 1 tablespoon (15 g) of bacon fat, ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of black pepper, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of chopped garlic, 4 green onion stalks that have been chopped, 1 packet achiote powder, and 3 ½ cups (828 ml) of hot water. Stir well until all of the ingredients are combined.You can use long or medium grain rice.
Make sure to rinse the rice in cool water and drain well before adding it to the rice cooker.
Dashida seasoning is a beef seasoning that’s similar to bouillon. You can find it at most Asian grocery stores.
You can substitute olive or vegetable oil for the bacon fat if you prefer.
Achiote powder is often sold as ground annatto in the spice aisle of the grocery store.
 Follow your rice cooker’s instructions to turn it on and activate the Cook setting. Stir the rice after 2 minutes of cooking and then again after another 5 minutes of cooking. Once you’ve stirred it twice and have ensured that the achiote powder has colored all of the rice, you can leave the dish to cook the rest of the way.Allow the rice to cook until your cooker goes into the Warm or Keep Warm setting, which typically takes 15 to 20 minutes.
 When your rice cooker indicates that the rice is done, transfer it to a serving dish or platter. Serve it alongside your favorite meat dish while still warm.

 If the infection leads to open wounds on your face, you should treat it like it is a wound. To help prevent more bacteria from entering the wound, wash the area with warm water each day. This helps keep dirt and debris from accumulating in the wound and promote healing.If your doctor says it is okay, use a mild cleanser or antibacterial soap. Discuss what would be best to treat the infected area before using it.
 To help keep the wound moist, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly on it. Doing this helps promote healing, reduce scabbing, and reduce scarring. You can apply the petroleum jelly with clean fingers or a cotton swab., If your wound is large enough and still has open sections, you may want to cover it with gauze. Place gauze over the open area and tape it in place with paper tape. After it has started to heal, you can leave it uncovered.Talk to your doctor about whether or not you should cover the area with gauze.

  Photocopy it, trim the white border, if there is one, and carefully glue it in the center of a piece of 9" x 12" piece of watercolor paper.  Make sure the edges are glued down flat to the paper.  Either landscape or portrait format is OK.;
,  No need to continue all the way to the edges of the watercolor paper, just go far enough to show what might be lying just beyond the photo's boundaries. This technique of leaving the edges ragged and unfinished is called a "vignette.", Use a scrap of paper to test colors and try to match exactly the colors on the edges of the photo. The colors will dry lighter than when wet, so, when completely dry, have another go at it and adjust your hues and values to match exactly what they are replicating.
  Look deeply to see what textures and patterns exist and be creative in trying to match them. Step back and look often to see the photograph merging with the painted background. If adjustments need to be made, wait until the paint dries to do another coat. Stay with it until the photograph is almost invisible.
 Continue to make adjustments until you are satisfied.

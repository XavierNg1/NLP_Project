 The Halloween or rainbow land crab’s ideal temperature is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. An aquarium tank between 15 and 20 gallons in size is adequate for either species.Use heating pads beneath the tank to maintain the temperature, and ensure the substrate provides adequate insulation against direct heat.The substrate should be of aquarium or reptile sand three to four inches deep.
 Rainbow land and Halloween crabs are freshwater crabs, and don’t require saltwater. Ensure the water is dechlorinated; spring water is an ideal choice. After covering 2/3 of the tank with substrate, pour water into the remaining 1/3 of the tank. Form a dam where the water meets the land with a long piece or pieces of driftwood. This will help the substrate retain its shape and not collapse on crabs’ burrows.Besides driftwood, give your crabs plastic plants, castles, and other climbable aquarium objects to explore.
 Rainbow land and Halloween crabs have diets almost identical to those of the hermit crab. You can feed them fish food, raw fish, and miscellaneous fruits and veggies like apples and potatoes.Ensure your crabs get enough calcium. Cuttlefish bone can be nibbled on for extra calcium, and commercially available calcium supplements can be sprinkled on fresh foods before you serve them to your crabs., Land crabs are best in pairs rather than large colonies like some other species of crab.Too many crabs can lead to fighting. The more crabs you have in the crabitat, the larger it needs to be. For instance, if your tank was five gallons and housed two crabs, you'll need to upgrade to a ten-gallon tank if you want to bring the total number of crabs in your family up to four.

 While the present should serve as a source of inspiration for your futuristic story, you don’t want to date it by making it speak too directly to current events. If you do, your future will get stale pretty quickly. Offer commentary without limiting it to a specific historical moment.For instance, if the characters in your story exactly mirror specific historical figures, such as Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, then the narrative and its commentary will not extend much past the present day.
 The pace of technological innovation is so rapid that it’s difficult to keep up. Lots of tech is obsolete within a few years of its development. Hence, if you describe the future technology in your book in too much detail, especially if your projections are based on where we’re at today, it’s bound to feel retro pretty quickly. Instead, focus on describing what the technology does rather than on the specifics of how it looks or works.You don’t want to describe screens and wires when those elements may become a thing of the past.
Instead, leave some gaps as to the details to let your readers’ imaginations fill them in accordingly.
 If your story projects an event, society, or character that was supposed to happen in the distant future but has already taken place in the reader’s present, the text will feel dated. Hence, it’s a good idea to resist including “first,” “lasts,” and “only's” in your futuristic writing.For example, if your story is about the first humans to land on Mars, that’s a reality that could happen sooner than you think. If one of your characters is the first female president of the US and you set the story a millennium from today, your premise will seem somewhat obsolete when there is a woman president.

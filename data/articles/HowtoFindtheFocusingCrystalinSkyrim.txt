 As you come from the Mzulft Boilery, you will enter the Aedrome. This area will contain a handful of Falmer as well as the Focusing Crystal needed to complete the “Revealing the Unseen” quest.;
, Once you enter the Mzulft Aedrome, you will see a ramp directly in front of you. There will be one Falmer and a Chaurus at the top of this ramp, so be prepared to face them. If they are too much for you to handle, you can retreat down the ramp to heal up or shoot them with your bow from afar.
 When you are at the top of the ramp, make your way around the corner and towards the end of the hallway, which has a tattered banner. You can either go left or right leading to doors that open into the multi-leveled room. It doesn’t matter which door you choose as they both lead to the same room.
 There will be four Falmer within this room. You will need to kill all four as one of them will be carrying the Focusing Crystal. Two Falmer can be found on the second level beside the tents. There will also be one patrolling the two entrances to this room and one located in the center of the room.


You can take a sneaky approach to this room by using a bow for sneak attacks. Make sure to crouch and stay out of sight to benefit from the 2x attack bonus if they do not see you. This can ensure the enemies go down quickly and help save on arrows.
If you decide to rush in with a sword or magic, make sure to have plenty health potions equipped so you can quickly heal up during battle.
 After you have killed all the Falmer in this room, one of them will be carrying the Focusing Crystal. Make sure to search each of the Falmer until you locate the crystal. This is the only room that the Focusing Crystal will be found, and it will always be carried by one of these enemies.

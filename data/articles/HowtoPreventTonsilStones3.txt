 A routine checkup and cleaning from your dentist is a key part of good oral hygiene. Professionally cleaning your teeth and gums, removing tartar and plaque buildup, and treating periodontal or gum disease will help cut down the risk of tonsil stones. Further, you can check in with your dentist if stones are a recurring problem and at-home options havenâ€™t worked.Depending on your oral health, you may need to visit your dentist more frequently than every 12 months. They may recommend coming twice a year or more.
 If you have difficulty managing allergies on your own or frequently get sick, work with your healthcare provider. Your physician may prescribe medications that can help you better manage problems with mucus, nasal allergies, and frequent infections.You can also get an allergy test in order to determine what specific allergens to avoid.
 Some tonsils are more prone to developing stones due to their shape and position. If stones and tonsillitis are recurring problems that interfere with daily life, you might have to consider tonsillectomy, or the surgical removal of your tonsils. Your physician or dentist can perform an examination and determine whether tonsillectomy will help prevent the development of tonsil stones based on the status of your oral health.It is believed that tonsils are part of the immune system since they are made up of special cells that prevent and fight infections. It is believed by some that removing them may impair your immune system, though research does not support this.

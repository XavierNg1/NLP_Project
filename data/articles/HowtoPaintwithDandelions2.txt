 Choose ones of a decent size. You'll need lots for this exercise, so it can be a good way to get the kids to "weed" the garden for you.

 Draw with it if you like. It should leave a little yellow color where it has been rubbed onto the surface.
 Rub or draw with the stem wherever you'd like it to appear green.
 For example, choose red petals to add red.

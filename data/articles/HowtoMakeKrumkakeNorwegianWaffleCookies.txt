 Before mixing in the butter, you can cut it into very small pieces, or soften it by putting it in the microwave briefly so it is easier to mix in.
 You don't need to apply any butter or iron to the tray., Check to see if the cookie is fully done on one side before flipping the iron onto its other side., You can tell when the cookie is done by opening the iron, and then closing it again. Once it is done, you should be able to see the pattern from the iron, and then you can use a fork to put the cookie onto a plate. You can mold it into a triangular shape using a wooden cone, or you can just leave them flat., Now that you are finally done making the cookies, you can add some powdered sugar to them and decorate them however you want. If they are triangular-shaped, you can fill them with whipped cream or some fruit.

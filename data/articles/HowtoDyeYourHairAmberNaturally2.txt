 Make sure that you are not wearing or standing near anything that could destroy your life if stained. Preferably apply in the shower or the bathtub. This may even stain sinks, bathtubs or countertops, so just pour some water, or keep water running just in case., Then scoop some of the dye and apply it from root to tip. Try not to apply too liberally to the scalp.

Most good hair stylists do not recommend ombres because it dries out the ends of your hair so if you're looking for a natural way to ombre your hair just apply the dye from wherever you want the hair color to change.
It's perfectly alright to have some dye leftover. You can use it if you want to further lighten/amber your hair in the next application or you can throw it away.
 You may need to use larger or smaller sections depending on the thickness of your hair., If it is still dripping after 10 or so minutes, squeeze out the excess and wait for another 5 minutes. Then bunch up the hair at the top of your head and secure with a hair band., If its not staying, use another hair band to tie the ends together. For an extra lock, take some saran wrap and wrap around your head., If need be take another hair band and use it to secure the towel or t-shirt.

The reason that you are wrapping twice is because it helps keep the moisture in. Also, makes sure that you're not staining other people and things. For at least the first few hours, the heat from your scalp will help make the dye work into your hair follicles. If you are sleeping with this dye in your hair.
 If it does, don't worry. As long as you have left it on for a couple of hours it's fine.

If you don't want to keep sleep with the dye in your hair, just leave the wrap on during the day. For the best results, leave the dye in your hair for at least 8 hours. The longer you leave the dye in, the better it will work.

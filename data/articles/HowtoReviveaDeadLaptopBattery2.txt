 This method will work for any type of laptop battery. Re-calibrating the battery fixes issues where the battery meter on your laptop no longer appears accurate. It also does a complete discharge and recharge, which can add extra life to your battery.
 Once the battery meter reaches 100% leave the computer plugged in to the power source for two more hours.
 Disconnect the laptop from the power source and drain the battery completely. You can speed up this process by using the computer to do something system-intensive, such as watching a movie or editing video.
 This will ensure that any phantom power is fully drained from the unit.
 Charge the battery back up to the 100% mark. At this point, your battery has been recalibrated.

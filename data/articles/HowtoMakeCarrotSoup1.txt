 Cook until the onions start becoming soft. This should only take a few minutes.


Pumpkin, fennel, apple, butternut squash, yam, tomato and sweet potato are also good bases if your cupboard is lacking in carrots.

, Cover and bring to a boil.


Vegetables take different times to fully cook through, obviously. Since it's all getting pureed later it's less of a deal, but you may want to start with your starchier veggies first. Carrots, potatoes, and similar dense veggies are going to take longer than, say, kale or spinach. Leafier veggies can be put in a bit later if it's something you'd like to be conscious of.
 When your fork easily slides into the body of the carrot, you know it's done.
 You're separating them now to get the solids alone -- you'll need the broth in a second.
 Pulse several times, then blend until pureed. Add broth as you go if the soup you are blending starts to thicken. Strain the resulting soup if you get celery strings or pieces that you don't want in your final soup.


Do not fill the blender more than halfway. Do this in batches, if necessary. Cover with a lid and kitchen towel, just to be safe.
 Bring to a boil, and add salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Really, you can add whatever spices you like!


Cayenne, cinnamon, clove, cumin, garlic, nutmeg, paprika, and thyme all work swimmingly.
 Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and strips of scallion or green onion, if desired. And be sure to serve hot and with some delicious bread and butter!

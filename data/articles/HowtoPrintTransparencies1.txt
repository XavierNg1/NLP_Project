 If you're printing for your school or office, they may have transparencies you can use for business or school purposes. However, if not, you'll need to purchase some from a office supply store, teacher supply store, or big box store.


Make sure you find the right kind for your printer. You shouldn't use laser paper in inkjet printers and vice versa.;
, Transparency packages come with a cleaning sheet to help remove stray ink from your printer before you print on the transparency. Because ink tends to smear on transparencies, it's important that you don't try to print on the transparency without cleaning the printer first.All you need to do is take the cleaning sheet out of its protective sleeve. Run it through the printer using your printer's feed button or the software. You shouldn't try to print anything on it.
You can save the sheet for later.
 With specialty paper, you need to be more careful with loading. In other words, you should only load it one sheet at a time. Otherwise, you risk jamming your printer or wasting expensive paper because it doesn't print correctly.In addition, be sure to print on the rough side of the transparency.
If you're not sure how to load your paper so it prints on the rough side, make a mark on a regular sheet of paper and note how you put it in your printer. Print on the page to see how you need to load the transparency so it prints on the correct side.

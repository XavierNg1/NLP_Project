 Take a plastic bag, such as a grocery bag or a Ziploc bag. Cut out a small circle or chunk from the bag. It does not matter where you cut, as long as you have some plastic to work with.








Do not worry about cutting out a perfect shape or circle. You'll be scrunching up the plastic into a ball anyway, so the shape is not that important.
 Take a shade of metallic nail polish. The color is up to you, although more neutral shades like gold and silver work best against pastels. Dab some of the nail polish onto a paper plate.
 Take your piece of plastic. Crunch it up into a small ball using your fingers. Make sure the edges of your ball are not too smooth. There should be some edges sticking up. This will create texture for your nails.
 Before using your plastic ball to apply paint to your nails, do a few test runs on your paper plate. Dab your plastic ball in your nail polish and then dab it onto an empty portion of the plate. If the speckles are too big or blend together too much, adjust your plastic ball. You can unfold it and refold it or pull some of the plastic out of place slightly.
 Dab the plastic bag in your metallic polish, getting a small amount on. Then, dab the bag over each nail until you have as many speckles as you want. For some nails, you may end up dabbing the bag more than once on slightly different portions of the nail.








There is no strict amount of how speckled your nails should look when you're done. It's a matter of personal preference, so keep dabbing your nails until you're happy with the look.

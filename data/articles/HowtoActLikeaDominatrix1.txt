 A full-bodied (often black) catsuit is a mainstay of fetish and bondage culture. There's a difference between a dominant lifestyle and fetishism, but the skintight black bodysuit remains an iconic garment in both communities. Make sure your suit is made from leather, or rubber latex. This is much more suited to use in the bedroom (or otherwise) than day to day use. Find some sexy, designer dresses. Make sure they suit you, and fit you well.;
, Like the catsuit, these boots represent dominatrix attire to mainstream culture. Platform boots can also be worn. Try Christian Louboutin heels; the red sole reflects your secret, sexual nature.
 A corset is a close-fitting undergarment (often worn as outerwear) that helps shape (and hold) your body. A bondage corset has become a staple in fetish wear. A bustier can also be worn as an alternative.

Gloves; try finger-less or elbow length.
A whip or riding crop.

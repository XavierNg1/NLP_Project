 Don’t try to hide your tummy or drown your body in a sea of fabric. Wear clothes that are fitted to your shape. Don’t be afraid to wear a bodycon dress or a form-fitting top. Love your curves and show them off in your sexiest outfits. Take time to research your coloring, face shape, and body shape, so you can pick out styles and colors that bring out your natural beauty. However, a fit and flare dress and a pair of heels will always be flattering., Lots of plus-size models have been rocking crop tops lately; try a crop top that shows off a layer of skin a few inches above your belly paired with a pair of high waisted jeans or a high waisted skirt. You should show off whatever body part you love about yourself, whether it’s your stomach, your butt, or your legs. You’ll feel and look sexiest when you’re showing the skin you love., If you find a piece of clothing you love but it doesn’t fit quite perfectly, bring it to a tailor to have it fitted specifically for you. You can get some garments tailored for under $20. Sometimes it’s good to buy a few pieces of clothing that fit really well rather than having many pieces of clothing that don’t look quite right.It’s not your fault for not “fitting” into clothes; the garment should fit you!

, Go for a dramatic smoky eye with black eyeliner, dark eyeshadow, and mascara. Fill in or accentuate dark, bold eyebrows. Unless the bold, red lip makes you feel sexier, opt for a toned-down, subtle pink lip, where only the bottom lip is lined. Use blush from your cheekbone to your temple to define your face even more., Don’t feel the need to over-accessorize. Some stylists recommend going for a bold print instead of a statement necklace. Try wearing a subtle pair of earrings or a few thin rings. You could also wear a simple pendant if you are wearing a simple top with a high neckline.

 Then sing it, but don't change your mouth shape. This is best done in a medium low vocal range. It help you find a vowel that sounds alive. If you know you have a poor speaking voice and lazy vowels, it may help you to pretend you are someone else you know who has a good speaking voice. Singing right after saying it helps you find your natural vowel shape and avoid pitfalls of having the mouth too closed or unnaturally wrenched open for singing., Let your mouth and throat be loose. Get a body breath and do a loose, very slidy siren on "ah" oozing slowly upward. Keep the breath moving, and let it move faster as you go higher in pitch. The impetus of the increased air should naturally make your face want to open up to make room for more air. Let the face do that. While most people will not open up enough for their high notes by intuition, most people's faces will open up for them on this exercise. It becomes a gauge by which you can find how open your vowel must be and how much air it must ride on to sing with ease in the high range., Sing your vowels with that added tickle behind them. This is one way to get a clear, ringing sound in your vowels., Think of a triangle with a very small point at the peak behind the bridge of your nose. Let this triangle be there as you sing., If you sing with the vowel well-formed behind the eyes but not seated on the low-body breathing mechanism, you are lacking the low part, and vice versa. You want to feel the whole length of every vowel, both the ringing part behind the eyes and the settled part within the body. In the upper ranges, you may feel more lift of air behind the vowel, but it should still be a column, though the column may seem to have a point on the top. Feel like you are letting each vowel bloom into its full shape. (See, how important word images are to vocal instruction? If you hate word images, you may want to pursue some other hobby than vocal music.)

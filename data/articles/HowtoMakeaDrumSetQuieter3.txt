 These sets can easily be equipped with headphones to allow the player to hear the drums while keeping overall noise to a minimum. This is a great option if you don’t mind trading sound quality for convenience.


Electric drum sets often come with additional features that make them a worthy choice, even if you already have an acoustic drum set, such as the ability to easily record your music.
Electronic drum sets also feature volume controls, allowing you to play them at a low volume, even without headphones., Practice drum pads are made of a rubber material and can be arranged in a fashion that resembles a full drum kit, bass drum included. Unlike an electronic drum kit, the practice drum pad is not capable of sound resembling a normal drum kit. However, the rubber construction allows drum sticks to rebound in a fashion very much like an actual drum set.


Drum pads are great if you have very little room to spare, but still wish to practice your hand technique. Set one up on a cymbal stand to practice, and buy a full kit when you have the room to spare., Drum brushes are drum sticks with heads consisting of nylon filaments. They are used for softer playing, as well as with certain drumming techniques. Note that these will have no effect on the volume of your bass drum.


Drum brushes don’t work particularly well on closed hi-hats, so plan your practice session ahead., Bundle sticks are similar to drum brushes, but made of wood or a similar harder material. They produce a louder sound than drum brushes, while retaining the feel and sound of standard drumsticks.


If bundle sticks are too loud, try coupling them with a mesh drum cover or other deadening method.

 If you have a uniform, this won't be a problem. Think about your outfit- is it appropriate for school? You don't want to be sent back home or wear clothing from the lost property just because your outfit was inappropriate.
 Take a long bath or if you prefer a shower. ALWAYS brush your teeth, use mouthwash and floss. If you have oily skin then wear some light powder. If you have dry skin, remember to moisturize at least 5 minutes after you have gotten out of the bath/shower.
 Bags are important when in High School and you don't want to give people the impression that you don't care about school.
 Try showering the night before so you have more time in the morning for other things. Lay out your outfit, along with shoes and all accessories the night before, so things are easier for you in the morning.
 Do this the night before school.


If your school starts at 8:30, try waking up at 6:30, but it all depends on if you're showering in the morning and how long it takes you to get to school. You don't want to be late.






Make sure you go to bed at a decent time so you're alert and happy in the morning, and won't have bags under your eyes. Also, you may want to paint your nails the day before school (optional).
 (This applies if you don't like school.) Think about happy things, such as what you did over the summer break.

 Algae should not grow if you keep on top of your pool chemistry. Test the pool regularly for free chlorine levels, pH, alkalines, and cyanuric acid. The faster you catch a problem, the easier it will be to deal with it.


Daily testing is ideal, especially in the week or two following an algal bloom. Always test at least twice a week during the swimming season.
 Algaecides are best used in small, weekly doses when pool conditions are normal. This will kill algae populations before they have a chance to grow. Check the product label for instructions.


Make sure to follow instructions for regular prevention, not for existing algae blooms. Too much algaecide may stain your pool or cause foaming.
 Algae feed off several nutrients in the water, notably phosphates. Phosphate test kits are a cheap way to test for these chemicals in your pool. If they are present, use a commercial strength phosphate remover from a pool supply store. Let the filter and robot or manual vacuum remove the phosphate remover over the next day or two. Shock the pool once the phosphates are at a reasonable level.


Pool professionals disagree over acceptable phosphate levels. 300 ppm is probably low enough unless you have recurring algae problems.

 If there's only a certain part of the spreadsheet that you want to turn into a PDF, select it now. Otherwise, move on to the next step.


Note that a PDF cannot be easily converted back into an Excel sheet, but this method will preserve your original copy.;
, If you're using an older version of Excel, click the "File" menu.
 If you are using Excel 2010 or earlier, select "Save As" instead.
 If you are using Excel 2010 or earlier, select "PDF" from the "Save as type" drop-down menu in the "Save As" window instead.
 This will allow you to adjust the settings for the PDF file you are about to create.
 In the Options window, you can select the range of pages included, whether the PDF includes your selection, the entire workbook, or just the active sheet, and if it will include the original document's properties.


Click OK when you are satisfied.
 Above the Options... button, you can select how you want to optimize the PDF. Most people can stick with "Standard" unless the spreadsheet is very large.
 Give your PDF a name and click the Publish button to create the PDF (Save if you're using 2010 or earlier).
 By default, the PDF file will open after it is created so that you can review it. If you aren't able to open the PDF file, you may not have a PDF reader installed.It's not really possible to edit the PDF now, so if you need to make changes you'll want to make them in Excel and then create a new PDF.

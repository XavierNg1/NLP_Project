 Using any micro-wave safe cup, fill about 2/3 of it with warm water. If you have no paper towels on hand, including a cup of water in the microwave along with the rice is an alternative way of adding moisture into the microwaving process. As the water heats, it releases steam at least some of which will return to your rice as added moisture (much how rice is cooked in the first place).
 Before adding the rice, heat the water in the microwave for a minute (or until you see it boil) to prime it for use with the rice. Keep a napkin or cloth towel nearby, as water may spill over the edge. If this is too much of a problem, pour some water out of the cup.
 Using power levels as suggest above, put your rice into the microwave with the heated water. Remember to keep them separate; have them on opposite sides of the rotating microwave dish. For this method it's advisable to use a little higher power and less time (2 minutes on 80% power is ideal) so the water never cools too much. The water in the cup ought to stay steaming in order to return moisture to the rice., Check the rice with your finger (carefully) to gauge how moist it has become. It may require more time if still dry to the touch. Once complete, dispose of the water carefully as it may still be near-boiling.

 The standard body of a Maltese is compact. Typically, the distance from the withers (shoulders) to the root (base) of the tail should be the same as the distance from the withers to the ground. The dog's chest should be slightly deep and the loins should be tight and slightly tucked under.The dog's neck should hold the head in a high position, almost as if the dog is holding its head back a little.
The tail should be curled over the dog’s hind end. The tail should also be plumed.
The front feet can be slightly turned out, but turned out back feet are not permitted.
The Maltese pup’s paw pads should be completely black.;
, The face of a dog is one of the most important aspects of a show dog, especially when it is being closely scrutinized by a judge during a competition. A Maltese dog should have a slightly rounded head on top with drop ears and a medium length snout.The dog should have a black nose, with its eyes a deep brown or black.
The skin around the eyes should be dark.
 The coat should be pure white. But it can be common to see cream, tan, or lemon ears. These colors should be seen nowhere else on the coat. It is preferable not even to have these pigments on the ears, although it is still permitted if they are light and barely noticeable.The coat should be silky and thin, never greasy.
Maltese dogs can also have red fur on their feet, but this is not permitted in most show competitions.

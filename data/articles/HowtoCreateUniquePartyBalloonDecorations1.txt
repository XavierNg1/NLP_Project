 For some occasions a regular latex balloon that you and your friends blow up at home will suffice. For other parties you may want helium or even Mylar balloons.


Your party type should dictate what type of balloon size you will need as well. You could also use a few larger balloons surrounded by smaller balloons for interest.;
, Will you need to glitter or draw on the balloons or will you add props like hats or faces to your balloons.


Assemble supplies based on your party. That means picking up glue, glitter or any other accessories you required to decorate your balloon.
Decide on how you will anchor or hold your balloons. This includes using ribbon, sticks or adhering the balloon directly to a piece of furniture or the wall. You may also partner the balloons with a flower arrangement too so plan accordingly. Having access to a clear tape dispenser would be a good idea.
 Especially if you plan to hold your party outside, you may want to take weather conditions into consideration (such as wind and/or rain).


The room size and shape may help you determine the number of balloons you will need.
If you plan to use balloons as a table centerpiece you will need to know the size and number of tables.

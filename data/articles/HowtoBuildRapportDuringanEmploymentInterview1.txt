 It's easier to stay calm during an interview when you arrive prepared and confident.


Organize your paperwork.
Choose your clothes the day before. Have them pressed and ready.
Familiarize yourself with the company's Web site.
Practice your answers to common interview questions.
Find out exactly where your interview will take place.;
, Arrive 10 Â– 15 minutes early and present a calm, friendly exterior.
, Keep your back straight and your hands relaxed.
 The object is to connect with your interviewer, not to think about what you'll say next.
 Skilled interviewers can detect deception, and an honest, "I'm not sure," is preferable to a lie.
 Showing interest helps build rapport during an employment interview.
 Avoid empty compliments ("Nice suit!") and comment about something you have in common instead. ("Are those your kids in that photo? Mine are 4 and 6. They're a handful!") When you relate to an interviewer on a personal level, you make a lasting impression that can give you a competitive edge.
 Offer a genuine smile and a firm handshake as you exit.

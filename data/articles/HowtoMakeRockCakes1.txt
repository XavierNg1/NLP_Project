 Using either cooking spray or a small pat of butter, grease a baking tray to prevent the rock cakes from sticking.


You can also cut a piece of parchment paper and use it to line the baking tray.

 Check the cakes occasionally to make sure they are not burning. They are done when the outsides are firm and golden brown.

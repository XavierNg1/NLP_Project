 Hangouts On Air are accessed through a different website than Google+. The Hangouts website shows the current Hangouts on Air that are broadcasting, as well as the standard Hangouts sidebar.


You can find a link to Hangouts On Air in the left menu of your Google+ home page.
 A similar window to the regular Hangout Party starting window appears. Make sure to give your Hangout a good name to attract viewers, and then invite the people that you want to join you.


A Hangout On Air will broadcast your Hangout to anyone that wants to watch. No one but those you invite can join, but anyone can see your Hangout screen and hear what you hear. Essentially, a YouTube recording of your Hangout is made as it happens, allowing anyone to watch.
 Once you’ve got everyone in the channel, get ready to start broadcasting. Make sure that all of your notes are in order if you’re giving a lecture. When you are ready, click the “Start broadcast” button. Your Hangout will now be viewable by the public.
 The creator of the Hangout On Air has the ability to make any guest that has joined the focus of the Hangout. Clicking on a guest’s thumbnail will make their feed the main image, and clicking the camera icon in their thumbnail will disable their audio and video feed.

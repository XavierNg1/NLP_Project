 Hamsters' teeth continue to grow their whole lives. If your hamster does not have a chew toy, his constant chewing may not be attention-seeking behavior.Hamsters need to chew everyday to prevent their teeth from becoming too long, which could cause serious pain and potentially harm your pet.Untreated, paint-free, oil-free wood is the best choice for chew toys. Avoid using wood harvested from outdoors, as this wood has not been properly inspected and could harbor harmful parasites or be treated with pesticides.Wood from an apple or pear tree is ideal, as these woods do not have any harmful oils and are therefore less likely to pose any threat to your hamster's respiratory or digestive health.Never give your hamster pine or cedar wood to chew on. The oils in these woods can be toxic to your hamster., A hard biscuit can make an excellent alternative chew toy for hamsters.Give hamsters hard treats like dog biscuits about once every week.Be sure the dog treats you give your hamster are free of garlic. Garlic is known to cause digestive problems in hamsters.
 The cardboard tube from a roll of paper towel or toilet paper makes an excellent chew toy for hamsters, and has the additional benefit of providing your hamster with a convenient hiding place.Try cutting a small hole in the tube before you give it to your hamster. That may help him see the potential in the tube, and may inspire him to make his own chew holes.
 A veterinarian can trim your hamster's teeth down to a manageable length, which may be necessary if your hamster has not responded to chew toys.Having a vet trim your hamster's teeth is quick and does not cause any harm to your hamster.Do not attempt to trim your hamster's teeth on your own, unless your vet has approved this procedure and given you proper instruction in how best to do this.

 You can access the system via 28 stations in the downtown, business district and residential areas. Routes begin around 5:00 a.m. and continue past midnight. Each route has its own operating hours, so check the TRAX route maps for times.;
, Ticket vending machines for TRAX only take cash. (Note: Most ticket kiosks now accept credit/debit cards as well as cash). You cannot purchase one-day or single-ride fare online.
 If TRAX doesn't lead directly to your destination, there are many areas where you can catch a city bus right off the TRAX light rail.
 Riding in the areas around the Temple Square and close to the state capitol is completely free.

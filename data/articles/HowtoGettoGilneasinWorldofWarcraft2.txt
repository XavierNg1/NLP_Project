 Do this by running or riding your mount out in the open world. The present-day area of Gilneas has been mostly abandoned and lies in ruins after the Forsaken invaded.


Press M to open up your map, and you should see four main continents on it: Northrend in the north, Kalimdor in the west, Eastern Kingdoms in the east, and Pandaria in the south.
 The ruins of Gilneas are located in the north of the Eastern Kingdoms continent, right beneath Silverpine Forest, a Horde questing zone designed for players who are between levels 10-20.


The closest major Horde city to Silverpine Forest is Undercity.
 If you are on a Horde character, you will be able to start some quests in Silverpine Forest, which will go over the story of what happened in Gilneas after King Genn Greymane and the Gilneans who were loyal to him fled to Darnassus.


Horde characters will be able to see and interact with NPCs (non-player characters) in the ruins of Gilneas if they have started the Silverpine Forest questline.
There are no Alliance quests in Silverpine Forest or the ruins of Gilneas, but it's possible to run or fly there on your mount and visit out of curiosity. The ruins of Gilneas are mostly empty, and you will not be able to see much besides abandoned buildings or a few critters if you are on an Alliance character.
The NPCs that Horde characters who are on the quests can see will be invisible to you.

 Some people enjoy making other people upset. If it seems like your friend often pushes your buttons just for fun, then don’t give her the satisfaction of seeing you get flustered.Stay as calm as possible and address her in a calm, even voice.


Using assertive body language may also help. Try to stand tall, face your friend, and keep your arms loose at your sides., Insults put the focus on you, but you can turn them around by responding with a question.If your friend comes at you with an insult, then do not get upset. Instead, ask a question to return the focus to your friend.


For example, if your friend says something like, “You are so dumb,” then you can respond with something like, “If you talk to me that way, then I am going to leave. Is that what you want?”

, If your friend has a habit of bossing you around, then correct her. Tell her how you want her to address you instead. For example, if your friend says, “Go get me a can of soda,” then you could correct her by saying, “I think you mean ‘Can I please have a can of soda?’”


If your friend refuses to address you in a respectful manner, then refuse to do what she wants. Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect., If your attempts to address your friend’s bossiness don’t work, then you may need to cut back on the amount of time that you spend with her to show that you are not willing to put up with this treatment.Try limiting your time with this friend to one outing per week, or less if she is treating you really badly.


If your friend asks why you don’t want to spend as much time with her, then you can say something like, “I don’t like the way you treat me. Until that changes, I can’t see you as much as I used to.”

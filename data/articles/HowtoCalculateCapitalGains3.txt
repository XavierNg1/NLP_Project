  Income taxes reduce the overall profit you earn on the sale of your assets.  You can use different tactics to manage the tax impact on your capital gains.  You can strategically plan the timing of the sale of your assets.  Also, you can use your capital losses to offset you capital gains.,  Short-term capital gains are taxed at your regular tax income rate, and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.  Therefore, sometimes it makes sense to hold off on selling equities in the short-term, even if the price spikes.  The difference between your income tax rate and the reduced long-term capital gains tax rate can be significant.For example, in the scenario described above, you might be thrilled that you made $400 on the sale of that stock after only three months.  However, if you are in the 35 percent tax bracket, then you would need to pay $140 in capital gains tax ($400∗.35=$140{\displaystyle \$400*.35=\$140}).  Your total profit would then only be $260 ($400−$140=$260{\displaystyle \$400-\$140=\$260}).

 Suppose in the same example, after 13 months, each share of stock was worth $4.50.  Your total investment would be worth $450.  If you sell, you would earn a $350 profit.  However, since you’ve held the stock for longer than a year, that profit is a long-term capital gain and is only taxed at a 15 percent tax rate.  

 Your capital gains tax would be $52.50 ($350∗.15=$52.50{\displaystyle \$350*.15=\$52.50}).  This means your total profit after taxes would be $297.50 ($350−$52.50=$297.50{\displaystyle \$350-\$52.50=\$297.50}).  

 Even though you sold the stock for a lower price, timing the sell of your stock allowed you to minimize the tax impact and make a bigger profit.  


,  Some investors purposely sell investments at a loss in order to reduce their taxable capital gains.  These tax-loss strategies may save investors enough in taxes to improve the overall performance of their portfolios.  However, this approach can be perilous.  If not executed correctly, you could end up losing more in capital losses than you save in taxes.Analyze the market carefully to select the right shares to sell at a loss.  Don’t give up shares in a healthy company just because prices may have dipped temporarily.  You could be missing an opportunity for large profits by not holding that investment for the long-term.

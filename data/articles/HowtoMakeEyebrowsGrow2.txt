 While you're waiting for your brows to grow, stimulating the skin in the area may help the hairs come through faster. Use a soft facial brush to scrub your brow area in a circular motion, removing dead skin cells and spurring circulation in the area.You can also use an exfoliating scrub in your brow area. Buy a scrub at the store or make your own sugar scrub.
Don't scrub too hard; rub the skin in gentle circles. Using too much pressure may loosen the hairs that are still in place.
 Brow serum is a product that is designed to stimulate growth at the follicle level with peptides. Some people have greater success with serums than others with these serums; they can be quite expensive, and they don't work quickly. If you'd like to give one a try, look for eyelash serums as well, which contain the same active ingredients and are more widely available at drugstores., Stimulate hair growth the natural way by making sure you're getting the vitamins and minerals you need to maintain healthy hair and skin. Get plenty of protein, vitamin B, iron, zinc, and omega 3's. Add these healthy foods to your diet:


Walnuts, avocados, and olive oil
Carrots, mangos, and sweet potatoes
Lean meat, salmon, and other fish
Leafy greens like spinach and kale

 Before you clean your cloth seats, you need to remove all debris, dirt, and crumbs. Vacuum the seats well. Make sure to get into the seams. Use your fingers to separate the seams and stick the nozzle of the vacuum into the seams to remove any loose debris., You should use a fabric or cloth cleaning product to clean cloth seats instead of an all-purpose cleanser. Lightly spray the solution over the area that you want to clean. Try four to five sprays over the area.Make sure not to spray so much that you saturate the area. This can lead to mold and smells on the cushion underneath the cloth.
 Before spraying cleaner on a new area, work on the area you just sprayed. Work on one area at a time, immediately brushing the area after spraying. Use a soft or medium stiff interior brush to massage the cloth seat.Don’t use a stiff carpet brush on cloth interiors. This can mess up the cloth fibers on the seat.
 Massaging the cloth helps bring dirt to the surface. When the suds start to gather with dirt in them, use a microfiber towel to wipe away the dirty suds. Make sure to do this before it dries, which will put the dirt back on the seat., Repeat this same process, spraying, massaging, and wiping, until the area is clean. Remember, the key is light coats before you brush instead of saturating the fabric with solution. It may take three to six coats to remove the stain., When you’ve finished removing the stain, use the vacuum on the area again. This helps dry up any wet saturation that has accumulated and dry the fabric. Let the seats finish drying before driving the car anywhere.

 If you already have your device setup to use WhatsApp, you can skip the next three steps.;
,


You may be prompted to allow WhatsApp to access your contacts. You can add contacts manually later, but this will greatly expedite that process.
,, This is in the bottom row of options.
 This button looks like a pen pointed to a square and is in the upper right corner.



If you need to add contacts manually, tap the Contacts tab, then tap the New Contact button (‘+’ icon) to bring up the form for entering contact information.



You can also tap the microphone icon to record an audio message. This option will only appear if you do not have text entered in the message field.
 This is represented by the up arrow that appears to the left of the text entry field. This will bring up a variety of media you can add to your message:


Take Photo or Video: This will bring up the camera to take a picture/video to add to your message.

You may be prompted to allow you WhatsApp to access your device’s camera before using this feature.


Photo/Video Library: This will open your camera roll to choose an existing image or video on your device.
Share Document: This will bring up a menu to browse your device or various cloud services for documents to share with your message.
Share Location: This will share your current or entered location in the message.
Share Contact: This will share the stored information of one of your contacts in the message.
 This is represented by the paper airplane icon and will send your message contents to the selected recipient.

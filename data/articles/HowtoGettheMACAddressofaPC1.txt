 You can find the MAC address of your PC's network adapter using the Command Prompt. There are several ways to open the Command Prompt:


Any version of Windows - Press ⊞ Win+R, type cmd, and press ↵ Enter.
Windows 10, 8.1 - Right-click on the Windows button and select "Command Prompt."
Windows 7, Vista, and XP - Open the Start menu and select "Command Prompt.";
, A list of your network adapters will be displayed on the screen., If you have more than one network adapter, such as an Ethernet adapter and a wireless adapter, they'll both be listed here. Chances are you need the MAC address of the active adapter, so find it in the list.


You can use the Connection and Network Adapter columns to help determine which adapter you're looking at.
Adapters that aren't in use will say Media disconnected in the Transport Name line.
 This is your network adapter's MAC address. It will always be 12 characters split into six groups of two characters each.
 On older versions of Windows, you'll need to write down the MAC address if you want to save it. In Windows 10, you can highlight the MAC address and copy it to your clipboard.

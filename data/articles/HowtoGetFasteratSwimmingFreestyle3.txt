 Take moderate-sized breaths as your head turns to the side. Then, slowly exhale as your head moves underwater. Do not:


Breathe too deeply. Ultimately, moderate sized, regular breaths are more important than deep breaths.
Hold your breath., Once your arms have entered the water, take a slight pause. This way, you’ll let the momentum of your stroke move you. You’ll also be able to recharge a little bit before continuing with the next stroke.


The pause you should take will be very short, perhaps about a second or so., Don’t force your release and recovery after your power phase. Let it all happen naturally – your arm should naturally move into recovery as your hand moves close to your hip.


The angle of your elbow doesn’t really matter during release and recovery.

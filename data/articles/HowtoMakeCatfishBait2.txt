 Add other ingredients, experimenting until you find the mixture that works for you.


Raw meat and blood or cooked meat leftover from meals.
Lunch meat or hot dogs.
Entrails of fish you have caught and cleaned.
Pet food. You can use dry kibbles or canned food.
Cooking oil or the oil leftover from canned tuna and sardines. Fish oil is particularly pungent and thus appealing to catfish.
Dark, sweet varieties of carbonated beverages. Other options are berry-flavored powders from dry drink mixes.
Fresh garlic, garlic powder, or garlic salt.
Other ingredients, which may include pig brains, coffee grounds, doughnuts, insects, bran flakes, ground-up bars of soap, chewing gum, candy bars, earth worms, peanut butter, eggs, seafood, hot pepper sauce, french fries, cheese puffs, licorice whips, or marshmallows.
 Place it into an airtight container.
 Be sure there is ample room for expansion and swelling as gases form.



If the bait mixture is too runny to form balls, you can put dabs of the mixture into pieces of pantyhose or cheesecloth and tie those to fish hooks.

 If you picked up your feathers outside, they may be carrying parasites. Place a handful of mothballs in a zip-lock baggie or Tupperware container. Add your feathers and seal the container. Keep the container outside and give the mothballs at least 24 hours to kill any possible parasites on the feathers.








To be effective, make sure you use mothballs that list paradichlorobenzene as an ingredient.;
, Bird feathers may be carrying bacteria and viruses. Once youâ€™ve taken care of possible mites, the feathers need to be sanitized to kill bacteria. Create a mixture that is half rubbing alcohol and half hydrogen peroxide. Soak the feathers in this solution for at least half an hour.








The higher the concentration of peroxide and alcohol, the better.
 If the quills look dirty or have a foreign substance on them, they should be sanitized. Bring a shallow pot of water to a boil on your stove. Place the quills into the water. Hold them there for a few minutes, which will kill any germs present.









Lay them out flat on paper towels to dry.
If boiling loosened up any unidentifiable gunk on the quills, wipe them gently with a soft cloth to remove it.

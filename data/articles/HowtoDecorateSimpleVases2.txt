 Washi tape is a good choice, or metallic tape.
 Here you have several choices, such as:


Cut into squares for a mosaic tape appearance.
Cut into tape lengths for making rows or lengths on the vase.
Cut into shapes, such as circles or stars, for sticking on the vase.
 Adhere to the clean vase, taking care to stick to a pattern formation if following one. Otherwise, use a random mosaic style.
 It's a good idea to paint Mod Podge over the top, to act as a waterproof sealant.

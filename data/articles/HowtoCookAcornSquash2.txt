 Remove the plate, turn the squash over, and microwave for another 4 minutes.
 Use a chef's knife to cut it in half, from stem to end. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and stringy portion in the center.
 Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of brown sugar onto each half.
 Remove from the microwave. Allow to cool and then serve.

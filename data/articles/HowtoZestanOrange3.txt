 Rest the tip of the microplane against your cutting board.
 Lightly press the orange against the microplane and scrape it from top to bottom, or from the handle to the tip. Maintain enough pressure to remove the top layer of the rind. Be sure to take off only the rind of the orange's skin, and not the bitter pith inside.
 Avoid using any section of the orange more than once, since you don't want pith mixed in with your zest.
 Gather your zest and measure it in a measuring cup to see how much you still need.

 Hold your first two fingers up, and your last two fingers down. Your thumb, first finger, and middle finger should be straight, with your ring and little finger bent down.
 Your first finger, middle finger, and thumb should be curved around the ball. The side of the ball should rest on the bent side of your middle finger. Try to hold the ball softly. If you hold it tightly, your control will be damaged., When you go to release the ball, your arm will be straight, and your wrist should be fully bent at your side. You don't want to bend it too hard as you want to keep flexibility.

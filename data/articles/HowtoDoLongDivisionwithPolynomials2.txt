 Just as you would with a simpler problem, write your dividend underneath the long division bar and your divisor to the left of it.Suppose you are asked to find the quotient of 4x3+9x2−x−6{\displaystyle 4x^{3}+9x^{2}-x-6} divided by x+2{\displaystyle x+2}. Set the longer polynomial 4x3+9x2−x−6{\displaystyle 4x^{3}+9x^{2}-x-6} under the division bar and the divisor x+2{\displaystyle x+2} to the left. It will look like this:


x+2)4x3+9x2−x−6¯{\displaystyle x+2{\overline {)4x^{3}+9x^{2}-x-6}}}.
 Follow the same pattern of four long division steps as before: Estimate, Multiply, Subtract, Carry down. The only difference with a longer problem is that you will continue repeating the pattern more times.Consider the numerical long division problem 24)90,048¯{\displaystyle 24{\overline {)90,048}}}. You will begin by estimating 2 into 9, then carry down the 0, then you will eventually carry down the other 0, the 4, and then the 8. Each number represents a full round of “Estimate, Multiply, Subtract, Carry Down.”

With the longer polynomial long division, each of the terms in the dividend, 4x3{\displaystyle 4x^{3}}, 9x2{\displaystyle 9x^{2}}, −x{\displaystyle -x} and −6{\displaystyle -6} represents one full cycle of “Estimate, Multiply, Subtract, Carry Down.”


, Keep working until you get to the final subtraction and have no more terms to carry down. With this example problem, the division should work out evenly, so that the final subtraction gives a result of zero., Just as you would expect a larger number to be the quotient when you divide large numbers, you will likely have a longer polynomial as your quotient when doing a longer algebraic division problem.

In this example, the result of 4x3+9x2−x−6{\displaystyle 4x^{3}+9x^{2}-x-6} divided by x+2{\displaystyle x+2} is the trinomial 4x2+x−3{\displaystyle 4x^{2}+x-3}.

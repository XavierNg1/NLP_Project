 There are lots of events to choose from, but don't enter all of them, it will be too hard for you and your horse.;
, You will need your horse's health records, Coggins test, and all the trailering paperwork. Also, you will need the event's entry fee(s).
 Work on the skills for each event, bulking on work over time. A good training schedule for a junior jumper would be the following. Notice the pattern of adding on work.


Week #1: 1 & 2 foot jumps, walk, trot, and canter.
Week #2: 2 & 3 foot jumps, trot, canter, 2 point position.
Week #3: 3 & 4 foot jumps, trot, canter, 2 point position, lead changes, work with different types of obstacles.
Week #4: 3 & 4 foot jumps, repeat everything.
Week #5: 4H Show.
, Make sure you wash all of their socks and any markings on their face or body. If your horse has white on them in is a good idea to wash the horse with a whitening shampoo such as "White and Brite"!Make sure you pamper and reward your pony. It also might be a good idea to put liniment on your horse the night before the show to relax them and their muscles for the next day. Rub the liniment really good on their back where the saddle goes and all down by their legs!!

, Good Luck

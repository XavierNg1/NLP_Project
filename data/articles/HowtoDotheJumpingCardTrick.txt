 This trick will not work on a hard table. You'll need a bit of give to the table, as it needs to work somewhat as a spring-board for the card to jump back.






;
, Do not deal the cards like normal.









If you're left handed, you can reverse all of the above directions and hold the deck on the left side.
 You'll basically be showing the card off to the person in front of you, but since you're not really dealing this is no big deal. You want to deal the card "standing."








, Only this corner needs to touch. Push from your index finger (on the upper-right corner) to curl the card away from you. As you press, the card will bend, and the piece of the card on the table will start to slip.
 This needs to happen quickly, in one fluid motion, to work. Repetition is key, as you just need to get used to the bend of the cards so you can control it.
 Once you can make the card jump, you need to stick the landing. You should practice the movement so that the card always shoots back face down. From there, work on lowering your other hand (holding the deck) so that the card can easily slide back on. It can help to use the "jumping hand" to follow the card back to the deck, allowing you to re-adjust any mistakes and make the whole thing smoother.

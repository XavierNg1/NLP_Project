 If low iron is making your child anemic, they may lose their appetite, get frequent infections, be lethargic or weak, get out of breath easily, sweat more, look pale, act out behaviorally, grow more slowly than expected, or in severe cases have cravings to eat dirt or chalk (a disorder called pica).If your child shows anemia symptoms, contact your doctor about a possible blood test to check their iron levels.
 Children between the ages of 6 and 12 months who have an increased risk of iron deficiency should be screened for their iron level.A child may be high-risk if they are breastfed past 6 months without the addition of any solid foods, or if they will not eat iron-rich foods. Certain medical conditions or medications can also put a child at risk for iron deficiency. Children from low income families or those receiving government assistance are also considered high-risk for iron deficiency.


Premature and underweight babies may be screened for iron levels earlier than 6 months.High risk children should also be checked again around age 15 and 30 months., Children who do not get sufficient iron from their formula, breast milk, or solid food as infants and toddlers may need iron drops to supplement their nutritional intake. This may include infants who cannot tolerate iron-enriched formula or those that will not eat iron-fortified food during the second half of the first year and later.


If you are concerned about your child's nutritional needs, speak with their pediatrician to find out if supplementation is necessary for your child's healthy development.

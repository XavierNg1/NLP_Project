If you’re slicing avocados for a salad or to eat on their own, go with a slightly less ripe fruit than you would for guacamole.
The slices will stay intact better if they’re a little less ripe, allowing for better presentation.;
, If you are preparing a meal containing avocados and need them immediately, choose ripe, ready-to-eat avocados. However, if you are buying the avocados in advance, you can purchase unripe fruit and let them soften at home.


To ripen avocados at home, you can store them at room temperature, and they should ripen over three or four days, depending on how firm they were when you purchased them.
To speed up the ripening process, place the avocados in a brown paper bag with a banana. The banana releases small amounts of ethylene gas, which helps other fruit ripen faster.To stop the ripening process, store the avocados in the refrigerator.

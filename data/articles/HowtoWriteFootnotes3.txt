 APA discourages the use of footnotes. They’re only allowed when you need to clarify content or demonstrate copyright permissions. Double-space all notes and format them in Times New Roman 12-point font.
 Do this for all cited material in your main text. Include the author’s last name, the source’s publication date, and the page(s) you’re citing in parentheses. Place the information before the punctuation. For example:The symbolism in dreams arguably extends to jokes and folklore (Freud, 1952, p.111).
 Capitalize only the first letter of a title and subtitle. Italicize the titles of books, journals, magazines/newspapers, movies, music albums, works of art, and websites. Place the titles of articles, essays, chapters, songs, and TV shows in quotation marks.For example, a book title looks like this: And keep your powder dry: An anthropologist looks at America.
 Use content notes to elaborate one small piece of information that would make your main text seem awkward. Make your note as short as possible, preferably no more than a paragraph. If you mention the name of one or more authors, include the publication date of their work(s) that discuses the information in your note. For example:1. Freud (1952) links the symbolism found in dreams to jokes and folklore.
 Use this to demonstrate that you have the author’s permission to use their material. You only need to do this if your quoted or paraphrased material is more than 500 words, if you’re reproducing a visual aid, or if you think it violates the Fair Use clause of U.S. copyright law. Begin the entry with the word “Note.” For example:Note: From “Title of article,” by J. Doe and J. Smith, 2017, Title of Journal, 20, pp. 30-35. Copyright 2009 by Name of Copyright Holder.

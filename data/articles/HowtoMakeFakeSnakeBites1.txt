 Try not to straighten the wire too much as you unwind it, but don't worry if you do because you can always use a pen or marker to reshape the wire into ring shapes.;
, Try to make sure that the rings are roughly the same size and shape, but donâ€™t worry if they are not identical.
 Grip one of the rings using the pliers and use the other pair of pliers to help shape the ring so that it is more circular. If you are having trouble getting the wire into a nice round shape, wrap the wire around a pen or marker and use the pliers to tighten the wire.
 Use the pliers to bend back about 1/4" of wire on each end and fold it so that it is aligned with the ring wire. Bending back the wire will redirect the pointed ends of the wire so that they are not pressing against your inner and outer lip. When you bend back the wires, make sure that the ring opening is wide enough to easily slide over your lip. This space should be about 1/4" wide, but you may want it narrower or wider depending on the thickness of your lower lip. , Use the pliers and a pen or marker to reshape the rings after you have bent back the ends. Make sure that they look exactly how you want them to look.
 Simply slide each of the rings onto your lower lip and adjust their placement so that they are spaced equally on your lower lip. The two rings should be closely aligned with your canine teeth. If they are too loose or too tight, gently squeeze or pull on the rings to adjust the fit.

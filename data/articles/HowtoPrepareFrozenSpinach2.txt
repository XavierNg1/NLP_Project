 Avoid using paper bowls, plastic Tupperware, or any bowls with metallic paint or trim. Instead, choose a glass or ceramic bowl.Additionally, the bowl should be large enough to easily contain all of the frozen spinach.


Some packages of frozen spinach ask you to keep the spinach in the bag while reheating. If so, place the bag on a ceramic or glass plate before putting it in the microwave., Follow the microwaving instructions on the package. If you can't find them, start by microwaving the spinach for one minute on high. If the spinach is not completely reheated, place it back in the microwave and heat it again in thirty second intervals.Stir the spinach between heating intervals to evenly distribute the heat.
Check for doneness by carefully touching the spinach. Fully reheated spinach will be easy to stir and warm to the touch.
 Place a clean dish towel in a large ceramic bowl. Next, pour the spinach over the dishtowel. Hold the edges of the towel together and lift the spinach away from the bowl. Squeeze the spinach tightly inside the towel to drain away all of the cooking liquid.Let the spinach cool slightly before using this method. Otherwise, you may burn your hands.

 Look for a digital thermometer designed to be used either rectally, orally or in the armpit. This way you can take the axillary temperature first, and if a high temperature is indicated, you can try a different method as well.


If you have an old glass thermometer, dispose of it instead of using it to take a temperature. Glass thermometers are considered unsafe now because they contain mercury, which is poisonous to the touch.
 Lift the arm, insert the thermometer, then lower the arm so the tip of the thermometer is snug in the middle of the armpit. The entire tip should be covered., Look at the digital display to determine whether the person has a fever. Any temperature above 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) is considered a fever, but going to the doctor right away isn't necessary unless the fever is above a certain temperature:


If the child is over 5 months old, call the doctor for a fever 101 °F (38 °C) or higher.
If the person with the fever is an adult, call the doctor if it's 104 °F (40 °C) or higher.
 Use warm, soapy water and dry it thoroughly before putting it away for next time.

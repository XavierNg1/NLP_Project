 You will be using Firefox’s Page Info command to browse for the .swf file, which is the format for Flash games. Make sure that the entire game has loaded.


This will not work for games that aren’t in Flash format, such as Java or HTML.
You will need to have Adobe Flash installed in order to save the file.;
, Don’t right-click on the game itself, but on the background of the website somewhere. Select View Page Info from the menu.
 This will list all of the images, sounds, videos, and other media objects on the website. Click the Type column to sort the list by type, and scroll down until you see the Object category. If there is not such files as Object, look for one called "Embed".
 Select the “.swf” file in the list. The name will typically be related to the title of the game, and will contain the entire URL of the game. Once you’ve selected it, click Save As. Rename it to whatever you’d like and choose where you want to save it. Once it’s saved, the download is complete.
 Once you’ve downloaded the game, navigate to where you saved it. Right-click on the file and select Open With… You will be given a list of programs to open the game with. If Firefox is on this list, choose it. If Firefox is not on the list, click “Browse for more programs” and then navigate to Firefox.


Firefox is typically installed at C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe, though this will vary depending on your system configuration.
You can install a standalone .swf player program if you’d rather use a different program than Firefox.

 Not all herbs grow well from cuttings. The following herbs tend to grow better from cuttings than others: lemon balm, mint, oregano, rosemary, and thyme., Measure down three to four inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) starting from the tip. Cut the herb using a pair of sharp scissors.Take your cutting in the springtime when the plants are starting to grow because actively growing plant stems will root the best.


Make sure that the herb you are cutting from is healthy. The leaves should not be withered looking or yellow.
 You will be placing the cutting in water. Any roots on the bottom can rot. They can also prevent any roots from forming.
 Make sure that the water is no higher than the leaves. Also, take care to avoid direct sunlight, as this can damage the cutting.


If you want to plant the cutting immediately, use root hormone, which will help the stem form roots after it's planted in soil. Dip the cut end into root hormone, then plant it into the ground. You can also use ground cinnamon in place of the hormone.This will kill any bacteria that can lead to rot or mold. It will also give the roots a "boost."

, Depending on the type of herb you cut, you might see roots forming in as little as 2 days. It can also take as long as 2 weeks. Changing the water is very important. If the water is not fresh, bacteria may develop and keep the herb from growing roots.
 Poke a hole into the soil, and slide the cutting in, until the roots are covered. Pat the soil around the cutting, and water it.

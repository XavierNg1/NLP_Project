 What sort of a person would go around trying to pick on every little flaw, just to make you feel bad? Don't let it get you down. Don't retaliate. Just smile, take a calming breath, and walk away.;
, What goes around, comes around. Someone might be mean to you, but the bad feeling will find it's way back to them. Keep your own karma in good shape by being kind to others!

, Then write some more. Write any worries or negative feelings on a slip of paper, then tear it up and throw it away. You'll feel relieved, and as if you really have thrown your worries in the bin.
 Hang around with everyone. Try not to give anyone or any group a label. Pretty soon you will realize that labels just give a preconceived notion about someone...not tell you anything about who they really are.
 Eat and drink what's best for your body. Drink plenty of water and stay away from soda. Eat at least 5 portions of fruits and vegetables a day, and get a good nights sleep. Wash regularly and take pride in yourself.

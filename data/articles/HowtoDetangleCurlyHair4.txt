 To help prevent tangles in curly hair, condition your hair every day with the help of a wide-toothed comb. Overall, the ultimate key to fewer tangles is keeping your hair nourished, moisturized, and protected from environmental factors such as the sun and pollutants.
 This will also help control frizz. Avoid washing your hair every day, no matter your hair type, as this can dry out your scalp and your hair. Shampoo your hair a few times a week, at most.
 Try to shower in the morning. Hair is more malleable when it is wet, so it might get rubbed the wrong way while you toss and turn in the night. It may be very hard to tame your tangled hair in the morning if you showered the night before. If you must shower at night, give yourself a few hours before bed so that your hair has time to dry out.
 Keep your hair in healthy shape by getting regular trims. Cut a small amount from the tips of your hairs to remove any split ends from your hair. Your hair will have fewer tangles if you don’t have split ends.
 Consider braiding your hair or tying it up loosely before bed. Securing your hair on top of your head will reduce friction and tangling overnight. Your hair won’t be able to move about so freely, and you will be less likely to roll over it and tangle it.
 Satin is a slippery fabric, so your hair will slide more easily over the surface and tangle less than with a cotton pillowcase. This will help keep your hair from tangling up in friction when you sleep., Consider simply trying a new, shorter hairstyle, especially when it is warm. You might even look younger. Maintain your hairdo by keeping it simple and easy, washing it only according to what your hair type needs. For instance, if you have dry and thin hair, only wash your hair twice a week, and make sure that you use a quality shampoo and conditioner. In the winter, when the weather is cooler, you can grow out longer hair to cover the nape of your neck.

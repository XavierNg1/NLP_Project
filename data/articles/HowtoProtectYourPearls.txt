 Okay, so pearls can get scratched really easily. So, to store them use a soft bag or small but soft pouch. You can also use a clean soft cloth. What we are basically doing here is avoiding the pearls to get scratched.;
, You love makeup, so do we but just make sure that whenever you are going to wear some pearl jewelry, wear it after you do makeup, or apply hairspray etc. because they are harmful for the pearls. They can create spots on them, or cause disintegration.
 Your beautiful pearls can get holes and get dissolved. Yep, that's true. Remove them if you are going for a shower/bath or if you are going swimming.
 Restring your pearls at least once a year. Tie knots after each pearl, because they avoid pearls from rubbing with each other and if the string is ever broken then loss of pearls will be less. Nice idea, right?

, Everything is great when it is clean. So how do we clean pearls? Well, it is simple. Take a dry, soft cloth for wiping the pearls. Do it gently. This will prevent oil, dirt etc. to increase. Don't use any rough/abrasive material to clean them.
 Don't store your pearls or wear them where there is direct sunlight. The acid in your perspiration can cause pearls for the luster to fade away. Discoloration of pearls also happens.

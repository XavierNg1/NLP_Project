 Partially straighten the paperclips, leaving the U-shapes intact. Pull the outer portion of the paperclip into a straight line without straightening the innermost U shape.
 Work one of the small Uâ€™s into the bottle between the glass and the cork until the U is below the cork and the straight portion remains out of the bottle. Rotate the wire 90 degrees so that the U will be beneath the cork when you pull up.Repeat on the opposite side of the cork with the second paperclip.
 Twist the ends together a few times. They should be securely joined so that they stay together when pulling out the cork.
 Insert a suitable utensil, such as a spoon handle, pen barrel, or pencil, under the twisted wires. Slide your fingers under the utensil, with the wires between your middle and ring fingers, and slowly pull out the cork.

 As well as increasingly flexibility, it's important to have a good balance of strength across your different muscle groups. This means not working really hard on your hamstring but ignoring the other muscles around them. These kinds of imbalance are a common cause hamstring trouble., The quadriceps are the muscles on the front of your thigh, and they oppose the hamstring on the back of the thigh. An imbalance between these two muscles is cited as one of the most common causes of hamstring injuries.When you stretch your hamstrings, don't neglect your quads.


Place your right hand against a wall. Take the left hand and grab the left foot while bending your knee. Align your knees and tilt your pelvis forward as you pull up your left foot behind you.
Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat twice on each side.
 Leg curls are a common way to build up quad strength, but it's important to balance this with your hamstrings. Do the same number of sets and repetitions for a quad leg curl (sitting up and pushing your leg up into a straightened position) as a hamstring leg curl (sitting and pulling your leg down into a bent position).


If you are doing squats, taking them more slowly and minimizing the amount you lean forward will help you keep a good balance between quads and hamstrings., If you have a pronounced strength imbalance, or want more personally tailored workout plans, it can be a good idea to ask for some guidance from a professional.This is especially relevant if you are doing weighted exercises where there is greater risk of injury.


If you are strength training be sure to give your muscles a chance to rest and repair between workouts.

 Ultrasounds are used in a variety of medical practices, including obstetrics, surgery, cardiology, oncology, and endocrinology.The size and type of machine you buy will depend on whether you expect to use it at your home, in your medical office or in a larger healthcare setting.


You will also need machines with different functions depending on the type of practice you have. An obstetrics practice and a general practitioner will need an ultrasound machine that has a large all-purpose probe. A cardiologist will need a more specialized machine that has Doppler capabilities and a specialized phased array probe.
You can limit your search based on the type of machine that fits your needs.;
, There are number of different sized models available. There are small and portable machines that can be easily carried, while there are also large stationary models that take up a considerable amount of space. Think about whether you will need to move the machine between rooms or practices, and decide whether size is a limiting factor in your decision.You may be limited in the size of models that are available depending upon the type of machine you need. For instance, if you are making house calls you will want a handheld and portable machine, rather than a cart-based machine., Your practice may currently have an ultrasound machine that is out of date, but that you are otherwise pleased with. You should consider buying the new model of the machine if the model still meets your needs. The manufacturer may offer an incentive for you to buy an upgraded model, like offering a trade-in program that could reduce cost.


If the machine no longer meets your needs, but is still functioning and meets certification standards, consider trading it in or selling it to defray your costs.

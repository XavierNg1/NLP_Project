 If you choose a grocery delivery service that offers only low-cost groceries, you’ll avoid the hard choices you’ll find when shopping at a deluxe grocery chain. This will keep you from accidentally buying things like $35 organic maple syrup that you can’t afford.Check the prices of the grocery delivery service you’re interested in using before signing up.
Ensure that the delivery service sources their groceries from a shop that offers low or mid-range prices.
Buy only affordable groceries.
 Placing a large order can often help you save on shipping costs or order fees. For instance, when getting groceries delivered directly from a store, you might need to pay a fee if you order less than a minimum amount (for instance if you order less than $35). If you order more than this minimum, you’ll avoid paying the fee and maximize your money.Many grocery delivery services also offer free shipping if you order more than a certain amount.
 Longer delivery times are usually cheaper than shorter delivery times. For instance, when getting groceries delivered through Safeway, you can choose a one-hour delivery time for a premium price. But if you choose a two-hour delivery time, you’ll save money. Choose the four-hour delivery time and you’ll save even more., When calculating the total cost of getting groceries delivered, don’t forget to factor in delivery or shipping fees, membership or subscription fees, and similar hidden costs. After all, if your total order exceeds the cost of what you’d spend by just going to the grocery store, you’re not saving any money at all.Each delivery service charges a different price for shipping, as well as different prices for the groceries themselves.

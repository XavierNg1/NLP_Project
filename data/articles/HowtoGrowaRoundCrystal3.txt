 You'll need Epsom salt, food coloring, a beaker or other heat-proof glass container (such as a measuring glass), and a transparent, rounded cup or bowl. The crystals will grow even if your cup is not round.Your crystals will not leave the container you grow them in, so make sure the container is transparent.
 Boil water, or use very hot tap water. Stir a half cup of Epsom salts with a half cup of the hot water. Stir until almost all of the salt dissolves., Add a couple of drops of food coloring. If you do not, your crystals will grow whitish-clear, like ice., Pour your solution into your round cup. Store it in the refrigerator for several hours. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap if you wish. After a few hours, you should have a cup of delicate, fibrous crystals. If you leave it, it may last for months.Display your cup of crystals in a window so that the light shines through.

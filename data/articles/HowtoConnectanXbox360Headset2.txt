 Plug the charging cable into the port on the headset. Connect the other end to the USB port on your Xbox 360. Your Xbox 360 will need to be turned on in order to charge the headset.


If you have the AC power adapter, you can use that to charge the headset instead. The headset will not work while it is charging.
When the headset is fully charged, all four lights on it will blink simultaneously. This may take a couple hours.
 Turn the 360 on, and press the power button on the headset. Press the Connect button on your Xbox 360 console, and then press and hold the Connect button on the headset for two seconds.


The headset will connect to both the console and a controller. The lights on the headset will indicate which controller it is assigned to. You can change the controller it is connected to by pressing the Connect button on the headset.
 Press and hold the power button to mute the headset. The headset will beep twice whenever the mute settings are changed.
 Press the "+" and "-" buttons to adjust the volume of the headset.

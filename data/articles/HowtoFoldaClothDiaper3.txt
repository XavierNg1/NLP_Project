, If using a fleece liner, it needs to be placed lengthwise down the center stride (over the twisted area) in order to keep moisture from baby once the diaper's front is pulled up over the baby's stride. If you are adding a diaper doubler for extra absorbency, place directly lengthwise beneath the baby just as you would the fleece liner.


Unless thin and narrow, diaper doublers do not work well with this fold.
, This will also help to hold the twisted portion in place.
 Pin both sides with diaper pins.


If needed, tuck the layers at the leg to ensure "containment" of any messes.
Back wings wrap around the baby, and can be pinned with safety locking diaper pins, through the front panel that was folded up.






If pinning, do not try to pin through all layers-just catch one or two. Keep fingers under diaper layers to ensure you do not stick the baby.

 Finger nails can play a big role in your overall look. Before the day of the party, make sure you clean up your fingernails. This includes trimming your nails and removing old nail polish.If you are wearing shoes that show your toes, be sure to clean up your toenails as well.
Girls, try finding a pretty nail polish shade that compliments the outfit you will be wearing.;
, If you have not had a recent haircut, at least in the past six weeks, be sure to make an appointment so you can trim off any split ends or shape up your current style.


If you dye your hair make sure you touch up your roots.
 Planning your transportation will prevent any unnecessary stress when getting ready for your party. If possible, try carpooling with a friend who is also going.


See how far away the party is so you can leave yourself plenty of time to arrive.
If you are wearing a more detailed hairstyle with products, take a car to protect your hair.
Depending on where the party is can help you decide to walk, ride a bike, take public transportation, or drive.
 Find out if there is anything already happening in your schedule the day of the party that you need to arrange for. You may also want to write down the date of the party to prevent the conflict of double-booking yourself.


If needed, plan for a babysitter in advance.

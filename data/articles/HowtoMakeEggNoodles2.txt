 The noodles are best fresh, but you can also dry them out if you want to save them to cook later. Simply hang them over the back of a clean chair, on wire hangers, or a dedicated pasta drying rack overnight, then break into smaller pieces and store in an airtight bag the next morning., There are not a whole lot of options here, but you do have some variability when choosing liquids. Try out a low-fat milk for a slightly denser pasta, or use a dry white wine (like a Chardonnay) for a subtle, snappy pasta that goes well with Italian dishes.


You could also try out lemon juice, though it should be cut halfway with water to avoid being too acidic.
 The most important thing to remember is to make sure they are finely ground, which will avoid lumps or broken pasta when cooking. Try out 2 teaspoons of:


Black pepper
Thyme
Lemon zest
Oregano

, There are a lot of different theories about how to make the perfect egg noodles, and most of them vary in the number of eggs. When using 3 cups of flour, you have several options -- experiment to find your favorite:


3 yolks, one egg
4 whole eggs
2 whole eggs, 1 yolk, + 1/4 cup milk., Simply pour the butter into the eggs and liquid mixture before fully blending everything together. This goes especially well if you've substituted milk for water in the earlier stages.

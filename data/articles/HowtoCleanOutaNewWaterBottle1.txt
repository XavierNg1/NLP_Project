 If your water is dishwasher safe, save yourself some time and hassle by simply throwing it in with your dishes. Remove the cap and set the water bottle in with your regular dishes.Make sure to take any special instructions into account in regards to using the dishwasher. For example, if you need to set the dish washer to a particular setting, do so to avoid harming your water bottle.;
, If your water bottle cannot be washed in the dish washer, or if you cannot find a manufacturer's label, wash it by hand. You can use tap water and any soap.All purpose dish soap works best. Squirt a small amount into your water bottle and then fill it with water.
Use a sponge or towel to gently wipe the insides of the water bottle. You can also shake the bottle to help disperse the soap evenly inside your water bottle.
 If your water bottle has a particularly harsh smell when you first get it, this may require extra scrubbing. In this case, you can use a scrub brush with a long handle to scrub down the insides and remove an unwanted new smell.If there were any stickers or embellishments inside your water bottle at purchase, a scrub brush can be used to remove these items.
 If washing the water bottle does not get rid of an unwanted smell, add a small amount of bleach. Mix one teaspoon of bleach with one gallon of water bottle with this solution. Let it sit for five to 15 minutes depending on the severity of the smell.Rinse the bottle thoroughly after letting it soak. It's very important to rinse it several times, as bleach is toxic.
Allow the bottle to air dry before using it.

 There are a number of potential causes, including common colds, flus, allergies, cold weather, stress, exposure to tobacco smoke, chickenpox, and whooping cough.If you are experiencing other symptoms in addition to a runny nose, like a fever or sore throat, then see your doctor to determine whether you have a bacterial or viral infection that requires medical treatment.
Common colds usually go away on their own, but should be treated with fluids like water and fruit juice, lots of rest, and soothing foods like soup.
 Runny noses can be caused by allergies to pollen, pets, latex, dust mites, and foods.If you are in constant contact with an animal, plant, or material that you are allergic to, you will probably experience runny noses often.


If you have allergies, try to stay away from pets and take medication if you are about to stay with one for prolonged periods.
Thoroughly clean your home to remove dust mites, and stay away from food and animals that you are allergic to.
Runny noses can also be caused by excessively dry or cold weather. Try using a humidifier to restore some of the moisture in the air in your home. Humidify the air and warm the air to keep nasal passages comfortable. Dry cold air can insult the mucous membranes and cause rhinitis. Dry nasal passages can become irritated and will be more likely to become infected and bleed.

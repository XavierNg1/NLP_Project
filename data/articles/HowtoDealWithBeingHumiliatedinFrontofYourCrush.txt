 It's Okay! So what if it happened. We all have to go through this at some point in our lives. Even the perfect ones. You cannot escape such a situation. In our day-to-day lives we come across many people and some of them can be mean as well. We have to learn to deal with them and learn cope with their hurtful words.;
, It's difficult not to have any effect on you but the important thing in this situation is to not show that it's affecting you. Your crush will automatically think that you are a brave person.
 Don't avoid your crush or the people just because you were humiliated in front of them. It's no use. Face them. They will think you are amazing. It will create an impression that you know what to give importance to and what not to.
 Don't try to tell your crush how bad you feel about it or how you are not like that. Act as if it's not a big issue.
 Don't try to seek revenge. You not caring is the biggest revenge. Act cool.
 Humans tend to think a lot about what others think. It's difficult but don't think about it. The more you think the more bad it will seem. Just forget it.
 That way you won't have time to think about the incident. And you will also become a talented person.

 If you live in an area that's far from the city,then you will need to go to a web bookstore,if you have a PC. You will not be looking for a rock or gem book, but a magazine that is made for people like you. One that is usually readily available is "Rock and Gem" magazine.;
, This is a listing by months of all the club shows going on in the United States. By carefully going down the list, you will find the city or town closest to you. Often, the show person will have his or her number listed. You can call and find out if there is a club closer to you,and find out when and where the meetings take place.
 There will be contact information that you can use.
 Once you are at the meeting, you will find yourself being introduced as a new potential member. The great thing about being in a club is the social interest in many of the same things you like about rocks, minerals, fossils or gems. You will have a world of experience around you to help, and at the same time a deeper appreciation of how our everyday life comes from deep within the earth.
 For instance, some clubs have many field trips while others have few. Join one or join them all.

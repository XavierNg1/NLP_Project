 A good ink stone will have a hard, polished surface. You don't want it too rough because a rough surface can damage the brush.;
,,,, Place the end of the ink stick into the water and pull some water up onto the plain of the grinding stone.
 If the ink is too thick, it will not flow easily off the brush. If the ink is too thin, the color will be light. Practice getting the right consistency.
 Clean the ink stone with water and a soft sponge or cloth. Never use anything that could damage the stone. Cover the stone to prevent the ink from drying if you will take a break.

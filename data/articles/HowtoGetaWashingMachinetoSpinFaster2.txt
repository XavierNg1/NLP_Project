 Although rare, a machine can encounter mechanical problems that slow down the machine's spin. This may be your issue if the motor sounds jittery or "jumpy," constantly adjusting its speed.


This is usually caused by a motor that's become offset so the belt no longer wraps tightly around it. A modern machine will attempt to adjust its RPM to keep the drum spinning at a constant rate, and the loose belt causes these adjustments to happen frequently.
 Let the machine drain and disconnect it from the power supply. Take apart your washing machine to give yourself access to the motor.


This is much easier if you have your washing machine manual.
 If the belt is old or has been slipping for some time, it may be wearing down. If there is visible wear on the belt, or if you see black, sooty powder on the floor beneath it, it is already damaged. Purchasing a replacement part is recommended.


If the machine is under warranty, the manufacturer may replace this part for free or a reduced cost.
 If the belt is loose, but not visibly damaged, adjusting the motor should fix the problem. Loosen the nuts holding the motor in place, then pull the motor with some gusto while tightening the nuts again. The belt should fit quite tightly around the motor. The belt is reinforced with a strong braid, so don't worry about breaking it.


This may be easier with some help.

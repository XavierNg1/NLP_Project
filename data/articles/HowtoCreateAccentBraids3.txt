 For a classic half up half down style, you need to pull back the top section of your hair. Gather the hair together and secure it in a ponytail at the back of your head with an elastic.








It’s a good idea to brush out your hair before pulling it back so there aren’t any tangles or knots. If your hair is curly, use a comb to detangle so you don't wind up with frizz.
You can take a small section, such as just the hair that will fall into your face if you left it down, or a larger piece, such as the entire top section of your hair.
 For the boldest accent braid, create the braid from the pulled back section. Starting right at the elastic that's holding your hair back, make a simple 3-strand braid and secure the end with another elastic.








You can create a more elaborate braid, such as a fishtail, if you prefer.
 If you want a more subtle accent braid, gather a small section from the hair that you’ve left down instead of braiding the top section that you've pulled back. You can create a 3-strand braid on either side of your hair or put it directly in the back.








As with a simple accent braid, you can give the braid greater impact by coloring it with hair chalk so it really stands out.

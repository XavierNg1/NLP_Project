 A wired connection is usually faster than WiFi. Try connecting your computer to the router with an Ethernet cable and you may notice improvements.


This option is not usually available for mobile devices.;
, If you cannot use ethernet, connect to a WiFi signal, as this is much faster than a standard mobile phone's data connection. Move to the same room as the wireless router, or purchase a WiFi range extender to boost the signal across your home.


See the section on optimizing your router below to further maximize your WiFi signal.
 If you are on a network sharing an Internet connection, disconnect all devices from the network while they are not in use. Additional computers and mobile devices can slow down a video stream considerably.
 Call your Internet Service Provider and ask them to analyze your connection for potential problems. Sometimes, the provider can fix an issue on its end that was slowing down your internet. If you have exceeded your data cap for the month, your ISP may be "throttling" your connection, making it much slower until the next billing cycle.


Upgrading your internet service package is also an option, or switching to a different ISP.

 We all like to socialize and move around for various gatherings and dinners. Notwithstanding the importance of these gatherings and visits, parents must ensure that they head back to their homes in time for bedtime.


Late night parties, functions and other family events badly affect the toddler's routine and disturbs their sleeping patterns. The adults must ensure that all such visits or gatherings finish up early in the night so that the kids (along with other family members of course) can get to sleep at their normal time.
It's important to be aware that disrupting your child's sleeping patterns not only affects the mood of the kids but also lowers their performance capabilities.
 The most important thing the parents must focus on is to ensure a peaceful, friendly and comforting environment at home.


A child who is stressed due to any quarrels between the parents will sleep poorly or and be more inclined to have bad dreams than a child who is surrounded by a happy, loving environment.
 There are a few regular tasks like brushing the teeth, praying, taking a warm bath and reading a book ,etc. which kids have to do before they sleep.


Parents must start these tasks with their kids about an hour before they they get the young ones to settle down in their beds. These activities set the mood for sleep

, Set up your child’s room to be as comfortable as possible. Remember that a bedroom should be quiet, with proper ventilation and dark at night.


Do not place a television in the room. Do not fall into the habit of allowing your child to watch television to fall asleep. This will only disrupt their sleep and possible cause nightmares.
Another thing that you need to keep in mind is not to stuff the room with your child’s favorite toys. You can give them a blanket, stuffed toy or teddy bear that they consider, but too many toys can be distracting. The room should always have a positive and soothing feel.

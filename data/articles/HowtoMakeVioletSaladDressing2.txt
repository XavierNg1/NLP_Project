 Add the salt and pepper. Whisk together.
 Stir constantly to infuse through the vinegar.
 Let stand for 20 minutes minimum. It is best if it can stand for an hour, as this will bring out the flavor of the violets. Leave at room temperature.
 Stir or shake well before serving. Add as a dressing to greens or a salad.


If there is any left over, it can be stored in an airtight glass container in the fridge for a week.

 Lenders will use your credit report and score to determine whether to approve the loan, and if so what interest rate to offer you.


If your credit score is 680 or above, you are considered a prime borrower and are eligible for the best interest rates available. The higher your score, the more bargaining power you have to negotiate a low interest rate.;

Many lenders offer 5 year loans, as long as the car you are purchasing is less than 5 years old. Most vehicles older than 5 years are only eligible for 1 to 2 year loans, if the lender will even finance them. Lenders are fearful that an older car will not last for 5 years.
Additionally, lenders often impose minimum mileage restrictions (often 100,000 miles) and will not finance salvage-titled vehicles. Typically they will only fund loans for vehicles purchased through a franchised dealership, not through a private party or independent dealer.
 The interest rates offered on used car loans are generally 4 to 6 percent higher than rates offered on new car loans.

 You will need to provide the car's make, model and VIN number, among other things. The lender will then originate the loan.

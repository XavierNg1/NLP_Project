 Maybe dressage, the art of lateral movements and obedience. Or cross country, racing along the field over difficult obstacles. Could it be racing, speeding down a racetrack at 45 mph (72 km/h)? Many do show jumping, a competitive way to show off your skill. Horses could be fancy competitors for experienced riders. You could get a pony for someone who's inexperienced, or just for fun.;
, Hardy native breeds do well living out all year round so you only need a pasture, whereas finer horses like thoroughbreds may need stabling over the winter so you will need stables as well as grazing.

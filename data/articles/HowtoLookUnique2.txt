 Find a style that accents your facial features and is fresh, creative, and easy to maintain.


The style doesnâ€™t have to be totally off the wall to be different, it just needs to be a major change for you.
If you have long hair, think about cutting it short. If you have shorter hair, think about growing it out, styling it differently, or getting extensions.
 Whether you put streaks in, make a bold color choice, or return to your roots, find a color you like and go with it.


If you want a safe but major change, you can dye your dark hair blonde, or vice versa.
You can also dye your hair using a colorful ombre effect.
If your hair has been every color of the rainbow and you want a more natural look, let your hair grow out to its original color. This can take some time, but your natural hair color is always going to be unique to you.
 Makeup can enhance your beauty and also be a form of art and personal expression.


Try applying stars and swirls or other quirky designs around your face.
Apply unique eye makeup. Blend eyeshadow colors or do a sunset makeup look for a colorful look.
Try out a rainbow or glitter lip for more festive occasions. There are also temporary lip tattoos you can buy online for a one-of-a-kind look that can be easily removed.
It is okay if you choose not to wear makeup at all. Your unique style is all about what makes you feel good. And depending on your situation, the choice not to wear makeup can be a statement in itself.

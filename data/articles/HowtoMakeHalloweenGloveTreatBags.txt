 Any miniature candy can be added into gloves.


Chocolate, white chocolate, or peanut butter chips
M&Ms or Skittles
Gumballs
Candy corn
Jelly beans
Popcorn
Smarties candies;
, Fluff the gloves up either by inserting your hand in them, so the fingers can extend out or lightly blow into the gloves.
 Drop a wrapped round candy, preferably a Hersey's Kiss or miniature Reese's cup into each finger.


If you are adding "bigger" candies, such as mini-sized wrapped chocolates, use Smarties candies for the fingers and then fill the palms with the treats.
 Distribute the candies evenly throughout the glove, ensuring the fingers are the same width and not budging.
 Wrap an orange ribbon around the opening, like a balloon.
 These can also be given out during Halloween parties as goodie bags.

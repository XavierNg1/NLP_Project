 The object of the game is simple. Each player must reduce his score down to zero.


Why is it called "01" then? "01" refers to the fact that each player always starts a game with a score that ends in "01". Single player games generally start with opponents staked 301 or 501 points. In larger, team games, the starting number of points can be set as high as 1001.
 The oche is the line that a throwing player must stand behind. It is 7ft 9 1/4 inches or 2.37m from the face of the board.
 The person who gets closest to the double bull gets to throw first.
 The points the player scores are then subtracted from his starting total.


For example, if a player is starting with 301 points, and lands 54 points, his/her new total would be 247 points.
 This is because of the manner in which the game is won. In order to win, or "close-out" as it is called, you must reach exactly zero. In addition, the dart's score that brings you down to zero must be a double.


For example, if a player has 2 points left, they must score a double 1. If he/she has 18 points left, the player must score a double 9.
If a double is not possible, such as a remaining total of 19 points, a player can score a single 3 first to bring the total down to 16. From there, the player can score a double 8 to finish the game.

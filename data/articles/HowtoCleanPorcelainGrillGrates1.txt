 Porcelain grill grates can chip easily if you use a metal or wire bristle brush. Avoid this by using a soft bristle brush, such as a brush made with nylon bristles. This way, the porcelain is not at risk of getting damaged when you clean it.You can get a standard square head soft bristle grill brush or try a grill brush with a rounded head. A soft bristle grill brush with a rounded head can make it easier to clean the grates.;
, The grill will be easier to clean when it is warm. Heat up the grill to burn off any excess food on the grill grates. Then turn off the grill and let it cool for a few minutes. Get the brush ready, as you will want to clean the grates while they are still hot.Alternatively, you can leave the grill on a low heat setting to prepare for the cleaning.
 Take the soft bristle brush and run it diagonally along the grates. Do this in smooth, fluid motions from the bottom to the top of the grates. Running the brush diagonally over the grates, rather than straight over the grates will make it easier to remove food and grease on the grates.Do one pass over the grates with the brush in a diagonal motion. If there are any really greasy or sticky parts of the grill, lightly go over the area a few times with the brush. Do not scrub too hard on the grates as this can damage them.
If the grill grates can be flipped over, wait until the grates have cooled. Then, use an oven mitt or heat proof gloves to flip over the grates and clean the other side with the grill brush.

 Start with bare nails. Apply a layer of clear base coat to each nail. Go slowly so the base coat appears smooth and even.Make sure to let your base coat dry completely before proceeding.Tim will vary depending on your type of base coat.
 From there, add a top coat. This will help keep the negative space on the nails looking shiny, and keep your manicure safe longer. If you want, you can use sparkly top coat to add a little shine to your negative space., The vinyl shapes can be purchased online or at a beauty supply store. You want long, thin triangles to create a striped effect. Place three triangles on each nail.Place the tips of two triangles on one side of your nail. One should go near the top. The other should go near the bottom. The tips of the triangles should stretch out almost across the nail, but leave some blank space between the tip and the nail bed.
Then, place one tip of a triangle on the other side of your nail. Place it roughly at the halfway mark between the first two strips. Again, make sure the tip of the triangle stretches almost all the way across the nail, but stops short of the nail bed.
Much like stripping tape, the vinyls may need an extra push with your thumbs or other fingers to make sure they're lying flat on your nails., Paint your nails as you normally would, using a dark polish. You can use colors like black, purple, deep blue, and so on. Paint over the vinyl and negative space of the nail, going slowly to avoid smudging the polish., Remove the vinyl slowly to prevent smearing. Do so before the polish completely dries. This will keep the polish from smearing. When you're done, you should have a zig-zag, striped pattern of negative space running along each nail.

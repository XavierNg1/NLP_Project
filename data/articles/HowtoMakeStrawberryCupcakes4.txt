 Frost or ice the cupcake with frosting of choice and add fresh strawberries:


Add a whole strawberry or half a strawberry. Either stand up the strawberry or lay on its side.






Add a strawberry fan. Cut a strawberry into a fan shape and arrange on the frosting or icing fanned out.






Cut the real strawberry into a shape, such as a heart shape.






Dip real strawberries in chocolate, allow to set and place on the cupcakes.
 Frost or ice each cupcake and add a strawberry figure to each one.
, Once mixed to a decent consistency, add to the cupcakes as usual.
 Pipe small melted chocolate "pips" across the red surface at even spaces. Add a green candy leaf or green fondant leaf at the "top" of the strawberry.

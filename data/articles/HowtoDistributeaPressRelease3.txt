 One of the typical shortcomings of new press-release-writers is stylistic—they tend to write a press release as if it was a memo. That is, they tend to write a dry, matter-of-fact document more suited to office consumption than public consumption. This is a mistake. A press release should be written like a hybrid of an advertisement and a news story; it should be pithy, catchy, and informative. The best case scenario for your press release is this: the reporter who reads it thinks it’s a newsworthy topic, runs out of time to write a story about it, and puts their name on what you wrote, giving you complete control over the message. If what you’ve written is good enough, there’s a (very slim) chance that could happen. If you write something dry and filled with jargon, it never will.
 The eye is drawn to a picture to a greater degree than it is to text, and as a consequence, visual aids work in press releases just as well as they do in any other type of written media. Tastefully integrated photographs, images, and videos are all great ways to get more eyes that matter reading what you want them to read.The effect of adding images and video is considerable—18% and 55% greater views on average, respectively.
 Understand that even if you advertise, your press release might be the way a lot of viewers learn about your good or service, whether the reader is a member of the press or a member of the public. As a consequence, you need to explain to the reader what they stand to gain by diverting their attention from whatever else is vying for it, and reading your press release. After every press release, your reader should be able to easily explain what is new, why it is unusual, and why they should care. Tweak it until you’ve satisfied those conditions.

 Note how the strings come off the grooves in the nut at the top of the neck, pass or bypass holders and the direction that they wrap around the tuners. This is very important for tone. You should have no less than 2 wraps around each tuner but no more than can fit around the tuner without overlapping.

, You can either take all the strings off at once and put new ones in all together, or do them one at a time. Some people prefer to change them one by one because it prevents changes in stresses on the neck. Others will periodically remove all the strings at once so they can clean the fretboard more easily. But that's your choice.
 It will be bent on the end where it was stuck into the tuner.
 Sometimes it will be difficult to grasp the end of the string to pull it out, so alternatively begin by pushing the string out then pulling.
 There are MANY treatments available to clean your guitar with, pick whichever is your favorite.
 If not, it still can be used to guide you in cutting the length of the new string.
 Be careful not to damage the guitar finish. Pull the string completely through the bridge before laying it on the nut.
 Finely wound or strings with coatings can be nicked or bent easier than one might think.
 Wrap it around the tuner until there is about an inch left.
 Correct it if necessary.
 Make sure not to put the tip in before wrapping if possible, since doing this will twist the string and can lower its integrity and sound quality.
 There should be at least two complete wraps present on the tuner, but still no more than can fit on without overlapping. The new string should sit on the bass just as the old one did.

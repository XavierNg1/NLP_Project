 If it is still light outside, use your power outage as an excuse to go outside and get active. Your mind will focus more on moving and breathing, and less being bored. If it is dark outside, you can still do some simple exercises inside, such as stretches or yoga. Listed below are some ideas to get you started:


Bike ride
Jogging
Jumping jacks
Stretches or yoga
Walk around the block
If you live in a good neighborhood and the weather is nice, send the kids outside to play., Having no power at home is a great opportunity to get out of the house and do other things. If the people you are visiting don't have power either, be sure to bring along some candles, games, and snacks. You can have a fun game night while you wait for the power to come back., Is there anything in your house that needs painting or repairs? Does your bathroom need thorough scrub? So long as there is enough daylight, there is plenty you can do in your house. By the time your power is back, you might even have a sparkling-clean bathroom and a freshly-painted bedroom.
 If the weather is decent, you can always pack your car, and go on a road trip. You don't have to go far. You can even go to the park or the library. If there is a big city or national park close to you, you can drive there and spend the day exploring. By the time you come home, the power might already be back.
 When all else fails, you can always take a nap. You may end up having a great, exciting dream.More importantly, you will wake up feeling refreshed and energized. You may have more motivation to do things you'd usually find boring (such as cleaning), or you may get some ideas for new projects (such repainting your cabinets or working on a painting).

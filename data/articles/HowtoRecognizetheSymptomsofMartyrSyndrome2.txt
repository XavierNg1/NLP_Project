 One of the more common signs of martyr syndrome at work is when the person you suspect has the syndrome arrives before everyone else in the office, and stays until after everyone leaves. Try to get to work early and stay late to see if the person does in fact arrive before everyone else, and stays until after everyone else has gone home.Having no life, or very little life, outside of work can also be a sign of martyr syndrome--the person may arrive early or stay late because he has an imbalanced life that revolves entirely around work.
 A person with martyr syndrome at work will not hesitate to bring work home with her. She will affirm that she isnâ€™t really bound by office hours and is more than happy to bring the work home. You can keep track of this by noting the time that she sends out hours--if she sends and responds to emails at hours when she should be doing anything but work, take note.


If she sends or responds to emails at odd hours every once in a while, this does not necessarily mean she is an office martyr. However, if this is a daily occurrence, she may have martyr syndrome.
 The person expects coworkers to know how hard he works based on the amount of hours he stays at the office, rather than by how efficient or productive he was. The person may view himself as the only person in the organization that can properly get the job done, therefore he has a hard time delegating parts of the job to others that he thinks will produce sub-par work. This causes the office martyr to take double the time to finish the task.People with martyr syndrome may also have harder times prioritizing their tasks because they are overly aware of how important their task is.
 People with martyr syndrome honestly believe that the companies they work for would crumble without them. Because of this, they have a hard time taking days off. When they do take the day off, they work from home to ensure that the company does not fall to ruin.

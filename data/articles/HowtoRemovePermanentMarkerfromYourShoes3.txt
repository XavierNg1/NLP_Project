 You can find a magic eraser in the cleaning section of your grocery store or pharmacy. The magic eraser is a great way to remove permanent marker stains from fabric and leather.If the stain on your shoes covers both fabric and leather parts, consider using this product.
 Run the sponge under cool water. Before using it, squeeze out any excess water. Use small, circular movements to rub the stain. While rubbing the stain, use gentle, but firm pressure.








Do not rub too hard. Rubbing too hard may lift the coloring of the leather, which you do not want.
 Once the stain is removed, clean the affected area with water and mild soap. Use a clean cloth to do this. Then use a clean, dry cloth to dry the area.

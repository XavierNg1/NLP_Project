 Deep conditioners all have the same goal: to repair chronically dry/damaged hair. Therefore, there aren’t too many ‘types’ of deep conditioner to choose from, just different brands. Find a deep conditioner that meets your hair and budget needs.
 Rinse through your hair with warm or cool water (the colder the better). You can choose to shampoo your hair first if you would like, but all you really need to do is to get all of your hair wet. When you’re finished wring it out, removing as much extra water as you can.
 Scoop some of the conditioner out of the container with your hands, and apply a thick coating to your entire head. Focus most of the conditioner on the ends of your hair, but feel free to spread it all the way to your roots. Be sure to separate any large chunks of hair so that each strand gets a thorough coating.
 Apply a shower cap to your head to keep your hair off your clothes/away from your face. Follow the directions for your specific conditioner, and leave it to cure. Typically, it should take between 20-30 minutes for the conditioner to work its magic. If you want an added boost, you can set your hair dryer on ‘warm’ and heat up the conditioner as it sets.
 Remove the shower cap, and turn your water on as cold as you can handle it. Spend 3-5 minutes rinsing out all of the deep conditioner, being careful not to leave any extra to set in your hair. When your hair no longer feels ‘slimy’, you’ve likely removed all of the conditioner. At this point you are free to dry and style your hair as you wish.

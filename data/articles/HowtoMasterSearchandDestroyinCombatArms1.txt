 Alpha players will try to plant the bomb while Bravo players will defend the sites. This makes some gear/weapons more suitable based on what team you are playing in. But naturally you need to practice both Alpha and Bravo playing at some point in order to become a pro at this mode.
 In this mode it's very important that you know every common camp spot and every possible hideout on the map you are playing. Therefore it might be advisable to play the maps couple of times in Elimination mode so you get to see everything on it.
 This makes it a lot easier to communicate and organize your attack/defense. Also if you are killed and there is only one team member still alive you can tell him the enemies last known location.

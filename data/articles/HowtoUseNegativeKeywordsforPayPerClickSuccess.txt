 Google AdWords provides a “negative” keyword suggestion tool with its Keyword Tool. The negative keyword function is hard to find, so you have to look for it. (PPC providers don’t want to encourage negative keywords because they make money every time someone clicks on your ad, whether it’s relevant to the search or not.);
, Your negative keywords could change every month or season. Thinking in terms of “seasons” will help you expand your positive and negative keyword lists in many ways, since people cook different things, wear different clothes, buy different products, seek different services, and consider major purchases in varying seasonal patterns.
 Don’t add negative keywords to your account without carefully considering each one. After all, if your negative keywords are too general, you might miss out on some valid Web traffic. For example, just because someone types in “cheap” doesn’t mean that person wouldn’t buy something expensive.

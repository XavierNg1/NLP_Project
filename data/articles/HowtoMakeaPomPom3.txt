 Place the tissue paper on a flat surface and make sure that all of the edges are even.









You can use less tissue paper for smaller pom poms, or more for larger, fuller pom poms., Begin folding at one end of the tissue paper pile and fold the pieces in an accordion-fold pattern. This is when you fold the piece over in one direction first and then in the opposite direction after that. Keep folding in this alternating way until you reach the end of the stack.








If you want to make a small pom pom, then cut the strip in half after you do the accordion folds. This will give you two shorter strips that you can use to make pom poms., You can cut the ends so that they are pointed or make them rounded. The look of your pom pom will be different depending on which style you choose.
 Use a piece of fishing line, a wire, or a thick piece of thread to tie a knot around the middle of the folded tissue paper. Make sure that it is long enough so that you will be able to use it for hanging the pom pom when you are done.
 However, keep in mind that a small tear will probably not be noticeable, so you do not need to start over if you tear the paper once or twice.
 When you are finished fanning out the pom pom, you can hang it up to display it. Hang it from a hook on a wall or ceiling.

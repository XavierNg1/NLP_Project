 Non-binary refers to a person who doesn't feel like a man or woman, or doesn't feel completely like one or the other. They may feel like they fluctuate between the two or instead feel like they fall somewhere in between. Agender people, who feel like they have no gender at all, may also consider themselves non-binary.;
, Many non-binary people prefer they/them/theirs pronouns. Just double check with them to make sure this is what they personally want to use.
 Do not use their birth pronouns, as this can be distressing. Call them by the pronouns that they now require. If you slip up and call them by the wrong pronouns, just apologize, correct yourself, and move on. Don't draw to much attention to the fact.
 If they choose to change their birth name to another name, respect this choice and call them by that name.
 Use gender neutral nicknames, for example "bestie", "mate", "partner" (if in a relationship), "princus/prinxe" (gender neutral for princess/prince), "auncle" (gender neutral for aunt/uncle), "datemate", "cuddle buddy", "buddy", "sweet/sweetheart", "Enbyfriend", etc.

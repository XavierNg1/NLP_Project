 Draw the person's face, with two large ovals where their eyes will be. Work loosely and give yourself plenty of space to draw.;
, The top lids will droop at the edges. Add a little arch for a sad-puppy-dog effect (as shown above). The bottom lids will move upward to show tension.
 Large irises will make a face look especially adorable and huggable. Draw the eyebrows close down to the eyes, with a very subtle u-shaped slant to them. Show crinkles between the two eyebrows if you want.
 Give the eyes a darker color, to contrast more strongly against the tears. Add a large white highlight (oval- or bean-shaped) near the top of the eyes.
 Add a darker color on top, and a lighter color on bottom. Try adding some brighter spots to make the eyes sparkle. This artist included a diagram of how the eyes were shaded, with and without the sparkles.
 First, draw a wavy line across the bottom area of the eyes. This shows tears filling up the eyes. Add curved lines for tears spilling out of the eyes and over the cheeks. The curve should match the curve of the cheek.
 For extra sadness, draw shadows between the bottom of the eyebrows and the top of the eyelids. Add a pinkish tone to the whites of the eyes if you wish to show eyes that are reddened from crying.

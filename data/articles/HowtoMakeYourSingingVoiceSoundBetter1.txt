 If you think drinking water is only good for physical fitness, newsflash: it's great for vocal health, too. Load up on the H20 to keep your vocal folds hydrated, healthy, and ready to go.


Avoid any liquids at extreme temperatures. Anything too cold and your vocal folds will tense up; too hot and they may get irritated.
If you are experiencing a tickle, warm teas or warm water with honey is fine. If you drink milk every morning, drink water after that, as dairy products coat your throat. As always, avoid alcohol. It dehydrates you and your voice.;
, Most people have a nasty habit of sucking their stomachs in and breathing just with the tops of their lungs. In order to get a strong, healthy singing voice, you must utilize the rest of your lungs and diaphragm, breathing low and deep.


This is true whether you're sitting, standing, or lying down. While standing or sitting, place a hand on your stomach and force it out with every inhale and in again with every exhale. If you are lying down, place a book on your chest and make sure it doesn't move.
 This will make your voice stronger. (If you don't know what the diaphragm is, look it up! It is a muscle just under the ribs!)

, Keep both of your feet flat on the ground and imagine a string over your head, holding your body in line. In order for air to flow easily through your system, you must maintain good posture.


If you're sitting, don't use the back of your chair and do not cross your legs. Remember: You're using all of your lungs. Slouching makes this very difficult to do.

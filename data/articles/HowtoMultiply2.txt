 Place the larger number on top of the smaller number and line up the units in the hundred's, tens', and ones' place. In the problem 187 * 54, you should line up 7 over 4, 8 over 5, and 1 over no number, since 54 has no number in the hundred's place.


Write the multiplication sign below the top number and draw a line below the bottom number. You will start multiplying the numbers below the bottom line.
 Multiply 4 * 7. Your answer is 28, so write the number 8 from the number 28 below the 4, and carry the 2 from the number 28 over on top of the 8.


Any time your answer is two digits long, carry the first digit above the number next to the top first right number, and place the second directly below the number on the second row you were using to multiply.
 First, you multiplied 4 by the number in the ones' place; now, multiply it by the number in the tenths place. Multiply 4 with 8, the digit to the left of 7. 8 x 4 = 32. Remember that you had placed a 2 over the 8. Now, add it to your answer. 32 + 2 = 34.


Place the 4 from the number 34 below the line under the 8, next to the number 8 that you wrote down in the previous step.
Carry the 3 from the number 34 over the 1 in the number 187.
 You just multiplied 4 by the number in the tenths' place; now, multiply it by the number in the hundred's place. 4 x 1 = 4. Now, add the number that you carried above one to your answer. 3 + 4 = 7. Write this number down on the line below the one.


You have used long multiplication to multiply 4 by 187 to get 748.
Note that if the top number had four or more digits, you would just repeat the process until you multiplied the number in the ones' place of the bottom number with all of the numbers in the top number, continuing to move from right to left.
 Place a zero in the ones' place of the new row below the 8 in 748. This is just a placeholder for this method to show that you are moving on to multiply the tenths' place value.
 Multiply 5 times 7 to get 35.


Write down the 5 from 35 to the left of the 0 and carry the 3 from the 35 above the 8 in the top number.
 Multiply 5 by 8 to get 40. Add the 3 above the 8 to 40 to get 43.


Write down the 3 from 43 to the left of the 5, and carry the 4 from the 43 above the 1 in the top number.
 Now, multiply 5 times 1 to get 5. Add the 4 over the 1 to 5 to get 9. Write it down next to the 3.


You have done long multiplication to multiply 5 by 187. Your answer for that portion is 9350, since the 5 was in the tens' place.
 Just do simple addition to add your two products, 748 and 9350, and you're done.


748 + 9350 = 10098

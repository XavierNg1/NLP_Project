 Lizards like to have spaces to hide. They also need places to live, to sleep, and to relax. You can attract lizards to your yard if you place natural or man-made structures in your yard.


Place rocks in your yard for shade and shelter.
Plant shrubs or leafy vegetation.
 To lure lizards to your property, you should attract what they eat. If you have a organic and an “untidy” yard or garden, you can attract bugs and moths. The more food you entice, the happier local lizards may be., Plant shrubs, grasses, and trees to create a more organic yard. Making your backyard a wild habitat will attract wild lizards and keep them happy.

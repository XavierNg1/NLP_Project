 No one wants a replica of someone else's Tech-Deck. Be creative! Have a style.;
, The logo is pointless and just drags back the style of your Tech-Deck. Your mother may say "Keep it - it's the logo!". Well, you can keep it if you want, but popular opinion is, it'll look heaps better without it. Get rid of the logo by dotting over it with a black sharpie. Let it dry before you start finger skating again.
 Take out a SHARP knife, and cut a line between the two back bolts, so you can see the plastic behind the griptape. Then, either keep it like that, or use a different coloured sharpie (orange, blue, red, anything! even black, for an emo deck!) and colour the brown rim of the Tech-Deck. Trust me. It looks way cooler. Even black.
 Make sure to take the trucks off first. Then you can get markers and draw on the bottom to customize your deck your way.
 Tech-Decks come with a yellow tool and extra wheels of various colours. To change the wheels, put the tool in the nut of the wheel and twist the tool left. Keep doing this until the nut and the wheel come out. Then, put the nut in the tool, grab a different coloured wheel, and twist that in, but turn the tool to the RIGHT. Do this until the wheel feels secure. Try to experiment! You could always change them back. Try putting a black wheel, a green wheel, a red wheel and a blue wheel. This gives your Tech-Deck the "Hard" look.
 Take out a sharpie of the colour you want, and colour the trucks Take care not to colour the wheels though! Sharpie + Wheel = BAD.
 Give your Tech-Deck a type, e.g. Hardstyle, Versatile, Flipster, etc. I have 13 Tech-Decks of different styles. Try making up your own style! And impress other people.

 Go on a social call to your friend’s house and act as if the visit is unrelated to the loaned item. Eventually get around to talking about the loaned item, or about something related to your loaned item.


A movie: “Remember that Halloween dance scene in Karate Kid?”
A tool: “My yard is a mess. I’ll have to weed eat for days.”
A clothing item: “What I really need is a black scarf to complement this outfit.”

, Note the object in the room, something close enough to be picked up. When calmly talking about the item, mention you had the same item once. Maybe even say how much you enjoyed having it.
 When you’re near your friend and see the item, say, "You know what? I think this one is mine! Did I leave it here?" Playing dumb is often a good way to be less threatening. They won’t be able to deny the truth. They’ll likely mimic your feigned ignorance.

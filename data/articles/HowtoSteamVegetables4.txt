 This does not seem like much, but it will do the job. Microwaves work quickly, giving the water little time to evaporate.


If you're working with denser, non-green vegetables, a bit more water may be needed, yes, depending on how large they are.
 Harken back to the days of TV dinners and recall the technology of the upturned corner. It is the same thing. And no, the plastic wrap won't explode in the microwave.


The other three sides should be tight, sealing in the heat. It just needs the one corner to act as a vent.
 If that does not do it, continue in 1-minute long intervals. Each vegetable is a bit different and so is each microwave -- 5 minutes is a good starting point for checking.


Yes, you are right; zapping them in the microwave is not legitimate steaming as the microwave does cook them some, too. Some of the nutrients will be lost -- but some won't.The microwave method is more about convenience and speed than anything else.
 Remove the plastic wrap, toss it in the trash, and place the vegetables on your dinner plate. Add some seasonings or sauces to taste and enjoy!


Or, eat them straight out of the bowl. We said this method was about convenience, right?

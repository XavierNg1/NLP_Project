 This method creates text with each letter of a word below the last, like a tall, narrow street sign. If you're trying to rotate the letters so you have to turn your head to read them, skip down to the other instructions.;
, A text box makes it much easier to adjust the position and orientation of text. Add it to your Word document as follows:



Word 2007 or later: On the ribbon menu above your document, click the Insert tab, then Text Box, then Draw Text Box. Click and drag in the document.Word for Mac 2011 or later: Select Home on the ribbon menu, then click Text Box on the right hand side. Click and drag in the document.

Word 2003 / Word for Mac 2008 or earlier: Select Insert â†’ Text Box from the top menu. Click and drag in the document., Click the text box and type in the text you'd like to orient vertically. If you already typed it in to the document, copy and paste it into the text box.
 A rectangular outline will appear around the text. Each corner of the box has a circle. These circles are "handles" you can pick up and drag to change the box size.
 Click and hold on any corner of the text box, then move the cursor. Drag the corner to make the text box a tall, narrow shape. Once the box becomes too narrow to display two letters side by side, they will shift on top of each other instead.


If the box is rotating, or if it's moving without changing shape, you didn't click it right. Try again and make sure to click the corner of the box.

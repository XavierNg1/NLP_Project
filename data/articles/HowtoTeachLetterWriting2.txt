 It's important to have in your mind what you expect the students to be able to do by the time you have completed teaching. Without a goal to begin with it will be impossible to know if you have taught sufficient skills by the end of the lessons.


Should the students be able to write in more than one format? Formats can be as broad as business, employment seeking, social, making complaints, official, outreach, etc.
Should they understand the basic framework of a letter? Again, this will vary dependent on the substance of the letter and to whom it is targeted.
 With a goal established it is now time to plan out the method you intend to use to teach this skill and ensure your students meet your goal. This is the step where you decide how many lessons are required and the time in those lessons that are needed to be spent on each aspect you intend to cover. Many of the following sections provide good ideas to include in your lessons. Some key things to be aware of include:


Stay focused on the goal and the topic.
Expect students to do live samples for peer and teacher review. It's probably the best way to learn, in the doing.
Don't try to cover too much at once. If you are teaching various styles of letter writing, consider shorter sessions focused on individual types of letter writing rather than cramming it all together. If you only have one set time, use breaks to signal changes between styles of letter writing rather than running them into each other.

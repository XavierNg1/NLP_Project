 Pesticides remain on the surface of a vegetable or fruit. If you are eating the whole of a fruit—as you would with a strawberry or grapes— find organic options. If the fruit has a thick outer peel that you remove before eating—such as with bananas, peaches, and pineapples— you can save your money and buy conventional fruit. Regardless of whether you buy organic or not, wash your fruits and vegetables before eating.
 Strawberries, apples, nectarines, peaches, and celery are the most pesticide-heavy of agricultural products. Limit your consumption of these products or choose organic options.
 Whole grains contain more fiber and nutrients, as opposed to the empty carbs found in processed grains like white bread. Whole grains include whole wheat bread, whole grain pasta, brown or wild rice, and bran cereal. , Chickpeas, lentils, and other legumes as well as some grains like quinoa and oatmeal are high in protein and low in fat. Other sources include nuts and soy products like tofu. Protein provides essential amino acids and repairs cell damage. , Terms like “natural” are not regulated by the FDA, which means that the ingredients in the food you buy may not be so natural after all. The best way to make sure that you are eating clean, additive-free food is to check ingredient labels. If it contains an additive which you cannot pronounce, it is a good sign that it is unnatural. You may also want to avoid dyes, MSG, aspartame, and high fructose corn syrup.

 Eyewash is a liquid solution, usually of saline, that should be used to clean eyes in case something gets into them. Some workplaces, such as laboratories, have eyewash stations or kits available for workers in case of an accident.If you work somewhere with an eyewash kit or station, make sure you know where it is so that you can find it in an emergency.
Eyewash should be at a comfortable temperature for use. It shouldn’t be too hot or too cold.
If eyewash isn’t available, clean, pure water should be used.
Flush the eye for several minutes to make sure all debris is removed.;
, If there’s a fairly large particle in the eye, lift the upper eyelid over the lashes of the lower eyelid. The person should then blink several times. The person will start to tear up and the tears should flush the eye naturally.If possible, the person with the eye injury should do this for themselves, though it’s possible they may need help, depending on the nature of the injury.
 Once the debris has been flushed out of the eye, the person should keep their eye shut as much as possible. This protects the eye from further damage. Meanwhile, get the person to a hospital or an eye doctor immediately.

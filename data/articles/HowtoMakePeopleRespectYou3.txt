 When you commit to something and then don’t follow through, people see you as unreliable. Keep your promises to others and get out of the habit of making promises that you can’t keep. Proving your dependability will garner respect from others. Be the person who can be counted on.
 Strive to always be punctual.


When you show your peers that you respect their time by being prompt, they will respond by respecting your time and you.
 In fact, it usually results in people thinking less of you and gossiping about you when you aren’t in the room.


You don’t have to like everyone, but you should always be respectful toward them.Know the difference between socializing and gossiping, and never participate in the latter.
Make an effort to avoid drama with your peers.
 Just as you should always stand up for yourself, you should also try to do the same when you see someone else being mistreated, especially if they are unable to do it for themselves. There is a time and place for this, and sometimes butting in would be inappropriate, but if it’s something that you can do, do it. Respecting someone else enough to take up for them will earn you their respect in return.


Pay attention to your surroundings and take opportunities to show empathy toward others when at all possible.
When you are able to demonstrate that you are willing to offer help when it is needed, you’re demonstrating that you care about others, which never fails to gain respect.

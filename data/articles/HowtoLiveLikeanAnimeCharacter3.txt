 A common tradition in Japanese culture, karaoke shows up frequently in anime. Find a friend with an old karaoke machine or a singing game on a game console and ask if they want to have a karaoke night. Find a local hangout that offers karaoke and sign up. Take a step out of your comfort zone and give it a try.


In Japanese culture, karaoke is often performed in a private room with friends rather than on a stage in front of strangers.
 Anime characters don’t usually sit inside staring at a TV. If you spend a lot of time inside, start going outside more. Explore the woods behind your house. Go walk around downtown and meet strangers. Book a camping trip, hike a mountain, or travel to a faraway place.


Adventures don’t have to be planned down to the minute. You could just start walking or driving and see where you end up. It’s about going into the unknown.
 Most anime character end up at an onsen, or hot spring bath, at some point in their travels. If you live in Japan, an onsen shouldn’t be hard to find. Other places may take more searching. Anything similar to a hot spring or public hot bath will work. In anime and Japanese culture, these baths often require nudity.


Outside of Japan, you may not find a traditional onsen bath, but you could visit other natural hot springs and at least have a similar experience.
 Find a local Comic-Con or anime convention and design a cosplay costume for your favorite character. Act out the character’s personality with the other people you meet. If you can’t find a convention, invite a bunch of friends over for a cosplay party and have games that incorporate the characters.


Cosplay for your next costume party or other events where you get to dress up like a character. Try out different versions of the same character if you have more than one opportunity.

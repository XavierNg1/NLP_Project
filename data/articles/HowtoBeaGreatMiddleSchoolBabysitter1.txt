 Don't take a class from a friend, or a childcare center. Though they may babysit a lot, they can't certify you.;
, Make them eye popping and make sure you include all information. Make a separate babysitting email for clients to contact you at, and check it frequently. Don't use your cell phone number or personal email.
 That way, you know the people your babysitting for.
 You want experience before you babysit for people that you don't know.


Also before starting your real babysitting jobs try a babysitting job while the parent is still in the house. Do this with someone you know, such as a friend of your parents.
 This will give you a chance to meet the parents, get a tour of the house, and get the kid(s) medical emergency form filled out (see below, and put it in your babysitting notebook if you have one).

 In the world of Goth stereotypes, you get two sorts: those who think hippies are too optimistic for their own good, and those who are hippies. A relatively abundant species, stereotypical Hippie Goths are nature-loving, follow Paganism and/or Wicca and/or misc. New Age religions, and are into candles, crystals, incense, Tarot, and anything else that can be found at the local New Age shop. The only major difference between hippies and Hippie Goths is the prevalence of black and occult symbols.
 Like their hippie cousins, Hippie Goths are quite often vegetarian or vegan, and are dedicated eco warriors or animal rights activists. When not campaigning for world peace, however, they usually know how to have a lot of fun eating and drinking excessively and romping around in fields at midnight as part of “an ancient Celtic ritual.”

, When it comes to music, Hippie Goths may be found meditating to dark folk (eg. Faith and the Muse), ethereal (eg. Cocteau Twins) and Pagan rock (eg. Inkubus Sukkubus), in addition to regular folk and New Age. Older Hippie Goths may listen to Fields of the Nephilim, The Cult and the more psychedelic end of the 80s spectrum (eg. Tones on Tail).

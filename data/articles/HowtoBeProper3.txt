 It’s completely improper to stare at a screen while speaking to someone or at the movie theater.Not only is it rude to those around you, it’s a distraction from being completely in the moment.


This also applies to all electronic devices. For example, if someone is trying to have a conversation with you, pull the headphones off or stop clicking away on the iPad for a few minutes. It will be there when you’re done.
 The proper thing to do when interrupting someone would be to say something like, “Excuse me” or “Sorry for interrupting, but…” Try not to just barge in on conversations. Think about how you would want another person to treat you.
 You might have seen something in your favorite comedy that you want to imitate for your friends, but be aware of your surroundings. It’s acceptable if you’re in a private setting, instead of the grocery store. Also, jokes are only funny if everyone laughs. Don’t try to get a laugh at someone else’s expense.


Notice the behavior of others around you as this will give you a clue as to what’s proper or not.
 Don’t forget that anything you post online is officially public. Think twice and perhaps three times before ridiculing or mocking another person.


Don't post things when you're angry. If emotional, walk away and gather your thoughts. This will ensure you offer a proper response/comment to any given situation.

 Fill the bottom of a double boiler with about two inches (five cm) of water and bring it to a boil. Open a can of sweetened condensed milk and pour the contents into the top portion.


Use a saucepan and a glass bowl if you donâ€™t have a double boiler. Half fill a small or medium saucepan with water, and set a large glass bowl inside the saucepan, making sure it doesn't touch the water (if it does, empty out some water). Make sure the glass bowl is big enough to form a seal with the saucepan.
 Place the milk over the boiling water in the double boiler and cover with a lid. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Stirring occasionally, simmer for one-and-a-half to two hours, until the milk becomes thick and reaches the desired caramel color.


Use aluminum foil to create a lid if you are using a saucepan and glass bowl.
 As it cools, whisk the dulce de leche until it is smooth and free of lumps. Allow it to cool for about 20 minutes before serving or using in a recipe.

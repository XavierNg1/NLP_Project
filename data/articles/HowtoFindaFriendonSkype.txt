 If you know them from another website or in real life, try their name or common usernames before resorting to other methods.;
, The first name may not work, since many people are hesitant to use it for privacy reasons and the name may be very common, but it's worth a shot.
 Some people may become angry if you find their account in this way, so it's better to try other methods first, but if it's publicly posted, the account owner will most likely be happy to Skype you.
 It may be embarrassing if you are shy or have a crush on someone, but if you want to talk to them and being a bit cooler about it has failed, it's a good way to know you have permission and for the other person to be prepared for a call.

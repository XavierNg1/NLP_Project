When you're done, lay a large tarp over the surrounding ground., Check the fence for any loose nails or screws. Use a hammer or similar tool to pry away loose nails and screws from the fence. These will get in the way of your painting.You should also remove any decorations from the fence at this point, and the nails or screws hanging them up. You can add new screws and nails when you finish painting.
 If there are any rough areas with splinters sticking out, sand them down. Get your fence as smooth as possible, as this will make it easier to paint.Garnet sand paper works best for sanding wood., Use a fence cleaner to wipe down your fence with a rag, spray cleaner, or a sturdy brush. Remove any dirt and debris from your fence, as well as substances like algae or lichen.Refer to your fence cleaner's instructions to figure out how much to use and whether or not you need to dilute the cleaner.

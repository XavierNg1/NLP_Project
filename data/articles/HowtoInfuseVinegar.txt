 While vinegar is a natural anti-bacterial, it is necessary to sanitize your equipment to maintain the cleanliness of your ingredients.;
, Yes, it stinks, but it is necessary to bring the vinegar to a higher temperature to avoid cracking the glass.
 Doing this will maintain the cleanliness of the infusing. Chopping the ingredients will allow juices and aromas to flow from the greater surface area and flavor the vinegar.
 After allowing the glass to cool for five minutes, place your ingredients in your jar and pour the vinegar on top. Make sure not to burn yourself from the vinegar or glass.
 Put on the lid and stow it on a shelf for 2 weeks to 2 months. For some herbs it's better to let it sit longer to get the full flavor into the infusion.
 Using a funnel or cheesecloth, pour the aged infusion into a dispenser bottle or another container. Use the cheesecloth to filter out any sediment. You may want to leave some, not all, of the spices in. Dried herbs is a good one for this.
 Mix with your favorite oil and shake it liberally onto your salad or other dish.

 Discard any tomatillos that are past their prime (yellowed, brown, split, discolored). Wash any dirt or other grime off them; you will need to be especially concerned to remove any "stickiness" on the peel., The tomatillos should only be placed in the freezer dry, not wet.
 Place the dry tomatillos across the baking sheet.It is up to you whether you freeze the tomatillos whole or sliced.,, They are now ready to be packed into small freezer bag lots.Their pre-frozen state will ensure that they do not stick together in the bags.
 It is recommended that you remove as much air as possible from the bag.Label and date so that you know when you placed them in the freezer.
 Allow to thaw and use in salsa and soup. Note that they will be a little softer in texture than prior to freezing but are still perfectly edible; just prefer recipes that require mushier tomatillos.,

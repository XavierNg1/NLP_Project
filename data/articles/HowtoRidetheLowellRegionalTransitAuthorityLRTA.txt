 If you see the bus coming or you would rather wait somewhere more convenient, you may wait along the bus route. If you do so, you will need to wave to the bus driver, signaling that you want a bus ride.;
, If you are transferring buses at the Kennedy Center, you will need to ask for a transfer. See the Tips section for transfer rules.
 The driver will not necessarily stop at a bus stop, but somewhere along the route that is safe for you to get dropped off at and exit the bus.

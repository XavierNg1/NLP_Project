 If it’s in a sheltered cove, the water should be calm and there shouldn’t be too much wind. If it’s fully exposed to the ocean, however, that could be a different story.;
, Your venue should be familiar with the tides, and should arrange your wedding so you and your guests will not float away halfway through the ceremony. It never hurts to check what time the tide starts to come in, in case you end running late.
 Make sure you have a good look at the beach and find out how private it is. It might look great in the photos but if there is a beach bar, or worse still a nudist beach right next to it, your ceremony might not be quite as serene as you imagine.
 Ideally, your venue should have direct access to the beach. If the venue is some distance from the sand but provides a shuttle to the beach, check how big the vehicle is and how long it takes; it could take a long time if a single minibus has to ferry all your guests back and forth.
 If the beach is a long way from the venue, your guests will not enjoy the ceremony if they are desperate to go to the toilet.
 Unless you are having a barbecue, a meal on the beach is going to be hard to organise, but if you want to eat on the sand you might be able to find a cater that specialises in beach wedding receptions. If you want to have the ceremony on the beach but your reception inside make sure you look for a venue that has a great view over the ocean; an ocean view terrace would be perfect.
 Ask your bridal shop if they have this variety available. Most notably, ask if the dress comes in sea colors, such as aqua, light peach, or cream to match the color of pearls or the sand.

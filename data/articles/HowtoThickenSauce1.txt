 Cornstarch is the most common to use for thickening, but you can also use potato starch, arrowroot flour, tapioca flour, or rice flour. When combined with liquids and heated, these starches swell and form a thickening gel.Flour isn’t recommended for this method because it has a strong flavor and doesn’t have the same thickening power as the other starches. Similarly, instant flour can be whisked directly into sauces without being mixed with water first, but it’s not recommended.
Starches are often used to thicken soups, gravies, fruit toppings, and savory or sweet sauces.;
, Use one tablespoon of starch for every cup of liquid you want to thicken., For every tablespoon of starch you added, add one tablespoon of cold water to the starch. Whisk until there are no lumps and the starch is fully incorporated.
 Pour the starch slurry slowly into the sauce you want to thicken, whisking constantly to incorporate the slurry into the sauce.
 To release the starch molecules, you must heat the sauce to a simmer, otherwise the starch won’t thicken.
 Since you’ve diluted the sauce by adding some water and starch, taste it again after thickening to see if you need to adjust any of the herbs or spices.

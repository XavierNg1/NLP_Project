 Don’t distance yourself from your other friends and family when you lose a friend from your life. Rather than turning help or support down, accept it, and let other people help you if they offer.If you isolate yourself after a loss, the loss will only feel worse, and have a larger impact on you. Instead, surround yourself with people and things you love.
 Mental health can have an impact on physical health. If you let yourself move into an unhealthy place emotionally, it can circle around and have an effect on your physical well-being. Fortunately, taking care of yourself physically has positive effects on your mental health. Exercising and eating well can be positive steps to take.Try to get outside for a little while each day. Go for a walk, ride a bike, or take a jog. You could even try opening the windows in your house to get a bit of fresh air.
 Pushing negative feelings away and not allowing yourself to feel them won’t really solve the problem. If you need to cry, you should let yourself cry. Or, if you feel angry, it’s okay to tell someone you’re angry. Also, if you’re feeling like you’re getting over things and feeling better, you don’t need to feel guilty for that, either.If you push feelings away and refuse to feel them, you might find that you’re stuck in the grieving process even longer than you needed to be. Feel what you need to feel.
Try writing in a journal to express your feelings. This will help you collect your thoughts in one place and be able to look back on them if you need to.
 Loss, in whatever form it takes, can take a toll on you emotionally. Counseling and therapy are great, constructive options if you find yourself struggling through your feelings.


If you are feeling especially depressed, or if you notice any changes in your normal lifestyle, like a lack of appetite or loss of interest in things you like to do, seek help. These could be signs of mental health issues that need to be addressed.

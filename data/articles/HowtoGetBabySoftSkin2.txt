 In general, a weekly exfoliation will remove dead skin cells and buff the skin back into good condition. Removal of all the dirt, oil build-up and dead cells will leave your skin feeling baby soft.


If you have sensitive skin, exfoliate bi-weekly (every fortnight) instead.
 You can either purchase one or make your own. Some homemade examples include sugar scrub and honey and sugar scrub but there are many more varieties possible.
Purchase exfoliating shower/bath gloves. Or, an exfoliating scrub sponge. If you want to make your own, see How to handcraft an organic loofah.
Run the gloves or scrub sponge up and down your legs gently to lift off dead particles and dirt. Also do your torso and back. Do this under the running water of the shower or in the bath's water.
Don't press hard; it should feel pleasant. Do not use this heavy duty scrub on your face (see above instead). Avoid scrubbing sensitive areas such as nipples and genitals.
 This is especially important for your face, as rubbing can damage delicate skin. Gently glide the towel over your body and pat dry any really wet spots.

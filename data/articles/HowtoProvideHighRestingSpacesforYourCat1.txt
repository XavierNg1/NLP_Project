 Cats usually gravitate to high places like the top of cupboards. Being up high helps to reduce stress and keep your cat calm and relaxed. Provide an open pathway to high cupboards so they are easy for your cat to access.For example, if your cat likes to climb the high cupboards in your kitchen, make sure there is no clutter on the top of the cupboards and that there is a lot of room for your cat to lie down or sit down in this area.
Make sure your cat has enough room to leap up onto the high cupboards. You can also provide steps or other flat surfaces that your cat can step on to get up to the high resting spot.;
, You can also provide high shelving for your cat to climb and rest. Set up shelving, such as book shelves, in your living room or bedroom and leave the top shelves empty so your cat can rest on them. Make sure there is an open pathway leading to the shelves so your cat can get on them easily.You can also create a rising pathway made of shelving so your cat can climb and rest on different levels. Put shelving of different sizes together to create an ascending row of shelves. Or use shelving of different sizes throughout your home so your cat has different levels it can rest on.
 Table tops are good spots for cats to rest on. Try designating one high table in your home as your cat's resting spot. Make sure there is no clutter on the table so your cat can access it easily.


You can also allow your cat to rest on the back of high couches, such as couches in your living room or bedroom.
 Stairwells and windowsills can act as great resting places for your cat. They provide different levels for your cat to climb, making them ideal high spots for resting and relaxing.Windowsills are also good options, especially if your home has wide windowsills. Keep the these areas clean and empty so your cat can rest on them as it sees fit.

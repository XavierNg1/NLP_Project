 To create a straight look with added volume you’ll need a round brush that has a mix of nylon and boar bristles. You’ll also need to make sure your blow dryer has a wide and narrow nozzle to direct the heat towards your hair. Hold your blow dryer and brush in whichever hands feel most comfortable. This is usually dictated by whether you are left-handed or right-handed. Hold your brush vertical and your blow dryer horizontal for a more modern curl.


Starting with the hair at the back of your head, position the brush at the roots and twist the brush to wrap your hair around the brush once. This creates the tension you’ll need for a smooth blow out. To get the volume you want, pull the brush upwards and back along the length of your hair, and allow the blow dryer to follow the brush.
Once you finish the back section, part a thick section of your hair above it. Divide the hair into sections and blow dry it straight following the same method as before. Continue to work your way up and around your head, making sure to brush in an upwards motion to create volume and curl.
 Your hair’s volume will be most notable at the top of your head, so you’ll want to maximize your efforts there. By working your way up and around your head, you should be left with a U-shaped section of hair. Grip the roots of your hair with your brush to create tension and guide both your brush and blow dryer in an upwards motion.
 Once you’ve straightened all of your hair, roll the top sections of your hair in your brush and blow dry it with cool air. Cooling the hair helps to preserve the volume and curl.
 You're ready to show off your new style. Now that your hair is dry and has the volume you want, you can choose whether you’d like to part your hair on the side or down the middle. It's best to wear your hair down to preserve your volume.

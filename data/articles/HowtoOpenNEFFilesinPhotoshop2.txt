, Click the "Help" menu and select "About Photoshop...". For newer camera models, you must be using Adobe Photoshop CS6 or later.


If you are using Photoshop CS5 or earlier, you'll need to convert the file. Click here for instructions.
 Click the "Help" menu and select "Updates...". Select the Photoshop Camera Raw plugin from the list and click "Update" to download the latest version.
 After updating the plugin, restart Photoshop for the changes to take effect. Try opening the NEF file again., If your camera is a brand-new model, it may not yet be supported by the Photoshop Camera Raw plugin. You can check which Nikon models are currently supported here.

 You win points by forcing the other team to miss the ball and/or hit it into the net or the ground.
 Angling your shots away from your opponents makes it harder for them to return the ball.
 An "attack shot" might be a drop shot where the ball barely drops over the net, a sharp, hard volley, or a lob.
 Lob shots are balls hit high over the net in an upside-down U shape. Because it takes longer for these balls to reach the other side of the net, lob shots can be useful for buying time.


Make sure to hit the ball deep into the court when lobbing. If you hit the ball short, the other team can easily attack the ball with a hard overhead volley.
 Call out who will return questionable shots with phrases such as "Mine!" and "I've got it!" Establish what phrases you will use before beginning the match.

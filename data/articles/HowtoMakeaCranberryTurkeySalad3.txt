 One way you can prepare the cranberry turkey salad is to spread it on toast or crackers for a quick snack. You may decide to place lettuce on the toast and then spread the salad on the leaf, or put the salad directly on crackers.You can also make a delicious cranberry turkey salad sandwich by putting lettuce and the salad between two slices of bread.
 For a gluten-free option, you can skip the bread and have the salad over a bed of mixed greens. Prepare arugula, spinach, or lettuce in a bowl. Then, spoon the cranberry turkey salad over the mixed greens and have the salad for lunch or dinner.Feel free to add other things to the salad, such as avocado, feta cheese, or more sliced almonds.
 You can also prepare cranberry turkey salad wraps, perfect for a packed lunch or eating on the go. Take tortillas or wraps and put one to two tablespoons of the salad in the center of the wrap. You may add lettuce or other mixed greens to the wrap. Then, fold the wrap up and enjoy your portable meal.

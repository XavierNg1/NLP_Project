 It may take a while for your dog to stop urinating inside after going outside. If you continue to see urine puddles in your home, do not punish your dog by rubbing its face in the urine. Not only is that form of discipline ineffective, but it will make your dog fearful of you.Your dog may think the problem is urinating in front of you, not urinating inside. Therefore, it may find secret places to urinate., Do not discipline your dog for urinating inside if you didn’t catch it in the act. If you try to discipline after the fact, your dog will not know what it’s being punished for. If you’re lucky enough to catch your dog in the act, firmly say ‘No!’ to your dog and immediately take it back outside. Praise your dog when it finishes urinating outside.Do not yell or shout at your dog.
 If your dog smells its urine in the house, it will go back to that spot and urinate. To completely remove the urine scent, use a pet-specific enzymatic cleaner that will break down the ammonia in the urine. Standard household cleaners will not get rid of the urine scent.Ammonia gives urine a very strong scent.
Keep your dog out of the area until after you clean the urine spot and the spot is fully dry.

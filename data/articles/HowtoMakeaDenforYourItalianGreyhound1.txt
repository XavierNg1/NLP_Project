, Make sure it is about twice the size of your pillowcase. If you need to, fold it in halves and/or quarters.
 Attach the corners of the pillowcase to the corners of the larger blanket.

Fold the two joined corners in half. Where it folds, fasten it together with a straight pin.
Continue doing that all the way around until the gaps between the pins is fairly small.
 You will want to have it off of the pillow for this.

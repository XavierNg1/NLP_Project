 If you don't know what direction you're facing, finding constellations can be a struggle. This can inhibit your ability to locate the North Star. Determining which direction is north can allow you to locate the North Star more easily. You can use two sticks to do so.


First, find two sticks. One stick should be slightly bigger than the other.Place the sticks in the ground vertically. Place the taller stick slightly ahead of the shorter one.Lie down in front of the sticks. Line up one eye, forming a straight line between your eye and the two sticks. Wait for a star to appear in your line of vision.Stare at the star for a few minutes and wait for it to move. It if it moves up, you're facing east. If it moves down, you're facing west. If it moves right, you're facing south. It if moves left, you're facing north., If it's daytime, you may still be able to see the North Star. However, you'll be unable to rely on constellations as they're very difficult to see during the day. Instead, you can create a shadow with sticks and use that to locate north.


Place a stick in the ground. Take a stone or other object and place it where the end of the stick's shadow falls.Wait about an hour. The shadow will move, either growing shorter or longer. Place another stick at the end of the new shadow. Then, stand at a perpendicular angle to the shadow. You are now facing north., If you're in an area where moss grows, you can use moss to help you locate north. Look for moss on vertical structures, such as trees. Moss requires a damp atmosphere to grow. This means moss usually grows on the north side of vertical structures, as the north side gets less sun.

,, Ninja Punk fashion is similar to Horror Punk fashion which means lots of black.


Leather biker jackets and leather pants are not a must, but are a perfect addition to any Ninja Punk's attire.
A black doctor mask is a must. You may have to search for this object. When acquired, you can customize it as you like. If not found, get a dark-colored bandana.
A Long black overcoat is also a must.
Dark colored jeans are appreciated more than blue ones.
Gloves/wristbands are another good addition to a Ninja Punk's attire.
Acquire lots of black t-shirts. Unless you are very muscular, avoid sleeveless shirts.
Black hair is another optional choice that will flare up your ninja style even more.
 Moving well is mandatory. Remember, you're a Ninja. A clumsy Ninja in the Feudal Era dies.
,, There are bands everywhere.
 Typically, this band will not be comprised of only Ninja Punks since at the moment, it is a small population.
,, Anarchy is about the destruction of government and social convention. Depending on the government and the social convention you can be a good or bad anarchist. You are a warrior of the night, and you listen to good music.
 For example, spraying graffiti is artistic, but illegal unless it's your own property. If you use Japanese ShutoÂ , then you're going to make holes in walls, no matter what.

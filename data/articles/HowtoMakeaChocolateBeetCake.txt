 Suggestions for the topping include:


Chocolate frosting or ganache.
Simply sprinkle over icing sugar or confectioners sugar, either in a pattern (use a paper doily or cut out a template of a beetroot for a pattern) or just generally; a few rose petals piled on top gives a nice final touch.
Drizzle over melted chocolate: milk, dark, or white.
Beet cream cheese frosting (a lovely pink shade).
Drizzle with a raspberry or other berry coulis.

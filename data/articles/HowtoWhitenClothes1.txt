Start your washer with the regular detergent






Add 3/4 cup of chlorine bleach to the water






Add the laundry

Check the labels of your items to make sure it's safe to bleach them with non-chlorine bleach






Make a solution of the non-chlorine bleach product according to the instructions on the bottle






Soak your items in the solution overnight






Wash as usual the next day






Add 1/2 cup of distilled white vinegar to the washing machine for enhanced brightening

Pour the non-chlorine bleach or peroxide on the fresh stain, completely soaking it






Let the item sit in a non-chlorine bleach/water solution overnight






Launder the item as usual the next day

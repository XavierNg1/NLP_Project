 If you just need to access Microsoft Paint but cannot locate the shortcut, you'll need to access the main file location. Regardless of your operating system, the Start icon will be in the lower left-hand corner of your screen. Click on it to open the Start menu.
 Even when you accidentally delete a shortcut, you don't actually remove the physical program from your computer; however, finding the actual file can be difficult. In this case, you'll use the Run program to access the root Paint file. In the search bar at the bottom of the Start menu, type in "Run" without the quotation marks. The top entry should say "Run" with the phrase "Desktop app" beneath it. Click on this entry to open the Run program.


Older operating systems such as Windows XP will have a shortcut to Run in the start menu; in this case, simply click on the Run icon to open the Run program.
You can also use the search function within the Start menu to locate Paint, through which you can create a shortcut by right-clicking the Paint icon and selecting "create shortcut" from the drop-down menu. , In the Run dialogue box, type in "mspaint.exe" without the quotation marks, then click on "OK" to search for Microsoft Paint. After a slight delay, this should bring up the Microsoft Paint interface.
 When you go to save your creation, consider choosing the save location as your desktop, since it allows for the easiest access.

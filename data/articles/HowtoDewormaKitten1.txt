Your vet will be able to diagnose the specific type of worm and give your kitten the proper treatment.Even if you deworm your kittens at home to begin with, you need to take them to the vet by six months old to get a fecal culture. This will check the kittens to see if there are any specific worms that have not been eliminated.;
, If you take your kitten to the vet, the vet will give you a prescription for a dewormer. The vet may also administer the dewormer for you. By taking your kitten to the vet, you know you are getting a dewormer that is approved for a kitten at the age yours is at. The form of the dewormer may depend on your cat's age.


Prescription dewormers may come in chewable tables or topical solutions. Your kitten will eat the chewable tablet. A topical solution is a liquid that must be administered directly to the skin.
 If you want to deworm your kitten at home before taking them to the vet, you can buy a commercial dewormer. Look for products containing pyrantel pamoate, which will kill round and hookworms.Over-the-counter worm preventatives and treatments may come in liquid, tablets, or topical solution. You must look at the age restrictions on the dewormer to make sure the kitten is old enough. Some dewormers are for cats six weeks and up, while others may be nine weeks and up.
A liquid solution is given orally, as are the tablets. Topical solutions are liquid solutions that are placed directly on the skin.
No dewormer will get rid of all types of worms. While a commercial dewormer will get rid of most common types of worms, your kitten may still have worms that arenâ€™t treated by the medicine. Take your cat to the vet as soon as you can to get a fecal exam, so they can be treated for the specific worms they carry.

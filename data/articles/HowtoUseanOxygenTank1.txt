 There may be a plastic sheath that fits around the top nozzle on your oxygen tank. Before you can attach the regulator to the tank, you'll have to remove it. Usually, you can simply slide the piece off or you may have to peel it away from the nozzle., The regulator will look like a cylindrical component with a gauge on it that reads the oxygen pressure. Inside of the regulator, there are two pins that will line up with the top nozzle on your tank. Position the regulator over the top valve of the tank and line up the pins to fit into the holes in your regulator., Twist the lever clockwise on the tank to tighten it around the valve. As you twist the lever, you should begin to feel it tightening around the oxygen tank. Continue twisting until the regulator is tight and the lever doesn't turn anymore., Find the small nozzle on the bottom of your regulator. This nozzle is where the air travels and you'll have to attach plastic tubing to it. Line the tubing up with the nozzle and firmly press up so that the tubing fits snugly around the regulator nozzle.

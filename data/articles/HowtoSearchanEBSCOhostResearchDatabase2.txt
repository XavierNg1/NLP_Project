 Find this beneath the search box at the top of your EBSCOhost research database.
 The Search Options choices are all the same in the Search Options boxes, but the search box at the top of the page now has more options. You may now select a field to search for multiple search terms (e.g., search the Author field for “King” and the title for “Carrie”).


You can also select the Boolean operator (“and,” “or,” “not”) before each term except the first one.
 Whether you want results to contain all of them (“and”) or any of them (OR).
 From here, it is the same as the basic search.

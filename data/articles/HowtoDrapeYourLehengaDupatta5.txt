 Pleat the corner of your dupatta first and then bring the corner over from the right side. Tuck the corner into the center of your skirt, just below your belly button.
 Do not pleat the fabric before you drape it. Allow it to be fully open and flowing over your arm. Do not pull too hard on the fabric either or it may come loose from your waistband.
 Pleat the other corner of your dupatta, but allow the rest of the fabric to stay loose and flowing. Then, bring this corner of the dupatta around your waist and tuck it into the center of your waistband in the back of your skirt.








Some loose, flowing fabric can help to add curves to straight shapes. If you have narrow hips and a small bust, then this may be a good look for you., You may tug at the fabric in front to bring it closer to your body or loosen it to make it flow more. When you are happy with the drape, pin one edge of the dupatta to your shoulder so that it will stay in place.

 To make a simple straw siphon, as a kids science experiment, or demonstration of the physics involved in siphoning, you need two bendy straws, scissors, and tape.
 Cut one of the bendy straws right before the bendy part, so that the straw is no longer a bendy straw. Cut it at an angle so that it comes to a point.
 Stick the sharp end of the straw you just cut into the end of the other straw. It should go into the end that's closest to the bend. Fit it in far enough so that it doesn't slip out.
 Tape around where the two straws are connected. Use plenty of tape, as you want the seal to be air tight.
 Place either end of the newly created double-length bendy straw into the container with liquid in it. Make sure it's in far enough that the bend is submerged in the liquid.
 Put your finger over the top of the straw. Begin lifting the straw out of the container. You'll see the liquid come up into the straw as you lift it. While keeping your finger over the end of the straw, place that end into the container you're siphoning into. Once it's in there, remove your finger. The liquid will now siphon from one container to the other.

, There must be something in life you have wished to and dreamed of doing. But you have been shy or embarrassed to do? Well, one day you will get up from the bed and you will realize that there is not time left for doing those things. Do it now!, It does not have to be serious. You could try telling your parents you love them everyday (if you live with them), or tell your boyfriend/girlfriend or husband/wife that they are a big part of your life.
 When you are dead, don't you want to have everybody remember you for all the great things you did? Maybe by helping that old lady reach the high shelf in the store, or helping that girl scout pick up her cookies, or even just being nice to your friends/family. It really does make a difference.
 Of course you probably do this already, or at least we hope so! Do not litter, be nice to animals and plants and recycle. Doing little things to help the environment can be helpful to your planet.
 This is where it starts getting good! Don't just sit around the house all day! Have a party, make lots of friends, do crazy things like sky diving! Do not be stressed out all the time, relax a little and chill!

, This is optional but be wild! Go bungee jumping, jump off a cliff into water (check if it is safe below first) or have an eating contest, you get the idea! Do whatever you want but just do not kill yourself.
 Stop. Sit down. Look at a sunset or a green field. Look at children playing and enjoying themselves. Look an old couple arm in arm walking down the street. Look at a flower. Savour the simple and beautiful things in life that are all around us. Do not take nature's wonders for granted - marvel at everything that we have on this planet earth that is our home.
 There will be ups and downs along the way. Do not worry about bad news, expect good news and hope for the best. Be an optimist and plan an enjoyable event or happening in your life in the near future, however small or token.

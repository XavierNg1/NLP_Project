,, To change music, go to step 4. To change stage laps, go to step 6.
, These are the compressed files for each stage (you can obviously see that). To change music files use WinZip, IZArc, or another unzipping program to open it. You can also right-click and select Extract all... then go through the steps to extract it. Now, you should see music files inside them in mod format. So if you wanted to make stage 4 music be stage 5 music, you would copy the file in it and paste it in stage 5 folder and rename it to "stage5.mod". Be sure to delete the original file. If you want to change it by a music that is not existing there then you can use a mod converter to convert it to mod and then rename it to stage#.mod and add it to the zip file. If it asks to replace the file then do so., If you can find the right kind of MPEG to convert a video to (the audio part of the MPEG), then you can put in your own music.
 Each stage is saved in a text file written in a special script. To edit a stage, open that stage's text file. Here is a list of the commands (note: the letters a, b, c, etc. are what you change):

, It appears near the beginning of each file.
, a is the piece type, b is the x-coordinate (from your starting point), c is the y-coordinate (from your starting point), d is the rotation (in degrees), and e tells the computer controlled cars what type of piece it is (type p for a straight piece, pr for a jump, pt for a turn, ph for a quarter pipe, etc.) The types are




0 = Tornado Shark statue
1 = Formula 7 statue
2 = Wow Caninaro statue
3 = La Vite Crab statue
4 = Nimi statue
5 = MAX Revenge statue
6 = Lead Oxide statue
8 = Radical One statue
9 = DR Monstaa statue
10 = Long, paved track
11 = Long, paved track with walls
12 = Long, paved track at an angle to the right
13 = Long, paved track at an angle to the left
14 = Paved track with a right curve
15 = Long, dirt track
16 = Long, grass track
17 = Dirt track with a right curve
18 = Long, dusty paved track
19 = Dusty paved track with a right curve
20 = Long, track going from dirt to paved
21 = Medium length track going from dirt to paved
22 = Short, track going from paved to dusty paved
23 = Short, paved track with an end facing back
24 = Short, dirt track with an end facing front
25 = Paved, track segment
26 = Medium sized, ramp
27 = Medium sized, paved ramp with walls
28 = Full, paved bump
29 = Half bump: low and high
30 = Paved bump; half
31 = Large, paved ramp
32 = Small, paved ramp
33 = Dirt "speed bump"
34 = Medium dirt ramp
35 = Small dirt ramp
36 = Paved Quarter-pipe
37 = Spikes
38 = Fake Checkpoint(Hurdle)
39 = Fake track border segment
40 = Blue Checkpoint
41 = Fixing Loop
42 = Black Checkpoint



, Works the same way as set.
fix(a,b,c,d,e)x- creates an electrified hoop. Same as for set and chk, except that d is the height(it has to be negative) and e is the rotation.
 A #10 straight is 2400 wide by 5600 high. A #14 turn is 4200 by 4200 (discovered by trial and error). Alternatively you can divide the coordinate system by 800 in planning and use 2x7 and 4x4 respectively.

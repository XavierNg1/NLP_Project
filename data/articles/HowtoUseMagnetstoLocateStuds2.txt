 The strongest readily available magnets are neodymium magnets, also known as rare earth magnets. You can use any size of magnet, but a small one will work fine (say 1 cm / 0.4 inches).
 Place the magnet inside heat shrink tubing of the appropriate diameter. One flat surface of the magnet should be visible. This gives the magnet a flexible wrapper, making it easy to manipulate.
 Heat the heat shrink tubing until it holds the magnet securely in place.
 Take the inner components out of an old, pen. Place the heat shrink tubing inside the pen, with the magnet poking out at one end. Hot glue it in place. The pen case will give you greater control over the magnet's position, and reduce the effect your hand has on the magnet's response.


Test the pen case first to make sure it does not repel or attract the magnet.
 Hold the pen very lightly, such that the tip is free to move. Now test it out against a wall. Move vertically, then horizontally to find the stud. Once you find a stud, mark the wall with a regular pen to note its position.

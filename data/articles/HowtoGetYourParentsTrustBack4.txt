 If you violated your parents’ trust by lying to them, particularly if you have had a history of lying, then you need to make a practice of being completely honest all of the time. Demonstrating a commitment to complete honesty will enable you to rebuild trust. Unfortunately, this may take a long time.
 If the nature of your trust violation involved breaking a specific rule that your parents have set, such as no underage drinking or being home by a certain time, communicate with your parents about the house rules.


It’s important that you understand what the rules are, why the rules are in place, and how to follow them.
An open dialogue with your parents about these can help you make better decisions in the future.
 If you have hurt someone, you should make reparations. If you have hurt your parents by doing something that disappoints them or makes them sad, then try to understand their emotions.


Putting yourself in their shoes and thinking about how you would want someone to apologize to you can help you know what will heal the wounds.
 If your transgression involved damage to property—for example, if you wrecked a car or vandalized public property—you need to do what you can to repair the damage. This may mean doing what you can yourself—painting over spray-painted graffiti, hammering out a dented car panel, or cleaning toilet paper out of trees. However, it may also mean offering to pay for the cost of repairs, as with a car accident.
 If you have done something that has cost someone else money, you should offer to compensate the injured party financially. Even if this means giving up your entire paycheck for several weeks, accepting financial responsibility can go a long way towards showing that you understand the consequences of your actions.

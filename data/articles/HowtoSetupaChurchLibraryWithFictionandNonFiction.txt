;
, Have a written letter that details what you are proposing so that it is easy to talk through the points or to add onto your ideas. Consider the following: who will you loan books to (the community or just the congregation), how long will you loan books out for, creating a committee to decide on which books should be included, when should books be taken out of the collection, how will the books be arranged (e.g. alphabetically: by author or by title or by subjects), will any resources be allocated to running the library (purchasing materials or books or computers).
 Try to keep a running total of the number of materials checked out and how many people visit to show how useful the library is to your community.
, Make sure that this area is well ventilated and not a humid space. Also make sure that this area is accessible for all of your members.
 Focus on authors that would fit your congregation or mission statement best. Then begin making a list of books which you plan to have at the library.
, Using a 4 X 9.5 inch envelope sealed shut and then cut in half will hold an index card.
 These index cards (since they hold up better than just paper) will help you keep track of when and how often the book is loaned out. These cards should list the title of the book and then below the due date and who it was loaned to. The due date should also be stamped on the library card holder in to book itself.

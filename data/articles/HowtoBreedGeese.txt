 Theoretically, you could have them locked up in small cages and let out only for a daily mating session, but that is pretty cruel. Unless you are starting your own commercial down and feather producing company for a pillow manufacturer, there really is no need for this kind of setup. The following are some required features for breeding geese:


Water Source. Depending upon the quantity of geese you plan on breeding, you need a substantial source of water for them to swim and enjoy. This also provides them a natural food source.
Shelter. During the harsh weather seasons, you will need a small shelter source for each breeding pair for both safety and comfort. They should be cozy with plenty of straw and soft material for bedding.
Predator Protection. Make sure your entire breeding land is surrounded by a fence of some sort to help keep the predators out and your geese safe. These birds are your investment after all; take the necessary steps to protect them.;
, Most species of geese are ready to breed at about a year of age. If you can get goslings for cheaper and can wait it out, they will be used to their new home by then and you will maximize their productive breeding years. The females, or breeders, are productive from 1 -10 years of age. The male, or gander, is good for only 1 - 6 years of age.
 These should be segregated from the rest of the community if you plan on having such a diverse population. If you are planning on having but a single or a couple of species that are not like this, you should not have to worry too much about keeping them separated to be productive.
 For the smaller, lighter birds, you can increase this ratio to one gander for every five geese or so. Depending upon the space you have, you might be able to adjust these ratios to get more birds; however, be always vigilant about overcrowding, which can rapidly spread disease and decimate your investment.

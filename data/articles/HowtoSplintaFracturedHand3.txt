 Make sure the injured hand rests comfortably and straight with fingers bent slightly around the end of the splint, as detailed above.


Place cotton pieces or gauze between each finger.
 Use four layers of cotton gauze or padding, starting around the hand and winding up the arm at least half-way to the elbow. Padding is important because it helps protect the hand and forearm from the heat of the plaster and keeps the cast splint from rubbing uncomfortably against the skin.


As described in the previous section, do not wrap the splint to tightly against the injury. The splint should be held in place just enough to be secure and to provide adequate support.Check the capillary refill of the fingers before you commit to the plaster of Paris.
 Use roughly 12 layers of plaster of Paris that are the right width for the extremity. Cut the strips if necessary. Dip them in warm water and squeeze out the excess water. The plaster must be damp but not sopping wet. Wrap the strips around the gauze padding until the entire padded area is covered.Make sure the water is only lukewarm. Plaster of Paris will warm up as it sets, and you'll risk burning the patient's skin if the strips are dipped in hot water to start.
You can also use fiberglass for the outer layer, which dries more quickly than plaster but is more expensive. Fiberglass is applied in the same way as the plaster of Paris strips. However, only a doctor should apply fiberglass to a cast, as a doctor should assess the injury and make sure it is set properly.
 Maintain the desired position of the splint and hand for several minutes to allow the cast splint to harden and adequately dry.


Plaster can take more than a half hour to set, whereas fiberglass dries in 15 to 30 minutes.

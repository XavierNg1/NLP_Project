 The shotgun seems like a simple weapon, but it is hard to get a precise hit unless your assailant is charging straight toward you. Make sure that you get very close in before even thinking about using this.
 The sniper, by far, is probably the greatest weapon in the game. It is long and short range if you learn to use it right. It is also an EXCELLENT weapon to wield with the shotgun. The shotgun can take out people who try to sneak behind you and melee you. That's when you turn around and point blank them. Also with the sniper you have the option to snipe anywhere on many maps, such as blood gulch, boarding action, or infinity.

 The change-up is a slower pitch that throws batters off-guard when expecting another fast-ball. Hold the ball completely in your palm, letting your each finger rest on the laces, and skip the finger snap when following through, instead leaving your hand open.


This is often the first special pitch you should learn after the fastball.
 The aim of the pitch is to make the ball sink on the batter. Grip the ball with your fingers aligned with the laces, instead of across them like you would on a fastball. Keeping your elbow a little more rigid than normal, flick your wrist and follow through like as if you were throwing a basic pitch.
 You need the same grip as a drop pitch -- fingers aligned with the laces, not across. Curveballs move down and sideways, making them tricky for a batter to track and hit. Your throwing motion is nearly the exact same as a fastball, but you twist your wrist (counter-clockwise for righties, clockwise for lefties) as you release the ball. This causes the ball to spin sideways as it travels., The hardest pitch to throw, this ball will come up towards the batter, making it incredibly hard to hit. The goal is a pitch that has top-spin so that the bottom of the ball rotates towards the top. To throw it:


Put your middle and ring finger in between the laces, at the point where they start to come towards each other.
Dig the tip of your index finger into the side of the ball.
Begin your normal fastball motion, but keep your palm facing down as you come around behind your back.
As you release, quickly turn your hand so that your palm faces up, as if you were turning a doorknob.
Release the ball early so that it has time to rise.
Remember that this is the hardest pitch to throw, and may take upwards of a year to perfect.

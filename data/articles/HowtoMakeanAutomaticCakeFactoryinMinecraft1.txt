 This is optional, but it can help give you a good sense of where everything will go. Using graph paper is recommended, since one square on the graph paper can resemble four Minecraft blocks. So, say your wheat farm is made of 20 squares on the graph paper, the room is 80 blocks in Minecraft.;
, Include things like redstone mechanics, important features, materials, etc. Having a list helps you stay on task and prevents you from overdoing it. It also helps you since you can make connections between rooms and lists, like the storage minecart from the egg farm leads to the ingredient room.
 Obviously, it will take more than a real day to build this cake factory with all the features and redstone. Plan out what you will do each day to reduce stress. Day 1 could be marking out the perimeter of the entire building and each room, day 2 could be building up these walls, and so on.
 For instance, if you plan on making a redstone timer to when you harvest all of your wheat, research how long it takes for wheat to grow in a bright, moist environment. For redstone components, look them up on YouTube and take notes on the videos.

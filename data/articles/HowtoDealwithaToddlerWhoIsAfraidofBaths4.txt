 Praise can go a long way, even for as mundane a task as taking a bath. Tell her that she was brave and was so grown up during the bath. Your toddler will be proud of herself and, with a routine in place, will be much happier to take a bath next time.
 Make sure that she doesn’t slip while she is trying to get out of the tub. Continue to praise her while you dry her off and then tell her what is going to happen next (be it some playtime, dinner, or bedtime).
 When your child explains what worries her, work around that worry. Don’t judge your child for the worry, even if it silly; instead show support and demonstrate that you understand her feelings.


Make her understand that you will always be there to guide her during bathtime until she’s ready to bathe on her own

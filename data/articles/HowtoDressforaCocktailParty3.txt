For warmer months, wear a light-colored lightweight jacket like linen. Pairing it with a knit tie mixes interesting textures without weighing down the attire.For cooler months, wear a nice V-neck sweater or sweater vest with a tie.
 Oxfords are the most popular and versatile shoes to wear to dressy events.Dark brown, black, and navy are all safe colors, but be sure to complement your clothing.


Loafers are an acceptable option, but they tend to appear less formal than Oxfords, Brogues, or other heeled shoes with laces.
 Pocket squares are an effective way to add a pop of color.If you wear a tie, ensure that these two items complement each other in style and color.


Wear socks that match your trousers and that are long enough to cover your calves when you sit.Easily stand out without showing off with small details like a set of cufflinks or a nice watch.

 Self-massage techniques can help to trigger digestion and relax muscle cramps. Try the following:


In the morning, massage your tongue and gums using the back of your toothbrush or finger. This prepares the upper part of the digestive tract.
In the evening, massage the lower abdominal area. Lie flat in bed with your knees bent. Feel the regions where you feel discomfort then apply gentle pressure.
Apply detoxifying oils like chamomile for an additional soothing effect.
 It’s impossible to completely eradicate stress from your life. However, effective coping skills can help a lot, especially in preventing the onset of IBS symptoms.


First, identify what causes the tension and stress. Listing your issues and doing a self-assessment to identify the root cause may help to solve the problem. Maintain a strong support network who you can discuss your issues and concerns with.
If you are finding your stress levels overwhelming, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or doctor.

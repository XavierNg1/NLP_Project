 If it’s been a long time since you have sized up your jeans, you should get an accurate waist and inseam measurement. If the store doesn’t do it, find an old pair of pants that fits well, then buy a fabric measuring tape and measure the 2 areas yourself.


The waist measurement is the circumference of the waistband. On your body, it is generally the circumference at the widest point above your hipbones.
The inseam is the measure from the top of the groin along the inside of the leg to the ankle hem.
 Avoid a general size so that you can get exactly the fit you need. Some men’s jeans are sized by waist measurements only. In this case the inseam is often around 30 or 32 inches (76 or 81 cm).
 If it fits snugly on your butt without drooping, you have a fairly good fit. , Sit down and see if it pinches. If it does, get a size with a larger inseam.
 However, remember, you can always get the length tailored, as long as the fit in the waist, inseam and butt is right.
 A true blue jean is usually a sign of sturdier fabric and more durable dye. It is also flattering to most body types.
 They can make a good pair of jeans look unusual, creating the look of a bad fit, even if you have found the right one. Focus on distressing a pair of jeans yourself with repeated wear.
 If they don’t, find a tailor in your local phone book. Ensure you get fitted for tailoring with the shoes you normally wear.

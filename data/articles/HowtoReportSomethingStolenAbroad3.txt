 You might have travel insurance policy or a valuable items insurance policy. Take out the policy and read to see if your stolen valuables are covered.


For example, a valuable items insurance policy typically only covers items you have listed on the policy.If you acquired property while on holiday, they may be partially covered for a limited amount of time.
Also research how much you can get back from the insurance company. Many travel insurance policies only allow you to get back a few hundred dollars., Insurers can be quite picky about details when you file a claim. Accordingly, get all required information lined up before contacting them. Gather the following:


copy of the police report
foreign currency exchange receipt, if money was stolenreceipt or other proof you own the item

, Each insurer has different deadlines for reporting the loss. Read your policy to find out. However, you should call as soon as reasonably possible, even if you are still on your trip.When you call, explain your loss to the insurance investigator. You may also need to complete a written Proof of Loss report., Read your policy to find out which method your insurer will use to calculate your reimbursement. For example, some items will have an agreed-upon value as stated in your insurance policy.Alternately, the insurer might reimburse you the amount to replace your property with a substantially identical item.
The insurer might also choose to give you the actual cash value of the property.

 Every time your credit is reviewed by a bank, lender, credit card company, or employer, it is considered an inquiry on your credit report. Too many credit applications can lower your credit score. Applying for too many credit cards, for example, can hurt your chances of your application getting accepted.Apply for one credit card at a time. Do not fill out 2 or 3 applications as a back up just in case your first application is denied.Shop around for credit cards only when you need to and without filling out multiple applications.
Do not shop for a credit card if you are also applying for a car loan or mortgage.
 Knowing your credit card score can help you apply for a realistic card and limit the number of applications you fill out. A FICO credit score ranges from 300-850.If you have a 320 score, you should not apply for a platinum, top tier card. Instead you would apply for a card that caters to people who are trying to rebuild or build credit.If you have a high credit score (usually 720+), you can apply to any card that you want.
If you have a low credit score, try applying for secured credit cards.
 Review your credit card debt and loans (e.g. personal, school, auto, etc.) before you apply. Also think about your work history and payment history. If you identify an area that needs improvement, work on that before you apply.Avoid taking any cash advances or going over your credit limit when you seeking to apply.
Establish a history of timely payments for all of your debt.

 One of the best ways to get tips about motivated sellers is to form a relationship with other real estate professionals. It's often the case that news about pre-foreclosures and motivated sellers will circulate within an online network of real estate investors.


You can find online groups by simply searching for "real estate" on the relevant social media website. Be sure to find groups specific to the area where you want to invest in real estate.
Don't forget the LinkedIn is a social network and offers a great way to network with real estate professionals. LinkedIn also has groups for specific interests, such as real estate investing.
Visit the Meetup website and search for "real estate" in your area to find a group of like-minded real estate investors.Meetup is a great combination of old school and new school networking because you find fellow investors online but also meet them in person.;
, Craigslist is the classified ads section of cyberspace in the Information Age. It's a great place to advertise to the world that you're willing to buy houses and close quickly. Run an "I Buy Houses!" ad consistently on Craigslist and motivated sellers may start to contact you.Remember, Craigslist is regional. If you're prepared to make an investment in properties in different locations, you'll need to run a Craigslist ad for each area.
 You can search online for pre-foreclosures in your area using the Multiple Listing Service (MLS).You should find some very motivated property owners among the pre-foreclosures in your area.


Even if you find a pre-foreclosure property owner who's motivated to sell, you might find that you'll need to opt for a short sale.That's when the existing homeowner has to sell the property for less than the amount owed on the mortgage. Since short sales require lender approval, it can take months to close on the deal.

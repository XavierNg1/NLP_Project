 Check to see if your bank features a mobile deposit app for your tablet or smart phone. Chase, Bank of America, and Citibank and other banks have developed apps for mobile devices that make depositing a check as simple as taking a picture. If one is available, download it onto your phone or mobile device.
 You should be taken to a screen with options marked "Front of Check" and "Back of Check." Use these to photograph the front and back of your endorsed check, respectively.
 Fill in the amount of the check using the app, and check to make sure all the information is correct on the confirmation screen. If it is, click "Deposit this Check."


You can elect to receive email or text confirmation when the check is deposited.

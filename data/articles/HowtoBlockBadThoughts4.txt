 Having social support can help people be able to cope with negative thoughts.Ask friends, family, significant others, teachers, colleagues, or other trusted individuals for support or help dealing with your negative thoughts.
Get another opinion. If you find yourself unable to change your negative thinking – ask others to help come up with alternative ways of thinking. You might be surprised at how helpful it can be.
 If you’re constantly around people who complain and find the worst in a situation, you’ll have a tendency to think like that, too. Cut the negative influences from your life, and spend your time with people who put you in a positive frame of mind. When bad thoughts aren’t part of your regular conversations, they won’t be a regular part of your thinking habits either.
 If bad thoughts are interfering with your ability to live your life happily, and nothing you do on your own seems to be making a difference, then you may benefit from seeking help from a licensed professional (therapist or psychologist). Therapists will be able to help you work through your bad thoughts in a structured, safe way.


Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a treatment approach that focuses specifically on changing negative thinking in order to improve emotions and behaviors. This is exactly the type of treatment that can help you learn to deal with bad thoughts. CBT has also been shown to help many different mental health issues such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Ask your therapist if she can use CBT in your treatment.
Remember that therapy is not a quick fix. A handful of appointments with a therapist will not make bad thoughts go away.
Be patient and stick with your therapist and your treatment plan to help you deal with bad thoughts more constructively.

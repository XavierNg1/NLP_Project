 Unless you plan to mail off your clothes to an online-only donation organization, it’s best to stick with local donation centers. This will make it easier to transport the clothing.

To find a local spot, type “donation centers near me” or “donation centers in Seattle” into your favorite search engine.;
, Most cities and even smaller towns have Goodwills. Goodwill is an excellent option for donation. They’ll accept all your items, and they put most of their profits back into job-training and employment programs for struggling workers in the United States., You can also find Salvation Army in most cities and towns in the United States. They may be best for families with really large donations, as they can pick up your clothes from your home., If you have homeless shelters in your area, give them a call. This may be a great way to get your clothing to people who need it most, right away. Call before dropping clothes off, however, as there may better times for the shelter to handle drop-offs.You should also call shelters for women and children who are victims of abuse, especially if you have professional women or children’s clothing.
 If you belong to a religious organization, they’re likely involved in a running donation program. Check to see if they accept clothing, and when you can drop it off., If you have prom and wedding dresses, tuxedos, and older professional clothing lying around your closet, look for specialized organizations online. There are lots of foundations that are dedicated to collecting just one type of clothing, so that people can then buy those items from them online.For prom dresses, try Fairy Godmothers Inc.

For professional clothing, use Dress for Success (for women) or Career Gear.

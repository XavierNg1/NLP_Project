 Whether the rape was committed by a stranger or by someone you know, get away from him or her as quickly as you can and make sure he or she does not know where you are going.


Remember that the assault is NEVER the survivor/victim's fault. The only person who can prevent an assault is the perpetrator.;

Do not shower, bathe, wash your hands, or brush your teeth. If you have to use the bathroom, try to hold it in. You could destroy important evidence by doing any of these.
Do not change your clothing.
Do not straighten out your house, or the place where the rape occurred.
 A volunteer can take you to the hospital.
 Medical personnel will collect stained clothing, skin under fingernails, hair, and semen (rape kit). These will be important if you decide to press charges. You will also receive drugs to prevent pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted disease at your discretion.


Depending on locality, medical personnel may contact the police. Remember in most states, reporting a sexual assault does not force you to press charges or appear in court. You can still contact the police after time has passed. You can file a report after a day, a month, and even a year. However delays make it more difficult for the police to obtain enough evidence to get a conviction.
 Allow family and friends to give you support and help you. Don't keep it to yourself. It is not something you should go through alone.
 Victims of violent crimes may suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and counseling will help.
 There is nothing to be ashamed about. Don't think that it was your fault: no one has the right to rape someone else.

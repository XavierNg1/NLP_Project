 Sometimes you'll feel ready for a test but realize, too late, that you're not as prepared as you thought. If this happens frequently, you may not be studying correctly or studying enough. Revise thoroughly, but make sure you do other things too. If you revise for too long you will become unfocused, so make sure you take regular breaks! Check out the related wikiHows for help.;

 A little brisk exercise will help you remain calm during any stressful situation. If your teacher will allow you to leave the room during the test, run up and down the hall or do some jumping jacks if you start feeling overwhelmed.

 Take in each word as slowly as you can, making sure your brain understands the meaning of it and what you're expected to do. Take deep breaths and play a soft song in your head, or words of encouragement. Start thinking very carefully about what's right and what's not. Then, as slowly as you can, decide on the answer or write out the answer once you're sure. Doing things slowly and carefully will be a better chance of getting the answer right, which relaxes you because you know that you have a higher chance.
 Don't spend too much time on any one question. If you get stuck, skip the question and move on. Don't get too stressed if you can't answer a question.

 Don't panic if you notice other students writing very quickly or handing in their tests early. Mind the time, and try to work at a steady rate, but otherwise don't worry about speed. It is not a race.

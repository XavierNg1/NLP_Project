 There are plenty of possibilities, including thyme butter, basil butter, rosemary butter and herb butter.
 Place this inside a freezer-proof container with a lid. Label and date the container.


You can freeze little portions (easiest to thaw), a butter roll or a whole block of herb butter. Do whichever works best for your cooking and storage needs.
 Herb butter will keep for up to 12 months.You can either slice off a piece of the frozen butter and allow just that piece to thaw, or thaw the whole portion, depending on your needs. Thaw in the refrigerator and once it has thawed, keep it covered in the refrigerator and use within 2 to 3 days.

 Almost every lake in America has been mapped out and you could take great advantage of this, especially if you have never fished that lake before. Find topographic maps that will show contour lines. Also satellite image maps help tremendously with learning the lake; you can even buy maps that download right to you GPS on your boat!
, Don't be afraid to ask other fishermen what they use and where they like to go (preferably not someone you will be fishing against). If you take a map into a bait shop, the people there are often willing to show you on the map where and how they had caught fish in the past. These areas will be great starting points for practice., Just take your maps and the information you have collected from other fishermen from the area and put it all together on the lake. During this time don't forget to make way points and follow your sonar to look for structure, road beds, creek channels, humps, and ledges. Even if these were not mentioned by others, they are still key places to find bass., As any bass angler knows getting on a pattern early in the tournament is key. That's why you are here practicing, to see if we can figure out what the fish want and where they are located. If you can put it all together, you will be a top competitor!

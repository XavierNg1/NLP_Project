 These parts keep the parts of the stove moving and circulating air and heat. It is possible to remove these parts by taking out the gaskets in order to vacuum loose ash, but at the very least some pellet stoves benefit from lubrication. Find the oil ports on the parts and apply no more than a couple of drops of all purpose or sewing machine oil., Take a dollar bill or piece of paper and stick it halfway into the fire chamber door. Close the door and pull on the paper. There should be a little resistance. Repeat this around the rest of the door and the ash pan and hopper doors if your stove has them. If the door becomes too loose or too tight, you’ll need to undo and replace the gaskets before they ruin the door’s seal.To remove the gasket, take off the door and lay it on a soft surface. Pull out the gasket, clean the groove with a wire brush, then replace the gasket with cement.
Check online or at a pellet stove retailer for replacement gaskets.
 The glass on the fire chamber should not break. It may etch, brown, or get scratched during cleaning, so you may replace it to view the fire clearly. Loosen the fasteners, take out the old glass, and replace it with new glass. Tighten the fasteners only a little in order to allow the glass space to expand during heating.


Stove glass is expensive. You’ll have to get it from a glass dealer.
 Switches that control the heat and pellet feeding are inside the stove. If your stove doesn’t shut off at the right time or feed pellets, replace the heat temperature and pressure-sensing switches. Unscrew the switches and disconnect them from the wires. Take the switches to a pellet stove supplier and have them give you an exact match as a replacement. Rewire the switches and secure them with screws.

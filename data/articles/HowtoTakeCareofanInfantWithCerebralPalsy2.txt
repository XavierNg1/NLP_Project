Hold your infant and cuddle him. Do your best to calm and sooth him when he is fidgety. Some infants with CP are happier in a swing or crib during fussy periods.
Talk, sing and play with your infant. Regardless of the possibility of CP, these activities are very important in the development of any infant.
 It is common for CP infants to experience feeding problems, so it's important to monitor your baby's weight gain.
 If your infant cannot support his head or sit during bath time, be sure to use a baby seat with a slight slope. Get one that will support his head and back during the bath.



There is always the risk of your CP infant having a seizure. Make certain he is safe and cannot harm himself during a seizure. Remain with him until the seizure is over. Knowing how to deal with seizures is a vital part of your infant's care.
 As your infant begins eating solid food, she may be more prone to swallowing difficulties, making choking more of a concern.
 Special vitamin supplements can help fight colds and other respiratory infections. An infant with CP is more prone to infection and may have a suppressed immune system.

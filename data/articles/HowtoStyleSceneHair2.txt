 You don't have to dye your hair to make it scene, but it's a fun way to express your style. In this section, you'll see some suggestions on where to add dye to your hair; for information on the process itself, see the Related wikiHows at the bottom of the page.
 Dyeing the tips of your hair along a straight line is called "dipping" (because some people actually do dip-dyes). This is a low-risk way to add color to your hair, because if you don't like it, you can always cut it off instead of having to wait for it to grow out. Try doing it in a color that's opposite the rest of your hair (blond tips if you have dark hair, or dark tips if you have light hair), or in a bright color such as blue or purple.
 Select streaks of your hair to dye a color that contrasts with the rest of your hair. You can do streaks in one color, or in several colors, and make them narrow or wide.


If you work or go to school somewhere that doesn't allow you to have dyed hair, streaks might be a good choice. You can place them strategically, so that they won't show up when you put your hair into a ponytail.
 A popular scene look is dyeing an entire section of your hair a different color than the rest of it; for example, making your bangs and front layers blond, and keeping the rest of your hair black. For something a little more subtle, you could dye the underside of your hair a bright color, and keep the rest of it a more natural shade.
 If you want to go all-out, you can dye your entire head of hair a bright color. Note that most unnatural colors are semi-permanent, so you'll have to re-dye regularly to keep the look up.


Black hair is good for any length, on any gender.
Try red, blonde or black if you don't want to be too outstanding.
 Try wearing a shirt that's the same color as what you're interested in. If it seems to go well with your skin tone and eyes, it will probably look good in your hair. If it makes you look washed-out and tired, try something else.

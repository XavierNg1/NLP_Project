 1-inch (2.5 cm) chunks are ideal, but anything small and manageable will do. Ripe mango is full of moisture and doesn't need much effort to blend apart.









If the mango resists cutting at all, it's not ripe. It should be soft and a vibrant orange. The taste changes remarkably as it ripens and you need the sweetness to make a great smoothie.
 Then, pile in the mango. If you don't have lime juice available, substitute lemon or orange juice.
 Add more sugar to taste, if desired. Keep chilled -- if there is any extra leftover!

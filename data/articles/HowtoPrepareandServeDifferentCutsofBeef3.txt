 Only 30% of fat per weight maybe allowed in either ground beef or hamburger. Anything above 30% fat per weight would be considered adulterated beef. Most ground beef is ground and packaged in local stores rather than in food processing plants under USDA inspection. Even so, the federal labeling laws on fat content apply. Most states and cities set standards for store-packaged ground beef which, by law, cannot be less than federal standards. If products in retail stores were found to contain more than 30% fat by weight, they would be considered "adulterated" under federal law.



All hamburger should be cooked to 160 °F (71 °C) due to possible contamination from bacteria. "Any food of animal origin can harbor bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, cause illness. These harmful bacteria can not be seen or smelled," according to the USDA Focus on Ground Beef Fact Sheet.
Scrub all surfaces that have come in contact with the raw ground meat. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling the meat.

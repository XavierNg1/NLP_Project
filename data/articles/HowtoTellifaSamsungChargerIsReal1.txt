 In general, verified Samsung chargers don't have any rough plastic edges, unsightly print, or crooked/dented USB inputs or outputs.


You can also usually tell if a charger is real by attempting to charge your phone. Fake chargers take much longer than the Samsung-standard 30 minutes to charge your phone to 50 percent, and they often heat up quickly.;

UL stands for Underwriters Laboratories, which is a safety organization tasked with maintaining safety standards for all marketplace technology. If your charger doesn't have a UL logo, you shouldn't use it.

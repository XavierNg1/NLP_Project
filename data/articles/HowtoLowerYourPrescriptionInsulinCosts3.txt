 Even though insulin can be very expensive, not taking your insulin is not a good way to cut back on your expenses. Not only can it put your life in danger, it could make you very sick and increase your medical costs in the long run. Completely stopping your insulin may result in a life-threatening emergency, especially for type 1 diabetics, since their bodies do not produce any insulin on their own. A type 2 diabetic may be able to decrease or stop insulin through diet and exercise, but should only do so under the direction of a doctor., It may be tempting to just skip an injection of insulin if you are having difficulty paying for it. However, skipping treatment for your diabetes can increase the speed at which the negative symptoms of diabetes occur. This means that you could begin to have problems with your heart, feet, kidneys, or eyes sooner than if you took your insulin as prescribed.Having to deal with the negative side effects of diabetes will cost you more, both in terms of money and quality of life, in the long run than taking your insulin regularly.
If you skip doses of your insulin it can cause dangerous complications , such as damage to your eyes, heart, blood vessels, nervous system, mouth, feet, and kidneys., It may be tempting to buy insulin from suppliers that offer extremely low prices online. However, if you do not know the source, you should avoid buying these products. These offers could be scams or they could send you medications that are not good quality products.


There are a lot of online suppliers that sell secondhand diabetes supplies, such as testing strips. These products will be cheaper for you to buy but the integrity and quality of the product may be less than perfect.There are a few insulin products available over-the-counter from reputable pharmacies. Keep in mind, changing insulin types or taking insulin without being under the care of a doctor can be unsafe and may cost you more in medical costs over time.

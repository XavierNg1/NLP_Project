,


If the Menu toolbar is hidden, click on orange Firefox button and select Add-ons from the drop down list.
Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+⇧ Shift+A to open Add-ons in a new window or tab.
All three sequences produce the same result: A new "Add-ons" tab or new "Add-ons" window (depending on the preferences you have set).
 This will display the Plugin Options drop down menu.
 Mozilla Firefox will then check online to see if there are new versions of any of your active plugins.


If there are any new versions found, Firefox will prompt you to update your plugins.

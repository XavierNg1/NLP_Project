 Torx screws have a star-shaped pattern on the head and are very popular screws for all purposes. Security torx screws will have a nub in the middle of the screw head that needs to be accounted for.


Torx screws can be easy to damage so be very careful when using an alternative tool to unscrew these screws.
 Insert the flat head screwdriver between two opposite edges of the screw head. Turn counterclockwise to remove the screw. Make sure you turn slowly so as not to damage the head.


For security torx screws you will need to insert the flat head in against one of the outer grooves and the center nub of the head. This works much the same as non-security torx screws.
Security torx screws will usually turn the opposite direction, so you should turn clockwise to remove them.
 If you have a normal torx screwdriver but not a security version then you can simply remove the center pin out of the screw head. Take a hammer and a punch or other chisel-like tool and line up the chisel at the bottom of the pin. Gently tap on the top of the chisel to remove the center pin., If you have a security torx screw and wish to remove using a non-security torx driver or drill bit then you can drill a small hole in the drill bit. This way it has a small hole to accommodate the center pin on your security torx screw.
 Take a plastic toothbrush and lightly melt the end using a lighter or other source of heat. Once the plastic is soft you can insert it in the head of the screw and allow the plastic to harden once more. Once it is hard try to turn the screw counterclockwise to unscrew it.

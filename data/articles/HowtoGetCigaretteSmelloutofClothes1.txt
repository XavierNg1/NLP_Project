If you canâ€™t fill your washer with water and pre-soak -- if you have a front loader, for example -- use a large wash basin, sink, tub, etc., then transfer the items for wash. Or, just add the vinegar and baking soda to the wash cycle with the clothes (use a pre-soak setting if your washer has one).
 Smell the clothes after the wash cycle is done. If they still stink, repeat the process.

 Purchase 10 feet (3 m) of 1-inch (2.54 cm) PVC pipe and 4 PVC joints and 3 1-inch PVC mounting clamps to create a 1 ft (.3 m) by 4 ft (1.2 m) rectangular frame. This will secure your kayak vertically against a wall.Buy extra PVC in case you need it.
 You will need to cut the PVC pipe using a saw and connect the frame by the joints. Saw two pieces that are 1 ft (.3 m) long and two pieces that are 4 ft (1.2 m) long. Attach them by gluing the pieces together in the joints using all-purpose PVC glue. It will form a large rectangle. Allow the joints to dry fully before affixing the frame to the wall., Place it 5 feet (1.52 m) from the ground on a wall in your storage area with the mounting clamps. Screw the clamps into the studs of the wall in a straight line. Screw in one clamp on each stud (with a standard distance of 16‚Äù between studs, this should require 3 clamps for a 4 ft frame), then clip each clamp on the same side of the rectangular frame. This will hold the frame securely in place, attached to the wall.Install it higher or lower depending on the size of your kayak.
 Place the bow through the rectangle from the bottom of the rack. Push up on the stern towards the wall so that the bow goes through the rectangular frame and the stern touches the ground. The cockpit should face out. The rack will hold it in place and allow it to lean against the wall.
 At least once a week, inspect the kayak to guarantee it hasn't slipped or sagged.

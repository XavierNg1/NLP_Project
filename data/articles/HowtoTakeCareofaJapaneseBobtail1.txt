 When you first get your cat, take it to the vet, especially if it’s a kitten. Bring any medical information and documentation provided by the breeder or previous owner. Your vet will evaluate your cat’s health and arrange a schedule with you to ensure it receives regular checkups.Kittens should receive their first vaccinations at six or seven weeks of age, then again at ten, twelve, thirteen, sixteen, and nineteen weeks. Booster shots may be needed every year for adult cats.;
, Limit the amount of time your Japanese Bobtail spends outside. This will protect it from being struck by a vehicle, contracting an illness, or becoming the victim of other cats or animals who might hurt it., Japanese Bobtails are generally self-sufficient, but they do need attention and opportunities to play. Spend time each day rolling a ping-pong or tennis ball across the floor near your cat. It will have fun chasing the ball. Wave a teaser toy – a stick with a string on the end connected to a stuffed mouse or similar toy – near your cat, then lift it just out of reach when your cat goes to swing at it. Your cat will derive great amusement from this activity.Make sure your cat has a scratching post to prevent them from scratching up your furniture.Cats often enjoy chasing laser pointers. Point the laser at a wall, and move it around as your cat chases the light. Do not shine the laser in your cat's eyes or human eyes., Japanese Bobtails are generally free of any health issues. However, like most house cats, they are at risk for obesity once they ease into domestic life. Manage your cat’s diet and food portions to ensure it stays lean. If your cat starts getting a bit pudgier, talk to your vet about developing a fitness plan.

 Lettuce is the foundation of most types of salad, and many types of lettuce or lettuce-substitutes should be available at your local grocery store. When choosing a lettuce for your salad—romaine, iceberg, green leaf—be aware that they’re all cholesterol-friendly.Use the type of lettuce that you prefer, or change the types you eat for the sake of variety.


If you’re tired of the three mentioned types of lettuce, consider expanding to spinach leaves, spring leaves, kale, or a mix that combines multiple types of lettuce.
Spinach is a healthy and delicious lettuce substitute; it’s high in fiber (a cup of spinach contains 6 grams of fiber), which helps your body lower its levels of cholesterol., Nearly all garden vegetables are very low in fats and contain no saturated fats, making them ideal candidates for you to include in salads. It’s especially important that you include veggies that are high in antioxidants, which help lower your body’s cholesterol levels. When you’re shopping for salad ingredients at your local grocery store, look for veggies like: cabbage, carrots, onions (either raw or cooked), soy beans, and tomatoes.Many of these ingredients can be chopped and served on top of your salad, while others—including cabbage—can be used in the place of lettuce itself.
 Although avocados are a fatty food, they contain significant amounts of good, healthy fats—including oleic acid and monounsaturated fats—and do not contain high amounts of saturated fats. Consequently, avocados will help raise your levels of good cholesterol, and lower levels of bad cholesterol.Avocados are commonly served as a garnish on the top of a salad. Cut each avocado half into thin slices, and arrange these on top of your salad. Alternately, cut each avocado half into half-inch squares, and sprinkle a half-cup or so on top of your salad.

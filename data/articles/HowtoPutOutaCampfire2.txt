 Plan on leaving the campsite when your fire completely dies down. Do not add logs to your fire if you know you are leaving soon so that the fire can stop burning. If you need to extinguish the fire quickly, this is not an ideal method. Instead, use water to put out your fire., Use a shovel or a long stick to poke the embers left over in the fire. Uncover large unburnt logs or sticks to make sure that there are no embers remaining under the ashes., You just want enough dirt or sand to smother the embers and to extinguish the fire fully. Do not cover or bury the fire, as this could create a fire under the surface of the dirt that could reignite later and will make the sand or dirt incredibly hot., Put your hand a couple of inches away from the coals in the fire to make sure that it's cooled off. If it still feels warm, repeat the steps until the ashes are completely cooled.

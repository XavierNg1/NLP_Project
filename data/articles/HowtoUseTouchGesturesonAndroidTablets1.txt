 This is the simplest gesture, and one with which you’re probably familiar. Your tablet registers a quick one-finger tap like the click of a mouse.


Tap an app icon or link once to open it.
Tap once to select objects, such as keys on the keyboard or items in a menu.;
, This is a “double-tap,” like a double-click with a computer mouse or trackpad.


Double-tap an area of a map in the Maps app to zoom to that location.
If you use double-tap to zoom, a second double-tap will usually zoom back out to the original size.
 This is a quick motion used to dismiss notifications or to show the next photo or item in a series. Depending on the app, swiping up, down, left, or right may achieve different results.


On most tablets, you can swipe the screen in any direction to unlock the device.
Swipe down from the top of the home screen to see a list of your notifications. Then, you can swipe each notification to the left or right to dismiss them.
 This action is used to select items, or to view additional options for a file. Unlike a regular tap, you’ll leave your finger pressed to the screen until an object is highlighted or a link appears.


Tap and hold an image in a web browser to see options to save or open it in a new tab.
Tap and hold multiple thumbnails in the Photos app to select many photos at once.
 Tap and hold an item and then, without removing your finger, drag it to a destination. This motion is different from a swipe because the “hold” part of the movement selects the object.


If you tap and hold an icon on your home screen, one or two links will appear at the top of the screen—Remove and Uninstall (some apps won’t have the “Uninstall” link). Drag the icon to one of those links to remove it from the home screen or delete it from your tablet.

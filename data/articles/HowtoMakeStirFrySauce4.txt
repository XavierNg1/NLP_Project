 This savory peanut sauce pairs fantastically with chicken, creating a mouthwatering (and very filling) flavor combination.To start making your sauce, combine equal portions of peanut butter and hot water (serving suggestions above). Whisk together to combine.


As noted in the ingredients section, the water should be hot, but not boiling. You want the water to make the peanut butter liquid enough to add to your sauce, not to cook it.
 Once you've softened your peanut butter, add the other ingredients and continue whisking to combine. As above, feel free to add more or less chili sauce to the mixture to increase or decrease its spiciness. Mix thoroughly until you achieve a uniform appearance and texture.


If you're using chunky peanut butter, you may want to pulse the sauce in a food processor for a smoother texture, though this isn't necessary if you don't mind solid bits of peanut in your sauce.
 Once you've combined your ingredients to your liking, your sauce is ready to serve! Because it contains protein- and fat-rich peanut butter, this sauce can make a hearty, filling dish even if paired with nothing more than rice. However, for a full, protein-rich meal, try pairing with chicken and brown rice â€” this is great for a post-workout protein load or simply an ordinary (yet satisfying) dinner!

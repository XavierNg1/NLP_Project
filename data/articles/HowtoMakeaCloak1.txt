 Measure the wearer's ankle to shoulder height. After that, measure the person's arm span. If you know you want it bigger, add extra length to the arm span.






;
, Cut a rectangle the length of their ankle-shoulder height and the width of their arm span on the separate sheet of fabric.









Round off the corners, if desired. This is most easily accomplished by folding the rectangle in quarters (in half once lengthwise, then in half once width-wise) and cutting all of the corners at one time so that they are all curved equally.
 Mark the halfway point of the neck edge with a pencil; this is for the center point of the neck divot.









Measure your neck and add two inches to that measurement.













Find the diameter by dividing by Pi or by three (will yield a slightly larger diameter, but in a cloak, that is not a bad thing).
Divide your diameter in half and mark the neck hole by measuring out from the center point to points the distance of that radius from the center point.
Cut the fabric, following your marks.
 Generally a 1/2" (1.25 cm) seam allowance is sufficient. It will depend on how your fabric cuts -- some felts don't even need to be hemmed.
 Attach a brooch, clasp etc., onto one side and pin it through to the other. This will keep the cloak securely on the wearer. If you don't have one, hit up your local thrift shops for inexpensive costume jewelry.

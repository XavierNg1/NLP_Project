 Sprayers come with a small tank on the front called a "hopper," which allows you to scoop out small amounts of stucco mix for each application. If the mix you're using pours out of the nozzle before you pull the trigger, thicken the stucco mix with more sand.
 Point the stucco sprayer at the wall, making sure you are around 12 inches (30.5Â cm) away and perpendicular to the wall. Spray in 1 to 2-second bursts. Try to keep the stucco coating even throughout the structure by constantly moving the sprayer up and down during the entire process, as spending too much time spraying one area may cause the stucco coating to be uneven across the structure.
 The trowel will help you smooth the stucco on to the structure. After the stucco sets, use the edge of the trowel to scrape off splatter and uneven stucco, then wipe the stucco surface down with a sponge and water.

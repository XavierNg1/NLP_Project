 If you’re boring completely through the material, use a set of vise parallels to help support it while keeping it raised enough to drill through.If you do use parallels, tap the material down with a rubber mallet to ensure that it’s tight against the parallels and won’t move once you begin drilling., A center drill is a much smaller, pointed bit that allows you more precision in starting a hole at an exact mark before drilling it out with a larger bit.A dab of cutting fluid should be applied when boring tougher materials such as metals to lubricate the bore and extend the life of all bits., As with hand reaming, you still want to use a 1/64” smaller drill bit to bore your hole before reaming.A drill press will allow more control and accuracy than a hand-held drill, especially on harder materials and denser metals, which is why a drill press is recommended.
 Especially when reaming a metal piece, you want to clear any filings from drilling the hole before reaming. Use a small round file to work away any filings., You’re now ready to place the reamer into the drill chuck and tighten it down. For high precision jobs, you may also consider using a floating reamer holder. A floating reamer holder allows the reamer to float, meaning it gives the reamer just enough movement to guide it into the hole in case of a slight misalignment., You can now lower the press and ream the hole. However, you want to set your press to roughly 1/3 of its usual speed because reaming with a press should be done at a much lower RPM.Once again, make sure that you use cutting fluid to lubricate the reamer.
 Once you have reamed your hole, you want to turn off the press and allow the spindle to come to a complete stop before you raise the press.This will help ensure a smooth, clean ream.

 A white or light-colored rose is usually the best choice. Since these have little color to begin with, it will be easier to get the color you want. This is especially true of dyeing, which can be difficult to detect in a dark rose.









If cutting the roses yourself, use disinfected gardening shears. Scissors may crush the stem, preventing uptake of water and dye.
Cut roses at a 45º angle to allow for more surface area for water and dye uptake., Although some people have tried black food coloring in water, a professional floral dye is safer for the plant. You can order these online, or ask a florist to order it for you.
 Wait at least three hours after cutting the roses or bringing the back from the florist. Stressed flowers will draw up more water, and therefore more dye.
 Check the label on your dye for a recommended concentration. When in doubt, go with 1 tbsp (15mL) floral dye for 1 quart (1L) warm water. The water should feel hot but not uncomfortable, about 100ºF (38ºC). Mix the ingredients thoroughly in a heat-safe container large enough for your roses.









Add flower preservative as well for a longer lifespan.
 Since roses have thick, woody stems, they can take several hours (or even a full day) to change color. To prevent blotchy, incomplete dying, keep the temperature at around 100ºF (38ºC).You can periodically add warm water to achieve this, or put the whole container in a slow cooker set to this temperature.
 Once the roses have turned black, remove the bouquet. Rinse the dye off the stems and transfer to an ordinary vase of water.









If the flowers are blotchy, leave them in plain, warm water overnight to spread the color more evenly.

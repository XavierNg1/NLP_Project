 It is possible you might be able to "match" if you have a favorite sports brand.;
, Although this might help you get a general idea on what type you want, but the store might not have the exact glove you want. Shopping online isn't the best though, because you can't try the glove out. This is the time you should also consider your budget: Softball gloves can be as much as $130!

, and go to the baseball/softball section. If you are not committed to softball and may not be playing for more than a year or so, you can try out some secondhand gloves as well. These gloves will be a lot cheaper. There is no difference!

, Unless you really find a baseball glove you just can't live without, you should stick to the softball gloves . It's better to buy a softball glove: the difference between a baseball glove and a softball glove is on a softball glove has longer fingers and a bigger pocket. A softball is a lot bigger than a baseball, so it's easier to catch with!

, When you find to right one you can tell its not to loose but not to tight either. One thing that can be helpful is that you can bring a wiffle/lacrosse ball and GENTLY try tossing it up and catching it.
, If the season is starting soon, you may want to break it in quickly. You can have your glove steamed, or buy a glove conditioner. Using regular hair conditioner is not recommended. Follow the directions exactly if you will be doing so- if you don't do it correctly, you could ruin the glove.
 Your glove will naturally break in as time passes. Just be sure to keep a softball in the glove when you are not using it, as it will help the glove pocket form correctly.

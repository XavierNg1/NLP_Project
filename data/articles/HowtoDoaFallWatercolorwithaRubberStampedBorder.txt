  Measure a 2 1/2" border around all sides of a sheet of watercolor paper and mark it with pencil.;
,  Arrange these colors around the outside edge of a white plastic dinner plate or a purchased palette.  Use three brushes and pull red, yellow and green into the center and mix with enough water to get the consistency of heavy cream.
  If necessary, tidy the stamp with a tissue and repeat.  Alternate flowers until you have printed completely around the edges of the paper.  Allow to dry.  Wait to paint the backgrounds of these flowers until you determine the color palette for the interior painting you will make next.
 You might put some wild flowers in a glass canning jar, tin can, or other rustic container and sketch them in the rectangle.  Add two or three fall vegetables, various shaped squash, corn, peppers or fruits in the foreground. 


This floral subject with veggies would make a complete composition, but here's how to make it even better: To enliven and add drama, sketch a cat sitting to one side of the flower bouquet.  Put a worm or mouse on one of the vegetables.
 Allow to dry and add a soft wash of color on the background, making the tablecloth checkered, flowered, or otherwise patterned.
  Paint this line with a contrasting color and draw on stitches with marker as if it were a piece of ribbon or bias tape sewn onto the painting.
 With magic markers, create faux stitches separating the flowers into separate rectangles to resemble quilt squares.

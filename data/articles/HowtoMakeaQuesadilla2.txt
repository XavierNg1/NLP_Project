 You can use any combination of vegetables, meats, or grains, so long as you end up with ½ cup (120 grams). If you are using meat or vegetables, make sure that they are cooked. Here are some suggestions to get you started:








For meat, try thinly-sliced steak, pulled pork, or shredded chicken breast.
For vegetables, try sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, or corn.
For beans, try black beans or pinto beans.
 You will need only about ½ teaspoon of butter or oil; avoid using too much, or your quesadilla will become too soggy. If using oil, try going for a lighter oil, such as canola or vegetable oil; olive oil will give the quesadilla too strong of a flavor.
 Make sure that the butter is spread evenly across the surface of the pan. At this point, you can start adding your fillings or you can flip the tortilla over and let it toast slightly on both sides; this will give you a crunchier quesadilla.
 If you do not like Cheddar cheese, you can use another type of shredded cheese, such as cheddar, Colby, Fontina, or Monterey Jack., You will be folding the tortilla in half later. Avoid putting too many fillings in, or your tortilla will be too bulky and tear.
 Slip the spatula under the cheesy side of the quesadilla and lift upwards, flipping it over onto the fillings. Gently press the quesadilla flat with the spatula.
 If there is any excess grease on the tortilla, you can wipe it off using a paper towel.
 Cut the quesadilla in half using a sharp knife, then cut each wedge in half again, creating four pizza-like slices.
 You can add toppings, such as salsa or sour cream.

 If you're out of olive oil and you need a quick natural conditioner, simply whisk an egg to combine the yolk and the white. After shampooing, comb the egg into your wet hair from the roots to the tips. Let it sit for five minutes, then rinse it out with cool or lukewarm water. This simple conditioner works for any hair type.
 If your hair is extremely dry and brittle, you might want to go above and beyond a simple egg and olive oil mixture. Try mixing in a tablespoon of one of the following ingredients to make your mask even more effective:Honey
Aloe vera gel
Milk
Very ripe avocado or banana

, If this is your first time making a mask, olive oil is a great place to start. You might be inspired to try other types of oil to see if they work well with your hair type. Try one of the following next time you need to make a mask:


Jojoba oil: for oily to normal hair
Almond oil: for normal to dry hair
Coconut oil: for dry hair
Cow ghee: for a conditioning effect & prevention of graying

, If you want your hair mask to smell like a fancy salon instead of your kitchen, try adding essential oils to the mix. A few drops of oil will instantly transform your hair mask. While you wait for it to soak in, you can enjoy the benefits of aromatherapy. Try adding five to ten drops of one of these essential oils:


Lavender
Rose
Lemongrass
Thyme
Vetiver

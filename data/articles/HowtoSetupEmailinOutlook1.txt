, In Gmail, this is found in a little gear symbol in the top right corner. Many other clients simply have the word "Preference" or "Settings."

, This could have many names, but all of them should have something similar to "Forwarding." Other phrases to look out for include:


"Forwarding and POP/IMAP"
"IMAP Settings"
"Mail Forwarding."
"POP/IMAP", This tells your email that it is okay to send a copy of the mail to Outlook. Once you've done this, you're good to set up Outlook.

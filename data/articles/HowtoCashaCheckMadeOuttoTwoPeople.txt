 This determines how the check can be endorsed and cashed.


Checks with names separated by “or,” “and/or,” a comma, or nothing at all can be endorsed and cashed by either individual.
Checks with names separated by “and” must be endorsed and cashed by both individuals.;
, Each bank has its own rules in place regarding checks written out to two people.


Cash the check as you normally would if the check can be endorsed and cashed by either individual. For example, if the check is made out to “Jane Doe or John Smith,” either Jane or John can cash the check without the other individual’s signature.
 Your bank will inform you of its rules and policies for cashing checks written out to two people. For instance, Bank of America requires both payees to share a bank account, while Wells Fargo and Chase require both payees to visit a branch in person to present government-issued identification., In most cases, checks with “and” between names on the “Payable To” line must be endorsed by both individuals, and cashed in person by both people at the bank., This is the best way to handle the situation if one of the payees cannot endorse the back of the check. Alternately, request that the payer write two separate checks to each individual.
 This can result in your funds being withheld or made unavailable by your bank as a result of violating rules and policies.
 Some banks allow you to deposit the check as long as both signatures are present.
 This can be used to your advantage if the other party cannot sign the check or visit the bank in person to cash it with you.

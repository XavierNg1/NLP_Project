 It is along Kaneohe Bay Drive in Kailua, but getting to this may be challenging. The Aikahi Gardens parking lot is reserved to tenants and their guests, so it's best to park at Aikahi Park Shopping Center (about 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km) away). Walk west on Kaneohe Bay Drive to Aikahi Gardens. If you plan to take the bus from town, get on the 56 "Kailua-Kaneohe" route and get off in front of the town house complex. At the far end of the parking lot, towards Kaneohe, you will come to a set of poles with a chain. Walk over the chain and follow the trail to a road.;
, It will soon become parallel to the H-3 Freeway. Follow the path to a paved concrete ramp.
 The brown gate on the left leads upwards to a radio tower on a smaller hill and the terrain turns into asphalt. The gate on the right, continues on the concrete path and ends at several main generators.
 When you get to the main generators, there are three different ridges to climb on.

Locate the generator straight ahead as you come up the road. Go around the fence on the right, using the fence as a guide, and come up to the ridge. Use caution when walking down to the rock below and enjoy the view of Kaneohe Bay.






Walk around the bend to the left and walk up to the next gate. Go to the far left of the gate and use the dirt opening on the side to come around the fence. Walk up the road to the left. There's an opening to the far right. Hike up the very short trail to the other ridge to view Kailua.






Using the above directions in the second one, go straight instead of the trail on the right. Go around the radio tower (be aware that there is barbed wire against the hill side). Climb up the tower steps and carefully walk over the bent fence on the right. Walking on the ridge, go towards the left to a concrete pillar. You can enjoy the view of Kailua and Kaneohe from here.

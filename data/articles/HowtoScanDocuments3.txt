 Once your document has been scanned, you may wish to use a program like Adobe Acrobat to turn the files into a PDF or stitch them together into some kind of multi-page document. You can also set Acrobat to recognize the scanned text and make it searchable or editable.


If saved as an image, you may want to up the contrast using photo software in order to make the text more legible.
 Open the image using either your computerâ€™s basic photo software or a more complex program like Photoshop. From there you can change contrast, levels, and a variety of other aspects of the image.

 The older the half dollar, the more it will be worth. Prior to 1964, half dollars contained 90% silver. In 1964, the U.S. Mint removed silver from all dimes and quarters. They also reduced the silver content in half dollars from 90% to 40%, which is the silver content for all half dollars minted from 1965-1970. Most coins minted after 1970 are not made of silver but are most likely nickel-clad half dollars.Kennedy 1964 half dollars are the last 90% silver coins minted by the Federal Reserve.
When you have find a half dollar, make sure its date matches the symbol minted during that period. For example, a Kennedy half dollar with a date before 1964 is likely a counterfeit.;
, Silver exhibits weak magnetic effects. If your coins stick to a magnet, they are most likely not silver.Your half dollar is more likely nickel-clad if it's strongly magnetic.

Remember that some metals (like aluminum or titanium) can look like silver and also have no metal qualities. When in doubt, bring your coin to a dealer who can determine its authenticity.
 Silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any common metal or alloy. If you place a piece of ice directly on the silver and it melts immediately (as if it has been placed on a hot object), your coin is most likely silver.Avoid performing this test outdoors. The ice test will be most accurate in a room temperature area.
 Flick your coin in the air and listen to the sound it makes as it hits the ground. Authentic silver will make a high-pitched ringing sound, like a bell. If it does not make this sound, the coin is likely a counterfeit., If the area is marred or looks like it's been tampered with, a counterfeiter may have altered the date. Don't trust a coin with lots of strange markings or scratches, especially if they're around the symbol or date. You may be dealing with a counterfeit coin.

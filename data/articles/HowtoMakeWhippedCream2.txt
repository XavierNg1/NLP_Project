 In recent years it has become popular to make whipped cream in a variety of different flavors that complement the dish the cream will top. Whipped cream is easily flavored by extracts, cocoa, liqueurs, and zests; choose a combination that works with your dessert. Here are a few ideas:









Make chocolate whipped cream by adding a tablespoon of cocoa. This would make a great topping for chocolate silk pie.
Make vanilla bourbon whipped cream as a topping for pecan pie. Add a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of bourbon to the mix.
Create a bright-tasting cream by adding a tablespoon of lemon zest, and use it to top strawberry shortcake.
Almond or anise extract add a subtle depth to whipped cream. These make an excellent topping for berry pies.
 When you're ready to make whipped cream, remove the chilled cream from the refrigerator and pour it into a clean bowl. Add sugar and a pinch of salt, then add the flavorings you want to use. Stir it all together with a spoon or a whisk.
 Using the same technique described for classic whipped cream, beat the cream until it forms either soft or stiff peaks, depending on your preference. Use the cream to top your pie or cake.

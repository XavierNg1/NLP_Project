 If the stain is not your own blood, exercise caution and use gloves for this and all subsequent steps. Some bloodborne pathogens can remain infectious for days outside the body. Dispose of all soiled cleaning supplies with care.
 If possible, chill the water in a bowl with ice cubes. Never use warm or hot water to clean blood! If you do, the heat may set the stain and make it permanent., Carefully dab the area until dry. Tamp gently up and down. Do not dab at a dry stain, as that may damage the paper.
 This will likely need to be done a few times. If the stain was fresh, this may be all that's necessary to remove the stain. If the stain persists, go on to the next step.
 Repeat steps 2-3 using hydrogen peroxide instead of water. Repeat as necessary. Do not be tempted to use bleach on a blood stain! Bleach can break down the proteins found in blood, leaving behind an unsightly yellow mark.

Because they relieve the symptoms of TMJ, they can lessen the headache pain.Generally, you take these by mouth for up to a couple of weeks, though you may need them for less than a week.Your doctor may also offer an injection, such as botulinum toxin or a steroid, that she will administer at the office.Because muscle relaxants can make you very drowsy and you should avoid driving or operating equipment when taking them, they may not be a good fit for everyone. You may wish to take them only at bedtime to avoid feeling sedated throughout the day.

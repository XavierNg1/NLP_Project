 The first rule of the Martini Diet is to “eat only the very best.” Eating only the best means sticking to whole foods and avoiding harmful processed foods. While this will remove a lot of packaged and pre-made food from your diet, it will introduce you to a wide range of unprocessed foods for further exploration, including fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables and quality meats.;
, On the Martini Diet, you'll need to adhere to the Slow Food philosophy. In a nutshell, this means that food should only be prepared from the highest-quality ingredients and those ingredients should be fresh, and they should be from local sources. Cooking should be a source of pleasure and dining taken slowly, amid conversation, sharing with loved ones and friends, and eating mindfully.
 According to the Martini Diet, fat-free foods are not foods; they are a process. And the evidence of their utility is weak at best anyway––they simply encourage you to eat bland food that has little place in the nutrient stakes.
 Trans fats are found in shelf-stable items such as margarine, baked goods and fried foods like freezer chips, while high fructose corn syrup is found in many sodas, candies, cookies and cereals.
 Monounsaturated fats like those found in avocados and omega-3 fatty acids such as those found in fish are best, but even the fats found in cream and butter are good for satiety.

 Like any good corporate program or initiative, a strong purpose and a good set of objectives is important. This set of purposes and objectives has to be relevant and aligned to your other corporate objectives.;
, It is important to know that not all objectives or purposes can be served by social media and it would be foolish to assume so just because 'everybody' is in social media. Social media is effective not only in PR, marketing and brand building but it is also effective when used for innovation, crowd-sourcing, building corporate culture and market engagements.

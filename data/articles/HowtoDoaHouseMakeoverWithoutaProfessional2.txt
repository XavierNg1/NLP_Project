 Decluttering the space will help make your rooms look bigger, brighter, and more beautiful. The process by which you declutter a particular room will vary depending on the amount of clutter in the room. Start by stepping out of the room and getting a good look at it.Ask yourself questions about the various items in the room like, “Do I still need or want this item?”
Walk through the room and consider each item. Ask yourself if it brings you joy. If it does not bring you joy and does not have a practical use, donate it to a thrift store or a give it to a friend.
 Instead of blinds, add curtains to your windows. In a living room or bedroom, especially, floor-length curtains can make the room look bigger., Check out your local thrift shops for vases, artwork, and other decorative objects that could lend some life to the various rooms of your home. If you don’t find anything to your liking, check online or at your local home goods store.Find new ways to use objects you might already have. If you’re going for a rustic look, for instance, you could plant some flowers in a watering can and place it in your kitchen or living room.
 If your friends or family are renovating their homes, ask them if you can have their old cabinets, countertops, doorknobs, and so on. Visit your local haberdashery to buy cheap scraps of cloth you could use to craft unique curtains. Check for new furniture and décor at secondhand shops before heading to big box stores., If you have a radiator or furnace pipe that disrupts the visual flow of a room, arrange your furniture in such a way that the offending element becomes invisible. For instance, place a couch or desk in front of a radiator.

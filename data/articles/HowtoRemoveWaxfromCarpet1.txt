 This will harden it and solidify it, making it easier to pick off. When it's completely solid, remove and set aside.









Get the stain as cold as possible. Ice packs, a frozen slab of meat -- whatever you have handy, apply it to the wax. Let it set for a few minutes until you're positive the wax is frozen.;
, Getting rid of as much of it as possible prior to actually cleaning it will make the process ultimately more successful. The less wax you have to tackle in the end, the better.









If you can't get much up, don't worry. That's fine. Move to method two (uses an iron and melts away the wax) if a substantial amount is left over.
 Either a carpet spray or cleaning solvent is fine. If a bit of a stain is left from the dye, rub with rubbing alcohol to remove the color. After applying any solvent, blot with a clean rag and fresh water to remove any leftover residue.
 The carpet has just been through a pretty harrowing experience. Vacuum it to return it to the texture it was originally.

 You will be putting these limes directly into the water after you slice them up, so you want them to be perfectly clean.;
, Simply lay the limes down on their sides, and cut them into thin disks. They will release the flavor into water as well as give it some color.
 You can also use a 32-ounce (0.95 liter) mason jar.
 The leaves will give the lime water some extra color and flavor.
 Stir the water gently with a long spoon.
 The longer you leave it, the more flavor your water will have. For a lightly-flavored water, wait 10 to 30 minutes. For a stronger flavor, leave the pitcher in the fridge overnight.
 If you want, you can add some ice cubes into the pitcher. You can also fill a jar with some ice cubes, and pour the lime water over that.

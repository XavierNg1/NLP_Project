 Even an old wooden box that is large enough to fit the boots can be turned into a boot storage box by the addition of a door on hinges. Tuck the boots inside this cupboard each time after use and the spiders won't be able to crawl inside.
 The mudroom, laundry or a spare cupboard near the back door can all work as suitable places for storing boots when not in use and thereby reducing the chances of spiders living inside.

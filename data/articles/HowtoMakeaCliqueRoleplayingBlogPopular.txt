 No one wants to read short, choppy posts with grammar errors and bad punctuation. If you're on WordPress, they have a button that checks everything for you. Also make your posts long, at least 500 words. Cliffhanger/cutoff posts are good too. They are posts when something dramatic or surprising happens in the end, but then the post is cutoff so you'll be left wanting to read the next one, like books do in a series.;
, In comments, make a little subtle advertisement, like, "I'm new, maybe you can give me an advertisement?" or "New post, check it out?" The key is to be subtle. You'll look like a desperate loser if you say, "Please give me an advertisement please I'm new and I have no views and you have so much I just want to be like you please please" because that is just annoying. Remember: subtle.
 People won't comment on your blog unless you comment on theirs. Make sure your comment is something related to their post, not just like advertising, because as said above, that is annoying.
 It is fine to be a solo blogger, and there is a couple solo Clique blogs out there, but blogs with PCs tend to be more popular. If you have a PC, you can also make many friends.
 Usually the pages people use are "About Me," "Contact," "CSOTU" (for Massie's) "Closet," and "Contact." Be creative and make up your own pages too. Also make up your own post ideas, like new characters. Never copy from someone else without permission though, because that is rude and shows you have no originality.
 If you're always mean and bossy, no one will ever like you, and they will go against you, ruining your blogging reputation. Always be willing to give advice to other bloggers and they will be kind to you in return.

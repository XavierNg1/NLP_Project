 To claim the skull, you must have begun the campaign level from the beginning and have attempted it on a difficulty of at least Normal. The Floodgate campaign level can be accessed from the Campaign option on the main menu.;
, You will have come this way at the end of the previous campaign level, so it isn't far from where you start on Floodgate. You will pass several trees and a few ruins on your way. Commander Miranda Keyes will be talking about the spread of the Flood as you approach the buildings.
 The building has power lines running from the roof across the road to the building on the other side. The road in the middle turns off to the left. Make sure you have your battle rifle or carbine ready.
 Immediately, look up to the aforementioned building on the right, directly in front of where the power lines run from. A Flood will appear on the roof carrying the Fog skull.
 If you wait too long, it will jump across the street and out of view, so you must be quick. If a marine yells out "There! Over there!" and a new checkpoint saves, then you have waited too long and will have to begin again. However, if you manage to shoot the Flood before it escapes, then the Fog skull should fall onto the street for you to collect.
 Congratulations, you've found it! Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics to see the Fog achievement has been unlocked for 10 gamerscore. It is represented by a skull with a swirl of fog on it. You will also be able to use the Fog skull in your campaign games by pressing X in the campaign menu and selecting it. It gives you a x1.5 campaign score multiplier, but you will not be able to use your motion tracker.

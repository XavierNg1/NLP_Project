 If your doctor feels that your wife is a good candidate for prenatal massage, you can ask for referrals to qualified massage therapists for further instruction.
 Speak with the therapist to learn about safety and precautions that should be used, and learn about the special techniques that you can follow at home. If you have difficulty locating a prenatal massage specialist, ask for advice from friends, neighbors and colleagues. Keep in mind that you are looking not just for a massage therapist, but one who is familiar with the care of pregnant women.
 Speak with the massage therapist and explain that you would like to duplicate her technique at home. Ask her to explain the important steps to you while she is massaging your wife. Many therapists will not mind taking the time to briefly discuss the key points with you during or after the massage session.

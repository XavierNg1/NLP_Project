 The fastest way of healing a bee sting is pretty similar to how one would deal with it in the real world—by using medicine. You can get the medicine from Tom Nook’s store for 400 bells.


The location of Nook’s store varies from game to game; however, it can easily be located by looking at the map on the bottom screen and finding the leaf shaped icon.;
, Once you enter the store, simply approach the white bag displayed on one of the shelves, and press the “A” button to talk to Tom Nook, who will ask if you want to purchase it. Select “Yes.”


Although medicine can be purchased every day, you can only get one dose per day. So if you give your medicine to a sick villager, you won’t get another one for that day.
 After buying the medicine, hit the “X” button to open your inventory. Select the medicine with your stylus, and drag it over to your character. After dragging the medicine, your character’s bee sting should automatically disappear.

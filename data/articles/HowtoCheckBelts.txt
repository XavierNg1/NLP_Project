 These sounds likely mean one or more belts are worn, loose or damaged.;
, You need to do more than just visually inspect the belts. Pinch, squeeze and twist them, looking for cracks, fraying, splits or brittle places.


On a serpentine belt, also look for missing grooves or places where the belt's layers have separated.
 Slick spots can cause a belt to slip and may be precursors to overheating and cracking.
 Look for a buildup of rubber deposits, as well as worn spots that could catch the belt and cause it to break.


Also check the belts' alignment on the pulleys. They should line up straight on the pulleys.
 Check the tension on the longest length of the belt; there should be no more than one-half to one inch (1.25 centimeters to 2.5 centimeters) of give.

 The best thing you can do for a swollen joint is to stop using it and just rest the joint.For example, if one or both of your knees are swollen, then get off of your feet. If your elbow is swollen, then stop moving it for a while.


If you have a physical job, then you may need to ask for a day off of work.;
, Putting your affected joint above the level of your heart can also help to relieve pain by reducing the swelling.Try placing the joints up on pillows or use furniture to help elevate your joints.


For example, if your ankles are swollen, then you can sit in a recliner with your feet elevated.
 Icing your swollen joints can also help to relieve the pain. Try holding an ice pack on the swollen joint for up to 20 minutes at a time.Make sure that you wrap the ice pack in a towel first to help prevent your skin from becoming too cold. Never place ice or an ice pack directly onto your skin.
Give yourself breaks as well to ensure that your skin does not get too cold.
 Taking a non-steroidal anti inflammatory medicine (NSAID) or acetaminophen can also help to bring down the swelling in your joints and relieve the pain. Try taking an ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen.Follow the dosage instructions. Do not exceed the recommended dosage.
 Wearing support hose can also help to bring down swelling in your joints and this may help to reduce the pain.You can find support hose in most drug stores or in a medical supply store, but you may also consider getting a prescription for compression hose from your doctor.


You will need to wear the hose all day to get the most benefit.

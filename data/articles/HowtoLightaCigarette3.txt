 Even though they are usually used to ignite a grill, grill lighters make for a quick alternative if you don’t have matches or a traditional lighter. Grill lighters have a long stem and a handle with a button on it.Light your cigarette in the same way you would use a disposable lighter.
 If you don’t have any sort of lighter or match in your house, you can turn on your stove and put your cigarette on it to light it. Turn on your gas stove and carefully place the tip of the cigarette into the flame with your hands. Once the flame starts to burn on the end, try to take a drag from it.


Don’t put your face near the burner or you can burn yourself.
If you smell gas, but there is no flame, put out your cigarette, go outside, and call 911., If you’re in a social situation and there is no lighter or matches in sight, you can use the tip of another lit cigarette to light yours. To do this simply touch the end of the lit cigarette to the end of yours while it’s in your mouth and inhale.


This is also a great way to start a conversation with a stranger.
 Lighting a cigarette with a Zippo lighter is very similar to lighting one with a disposable lighter. Make sure that your lighter has enough fluid. Some Zippo lighters are even wind resistant.Closing the lid on a Zippo lighter extinguishes the flame.

 This is Facebook's two-factor authentication system, and can foil nearly any attempt to access your account without permission. When an access attempt is detected on an unrecognized device, your mobile phone will be sent a code that will need to be entered in order to log in. Without this code, the intruder will not be able to access your Facebook account.


Log in to your Facebook account.
Click the Menu button in the upper-right and select "Settings".
Click the "Security" tab.
Click "Edit" next to the "Login Approvals" entry.
Follow the prompts to enable Login Approvals. You will need to associate your mobile phone number with your Facebook account.
 Avoid using names, birthdays, home addresses, or real words in your password, as these are easy to guess. To ensure security, your password should be a combination of words and letters, preferably in a totally random order. The longer and more random your password is, the better.
 If you use the same password for your email, your online banking, and your Facebook account, then it will be easier for people to hack into all of your information once they have discovered one of your passwords.
 If you suspect that somebody else has your login information, then you should change your password immediately to prevent them from hacking into your account without your permission.
 This is especially important if you are logging into your account on somebody else's computer or mobile device. You may even want to consider logging out of your account on your own computer each time, especially if you know that somebody else will be using your computer.
 The firewall will alert you anytime information on your computer is being sent out to a third party and ask for your permission first.

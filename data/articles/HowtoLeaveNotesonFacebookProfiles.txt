 Skip this step if you already have a Facebook. Fortunately, if you go to www.facebook.com, there will be a sign-up sheet on the homepage. This sheet makes the process of signing up quite simple.;
, You will see a search box, and next to that is a box that says log out, which has settings on the other side of that, finally there will be a box three down from the search box with your name in it.
 Once you are there, scan the page for your picture. If you did not add a picture, then there will be a silhouette of a person's bust, which will supplement as your photo. Below that is a box that will say "Click here to add a note."

,, Congratulations, you have created a note! Pat yourself on the back!

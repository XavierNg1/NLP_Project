 Try to find one that has a deep, serrated edge. A knife with a shallower edge may not cut as well. Also, try to find a bread knife whose blade goes all the way through the handle. It will give you the best support. A bread knife whose blade only extends partway into the handle will not give you enough support.

Some people find that knives with wavy edges are easier to use than knives with jagged edges.
 If your cutting board is not long enough, then place part of the baguette on the board. As you continue to slice it, you will scoop the sliced parts off to the side and push the baguette further up onto the board.
 Start by going into the baguette at a slight angle, close to the heel. Once the knife pierces the crust, position the knife so that the jagged blade is parallel to the cutting board.


For thin slices, try cutting them ¼ to ½ inch (0.65 to 1.27 centimeters).
For thicker slices, try cutting them 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) tick.
 Place a slice cut-side-down onto the cutting board. Cut the slice straight down the middle so that you end up with two half-circles. Repeat this for the rest of the thick slices.


If the bread is very sturdy, you can set it down on the cutting board and cut horizontally into it, with the flat side of the blade parallel to the cutting board.
You can also use this technique for ciabatta bread.
 Top the thin slices with ham, salami, or thin slices of cheese. Serve the thicker, half-circle slices with dips or olive oil.


If you are serving your bread with olive oil, consider mixing in some balsamic vinegar and dried herbs, such as oregano, rosemary, thyme, or basil.

 For example, take a hike to the woods and look for a fallen tree. Be sure to stick to using a dead tree, keeping this an environmentally friendly exercise.;
, It's safe to say to make your stool about a foot (30cm) high or even lower because it's meant for kids. Use a pencil to mark where you are going to cut the log.
 Simply saw back and forth until you have severed the measured piece of log.
 If the log is still long, make use of it by creating even more stools rather than leaving the leftovers behind.
, Use it to smooth the surface of the stool. You can even paint the stool if you prefer.
 Now your kids will have a place to settle near the campfire!

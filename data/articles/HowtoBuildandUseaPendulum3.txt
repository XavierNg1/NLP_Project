 Using a second, or even third, string can help you demonstrate the special properties of the pendulum. Make the string shorter than your first one, or weight it differently.


Cut 2nd string to 35 centimeter (13.8 in), if you're testing how a difference in height works for pendulums.
Place the second string 20–30 centimeter (7.9–11.8 in) from the first one, so they don't bump into one another during their rotations.
 Test pendulums of different weights and see if there is any change in their rotation and in their frequency. Time them to see what, if any difference, there is.Repeat several times (around five) and average out the times that you've recorded, or oscillations of the pendulum. This will give you the average movement of the pendulum.
 While a slight angle change tends not to have any effect on the rotation of the pendulum, you might try making a really big difference and see what that does. For example, placing one string at 30 degrees and one string at 90 degrees.Again, while you're testing out the different angles, you'll want to repeat the experiment around five times to get the best information.
 Find out what happens with the speed of two different lengths of pendulum. Time them to see if the shorter pendulum is faster or if it remains the same as the longer one.


Repeat, repeat, repeat. Then average out the times and oscillations of the pendulum.

 Since water is crucial in helping your body turn fat into energy, dehydration can slow your metabolism.


The amount of water you should drink each day depends on your body. Aim to drink at least half your body weight in fluid ounces. For instance, if you weigh 120 pounds, you should be drinking 60 fluid ounces of water each day.
If you find yourself bored with water, try flavored water. These are available in many stores, though you could flavor it yourself by dropping some sliced lemons or cucumber into a pitcher and letting it sit for a few hours.
Carry a water bottle with you wherever you go.
 Unsweetened, brewed green tea increases the rate at which calories are burned. Green tea also reduces cholesterol, combats heart disease, and prevents cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Swap out green tea for sugary sodas and fruit drinks.
 Caffeine can boost your metabolism between 5 to 8%. While it doesn’t play as important a role as water or green tea in the effort to raise your BMR, it’s worth incorporating a cup of joe into your morning or lunch routine. Avoid getting buzzed on caffeine by limiting yourself to just two or three cups each day.

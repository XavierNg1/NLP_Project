, Division by zero is undefined.






Rational numbers = all the naturals, wholes, common fractions, integers, and some other non-common fractional expressions, or decimals and roots that all have a terminating decimal or repeating decimal equivalent form.






Fractions, equivalent decimals and percentages are three examples of rational numbers:






Fractions = p/q (p and q are integers, but q is not zero). Also, terminating decimals and repeating decimals are other examples of rationals, like:

Terminating decimals are such as: 1/4 = .25 = 25/100 = 25%, and 3/4 = .75 = 75/100 = 75%, and 5/8 = .625 = 625/1000 = 62.5/100 = 62.5% .
Repeating decimal like 1/3 = .333... = 33 1/3% or ~ 33.333%, and also 2/3 = .666... = 66 2/3% or ~ 66.66% (often rounded to 66.7% = .667 for convenience).
and in 3/13 = 0.230769230769230769... notice that "230769" repeats, which indicates that 3/13 is rational (and, of course, any rational divided by a rational could be shown to have a rational quotient).
, Irrationals, stated as decimals neither terminate nor repeat. They can not be stated as a ratio such as a fraction (p/q) that would terminate or repeat in its decimal equivalent. The number Ï€, e and sqrt(2), of 3, or of 5,..., and the 3rd root(4) are some examples of irrationals.
, Imaginary numbers are based on i = (sq root of -1) = i1 or 1i. The i is the symbol for imaginary numbers, such that:


(a.) 1i X 1i = -1, but since (b.) -1 X -1 = +1, just as (c.) 1 X 1 = +1






Example: the sqrt(-9) = 3i is called "imaginary 3", or "3 imaginary" and is not Real. Check: i3 X i3, or 3i X 3i = -9.

Example: The sqrt(-8) is imaginary = " i(2nd root(8)) "

,


Example: 3rd root of (-8) = -2 is Real. Check: -2 X -2 X -2 = -8.
 bi is the imaginary part of that value. ax is Real as seen here.
 Here is how Reals are easily defined as y = ax based on y = ax + bi. Show that subset y = ax + 0 is where the (optional) imaginary part bi is not present (not relevant). Why not -- because we have b = 0 and bi = 0i = 0, so then we call that the values of a subset R, such that y = ax makes up all of the Real numbers.

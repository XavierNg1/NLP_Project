 Take out some frozen puff pastry and cut it into as many squares as you have people eating dessert. Cut an indentation inner square out of each puff pastry square and layer apricot halves or peach slices in the indented part. Bake in the oven on a baking tray until the pastry puffs up (about 10-15 minutes) and dust with icing sugar to complete the dessert.
 Use the cream to join together two sponge fingers or two meringues per person., Soak a sponge cake with sherry and place in the base of a large glass bowl. Add layers of the following items on top: ready-made custard, sliced bananas and apricot halves or peach slices. Dust with hot chocolate powder and sprinkle on toasted coconut.

 An online rewards program can reward you with gift cards in the long run, but they generate a significant amount of marketing email and spam. This is how they afford to give out gift cards. Create an email address specifically for the rewards program to keep your personal inbox spam-free.


Do not give any of the companies your credit card number, as there are numerous ways to earn points that do not require purchases.
 These programs will send you marketing email with offers that can earn you points. These are often surveys and special purchases through specific retailers. Some of the most popular rewards programs include:


MyPoints
SwagBucks
My Coke Rewards
QuickRewards
Free E-bay Gift Card (Check the last link of source)

, These can include playing games, watching advertisements, and filling out surveys. These activities often net you fewer points than purchases, but they are free.


You may need to make big purchases in order to earn enough points for a gift card. Try to make purchases that you would normally make at another store to keep the cost of the gift card down. Making extra purchases just to receive the gift card will defeat the purpose.
Members are usually given the opportunity to sign up with program sponsors for products or services; you do not have to accept in order to become a member or to earn points towards future free gift cards.

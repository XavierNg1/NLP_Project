 Buy your British shorthair cat from a breeder recognized as trustworthy by the International Cat Association, the Cat Fanciers Association, or a similar organization. This way, you will be sure to get a cat that has been raised properly and had its health certified.You could also ask your local veterinarian which breeders are reputable.
British shorthairs are relatively rare, and you’re unlikely to find one in a shelter. You might occasionally see one available in local classified ads or at pet shops, but the best way to get a healthy cat is to obtain one through a breeder.
 When buying a British shorthair cat, be on the lookout for breeders who have kittens available all the time or have multiple litters available. The ability to pay online with a credit card should also be considered a warning sign., When shopping for a British shorthair cat, keep an eye on the environment the cat is kept in. If the cats are isolated in cramped cages or pens, or if their living conditions are unsanitary and dirty, you should not buy a British shorthair from that breeder. Cats raised in such conditions are harder to socialize later, and could suggest health problems., Sometimes you will have to wait many months before you can get the cat you want from a breeder. Reputable breeders will not sell kittens until they’ve been weaned from their mothers after they’re 12 to 16 weeks old. Spend time researching exactly what you want in your British shorthair cat and locate a trustworthy breeder who will work with you.

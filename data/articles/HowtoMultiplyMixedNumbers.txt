, An improper fraction is a number that has a numerator that is larger than its denominator. You can convert a mixed number to an improper fraction in just these easy steps:



Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction.
If you are converting the number 41/2 to an improper fraction, you would first multiply the whole number 4 by the denominator of the fraction which is 2. So, 4 x 2 = 8

Add this number to the numerator of the fraction.
So adding 8 to the numerator 1, we get 8 + 1 = 9.

Place this new number over the original denominator of the fraction.
The new number is 9, so you can place it over 2, the original denominator.
The mixed number 41/2 converts to the improper fraction 9/2.

Follow exactly the same steps as described above:



Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction.
If you are converting the number 62/5 to an improper fraction, you would first multiply the whole number 6 by the denominator of the fraction which is 5. So, 6 x 5 = 30

Add this number to the numerator of the fraction.
So adding 30 to the numerator 2, we get 30 + 2 = 32.

Place this new number over the original denominator of the fraction.
The new number is 32, so you can place it over 5, the original denominator.
The mixed number 62/5 converts to the improper fraction 32/5.
 Once you've converted each of your mixed numbers to improper fractions, you can multiply them. To multiply the numbers, just multiply their numerators and multiply their denominators.


To multiply 9/2 and 32/5, you should multiply the numerators, 9 and 32. So 9 x 32 = 288.
Next, multiply the denominators, 2 and 5, to get 10.
Place the new numerator over the new denominator to get 288/10.
 To reduce your fraction to the lowest terms, find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF), which is the biggest number that is divisible by both the numerator and the denominator. Then divide the numerator and denominator by this number.


2 is the greatest common factor of both 288 and 10. Divide 288 by 2 to get 144, and divide 10 by 2 to get 5.288/10 is reduced to 144/5.
 Since the question is in mixed number form, the answer should be in mixed number form as well. To convert it to the mixed number, you have to work backwards to get your answer. Here's how you do it:


First, divide the top number by the bottom number.
Do long division to divide 5 into 144. 5 goes 28 times into 144. This means that the quotient is 28. The remainder, or the number that is left over, is 4.
Make your quotient the new whole number. Take your remainder and place it over the original denominator to finish converting the improper fraction into a mixed number.
The quotient is 28, the remainder is 4, and the original denominator was 5, so 144/5 expressed as a mixed fraction is 284/5.

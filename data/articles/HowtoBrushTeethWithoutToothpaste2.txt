 As with homemade toothpaste, tooth powder can be made using a variety of recipes. Often these natural products may sound a bit baffling — clay on your teeth? — so understanding the reasoning behind the ingredients in a sample tooth powder recipe is important:


Bentonite clay: this natural clay can bind to toxins in your body — including the mercury that may be found in dental fillings. It is also rich in materials that can nourish teeth and gums.
Baking soda: baking soda is a wonderful natural abrasive, and its alkaline qualities neutralize damaging acid.
Sage: sage is a natural tooth-whitener and astringent.
Xylitol: this natural sweetener is an important pH neutralizer and will help make homemade tooth powder more palatable. Be aware that xylitol is toxic to cats and dogs, so keep it out of your pet's reach.
Sea salt: sea salt contains tooth-strengthening minerals and can alleviate gum inflammation. Don't use too much salt as large amounts may lead to swollen gums.
Peppermint: peppermint has antibacterial, antiseptic, and pain-relieving properties in addition to its breath-freshening qualities.
 Use a non-metal spoon as some metals may react with your ingredients.


Mix 2 tablespoons bentonite clay, 2 tablespoons baking soda, 1 tablespoon dried, finely ground sage leaf, 1 tablespoon xylitol, and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt.
Drip 15 to 20 drops of peppermint essential oil into mixture and stir thoroughly to combine.
Place in a container or jar with a tight-fitting lid, or consider placing in a squirt-top container (the grain of your mixture will be fine enough to "squirt"). Avoid metal containers.
Store in a dry location.
 Dip your toothbrush in the powder, or squirt from your squirt-top bottle onto your damp toothbrush. Use just as you would commercial toothpaste.

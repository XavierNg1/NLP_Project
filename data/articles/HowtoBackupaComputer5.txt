 You can backup individual files to a USB stick, an external drive, cloud storage, CDs, floppy drives (if your system is very old or you are feeling a little ironic), or any number of other storage devices. Which you choose will depend on how much storage is needed and the level of security you would prefer.
 Copy all of the files you would like backed up to a folder on the computer. The files can be further subdivided into more folders if you wish.


Putting all of the files into a single folder will make transferring them easier and will keep you from accidentally missing files if there are a large number. It will also allow you to keep the backup files easily distinguished from other files which may be on the storage device.
 You can compress this backup folder if you want to. This will be especially helpful if there are a large number of files or the files are very large.
 You can encrypt or password protect either the folder or zip file, depending on the route you have decided to take. This will give you added security if the files are of a sensitive nature. Just be sure you donâ€™t forget the password.
 Once the folder or zip file is ready, copy it to the device using copy-paste and navigating between the devices or saving the item to your cloud storage (if you have chosen that option).
 If you have backed up the files to a storage device like a USB stick, you may want to also save them to another computer, should you need the device for something else or want to be sure that the files are safe should the device be lost.

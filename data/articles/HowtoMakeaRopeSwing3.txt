 Scout your property for a good sized tree and make sure it is sturdy. Look for thick tree branches that extend at least 15 feet from the ground. Make sure the tree is in good health and can take the strain of a rope swing.


You don’t have to use a ladder to tie the knots., Once you’ve found a good branch, you need to measure the height from where the swing will hang. You need to leave three feet of slack for knots. Once you’ve measured how long each rope should be, cut two identical strands of rope., This is a common knot for creating a rope swing. Create two small coils close to each other and then layer them on top of each other. Thread the closest edge of the rope through the two coils. Then swing that edge around the rope above the two coils and thread it back through the coils.


Open up the hole underneath the coils and secure the knot that the coils have created.You’ll need to make this knot for each strand of rope.
 Toss the knotted edge over the branch you’ve selected. Pass the other end of the string through the hole and tighten it until the knot is in place on the branch. Repeat this process to the other rope.


Adjust your rope into the right position before tightening.
 Once the two ropes are in the proper place, tie an additional double-bowline knot onto the dangling rope. Once you’ve secured the two holes, attach the two carabiners to the ropes end. You should now have a balanced and sturdy rope swing.

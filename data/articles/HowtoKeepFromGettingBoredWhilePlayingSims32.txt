Make a couple who have conflicting traits (example Sim 1 has the "slob, couch potato, hates the outdoors, unflirty and heavy sleeper" traits and Sim 2 has the "neat, athletic, loves the outdoors, flirty and light sleeper" traits. Move them in together in a small house, see how long they last.
 Make a Sim who has traits such as evil and hotheaded. Make them visit public places such as the park and make them argue with everyone. Try to make them enemies with as many people as possible.
 Make a Sim with traits such as flirty and good kisser. Try to make them have a romantic relationship with every possible male/female Sim within the town. See how long it takes before they get caught out.
 Make a Sim with traits like good and friendly. Try to make them be best friends with everyone in the town.
 Devils have red skin, which you can change by clicking the circle near the skin tone meter and experimenting with different tones of red! It is easier to make a male devil as they have a choice of spiky hair.
 Look around the graveyard for people who have died and make an evil and green skinned Sim! Give them the same name as any dead Sim of your choice, and you can even make a family of zombies!

, Get black skinned Sims and give them black clothes for everyday, formal, sleepwear, athletic and swimwear.
 This can be really fun! If you're making Medusa and the Gorgons, don't forget to place lots of Medusa Victim sculptures in their house.
 Steve is simple, just give him a cyan shirt, blue trousers, grey shoes, purple eyes and brown hair for all outfits.
 Give them the Neurotic trait as freaking out will look perfect when howling at the moon or meeting normal human Sims.
 Have fun with your new Sims!

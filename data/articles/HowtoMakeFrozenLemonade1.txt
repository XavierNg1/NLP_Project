 Don't worry about turning the ice into slush just yet. You just want to break the ice up. This recipe will give you more of a slushy-like consistency; it will not be smooth like a smoothie.;
, Fill a pitcher with 2 cups (475 milliliters) of water, and add the powdered lemonade into it. How much powdered lemonade you add will depend on what brand you are using; in general, it will be about 1 tablespoon per 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. Stir it briskly with a whisk until combined.
 The ice should be mostly broken up. It won't be completely smooth, and there may be some larger chips left, like in a slushy.
 If the lemonade is too sweet, add some more water. If the lemonade is too sour, add some sugar.
 This is enough to make two large servings, or four smaller ones. You can also garnish it with a mint leaf and/or a lemon slice for a touch of color.

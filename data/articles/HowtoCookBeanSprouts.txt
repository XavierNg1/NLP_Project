 Remove them from the oil when they are tender--usually 2-to-3 minutes—and mix them with an oil-and-vinegar salad dressing. Allow them to marinate for 10-to-15 minutes before serving them as a salad option. Mound them on a frise blend to extend them.
 Add the mixture to your blender and puree them to make a dip. Add your favorite herbs, such as dill, basil or oregano, as well as salt and pepper to taste. Serve the dip with torn pita bread or tortillas.
 Add scallions, garlic and your choice of cooked vegetables. Beat 2 eggs with a little bit of water. Pour the eggs into the pan and scramble all of the ingredients together.
 Add the sprouts and cook them for 3-to-4 minutes. Add chopped green onions and grated carrots and cook them for 1 minute longer. Add soy sauce and rice wine.

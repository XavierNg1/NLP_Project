 If you are truly terrified and you live alone, you may feel more comfortable if you invite someone over. Call up a friend, sibling, parent, or your significant other and ask them to spend the night. Having someone else in your home can make you feel safer and more secure, and will also distract you from your fear., Some people feel more secure with all their doors closed, while others may prefer to have them all open. Decide which will make you feel better, and act accordingly. Just be sure to lock any exterior doors and windows., If youâ€™re afraid of the dark, leaving a light on can help you feel better. Choose a light in the hall or bathroom, or turn on a lamp or nightlight in your bedroom. You could also leave the television on and mute it so the soft light illuminates your surroundings., If you are nice and cozy, you will have an easier time falling asleep. Put on your most comfortable pajamas, or sleep in the nude. Plump up your pillow and snuggle into your sheets and blankets. Adjust the thermostat so you are at a comfortable temperature, or turn on a fan or heater.

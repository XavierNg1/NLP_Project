 There is no need for complicated lists, but a simple checklist with everything you think you need is a good start.;
, I'm a girl, and I hate to shop. I know you guys agree with me. But, unfortunately it is inevitable. Just pick up a few spare things. Toiletries,books, mags, etc. That you want or need.
 Packing light is the best road to take. Depending on the length of your trip, bring a roomy backpack or a shoulder bag.
 One backpack is perfect for clothes (rolling them up makes them easier to fit,)but you can carry another smaller bag for car entertainment, (books, magazines, iPod.) Put your clothes in the trunk and keep the other with you at all times.
 Stuff a cooler with nuts, fruits, crackers, and other nibbles. Soda, juice, and lots of water are also handy, but steer clear of salty foods and do not drink too much water, as you will have to pee sooner or later.
 When you get in the car, choose a good seat and make it yours! You'll be stuck here for awhile, so make sure it is comfy and roomy.
 Every road trip has stops, so make them count. Use the restroom, get a meal, grab a snack. A good tradition is stopping ONCE along the way to satisfy your sweet tooth. Other stops should be filled with healthy foods and good meals.
 Pajamas and Flip flops are good for guys and girls, but shorts and tanks are good too. Always wear flip-flops! You will want to let your feet air out. A big sweatshirt is also good for winter or nighttime trips.
 This is where you use everything in your car entertainment bag. Play games, chat w/ friends, read a book, read some magazines, and don't focus on the car ride.
 Sleep! Sleep! It passes the time so well, and it is so relaxing. Try going to bed late and waking up early the night before so you are extra tired.

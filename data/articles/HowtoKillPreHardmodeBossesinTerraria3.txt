Destroy three Shadow Orbs (found in the Corruption) with any kind of Hammer to spawn it.
Alternatively, you could use Worm Food, which is made by combing twenty Vile Powder and fifteen Rotten Chunks.


Like the Eye of Cthulhu, the fight is pretty easy. Just make sure you don't trip off a ledgeâ€”you might want the Rocket Boots.
The Eater of Worlds tends to fly around a lot, so you may want a Bow and Arrows.
 Make sure to collect its Corrupt Ore, as this is necessary to progress in the game.

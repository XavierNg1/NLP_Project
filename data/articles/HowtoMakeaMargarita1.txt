, Cut a small slit into a slice of lime and place the lime on the rim of your glass. Run the lime around the rim of your glass to wet it.
 Pour some coarse (kosher or sea) salt onto a plate. Holding your glass parallel to the plate, let its rim touch the salt and then slowly turn it.


Don’t just place the glass face-down into the salt like a cookie cutter. You want to make sure the salt is only on the outside of the glass.
Alternatively, you can use sugar instead of salt to rim the glass.
 Use large ice cubes, as smaller ones will melt more quickly and dilute your drink.
 For 1 margarita, you’ll add 1 to 2 shots of tequila. How much tequila you use will depend on your own personal tastes.


You may want to start with 1 part tequila and, if that doesn’t taste strong enough for you, you can always add more.
 For 1 margarita, you’ll add 1 shot of triple sec.
 For 1 margarita, you’ll add 1 shot of lime juice.
 Do this for at least 15 seconds to ensure that the ingredients are fully mixed.
 If you’d like to add ice to your margarita, be sure to add the ice cubes to your glass before pouring the drink (just to avoid splashing).
 If you’d like, you can also add a splash of Tabasco sauce.
 If you’re unsatisfied with the suggested ratios in this recipe, consider trying some of the following ones (tequila: triple sec: lime juice):


3:2:1
3:1:1
7:4:3
8:1.5:3 (to reduce the triple sec flavor)

 The Eiffel Tower website offers two types of tickets online: elevator access to the top of the tower or elevator access to the first two floors. Tickets purchased online are stamped with an entrance time and you cannot use the ticket before or after your time stamp. If you prefer to take the stairs, you will have to purchase your tickets at the tower because stair only tickets are not available for purchase online.;
, There are many modes of transportation in Paris or Europe that will get you to the tower. You can choose to take the Metro, a bus, a bike, a boat or a car.
 Guided tours are available for those visitors who not only want to enjoy the views, but also desire to learn about the Eiffel Tower's history and construction. Guests on guided tours get to see the machine room that operates the elevator and a secret bunker under the Champ de Mars.
 This floor offers the panoramic views of Paris and is a popular spot for taking photos. It also houses the vision well, which is a glass window with a view to ground level. While you are on the second floor, browse in the gift shop for some souvenirs or grab a bite to eat at the Jules Verne Restaurant, which offers French cuisine.
 Guests may enjoy a chilled glass of either rose or white champagne at the bar, which is open until 10 p.m. daily. Gustave Eiffel's office is also on the top floor. It is home to a wax figure display of both Gustave Eiffel and Thomas Edison.
 Each hour, every hour, the tower is lit up for 5 minutes. Not only is the reflection on the River Sienne a beautiful sight, but so are all the lights in Paris or Europe.

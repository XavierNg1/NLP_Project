 Some smart snack choices that have a low calorie density (which means that you can eat more of them) include:

Raw veggies with 2 tablespoons of low-fat or 1 tablespoon of regular salad dressing






1 cup sliced strawberries and 6 ounces of light yogurt






1 whole-wheat tortilla (1-1/2 ounces) with 2 tablespoons of reduced-fat cheese and salsa







, Eat a snack when you know that you are vulnerable to grazing or overeating. Keep ready-to-eat snacks like cups of raw vegetables or fruit on hand.


Invest in a small, soft-sided cooler. Pack your cooler with light yogurt, half a sandwich, cut vegetables or a couple of pieces of fruit.






List 6 to 8 healthy snacks that you can rotate throughout the week.






Coordinate your snacks with your activity schedule. For example, eat a small snack for energy before you work out and another small snack to restore your energy reserves after you work out.
 For example, if you need to eat a serving of dairy, try one of these 100 to 150-calorie snacks:

Broccoli florets with savory yogurt dip






Small apple and a mozzarella cheese stick






Smoothie of 1/2 cup yogurt, half a banana, 1/2 cup strawberries and ice






Cup of yogurt and sliced peaches







, Instead of buying packaged junk food that tempts you to eat too much of a high calorie density food, choose low calorie density packaged snacks like single serve packages of fruits and vegetables, low-fat cheese, guacamole or hummus for both yourself and your family.

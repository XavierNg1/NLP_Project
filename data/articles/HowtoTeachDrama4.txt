 Maintaining good behavior in drama class can be a little more challenging than it is in other types of classes, since the students are actually encouraged to goof around. Set up some rules that are specific to your class that will help you prevent and respond to any behavioral issues.Encourage your students to take part in making the rules. Ask them what they think class rules should be, and post the ideas you agree with.
Include rules like “Always be friendly and helpful” and “Encourage each other to be creative.”

, Especially in a drama class, where dramatic behavior is literally encouraged, students will test the boundaries. When they break a specific rule that the class has been made aware of, quickly stop class and address the problem.Consistency and quickness are vital here. Don’t let your class get out of hand by stopping a poor behavior before it escalates or spreads.
 For instance, have a student who broke a rule sit out the next exercise and think about why they shouldn’t have acted as they did. Before rejoining the group, have them pantomime their bad behavior, and then act out the good behavior they’re going to maintain the rest of class.Alternatively, ask for an “actor’s promise” from the student who broke a rule. This is especially good for a student who is hesitant to participate in acting exercises.
Have the student prepare and give a statement after sitting out and exercise. Encourage them to act apologetic – or to be funny – and ask that they specifically promise to honor the class and their classmates moving forward.

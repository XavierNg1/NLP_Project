 You don't actually need a hutch, you could just use a shed which is attached to a playpen, so they get the warmth and fresh air they need. But if you are deciding to get a hutch, make sure it's big enough, because in some pet shops they are not spacious. You will know if the house is big enough because your rabbit can hop nine times in a row and his ears won't touch the top of the roof. Also make sure it is waterproof so no water comes in because your rabbit will get damp and become ill. Make sure it's warm enough so your rabbit is nice and warm especially in winter.
 An ideal space to put a rabbit house is in a place which is dry and is also in shade. Make sure that the hutch/shed is away from predators., Provide sawdust or hay and animal bedding or recycled paper for its bed. But if you getting a shed for your rabbit, just fill the rabbit's bed with recycled paper or bedding for animals. Make sure you put carpet down so your rabbit's feet don't get cold., It would be really boring for a rabbit to have a house without any toys, so make sure you include them. Also provide them with a hay and vegetable rack, drink bottle and food bowl. Provide it with toys such as paper bags filled with flowers treats food and hay and grass, a ball filled with nuggets and toilet tubes. you can also get lots of other stuff to customize your rabbits home!

 Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc or enter task manager into Windows Search. This is the built-in tool for Windows that allows you to monitor your performance and force close any programs that are no longer responding.
 In the Applications tab, your currently running programs will be listed. Programs that are working will show "Running" in the Status bar, while programs that are frozen will display "Not Responding".


In Windows 8, the default Task Manager view will show your running applications in the "Apps" section and processes in the "Processes" section of the Processes tab. Frozen programs will display "Not Running".
 Select the program and click End task. Windows will display a message warning you that any unsaved data will be lost. Click OK to force the program to close.
 If you are having difficulties closing the program in the Applications tab, you can open the Processes tab to force close the program at the operating system level, which is more likely to work.


In Windows 8, click the "More details" button at the bottom of the Task Manager to open the list of Processes.
 In the Processes tab, programs are listed by their file names, which can make locating the program you are trying to close a little more difficult. You will see many more options than the Applications tab, because this list includes all of the background processes running on your computer.


Closing the wrong processes may close essential programs such as antivirus or the Windows Explorer. If you accidentally close the wrong programs, you can restart your computer to restore full functionality.
 Select the process you want to end and click End Process. You will be asked to confirm that you want to force the process to stop. It should close immediately.

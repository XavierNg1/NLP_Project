 Pour the milk into a microwave-safe bowl. Whisk in the pumpkin puree, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla.









For a more subtle pumpkin flavor, reduce the pumpkin puree to 1 tablespoon (15 grams).
Make sure that you are using plain pumpkin puree. The pumpkin pie blend has too many additional ingredients.
 Poke a vent hole in the middle with a fork or skewer. This will allow the steam to escape.
 How long this takes depends on the strength of your microwave. For most microwaves, however, this should take only 1 to 2 minutes.
 You can do this with a handheld mixer or with a standard whisk. It will take about 30 seconds.
 You can used freshly-brewed coffee or instant coffee, but make sure that it is strong. If you use regular coffee, the latte will be too milky. You can also use 1 to 2 shots of espresso instead.
 If you need to, give it quick stir with a spoon.
 For an extra burst of flavor, top it off with a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice. You can also use nutmeg or cinnamon instead.

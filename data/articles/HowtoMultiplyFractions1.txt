 The two fractions should be written down so that their numerators are aligned with their denominators.

Ex: 2/4 * 2/4;
, Since the numerators are both 2, you can multiply 2 * 2 to get 4.
 Since the denominators are both 4, just multiply 4 * 4 to get 16.

Your answer is a fraction comprised of the new numerator and the new denominator. Your answer is 4/16.
 To simplify a fraction, you have to divide its numerator and denominator by the largest number that can go into both numbers evenly. In the case of 4/16, 4 is the largest number that goes into both numbers evenly, so you should divide both the numerator and denominator by 4. Here's how you do it:

4/4 = 1
16/4 = 4
Your new fraction and final answer is 1/4.

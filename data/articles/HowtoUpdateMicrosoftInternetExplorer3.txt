 If an update for Edge is available, Edge will need to be closed in order for the process to complete.
 To do so, either click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen or press the âŠž Win key.
 It's in the lower-left corner of the Start window. Doing so will open the Settings page.
 You'll see this option near the bottom of the Settings page.
 It's a button near the top of the Update & Security page.
 Once you see "Your device is up to date" displayed at the top of the page, your Microsoft Edge browser has been updated.

 Pull it down (while still wearing safety equipment) and dispose of it in a large plastic bag that can be tied off. If the nest was in an enclosed area such as a ventilation duct or air conditioner port, a long, serrated bread knife may be useful in removal.


Seal up any entrance holes that you can gauge by checking around. This will help to discourage future hornet intrusion.
 A small nest is a simple affair to remove––squirt the chemicals and yank it down, while a large one may require a repeat of this whole process.

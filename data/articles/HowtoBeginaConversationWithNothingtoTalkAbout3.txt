 Complement the person you are trying to talk to. I doesn't really matter what you say, examples:


"I like those shoes"
"Nice shirt! Where did you get it?"

,, Do you shop at the store they got their shoes at? Did you notice anything about that store? Maybe you never been there and wanted to go there? Tell them WHY you wanted to go there.

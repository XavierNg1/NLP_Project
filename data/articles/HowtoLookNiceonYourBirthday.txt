 Brush your teeth again and use mouthwash. Wash your hair clean with shampoo and conditioner. (You can also oil your hair an hour before you wash it for added shine!) You want to make sure you're clean, because that falls under the basics of looking good!;
, Like we said before, it's your day. Don't camouflage yourself in the room. Stand out. The moment people enter the room, their eyes should fall on you. Make it obvious whose party it is. Of course, you also need to intelligently choose your outfit. For example, if its freezing, you can't wear a little black dress just because it will stand out. You want to stand out in a good way! Choose something chic and comfortable all at the same time. (You can read more on choosing the perfect stuff on the Internet).
 Sweatpants and a loose t-shirt are a good bet, because that will ensure you're comfortable while you get ready and you won't stain your clothes with anything.
 Study a few styles beforehand and try them out. You don't want a catwalk catastrophe at the last moment, do you? For example, if you're going for a pretty fishtail braid or something, practice a few times. If you're leaving it loose, style it well! Determine what suits you and go for it.
 Start with concealing your little zits and black heads. Go for your desired look, but don't overdo it. A face packed with make up can be uncomfortable, too. If you can't do it right, get someones help.
 Make sure you're comfortable.
, Who wants the pain of dressing up from scratch for a second time?

, Remember, its your day. Make the most of it. However, don't go blabbing that sentence to all your guests- you don't want to come off as a snob!

, As they say, a smile is the best accessory!

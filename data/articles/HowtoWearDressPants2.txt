 A break is how far the fold or crease at the bottom of your pants in the middle of the leg comes down on your shoe. No break means that the bottom of your pants only slightly touch the top of your shoes, if it touches at all. This look is great for a trendy, modern style, and it also works well on slim and short people., A slight break means that the front of the pants covers a small part of the top of the shoes. This is a good choice if you want to stay up-to-date, but aren’t into trends. A slight break works for pretty much everyone., A medium break comes down a little bit lower than a slight break. This type of break will cover about a ½” (1.3 cm) of your shoe. This look is ideal for someone with a conservative style. A medium break is also good for someone who wants to wear dress pants with a cuff., A full break comes down the farthest on your shoe. A full break covers about an inch (2.5 cm) of your shoe. This look is considered to be a bit out of style, but it works for someone who is going for a vintage look or is heavier set. The pants should be fairly wide in the calf or ankle for a full break to look right.

 The best time of year to find them is around Christmas, when you are receiving presents and ordering things by mail. Choose 5 to 10 boxes that are of similar size and shape., Lay your boxes on a table with the openings toward you and measure how long they are. You want to use enough boxes so that it is approximately the same measurement or slightly smaller., Take them all outside and spray paint the inside of the boxes and the sides with the paint color of your choice. Leave them in a well-aired place while they dry according to the can's instructions., Measure the length and width of the side., This is the material you will use to cover the cardboard. You can also use drawer lining or wallpaper., Spray the side with strong spray adhesive or paint fabric glue on it. Place the fabric strip on top of the boxes, making sure the boxes align right next to each other., Use the spray adhesive again and then align the back piece. Allow it to dry and then repeat on the remaining side., Put a length of rope through the back slit and knot well in the inside of the box., You may choose to put it at a side or in the center. Make sure the bottom box rests on the floor., Knot the rope and cut off any excess. Although the fabric will hold your boxes together, the rope will keep it from moving or falling when weighted down with clothes., You can organize everything from sweaters to scarves to socks.

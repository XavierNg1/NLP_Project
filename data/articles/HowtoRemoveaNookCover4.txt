 If your nook has an SD card, it is located on the right side of the Nook. Remove the SD card before you do anything else because removing the back can potentially break the SD card. Set it aside somewhere that you won’t lose it.
 Use the plastic tool that came with your Nook or another thin plastic tool. Don’t use a metal tool or you might scratch something. Locate the power button on top of the Nook. Insert the tool under the edge of the power button. Gently pop the power button off., The screw has a tamper sticker over it, so remove the sticker. Be wary that this voids your warranty. Use a size T5 Torx screwdriver to remove the screw. Make sure that you set the screw aside somewhere that you won’t lose it.
 Place the Nook face down on a non-scratch surface. Gently press down on the back cover and push it toward the USB port. The back will slide off easily at this point.

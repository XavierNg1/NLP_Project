 The consequences may still be harsh, especially if your teacher is mistrustful or you often forget your homework.;
, Don't try to make something up on the spot, it's not going to work unless you're a born actor. Have a vague idea of your excuse, but when you tell your teacher don't rush through it.
 You don't want to sound too rehearsed, but of course don't stammer too much.
 If you go to school by bus or car you can always do a bit of it then, or in the library before lessons or any free time you get. Even if you don't finish it, it gives a better impression to have at least some of it done.
 Make it believable and not uncommon, and not something the teachers will overly look into. Look upset or frustrated that you couldn't do your homework.
 Excuses such as 'I forgot' can be used repeatedly but your teachers will think of you as disorganized, which will go into your reports, which your parents will see, and if the teachers ever refer you for a job it will end up there, so beware!

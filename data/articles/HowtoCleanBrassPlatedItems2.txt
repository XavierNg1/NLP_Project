 Ammonia is gentle enough that it won't remove the brass-plating, but strong enough that it will remove much of the grime. Use a soft cloth to apply the ammonia to the brass. Rinse it off thoroughly., Another option for heavier tarnish (once you've cleaned the item with soap and water, plus dried it) is a brass cleaner that is designed to be used on brass-plated items. Rub it in with a soft cloth, and wash it off with warm water.Test the cleaner first in a hidden area.
 Once you've cleaned the item and rinsed off any excess cleaner, always take the time to dry it thoroughly. You don't want to leave it wet, so use a soft cloth to dry it off.

 Whenever wireless Internet is available as an option, you should prioritize it over using data--even if your phone's data is faster than the Wi-Fi.

Many public locations, such as coffee shops, have "free" Wi-Fi insofar as you must make a purchase in order to obtain the password.;
, Using data-rich sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram while on data will quickly add up, especially since most of these services will load videos as you scroll through your feed., If you must browse while using data, avoid using sites' apps (e.g., YouTube or Facebook), and instead use the mobile site. You can typically access the mobile version of a site by typing "www.m..com" into your Android's browser.

For example, you would access the mobile version of Facebook by typing "www.m.facebook.com" into your Android's browser.
 Storing media such as music, photos, and videos locally rather than streaming them will save you hundreds of megabytes' (if not several gigabytes') worth of data., While texting over data generally constitutes a negligible amount of data use, sending large photos or videos will make a dent in your monthly data limit.

The same goes for uploading photos or videos to Facebook, Instagram, and other social media.
 In Google Maps, for example, you can download a map of an area while connected to Wi-Fi and then use the offline map to navigate without using data.

Offline use also applies to some cloud storage apps (e.g., OneDrive), YouTube Red subscribers, and Spotify Premium users.

Flapper dresses with lots of fringe were also popular. Neutral colors were in fashion, as well as bright accent colors such as red, coral, jade green, yellow and deep blue.

, A makeup entered the mainstream in the 1920s, women began to wear dark red lips and smoky black eyes. For your hairstyle, try finger waves for long hair or straight hair with the bottom curled in for shorter hair.
 Finish your look with fishnet stockings and black or red heels, then add period-appropriate accessories. Wear a long strand of pearls tied in a knot about halfway down, or a thick, Asian-inspired cuff. Try a sparkly headband over your forehead or an embellished comb in your hair. For an extra costume-like effect, wear a feather boa and put a tiny toy gun in a thigh holster.

 Once you spot a Like Like, press the Action button on your controller where the bomb is equipped to take out a bomb., Once the monster approaches you, press the Action button again to throw one directly at the monster, and it will suck the bomb., The bomb will go off inside the Like Like’s body, killing it.

As you wait for the bomb to go off, it’s best that you back away from the monster to avoid being sucked in.
 If the Like Like did manage to devour you, the shield or tunic it stole from you will drop to the ground once you defeat it. Walk towards the items it dropped to take back your precious items.

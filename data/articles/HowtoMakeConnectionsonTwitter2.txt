 As well as retweeting a message, choose to include a reply "@theirusername" and say "thanks, I loved this" or a similar comment. This is a great way to achieve a more personal connection and get the person to follow you, if they don't do so already. Everyone loves knowing that their tweets are reaching their followers and being appreciated.
 Just like regular friends, Twitter friendships and connections get stronger the more consistently you interact. Become part of conversations with people you follow, and you will begin to connect.
 Direct messages are private messages between two users, invisible to the public. Use this to communicate with close friends, family colleagues and people you have developed close connections with.


Direct messages that are sent to people you don't know very well may go unanswered. However, if you are trying to arrange a business meeting or ask for advice, it may be a way to get to know someone better. Never ask for personal information, or you may be reported as a Twitter spammer.
You can only send direct messages to users who are following you.
 TweetDeck is a popular Internet, iPad and phone application because it displays the homepage, replies and direct messages in a user-friendly way.

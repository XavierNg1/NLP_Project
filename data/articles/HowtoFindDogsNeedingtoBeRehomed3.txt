 Keep an eye out around your community for dogs that are stray, abandoned, or otherwise kept in poor living conditions. Check areas such as parks, alleys, or anywhere else a dog might be able to scavenge first.If you notice a dog living in poor conditions, such as being harmed or kept outdoors in inclement or threatening conditions, contact your local Animal Control office or Humane Society to file a formal report. Do not pursue the dog yourself.
Be prepared for the increased vet expenses that can come with helping a stray or abandoned dogs. These dogs are often malnourished and may have other physical problems that need immediate medical attention.
 Veterinary offices often get notices about pets that need a new home. Work with vets in your area to see if they get any information about dogs that need rehoming.Some vet offices may have a bulletin or notifications board you can check for this information.
Pets are also sometimes abandoned at a vetâ€™s office. Work with your vet to get notifications if a dog is abandoned at their practice.
 Check with your local animal control or animal rescue department to see if they work with volunteers. If so, volunteer and use your work as an opportunity to find and help dogs that need to be rehomed.Remember that these dogs need to go through the proper channels before they get to you. This means that they need to be reported to and checked out by animal control before they can be released or adopted.
Only volunteer if you are committed to working with your animal rescue department and following their rules and protocol.

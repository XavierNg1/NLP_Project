 Crackled lip colour is almost as unattractive as bright red lipstick on your teeth.;
, Use a nude shade of lip liner if you'll be applying sheer or neutral lipstick. Otherwise, try to match it to the colour lipstick you'll be wearing.
 This provides a base for your lipstick to stick to. Avoid filling in your "inner lips" - where the teeth naturally hits the lip.
 Preferably, use a lip brush for this so you have more control of where the colour goes. Be sure to apply your lipstick evenly and within the lip lines. Optionally, apply lipgloss after this step.
 Form an O with your mouth around your finger, and gently slide your finger straight out of your mouth. Any lip colour that was on your inner lips is now on your finger. This step is crucial, as lip colours on the inner lips will rub off onto teeth after you've left the mirror.
 If you see any lip colour on your teeth, gently rub it off with your pinky finger.

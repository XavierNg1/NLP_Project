 Do this by moving the decimal point two spaces to the left, or dividing them by 100. For example, 30% and 70% would be 0.3 and 0.7 as decimals.;
, The multiplication of decimals is similar to that of whole numbers, with a few differences.


Remember that you do not need to line up the decimal point while you multiply, as you will be ignoring the decimal points as you do so. When you have your product, you will then count the total number of values behind the decimal point, and move the decimal point that number of places.
 If you had 0.25 as your product, for instance, you would multiply it by 100 to get a product of 25%.
, For example, if you had 50% and 25%, you would rewrite them as 50/100 and 25/100. Then simplify as needed; in the given example, 50/100 would simplify to 1/2, and 25/100 would simplify to 1/4.
 Remember that when multiplying fractions, the denominators do not have to be the same; you will multiply the numerators and denominators. In the example above, 1/2 x 1/4 would equal 1/8, or 0.125.
 In the example above, your percentage value would be 12.5%, since 0.125 x 100 equals 12.5%.

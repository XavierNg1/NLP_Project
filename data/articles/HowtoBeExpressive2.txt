 This can help keep your voice from becoming monotone.You should always speak loudly enough so that everyone who is listening can hear you, but you can vary the volume to make it more interesting. Be careful that you aren't shouting, though!


When you are telling a story you can begin quietly and raise the volume as you reach the climax of the story.
 This is very important for being more expressive. If you raise your pitch, your voice will become slightly higher, if you lower your pitch, it will become slightly deeper. For example, when asking a question, most people tend to raise the pitch.If you want to make a positive statement, or agree with an idea, ending a statement on a slightly lower pitch is a good idea. If you want to create doubt in your listener, end in a slightly higher pitch.If you want to sound authoritative, you should maintain a slightly lower pitch., When speaking, this can be difficult. Often a pause of even a few seconds can seem like an eternity if you are a bit shy in social situations. However, using pauses creates drama and makes you appear more confident.Pausing can also give listeners a chance to absorb what you have said.Donâ€™t pause for too long! A few seconds should be sufficient.
 If you find that you have a hard time being expressive with your voice, then keep practicing!


You can do this by practicing speeches by yourself, in front of a mirror.
You could also do this in a public speaking class, or with a trusted friend or teacher. However you do it, the only way to get better is to keep trying!

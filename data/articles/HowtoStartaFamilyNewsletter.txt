 Depending on the amount of time you are able to spare, you should decide within the range of once every two months to once a week.;
, Microsoft Word is a common choice, because they have some templates you can use, clip art to enhance the newsletter's appearance, and numerous other advantages. However, if you find something else that works (Corel WordPerfect, LibreOffice Writer or Serif PagePlus), good for you!

, Two to five pages would be sufficient.
 An audience could be grandparents, parents, siblings, relatives, and other family members.
 You may also make a website (not from scratch, but more of something like Google sites, don't spend money on this part).
 If your last name is Smith, for example, you could call it "The Smith Family Newsletter" or "The Family Times".
 When they send it to your newsletter's email address (if you made one), then copy/paste the submission into where you'll type the newsletter.
 Either way, it's a good idea to use bright colors and/or pictures so your family newsletter doesn't have a dull look.
 This means that let's say you have a sister named Kate and a cousin named John, then you could tell Kate to write about school, and John to write all about guitars. Then, they send in their jobs to you, and you put them in the newsletter.
 You may print it for yourself, but it's an ideal choice to post the newsletter on your site (if you make one) when it comes out. Otherwise, email an attachment to everyone who will receive the newsletter.
 You're done! Feel free to make any adjustments that are better for you, whatever works. Have fun making your family newsletter! Remember, the point is not to boss everyone around and make their jobs required. Take it easy, because if you make it fun, everyone will contribute!

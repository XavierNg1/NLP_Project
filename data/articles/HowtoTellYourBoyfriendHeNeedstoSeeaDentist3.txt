 Your boyfriend might be anxious about a dental visit. Letting him pick the dentist might help ease his anxiety. If you are worried about him forgetting to do this, you can sit down together to research local dentists together.


You can use a review site, such as Yelp or Health Grades, to find a highly rated dentist in your area.
You can call your general practitioner or local oral surgeons for dentist referrals as well., To make sure that he actually follows through, you can offer to call the dentists’ office for him. If he agrees, he should give you some times and dates when he is available. Once the appointment is made, he is much likelier to actually go.


You can say, "Would it help if I set up the appointment for you?"
If he wants to make the appointment himself, gently remind him every few days. You can say, "When is your appointment for the dentist?" or "Have you made that appointment yet?"
Do not make an appointment for him without his permission first.
 Ask your boyfriend if he wants you to tag along during the visit. If he has a dental phobia, your presence can help him relax. Some dentists may even let you into the suite to hold his hand during the cleaning and check-up.You can offer, “Do you want me to come with you to your appointment? I can be there with you and make sure everything is all right.”

, Another way to help calm him during his visit is to give him relaxing music to listen to. Load his music player with his favorite music. When he is sitting in the chair, he can listen to it through his headphones.

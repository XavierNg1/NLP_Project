 Make sure that the box is the correct size - you don't want the box too small or too large. (When mailing from the U.S. go to www.usps.com and go to SUPPLIES and click on FLAT RATE. You will find flat rate boxes for APO/FPO addresses. These are for troops overseas and the USPS will mail you these boxes for free. The shipping costs for the flat rate is usually cheaper than shipping by weight, depending on what you are sending.)

, It will be a lot easier for marines to carry around with them.
 If you are taking the box to a local or non-military post office, you may either be rejected (as they don't send to POs), have to pay a fee, or need to fill out a customs form. You'll also need to fill out a customs form if taken to a military post office.
 Remember to write it correctly. Use this format:

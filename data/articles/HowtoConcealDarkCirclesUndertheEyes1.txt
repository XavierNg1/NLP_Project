 Wash your face with a gentle cleanser before you start. You may also apply a lightweight under eye cream before you apply your concealer. Look for a cream that is formulated for daytime wear. Nighttime eye creams are too heavy and will not do well under your concealer.Look for an eye cream that promises to plump and strengthen the skin under your eyes.
Your eye cream should have ingredients like vitamin K, alpha hydroxyl acid, or hydroquinone.;
, A concealer with peach or pink undertones will neutralize dark circles with blue, gray, or brown tones. Use a small pointed brush, concealer brush or your fingers to pat the concealer on the dark areas. Be careful not to rub it in. If you rub, you will move the concealer to the side and your dark areas will still be visible.If the concealer does not provide enough coverage, you may need to apply a color corrector first. If you have fair skin, a pink color corrector is best. If you have medium to dark skin, a peach or orange color corrector is best.
Only use the pads of your fingers to blend the concealer into your skin. Make a gentle, rolling motion with your fingers.
 Once your concealer is blended, set it so that it will last throughout the day. You can use a translucent setting powder. Stay away from mineral powders. These powders are shiny and may highlight the creases around your eyes.Use a small eyeshadow brush to apply the setting powder.
 Additional eye makeup will take the attention away from your dark circles. Mascara, eye liner, eye shadow, and a strong eyebrow will help people focus on other parts of your face. Also take the time to style your hair and put together a nice outfit. If you are well put together, people may not notice your dark circles.

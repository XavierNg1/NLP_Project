 Getting to know the people that you work with all day long may improve your sense of happiness at work.You may even make some new friends to spend time with outside of work in the process. Try striking up a conversation with someone new every day that you are at work and try to develop good work relationships the people that you work with most often.


For example, you might strike up a conversation with someone in the elevator by saying something like, “Hi. I’m Joe. I don’t think we have met before. What’s your name?” Or, you can give a coworker a compliment to start up a conversation by saying something like “I thought that the presentation that you gave the other day was outstanding. It really gave me some great ideas. How did you come up with that?”

, You may enjoy sitting at your desk or working in your work space if the area is inviting. If you are allowed to do so, try adding a few personal touches to your desk or work space.


For example, you can place a nice photo of you and your significant other or family, a small plant, or an inspirational figurine.
 Having something that you look forward to doing every day can improve your feelings about your job. Try to develop a simple daily ritual to add to your workday.For example, you might spend your first break of the day sipping a cup of tea and listening to an audiobook. Or you might make daily ritual out of tossing a coin into a nearby water fountain on your way home from work.
 Some of the tasks that you need to accomplish each day might be mundane, but you can make them more fun by finding ways to be creative.For example, if you have to arrange clothes on a display, try to make it look as appealing as possible by arranging the colors in a pattern. Or if you have to file some documents, make a game out of it and try to see how quickly you can find each document’s file.

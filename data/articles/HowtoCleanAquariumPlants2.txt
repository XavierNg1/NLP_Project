Do not use scented or gel bleach. They will not rinse off the plants well and can leave a chlorine or chloramine residue on the plants., Remove the plant from the aquarium and soak it in the bleach solution. Only soak a live plant for five minutes. Soak an especially delicate plant for even less time., After taking the plant out of the bleach, gently use your fingers to rub off any remaining algae. Next, submerge the plant in a bucket of clean water and soak it for another ten minutes. Remove it from the clean water and rinse it thoroughly before placing it back in the aquarium.


You can also bleach artificial plants. Soak them up to ten minutes in the bleach solution. After rinsing the plants, allow them to air dry before placing them back in the aquarium.

 Place the side pattern piece on a large piece of felt. Keep the felt and the paper as flat as possible, then slide straight sewing pins into the paper and material to hold the pattern in place. Repeat with the top pattern piece and another patch of fabric.


Use as many pins as necessary to secure the pattern to the felt, but also keep in mind that pins cause the pattern to wrinkle and bunch up, so using too many could slightly distort the shape of the felt once you cut it out.
 Use sharp sewing scissors to cut out the felt pinned to the pattern pieces.


Keep the scissors steady and rotate the felt as you cut. This will help you make a cleaner cut.
Keep the sides of the scissors blunt to the edges of the paper pattern. Doing so can prevent the the scissors from cutting at an angle and making the resulting felt piece too narrow or too wide.
Note that this first batch of felt will form the outside of your hat.
 Cut these felt pieces out, as well.


This felt will form the inner lining of your hat.
 Interfacing is a textile used on the underside of garments to help them maintain a rigid structure. Remove the pattern pieces from the second batch of felt and place them on a piece of heavy interfacing. Interfacing can be purchased at fabric or hobby stores.Pin in place, then cut the interfacing out according to the dimensions of the pattern pieces.


Interfacing is necessary since it gives the hat body and structure. Without it, the entire hat would likely collapse into itself after you sew it all together. Use a heavy interfacing for best results.

 Even if you're a pro bowler, it's unlikely that you'll have a specialized ball cleaning machine of your own. These machines are essentially tanks of water that heat to open the pores of the ball and remove deeply entrenched oil. You should be able to find one of these machines at most bowling pro shops., This service is usually relatively inexpensive, and having a professional clean and polish your ball all but ensures a thorough cleaning. Beyond that, your pro will be able to point out damage that you might otherwise not have noticed., The time it takes your pro shop to clean your ball may vary, but you can generally expect ball cleaning to take about an hour and a half. If you have a spare ball, this is just enough time for you to squeeze a few games in.Alternatively, you could run errands, tackle some chores, read a book, or play a handheld game while you're waiting. This way, you're not bored while your ball is cleaned.
 Now that your ball is cleaned and polished, it should have regained the same lane reaction as it did originally. Continue to wipe your ball with a towel after throws, and clean it after every game to maintain its condition.

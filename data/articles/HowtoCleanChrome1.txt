 As with any type of cleaning, you'll have an easier time cleaning your chrome if the water is at least warm. Fill a bucket two-thirds of the way full with warm to hot water. If there's only a small bit of chrome that needs cleaning, you can do away with the bucket, and apply the water and soap directly to a towel.;
, Once you have a bucket of hot water, add soap to it until the surface is filled with bubbles. The type of soap you use for cleaning chrome depends on the application. Although any non-abrasive soap is fine to use with chrome, choose a soap that can be used with the surrounding area as well. For example, you should use a car-specific wash when cleaning your car's exterior.A simple household cleaner should be fine for use on chrome.


If in doubt, check the label of the cleaner you're going to use. It should have some indication for materials it can and can't be used on.
 Rub the chrome gently in a smooth, circular motion. Focus on cleaning a section of chrome before moving onward. In order to prevent marks or streaks, dry the area with a separate cloth when you're done with each area.


In case the water is hot to the touch, you should only put the end of your cloth in. When the water and soap run out, you can simply dip it in again.
 For the vast majority of them, applying your soapy water to an old toothbrush and scrubbing the nooks will get the dirt off.


Although the toothbrush can be old, make sure that the majority of the bristles are still intact. Scrubbing chrome with a worn-down toothbrush is inefficient and could risk scratching the chrome if you scrub hard enough.
 After you finish washing the chrome, dry it off with a clean hand towel. Dry it in soft, circular motions to prevent streaking.
 Many kitchens stock aluminum foil. Tearing off a strip and scrubbing it over the chrome once you've cleaned off the dirt is a great DIY method to bring the shine back.

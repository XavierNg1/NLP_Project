 Be as thorough as possible when recording details about the piano. What company produced it? How old is it? What is it made of? Are there any flaws or faults potential buyers should be aware of? The more details you can provide, the better the odds you’ll find a suitable buyer match.;
, Once you have established the condition of your piano, you can narrow your search in order to find comparable items either online, in local newspapers, or in buy-and-sell publications. Pianos for sale aren’t always easy to find, but with enough digging, you should be able to come up with a rough idea of your item’s worth.
 Be sure to keep a few things in mind:



Brief is best. Only include details relevant to the advertisement. Longer ads lose people’s interest, so keep it short and to the point.

Take a photo. Classified ads and buy-and-sell magazines generally don’t include photos with their ads, but most online sites do. Having a photo of the piano gives prospective buyers a look at exactly what they’re buying, rather than having to rely exclusively on the text in the ad.

Include detailed contact information. Most people have a preferred mode of contact. Enclose a phone number and email address so that interested parties have more than one option.

Flexibility helps. If you’re willing to barter, you’ll likely draw more interest. Include your willingness to accept someone’s “Best Offer” when creating your listing so the buyer knows you’re amenable to negotiating.

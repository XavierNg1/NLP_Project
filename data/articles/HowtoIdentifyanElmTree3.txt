 Depending on your species of elm, you may or may not have flowers in the spring. European White Elms, for instance, sprout small purple flowers in early spring.Wych Elms have similar reddish purple flowers that sprout at the same time.The Caucasian Elm, by contrast, has small green flowers that also emerge in spring.English Elms sprout red flowers in small clusters early in spring.Flowers may be hidden behind the leaves of the elm if the tree has already produced leaves, so look closely before deciding whether a tree is an elm or not.
 Elm seeds form and fall from the trees in springtime soon after flowering. They are distinctive in appearance. Elm seeds are round, flat and covered by a thin, paper-like casing that hooks at the top.


Most elms bear single seeds about the size of a pea.
The seeds are encased in a green, thin, ovular case the resembles an insect wing called a samara.When mature, the seeds will change from green to a hay-like yellow-brown tone.
 Check trees in autumn when the leaves are changing colours. Many species of elm trees have leaves that will turn a bright yellow in fall, and sometimes a yellowish-purple colour. For instance, leaves on the Wych Elm and English Elm are renowned for turning bright yellow in autumn.The leaves often may be hiding blooms that are still present from late summer, so look carefully before judging whether a tree is an elm or not.
 Elms are deciduous, meaning they shed their leaves once each year, starting in the fall.By the winter, they will be bare of leaves, and then in the spring they will start to re-grow their leaves. If you notice this foliage pattern, you might have an elm.

 Tell them about you plan to get you crush, boyfriend, or, girlfriends email.
 All 3-4 of you get some paper and start "swapping" emails, obviously you would already have your friend's emails, you're only doing this to get their attention.
 Try to talk and laugh really loud (not too loud you'll look obnoxious) this will make him/her curious and they may come over to your group of friends.
 Even though it may be scary to talk to your crush, boyfriend, or girlfriend, try to sound confident and have a nice smile on your face when talking to them.
 You could also ask them yourself if you're comfortable asking.
 Write their email in your notes so you won't forget, they may not give you their email again if you ask a second time.
, Say something like "Just a test email, reply if you get this."

, You now have them hooked. Reply saying something along the lines of "Hi, how was your weekend?" (note:only ask this if it's Monday or Tuesday, otherwise it just seems odd).
 Have one of your friends casually ask him/her "Hey, did you get -insert you name here-'s test email?" He/she should then that afternoon check their email and reply to you. Understand that your crush, boyfriend, girlfriend, has other things to do and can't text you all day long.

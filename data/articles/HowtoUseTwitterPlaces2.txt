,, This will set a search in train.


If the results draw a blank, consider adding the place. You can do this by clicking "Add this place!". Enter the name of the place and its address. By default, the city you're in will already have been chosen for you.
A map will appear. If it isn't precise enough, drag the pin to the best location on the map to mark the spot.
Click on "Add this place" and the location will now appear under your tweet box. Followers will be able to click on the geo-pin next to the location name so that they can locate it on the map too.

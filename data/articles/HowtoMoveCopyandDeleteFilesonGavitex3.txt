 This will take you to your main storage folder.
 You can navigate through your folders by clicking on them.
 Do this by clicking on them one by one. The selected files will be highlighted.
 Right-click on any of the highlighted files and a submenu of tasks will show up. Select “Delete” from the menu. A confirmation message will appear.


You can also access “Delete” from the header toolbar.
 The selected files will be removed.


If you want to permanently remove the selected files, tick the “Don’t move to trash folder” option on the confirmation message box. Otherwise, leave this option blank. All deleted files moved to the Trash folder can still be recovered.

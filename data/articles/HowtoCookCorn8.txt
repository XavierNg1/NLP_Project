 Spread frozen corn kernels into an even layer in the dish.


Canned corn kernels can also be used, but there are some differences in the cooking method and length.
Frozen corn does not need to be thawed prior to cooking.
 Stir the water into the corn to disperse it throughout.


Note that this step is only needed if using frozen corn kernels. You do not need to add water if using canned corn, but you should not drain the canned corn before use.
 Use a fork to poke a few holes into the plastic wrap, providing ventilation.


Only use plastic wrap that is safe to use in the microwave.
If the dish has a cover, you could use that instead of the plastic wrap. Make sure that the cover is placed on the dish loosely so that the corn is still ventilated.
 If using canned corn, only microwave the dish for 1 to 2 minutes.The exact length of time varies depending on how much wattage your microwave has. A lower-powered microwave will need longer time, while a higher-powered microwave will need less time.
If you hear popping sounds as the corn cooks, stop the microwave early.
 Drain the cooking liquid from the corn and season as desired with butter, salt, and pepper.

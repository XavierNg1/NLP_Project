 Not all finches get along, so it’s important to look at what types of finches you want to keep. Check a compatibility guide or consult with your local avian vet to see if your finch species are known for their patterns of aggression.A single pair of zebra finches, for example, will get along well, but will fight with a second pair or with finches of another species. If you want to keep two pairs, you would likely need multiple cages. Zebra finches can be kept in larger colonies, though, provided you have the space.
Likewise, blue-faced parrot finches, cordon bleu finches, and green singing finches may do well in a single pair, but should not be mixed with other birds, including other finches of the same species.;
, The more finches you have in a single cage or aviary, the more space they will need. A single pair of finches needs a cage that is at least 24” long x 18” high x 18” wide (61 x 46 x 46 cm). This needs to be doubled for a second pair of finches.If you are going to keep a large aviary, talk with the manufacturer as well as your avian vet about how many finches they recommend for housing of that size.
 If you are keeping multiple finch cages, remember that a cage of same-sex finches should not be kept in the same room as another cage of finches of the opposite sex. Make sure you have room to keep multiple finch cages spread out throughout your house to avoid territorial aggression.If finches can hear the song of a finch of the opposite sex, they may fight with their cage mates to try to establish dominance.

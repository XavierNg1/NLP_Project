 When some people are too angry they shoot their game out of the DS like it was a rocket launcher.;
, Putting a DS game in the GBA slot is bad enough, but do NOT STICK YOUR STYLUS IN THE DS SLOT 'CAUSE YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE WHEN IT'S REALLY A MISPLACED CIRCUIT.
, A charger that's too big might stretch the outlet. A smaller charger will bend the circuit inside the outlet. A charger that works a GBA SP will also work for a 1st Gen DS, and vice versa. A 2nd Gen DS (aka DS Lite) charger will not work with anything else, even though it looks like it'll work with a GBA Micro charger will. At certain Game stop stores, you can buy a charger that will work for Nintendo DS' and GBA SP's, yet also has an attachment for the DS Lite.
 if you have a loose hinge, there are a few options. One, you can mess with it like crazy, resulting in a dysfunctional top screen, and, if you have a DSi, a basically screwed camera (Basically ripping yourself off, you did after all pay an extra 40 bucks for it, right?) Two, You can ship it to Nintendo so they can fix it. Nintendo or some other electronics company will be able to tighten or replace the hinge for 50 to 100 dollars. Three, You can simply not mess with it. Most people with loose hinges choose this option, simply because they can't survive without their DS for 2 weeks, or just because they don't want to pay 80 bucks.

 Follow the instructions above to create a neat ponytail held firmly in place in the middle of your head. Use a straightening or curling iron to help your ponytail look as neat as possible., Choose a thick strand from the underside, so you won't be able to see where it came from.
 Keep wrapping until you run out of hair. When you're finished, the hairband should be completely covered.
 You should only need one or two pins to secure the hair in place.
 Covering your hairband adds an elegant touch that makes this look appropriate for any type of event. Accent it further with pretty barrettes, and you're good to go.

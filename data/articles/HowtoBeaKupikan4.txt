 Making a club is fun, but hard. You have to constantly keep up with members, and decide who to admit and who to deny. Alternatively, you can just join another persons club.
 Using the search bar, you can search for keywords of things you like. Say you like cars, type in 'cars' and click on clubs. Maybe you'll join a super club about Hummers or race cars. You can also search a friend's page for clubs they are in. Clubs are located right below a person's "Edited" profile.

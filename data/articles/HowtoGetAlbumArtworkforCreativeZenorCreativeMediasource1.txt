 Open ZEN Media Explorer from My Computer.;
, A new window will open. Find your ZEN player in the left-hand panel. It should automatically load your player and direct you to the "Media Library" folder.
 Access your music files either by clicking Music underneath Media Library in the left-hand panel, or double-clicking Music in the main window.
 You can copy the first track either by dragging and dropping it into a specified folder on your computer (in this example, the Desktop) or other medium.


Or you can right-click the file, scroll to and click "Copy",and then move to a blank area on your folder, right-click, scroll down to and click "Paste."

, Open Creative MediaSource. Locate the target folder on your hard drive or other media, and find the song you just added. Once you have found the file, right-click it and scroll down to "Edit Track Properties."

, There will be an empty area towards the bottom that says "Cover Art." Click the "Change" button on the right.
 Locate the album cover, highlight it by clicking on the file, and click "Open." Edit other parameters as desired and click "OK."

, Go back to ZEN Media Explorer. Locate the song on your player that you wish to re-load. Either delete it and replace the song, or re-copy it to the player, answering "Yes" to the prompt that you want to replace a file with the same name.
 Scroll to Music, then Albums. Press the context menu button and scroll down to "Switch View." Press down on the D-pad until you see the album. If everything worked, you should see the new album art. If not, try the next method.

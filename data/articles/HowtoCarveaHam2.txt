 Take a large knife and trim off two or three slices from the side of the ham, creating a flat surface. Turn the ham so it rests on this flat surface., Stabilize the ham using a large fork. Start cutting quarter-inch slices down the ham. Use long, smooth knife cuts to make slicing easier. Cut these slices down to the bone. Cut along the bone to release the slices and place them on the serving platter., Once the slices are all cut on the first side, place the ham on the new flat side. Continue to cut more slices down through the ham, still keeping close to the bone. Slice along the bone to free the slices. When you're finished cutting these slices, they can also be served., Cut a few thin slices off one of the remaining sides of the ham. Set the ham on this newly flat surface and slice the uncut side, beginning at the narrow end of the ham., With the ham set on its flat base, make a cut close to the bone. This should release the slices; repeat the cut on the two remaining sides of the ham. Put these slices with those you've already cut and you are finished.

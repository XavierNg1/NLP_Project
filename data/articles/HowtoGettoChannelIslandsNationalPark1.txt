 The park’s website lists all of the expenses you’ll incur during your trip:


General admission to the park is free.
Those wishing to camp on one of the islands will be charged a fee of $15 per campsite per night. The money is used to help preserve the park. Reservations must be made ahead of time, and can be arranged via the National Recreation Reservation Service website. Reservations can be made no more than 5 months in advance.
Visitors who choose to access the islands by boat will be charged between $50 and 75 round trip per person. Children aged 2 and under travel free. Those bringing surfboards along will be charged extra. Reservations can be made either by contacting the park’s visitor center or through the Island Packers Cruises website.
Visitors who elect to access the islands by plane can do so via Channel Islands Aviation. Costs vary depending on which experience you choose. Day trip flights cost roughly $150 to 160 per adult round trip, and $125 to 135 per child. Exclusive camping trip charters are also available during the summer months at a cost of $300 per person (minimum 4 campers), $1,600 for a seven-passenger charter from Camarillo, and $2,000 for a seven-passenger charter from Santa Barbara.;
, As with most national parks, Channel Islands has restrictions on where visitors can go, and what they can do. For example, Channel Islands emphasizes limiting visitors’ footprints during their stay. Visitors are asked to avoid areas where animals are nesting, limit the use of artificial light at night, and stay out of caves altogether. The park website contains a detailed list of restrictions and allowances; studying these is an absolute must for anyone planning to make a visit.

 Find out if they have good references, research their safety record and check their website to see if they are involved in any conservation or research projects. A good dive operator should have all this information available to the public.;
, You do not want to be dropping straight down onto coral, so pick a spot just up current from the reef so you land in sand and can drift onto the reef. This will ensure a more comfortable dive all round. Do not drop anchor on the reef. If you're doing a shore entry, be careful of the many marine organisms that live in the shallow intertidal areas, walk gently.
 If you are a beginner and battle with buoyancy, then stay a few meters above the reef. Poor buoyancy control will have you sinking down onto the delicate coral and doing damage.
 Your fins are the biggest problem when diving; you may be inadvertently kicking and breaking coral without even knowing it. Buoyancy control is king here.
 If you want to look at something close up, gently get an open spot on a rock where you can touch gently with your finger and hold yourself steady. It works amazingly well. Never come to rest on the reef itself, especially when trying to get close up macro photographs.
 Remember, you are a visitor in this underwater world. Do not take anything from the reef except photographs. Do your part to ensure your dive buddies and fellow divers follow these rules too. Look out for marine aquarium collectors removing live fish from the reef and let them know how you feel about their actions. Raise awareness for the conservation of reefs and you'll be doing your bit for conserving reefs when you dive.

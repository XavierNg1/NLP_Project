 Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer.









Add the cranberries and stir to coat, then add the chopped fresh ginger. Sauté, stirring frequently, until the cranberries pop open—about 5 minutes.
 Stir in the wine, and then stir in the sugar, working around the edges with your spoon to make sure all the sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil.
 Let the mixture boil, uncovered, until has reduced by about 1/3 to 1/2—about 15 to 20 minutes.
 Add the chopped crystallized ginger, curry, and 5-spice, and blend well.
 Let the sauce cool to the desired serving temperature, or refrigerate to chill for about 2-1/2 hours.
 Add a sprig of fresh tarragon or thin strips of orange peel to garnish.

 Consider tampons or a menstrual cup while hiking or camping. They’ll take up less space in your backpack, and they’re a better bet than pads if you’re worried about attracting bears. Since bears are attracted to scents, make sure you choose unscented products!, In addition to pads, tampons, or other materials, you’ll need some or all of the following: painkillers, extra bottled water, tissues or toilet paper, and tons of Ziploc bags. All of this will take up space in your backpack, so you might have to get rid of something you normally bring., Since you often won’t have access to bathroom facilities, bring unscented hand and/or body wipes, and keep antibacterial gel handy. These items can be helpful for all hikers and campers, but you’ll find them especially useful when you have your period., Wrap them in tissues or toilet paper, put them inside of a Ziploc bag, and then put the bag into a Bear Canister (obviously a different one than you are using for your food.)If you are using a menstrual cup, you will need to bring extra bottled water so that you can rinse it out safely. Never rinse it out in rivers, streams, or other bodies of water.
 Again, this goes for all hikers and campers, but it is especially important when you are on your period.

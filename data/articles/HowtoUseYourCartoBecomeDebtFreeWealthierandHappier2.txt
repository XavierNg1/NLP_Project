 So how, exactly, do you live without a car payment?;
, Buy a cheap $2,000 car just to get around for about a year. 12 months @ $475—using the average car payment—save it every month, and pay for a newer car (with the cash!), instead of giving it to the new car payment.


Pay cash for a better car. You see that after 10 months of doing that, you'd have $4,750 to use for that newer car, and two more months is another $950. Also use the $1,500–2,000 you can get for your old beat up car, and you have about $7,000.

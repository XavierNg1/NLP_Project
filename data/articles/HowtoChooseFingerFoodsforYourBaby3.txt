 Most babies have developed the fine motor skills necessary to self-feed by around eight or nine months. Still, it is important to make sure your child is ready to get food into their mouth. To see if your baby is ready to self-feed, look for signs like:Grasping and raising spoons to their mouth, though the spoon may not go in the mouth
Grabbing items between their thumb and forefinger
Holding their head upright without assistance
Being able to put things in their mouth on their own
Holding a cup with a lid without help

, Introduce single ingredient foods to your baby first, and introduce them one at a time. Wait three to five days between introducing a food and feeding it to a child for the second time. This allows you to monitor for allergic reactions. Even minor allergic reactions should be seen by a doctor. Signs of allergic reactions may include:Swelling of face, lips, or tongue
Tingling
Itching
Burning
Hives
Chronic eczema
Ongoing vomiting or diarrhea
Coughing or wheezing

, As you start your child on finger foods, start including them in your family mealtimes rather than setting aside a special time to feed your baby. This will allow them to mimic you with their finger foods, and help make the transition toward full solid meals.It is alright to have some time set aside to breastfeed or formula feed your baby, but try to encourage them to eat solid foods during family meals.
 Healthy eating habits start early, so while your child may have a healthy appetite, it's your job to make sure they get reasonable portions that are neither too large nor to small. At any given meal, your baby should be eating around four ounces of food.


This is the equivalent of a small jar of strained baby food.If you notice your child is not eating, or if they have an abnormally large appetite, contact your doctor immediately.

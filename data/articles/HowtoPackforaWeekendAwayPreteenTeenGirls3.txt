 It's best not to just leave them in your bag.
 Only if they are dirty, though. If you didn't wear something or it is already clean, just skip this step.
 You may need those clothes again, so you don't want to lose them.
 You can't just lose your comb.
 You have successfully packed and unpacked your weekend's bag. Great work!

 Make certain your seated elbow height allows you to reach your work tools, typically a keyboard and mouse, without reaching up or forward. You want your arms relaxed at your side and your elbows, wrists and hands in a straight line (i.e. the elbows are not bent).;
, If proper seated elbow height requires setting the seat at a height that puts pressure on the back of your legs in order for your feet to reach the floor, then you may need a footrest. Your knees should be at about the same height as your hips or slightly lower.
 An ideal work surface will allow you to pull into a "body pocket" such that your forearms are gently supported at your sides and the surface tilts towards you, enabling you to rest comfortably against the backrest and not have to sit straight up. Support to the forearms in a posture where the elbows are slightly lower than the hands makes it much more comfortable to use the backrest and open up your body angles.
 Use a chair that allows you to move while at the same time maintaining alignment of your head and hands to their primary visual and manual targets. Chairs that allow you to relax in an ergonomically correct posture and offer counterbalanced motion are ideal for this purpose.
 Any desk can easily be adapted to provide a body pocket by attaching a forearm support device. Such a device should offer a padded surface for the forearms and a positive tilt angle of approximately 9 degrees (front is lower than the back). Typical width of the body pocket ranges from 21 inches (53.3 cm) to 18 inches (45.7 cm); the deeper you pull in the more narrow the gap between the left and right supports. #* According to studies from University of California and Harvard, supporting the forearms with the mouse centered in front of the user and between the user and the keyboard produces the lowest amount of tension (muscle activity) of any possible position for the mouse, keyboard and user.

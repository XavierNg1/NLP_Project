 If you and your friend have pink tails, you could call it Pearl Pink Tails or something. If it's about you and your best friends moving somewhere, like Malibu, you could call it Malibu Mermaids. Make it unique, and make sure you don't copy anyone.;
, You can't have a show without people! You may want to have some humans and some mermaids, or all mermaids. Also, decide if you are land mermaids or sea mermaids. Did you become a mermaid or did you become a human. Does your family live in the sea or on land? You should decide.
 Every mermaid show needs decent tails. If you want, make one! There's some great YouTube videos that provide instruction. If you want a simple tail, use leggings and a pillowcase. If you want a medium tail, use waterproof material, a tail pattern and a Mono fin. If you want a Professional tail, buy one from Mermaigica.com or FinFun.com

, What are their character's names? What are they like? What is their background?

, If you want a good show, have someone who's good with computers. Consider having someone to film it and someone to edit it.
 Your parents may not want 7 kids in their house, all with mermaid tails and such.
 You have to have something to work with. You can't just shove a bunch of people in front of a camera and expect them to be word perfect. Make sure everyone knows his or her lines.
 You don't need professional cameras. You could use your iPhone, your iPad, and your tablet's camera.
 Don't just pick any random person. See who's the best. Make sure to pick someone who can supply their own tail, unless you have spares.
 Make sure no one gets bored.

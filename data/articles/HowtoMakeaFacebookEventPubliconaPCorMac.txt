, This button will be under the EXPLORE heading on the navigation menu to the left of your News Feed. It will open your Events page with a list of upcoming events near you, your event invites, and suggested events.
 This is the blue button in the top-right corner of your list of upcoming events. It will give you an option to choose between Create Private Event and Create Public Event.
 You have to choose the correct privacy setting when you're creating your event. Facebook doesn't allow users to change a Private event to Public afterward because of privacy concerns regarding event attendees.
 Fill out the basic info and details for your event, and click the blue Create button in the bottom-right corner to finalize. This will create your Public event. Anyone will be able to see your event and join as an attendee.


Alternatively, click the downward-facing arrow next to the Create button. This will give you two more options to Save Draft of your event to revisit it later, or Schedule it to become visible to everyone at a future date and time you will set.

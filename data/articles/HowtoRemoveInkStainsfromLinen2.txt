 Fill a bowl or basin with 1 quart of warm water. Add 1/2 teaspoon of dishwashing detergent and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the water. Mix until well combined.This method may be best for larger stains, as you will soak the entire garment.
 Submerge the linen into the solution. Let it soak for approximately 30 minutes. This will allow time for the chemicals to react with the stain. You may want to gently stir the solution from time to time., Take the linen out of the soaking solution and rinse it with cold water. Pay special attention to stained part of the garment. Donâ€™t use hot water, as it can permanently set the stain.
 Squeeze out excess moisture without wringing the fabric. Squeezing the liquid out instead of twisting it will help keep the shape of the garment intact. Set it out to dry on a flat surface or hang it on a clothesline.
 If traces of the stain remain, repeat the process by mixing up a fresh soaking solution. You may also want to try another method, such as rubbing alcohol, if the stain is particularly stubborn.

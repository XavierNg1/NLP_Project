 You need large foam sheets to make a foam unicorn headband. You can get them from your local craft store or buy them online.


Self-adhesive foam sheets work well for this project.
 On the back side of the foam sheet, use a ruler to draw a diagonal line from the bottom left corner up to one inch inside the top right corner.
 Use scissors to cut along the line you’ve just drawn. You will end up with a shape that looks like a triangle with one corner that’s flat.
 Start with the bottom left corner of the foam and roll it towards the bottom right corner to form the cone. Continue rolling until the top corner is completely rolled around the cone.
 Use hot glue to glue the top corner down onto the cone to secure the cone in place. You can also put some glue on the inside to hold the bottom of the cone in place.
 Use scissors to trim the bottom of the cone so that it is even and can stand up flat on a table.
 Use scissors to make snips up ¼ inch from the bottom of the cone. Snip every ½ inch around the bottom of the cone to create fringe.
 Use the leftover foam you have to cut a circle that is ½ inch larger in diameter than the bottom of the cone.
 Get a plastic headband to glue your horn to. Use a hot glue gun to glue the foam circle to the bottom of the center of the headband. Then, put the cone on the top of the headband directly above the foam circle. Glue the cone onto the circle by gluing each piece of fringe onto the foam circle.

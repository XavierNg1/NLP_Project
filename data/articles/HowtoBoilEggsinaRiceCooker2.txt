 Many Japanese rice brands suggest rinsing the rice out, but it is completely optional.
 Depending how many cups of rice you are making, add a half cup more of water.
 Make sure that they stand upright, so the bottom of them is down. This will balance out the yolks and be the ideal finish if you are making deviled eggs.
 It's important not to lift the lid on during the cooking process, or else all of the steam will escape.
 Push down the rice cooker button and allow the rice to completely cook.

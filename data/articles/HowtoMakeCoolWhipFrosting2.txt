 Using a medium-sized bowl, add the milk, pudding mix, and sugar. Whisk until the ingredients are combined and the mixture begins to thicken (approximately 2 minutes).


You can substitute in any flavor of pudding mix you like in place of the vanilla, like lemon, cheesecake, or banana.
 Using a spatula, fold the whipped topping into the mixture.


Gently combine until the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated.
You can also stir in several drops of food coloring if you choose.
 Begin spreading the frosting over your desired dessert, several tablespoons at a time, using a spatula. After you’ve covered the surface of the dessert, use the spatula to smooth out the frosting and ensure that it’s evenly distributed.


You can use this frosting for a range of cakes and desserts, from angel food cake to cupcakes to sheet cakes.
You can also optionally run a butter knife or spatula over the frosting to create a wave-like design.
Alternatively, you can spoon the frosting into a pastry bag (or a plastic storage bag with a small hole cut in one of the corners) equipped with a frosting tip, then squeeze frosting onto the dessert.

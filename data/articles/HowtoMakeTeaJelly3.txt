 Use tongs or a canning lifter to carefully lift the sterilized jars out of your canner. Put a canning funnel on a half-pint jar and fill it with your tea jelly. Leave 1/4-inch (6 mm) of room. Run a clean knife through the jelly to remove any air bubbles and ensure that the rim of the jar is clean. Put a warm lid on the top and screw on the band just until it's fingertip tight. Fill all of your jars until you've used all the jelly.Avoid screwing the band on tightly or it may burst as the jars process.
 Use the canning lifter to place the filled jars back into the hot water. The jars shouldn't touch the bottom of the pot or each other. Add enough water to the pot to cover the jars by 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm). Put the lid on the canner and turn the heat on high. Boil the jars for 10 minutes.If you live over sea level, add one extra minute for each 1000 feet (300 meters).
 Turn the heat off and take the lid off. Leave the jars in the canner for about 5 minutes. The water will stop bubbling during this time which will make it easier to lift out the jars. Use a canning lifter to take the jars out and set them on a clean kitchen towel on the counter.Close any windows to ensure there aren't any cold drafts that could cause the jars to crack.
 Leave the jars to sit out for 12 to 24 hours. The jars will be completely cool and you can test the seals. Unscrew the bands and press on the middle of the lid. The lid shouldn't spring back or make a wobbly sound when you press it. The lid should look slightly pulled down at the center. This means that it's sealed properly.Always label your jelly with what it is and when you made it. Tea jellies will keep for 1 year.

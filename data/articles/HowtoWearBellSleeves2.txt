 Select tights that pick up a shade from your dress. Wear boots that are either at the ankle or above the knee.For a classy look, pair a neutral-colored dress with mid-thigh, black suede boots. Your hemline should fall a few inches above the boots.
Dresses in solid colors or lace tend to be fancier, while patterned dresses are generally more casual.
 Wear flats or wedges. Add a long necklace and artsy earrings to dress up your look. Look for a dress in a print or a bold color. Keep the shade of your handbag and shoes neutral.For example, try an eggplant-colored dress with beige wedges and a tan purse.
 If your bell-sleeved dress is floor- or ankle-length, try wearing flat sandals such as embellished thong sandals or ankle-high gladiator sandals. If your dress is short, opt for pumps or fancy slip-ons.For a spring feel, pair a turquoise dress with nude pumps and a pastel floral clutch.
 Wear a slim belt to up the formal factor. Alternately, wear a wide belt or a string belt to make the look more casual. You can add a belt to a loose or form-fitting bell-sleeved dress.


Match the color of a slim belt to the color of your dress for a pulled-together look.

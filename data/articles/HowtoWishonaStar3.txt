 Once you’re situated in a good place for stargazing with your wish on your mind, you’ve got to keep an eye out for a shooting star. Lay or sit comfortably and keep your eyes on the sky and think about your wish.


Don’t stare at the sky for too long. Take a few breaks every half hour to let your eyes readjust to the dark., If you get lucky enough to see a shooting star, close your eyes before wishing. Then say, “Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight: I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.” This old rhyme is rumored to make your wish come true., If you tell someone your wish it’s less likely to come true. If you’re stargazing with a friend, say the wish in your head so that they won’t hear it. If you’re alone, you can say it aloud, but make sure that nobody else is around., If you get unlucky and can’t find a shooting star, look for the brightest star you can find and wish on that instead. While bright stars aren’t as legendary as shooting stars in granting wishes, it’s worth a shot.
 Wishes only come true if you believe in them! After you make your wish, keep thinking about it when you get home. The more positive energy you put into your wish, the more likely it is to come true.

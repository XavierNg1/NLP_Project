 It needs to be a choice that you make willingly, because you truly do like spending time by yourself. Perhaps you’re an avid reader, or a frequently inspired artist, or an athlete that enjoys solo cross-country sports. Maybe you just like the quietness of being alone sometimes.


Whatever your reasoning is for being a loner, it has to be a choice that you make freely.
If you're a loner but you don't want to be, that's a very different problem.;
, A genuine smile can communicate a lot to the world, but mainly, it shows other people that you’re happy, confident and comfortable.Even better, it’s been scientifically proven that smiles really are contagious.Your smile will set off a chain reaction of other smiles, and all of these people will associate positive feelings with you – without you ever having to say a word. No socializing required!


When you’re trying to be both a loner and cool, this is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get there.
Direct eye contact will make your smile even more impactful while also projecting confidence.
 Some people aren’t going to understand your loner side, and they may gossip about you. This isn't always going to be the case, but if it happens, don’t let it affect you. A big part of being “cool” is not allowing other people’s thoughts and actions to affect your self-image negatively.


Nothing can hurt your feelings unless you allow it.
You don’t need anyone's acceptance or approval.
 Set goals for yourself and quietly start working toward them. Stay motivated. The sense of accomplishment you’ll feel when you achieve a personal goal will be more meaningful to you than the admiration of others.


You don’t need to set tons of lofty goals for yourself. Small, every day goals are just as important as large ones.
You don’t need to be accepted by everyone in the world, but it is imperative that you accept yourself.

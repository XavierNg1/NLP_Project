 Tap on the Twitter icon on your smartphone’s home screen or app drawer.


If you don’t have the Twitter app yet, you can download it from Google Play (for Android) or iTunes App Store (for iOS). Search for the app in the app store, tap on the Twitter icon in the search results, then tap “Install” to get it on your device.
 Enter your email address and password on the fields provided then click “Sign in” to access your account.


After you gain access to your account, you will be on your main feed page.
 Click the 3 horizontal dots at the top-right side of your screen and a drop-down menu will appear. Select the first option on the list, which is your profile picture and your Twitter handle.
 Two options will appear for you to choose.
 On the screen that will appear, the first option is your profile picture with the word “Photo” beside it.
 Tap on the picture of yourself for two options:


Your first option is to “Take a photo.” All you need for this is to tap the button and take a picture with your phone; this will become your new profile picture.
The second option is to “Choose an existing photo.” This will open your image library on your phone, and you can scroll through it until you find a picture you want to use. Tap on the picture when you find it.
 The final step is to tap the “Save” button on the top-right side of your screen after you select a new picture.

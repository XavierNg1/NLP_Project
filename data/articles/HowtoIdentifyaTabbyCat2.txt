 The stripes on a mackerel tabby tend to be very narrow, unlike the wide, swirling stripes of the classic tabby., Mackerel tabbies typically have unbroken lines that are evenly spaced. These stripes tend to run down both sides of the body in a top-to-bottom formation., The most distinct characteristic of mackerel tabbies is the spinal pattern. The stripes that run down the length of the body all extend from a single stripe that covers the cat's spine. Because of the way the cat's body stripes branch off from the spinal stripe, some mackerel tabbies bear a slight resemblance to a fish skeleton, hence the name mackerel.

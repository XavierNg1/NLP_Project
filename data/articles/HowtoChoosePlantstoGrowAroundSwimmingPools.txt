 It's hard enough cleaning a pool regularly without increasing the chances of filter clogging and messy pool water thanks to plants. When selecting plants, choose ones that:


Are evergreen; and
Will not drop leaves, flowers, needles, seeds or bark into the pool; and
Will not release thorns, prickles or other painful things that might be trodden on around the pool area.;
, The body of water in your pool will serve as large heat reflective surface that can scorch plants in close vicinity. This means that the plants you choose must be able to withstand hotter temperatures and sun glare.
 One ideal solution for pool plants is to use containers which can be shifted around at will. Choose containers that can cope with the watery and chlorinated environment; some container materials will deteriorate faster than others under the combined force of heat, sun, water and chlorine.
Alternatively, make use of such features as trellis, pillars or railings that are next to or surrounding the pool to grow plants on. Climbers and creepers are good for such supports and can be regularly trimmed to keep them under control.
 It can be very pleasant to swim and smell sweet fragrance from plants near the pool area. Bear in mind the possibility of attracting bees and other insects not wanted near the pool are though.


Flowers that release their fragrance at night during the summer months can make an excellent choice for those who enjoy evening swims after the sun's heat has started to wane.
Lavender makes a perfect choice for a poolside fragrant plant––smells great, tolerates heat and has a variety of colors and sizes.
 A nice pathway of lawn around the whole pool can be a great way to add some greenery without having any issues with dropping foliage or seeds. It will need regularly mowing maintenance though, and regular fertilizing.

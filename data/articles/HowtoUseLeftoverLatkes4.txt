 Use undercooked latkes, if possible. To check for coolness, press a finger into the center of a latke. Your finger should not be warmed by doing so.


Undercooked latkes are ideal for freezing, because they’re less likely to burn when you reheat them., Line a freezer container with wax paper. Line up the latkes on their sides. This helps to avoid a greasy taste to reheated latkes. Put the container in the freezer., When you’re ready to reheat your latkes, preheat the oven to 400°F (204.4°C). Use a cookie sheet on a baking rack to bake the frozen latkes. Cook them in the oven for ten to twelve minutes, or until they are bubbly and completely heated.

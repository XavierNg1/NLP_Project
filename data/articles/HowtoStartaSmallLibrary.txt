 Think these questions: "What books do they not have and what books do I have? How much are library cards? How do they organize their books? What special things do they do?";
, A garage should do. If not, rent a small space from a person.
 Maybe the kids' section on the left, etc.
 Have a small table for kids with homework, and a small space for crafts. Have calm colors like pink, purple, and blue. No yellows, reds, or oranges.
 Enough said.
 Like the dewy dudes way.
,, Member ship cards, of course.
 They don't get paid, but they must love books.

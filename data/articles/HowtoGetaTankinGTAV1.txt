 The military base can be found on the map to the west. The road leading to the fort can be found just off of Route 68. This road runs alongside the Zancudo River.It is recommended that you be well equipped before entering the military base. Purchasing extra armor and ammo is a must.
Using a fast vehicle when entering the base is a great way to quickly find a tank and avoid enemy fire.;
, Having a fast car comes in handy when looking for a tank. You donâ€™t want to waste any time when you are in the base. You will have to avoid enemy fire and vehicles.
 Before the enemy tank has time to react, you must drive up as close as you can to it and then hijack it. If you give the tank too much time, it will be able to fire a shot at you.


Use buildings and other structures to avoid tank fire. The tank shells cannot shoot through these obstacles, and they offer fantastic defense.
 There are bound to be other enemy tanks nearby, so getting out of the base and away from them as quickly as possible will ensure your tank stays alive. The most direct way to exit the base is to go the same way you used to enter it.

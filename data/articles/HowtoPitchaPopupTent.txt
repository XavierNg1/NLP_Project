 Pop-up tents are different from conventional tents. They have a flexible frame which springs into shape as soon as the tent is released from its restraining strap. These tents are very lightweight and fold away almost flat.;
, Find a flat area, ideally on ground higher than that around it. This means your tent won't flood when it rains and you won't be sleeping on a slope. In most campsites you will have a set area as your pitch. But if you are camping in a crowded field, don't plonk your tent too near to somebody else's. Sound travels easily between tents, and you may need some space for guy lines and cooking. Give yourself a 6 metre (20 feet) berth from any neighbouring tents.
 Clear away any stones, sticks or other sharp objects that may damage the floor of your tent and make the ground uncomfortable to sleep on.
 Remove the tent and pegs from the tent bag.
 Pull off the restraining band. The tent will 'pop' open. Turn the tent the right way up with the door in a position you are happy with. If you are forced to pitch on an incline or uneven surface, ensure the door faces downhill to prevent the tent flooding.
 Secure the tent to the ground by putting pegs through the loops at either end of the tent. Push or hammer the pegs into the ground at a 45 degree angle towards the tent. This stops the wind uprooting them. Your tent may have extra peg positions along each side. If so, peg out each one.
 The tent will have guy ropes already attached. Secure the guy ropes into the ground at either end. Guy ropes are adjustable in case you are restrained by space. Adjust the slide to make the ropes as taut as possible.
 Stand back and admire your work. Make sure that each guy rope is secured and that the pegs are sunk into the ground. If anything looks wrong, correct it.

 There's a small catch right next to the power switch. Push it away from the power switch.;
, It slides towards the power switch.
 Lift the hinged silver cover away first, then fit four batteries in the battery compartment. Press the silver cover back into place.
 This is almost exactly the opposite of removing it; it'll click right into place., This is a small, silver cover on the base of the camera (on the right hand side, if you're looking at the camera the right way up from the back). Use a coin or a large screwdriver to unscrew it.
 There's a holder for it on the top of the winder so you don't lose it. Slide it in as illustrated.
 Make sure the tripod socket on the camera and the screw on the winder, the electrical contacts, and the winder couplers are aligned. Gently push the winder onto the base of the camera.
 The fastening screw is the large, silver knob on the front of the camera. Turn it in the direction illustrated. It only needs to be as tight as your finger can do it; don't bother using any tools to get it tighter.
 If the camera is not already wound on, the winder will advance the camera to the next frame., According to Canon's own literature, the winder will not advance the film to the next frame until you remove your finger from the shutter. Oddly, in practice (on the A-1 and AE-1 at least), it works continuously.Try it on your camera and see what happens.
When you reach the end of your film, the winder will audibly refuse to advance the film any further, and a red LED will illuminate on the winder. The good news for cheapskates is that you can milk as many frames as possible out of a film this way, because it'll keep going until the film cannot be advanced any further, and (unlike with manual winding) you can't wind it too far.
 Fortunately, the Power Winder A provides a rewind release button. Push it, then rewind your film as normal.

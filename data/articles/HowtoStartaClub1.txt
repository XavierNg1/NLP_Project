 Before you start your club, you’ll have to pick a theme. What is your club about? Take some time to brainstorm and come up with a list of possible topics. Spies, princesses, geeks, pop stars? Remember to think about your club’s purpose. Do you simply want to discuss a topic with like-minded people, or are you putting a plan into action?;
, After you’ve brainstormed, choose an idea that you are truly interested in. Starting the club and keeping it running may turn out to be a lot of work for you, so you’ll want to focus on something that you enjoy.Consider creating a short mission statement that explains exactly what the club is all about. That way you can go to your statement when you are wrapped up in the excitement of explaining it to your friends.For example, “Trebble club is a group of high school students that are dedicated to arranging and performing pop songs from the 1990s to the present.”

, By nature, a club is a group activity with a certain number of participants. Talk to your friends, acquaintances, and other people in your community about your ideas. Ask them if they would be interested in participation and membership.If no one seems interested, try reaching a bit further out of your network. For example, you may have only spoken to your class or your schoolmates. Try reaching out to older or younger students, or contact other schools in the area.
Consider adjusting your idea if you can’t find any members. After several conversations, you should have a better sense of what would be interesting to your peers.

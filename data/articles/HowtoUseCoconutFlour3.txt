 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (178 degrees Celsius) to let it preheat. Prep your muffin pan. You can either use ten liners or spray the pan with cooking spray to keep it from sticking., Add the 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of oil, 2/3 cup (180 milliliters) sugar, 1/2 teaspoon (2.46 milliliters), 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) of extract, and the 6 large eggs to a bowl. Mix them together until well incorporated, then add in the 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) milk. Mix together again.You can use whatever flavor extract you want. For a simple cupcake, try vanilla.
 In another bowl, add the 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of coconut flour and 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of baking powder. Mix them together until they are well combined, then pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Stir to incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet., Pour the batter into the muffin pan, dividing the batter evenly between ten of the liners or muffin spaces. Place in the oven. Bake for about 18 to 20 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the cupcake should come out mostly clean when they are done. Let them rest in the pan outside the oven for five minutes before moving them to a cookie rack for cooling. Frost with your favorite frosting.

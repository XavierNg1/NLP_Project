 Seedlings should not be used since they do not transplant well. Remember to obtain two separate sets of seeds for cross pollination.;
, This will help pull them out of their dormant state. Specific directions for the particular variety of paw-paw you have purchased will come with the seeds.
 Plant the seeds 1.5 inch (3.8Â cm) deep into the soil. Water thoroughly and cover the pot with a clear plastic bag. (Poke holes in the top for ventilation!)

, Water daily for a month, until the seeds sprout.
 They may not survive in full sunlight, so keep this in consideration.
 Using a paintbrush or something soft, rub a flower of one paw-paw tree to collect pollen. Then proceed to rub a flower of another tree. *Note: You cannot take pollen from one tree and use it on the same tree! Each individual flower will only accept pollen from a flower from a genetically distinct individual tree.
 It will take three years before you can start harvesting your fruits. When they turn a brownish yellow, they are ready to be picked.

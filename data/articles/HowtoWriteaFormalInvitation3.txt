 When inviting guests to a formal dinner, be sure to word it so they are invited “at a dinner” or “to a dinner,” never “for dinner.” Your invitation should read “We request the pleasure of your company at a dinner” or “You are cordially invited to a dinner” before listing what the dinner is for.You may or may not have hosts to lists for a formal dinner, but if you do, their names should go at the top of the invitation.
 Writing an invitation to an anniversary celebration is similar to writing one for a wedding. You should include the hosts’ names, the date, and the venue, but you should also note that it is an anniversary celebration.For example, you could write “Dan and Carol Smith are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. Their children invite you to join them for a reception at The Country Club.”
If you do not wish guests to bring gifts for the couple, you can simply note “No gifts please” at the bottom of the invitation.
 These types of invitations are usually less formal than wedding invitations. You may or may not list a host, but you should include the name of the bride and/or couple and the information regarding the shower. The spacing of a shower invitation should follow the spacing of a wedding invitation.For example, you could write “You are cordially invited to a bridal shower in honor of Tiffany Smith on November 5th at 6 pm. The Country Club Minneapolis, Minnesota.”

, The RSVP etiquette for events other than weddings varies widely. You should ask your guests to let you know if they're attending or not, but it's up to you how you'd like them to respond. Formal dinner invitations should include an RSVP card similar to the kind you would send for wedding, but anniversary parties and bridal or baby showers can simply ask guests to call the host with their response.

 If a classmate asks you if you are crying, just say you yawned or that you have bad allergies.;
, Just say nothing. That will make them walk away.
 They may send you to the guidance office because they don't want to deal with it. If this happens, you can go to the guidance counselor if you need to talk to someone. Or you can hide in the bathroom until the end of the period.
 The teacher won't bring it up.
 If they like you, then they will most likely come over and ask what's wrong.
, If you feel comfortable crying in front of them, then tell them what's wrong. They will likely try to make you feel better. Just go along with it.
 Say you yawned, sneezed, or have allergies. Or, you can pretend you don't know what he's talking about.
 Get your crying done there.
, People tend to try to comfort you if you cover your eyes with your hands and act shy about it.


For sympathy, say something like, "This is so embarrassing," or, "Oh my gosh, I'm really sorry. I don't want to bother you with my crying." This will most likely get you a hug.
If you don't like hugs, then don't lay it on thick.
 You don't want to seem like you faked it all. That will irritate people.
 If you want to keep it normal, act like nothing happened. If you act that way, then the teacher will too.

 Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the bodily processes behind menstruation. Many women feel more comfortable with their first period if they understand why menstruation occurs.


Your menstrual cycle is a bodily process that begins in puberty, when you reach sexual maturity. Each month, your body prepares you for possible pregnancy. The walls of your uterus thicken with extra blood and tissue and your ovaries release an egg.The egg will move down one of your two fallopian tubes into the uterus. If fertilized, the egg will remain in the uterus and grow into a fetus. If this does not occur, the lining of the uterus breaks down and bleeding occurs. This is what is referred to as your monthly period.;

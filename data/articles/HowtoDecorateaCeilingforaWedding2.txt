 Choose bright white or golden colored lights. Hang them from wires with zip ties and try to net the entire ceiling.
 You can use decorative paper or fabric in designs as well as in solid colors. Hanging them at different levels every 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) will give a festival look to your ceiling.
 Hang a glass or plastic chandelier from the center of the room. This will create a tent-like feel for your room.


When measuring for your fabric, be sure to count in the amount that you would like your drape to fall down in the middle. Take time to secure the gauzy fabric at the center and ends. This is a great way to create a false ceiling and draw attention away from an ugly ceiling.
 Secure the lighting cords with zip ties. You can choose to hang them at 1 level or create more depth by hanging them at varying lengths.


Although traditional triangle banners strung up on string look wonderful, you can make them in almost any shape. Use a stencil to create heart, star, bird or other animal shaped banners.
Alternate garlands with strings of twinkle lights to improve the décor and lighting of the ceiling.
 Make large cranes, so that they are visible from the ground level. Use decorative papers that compliment the wedding colors.
 Choose decorative paper and attach each ring with strong tape, instead of glue. Make enough chains to extend from the center, draping through to the edge of the ceiling in all directions.
 Remove all leaves and wipe them before hanging. Wrap the branches in lights to create accent lighting.
 Use very strong, secured cord to attach them at varying lengths to the ceiling.


You can also use succulents instead of flowers to create a more earthy feeling.
 You can use crepe paper in the wedding colors or in rainbow colors. Each circle can move like a mobile, spinning slightly as a breeze moves through the room.

 Almost all of the Disney Junior shows have songs or their characters singing. "The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse" always ends episodes with the "Hot-Dog Song" where the characters dance on their platforms. "Little Einsteins" has sing-along ditties set to the tune of classical music.;
, Characters look at the screen and ask questions pertaining to a situation or if they can do something with the character, for example, count things or sing along with them. At these times, ask and encourage the child to interact back. Try to teach them along with the characters.
 While "Guess How Much I Love You", "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse", and "Goldie and Bear" can be amusing to a toddler who is 18 to 36 months old, "Little Einsteins", "Doc McStuffins", and "Sofia the First" may be more enjoyable to a three to five year old.
 Don't watch a show because you think it'll be good and enjoyable for them. If something else distracts them, try to find something that they'll have fun with.
 These segments include short and peppy music videos or educational messages. "Lou and Lou: Safety Patrol" teaches kids a wide variety of information, ranging from strangers to accidents.

 Pick a charity that you feel strongly about and that is reputable. Think of a fun creative idea, a fashion show of charity shop clothes, a competition, a summer fete in your garden, a play, etc. Planning the event will give you something to focus on, even if you don't plan on holding it for a while yet.

 Pour 3 cups of water (24.98 fl oz) into a saucepan on the stovetop. Add the sugar. Turn the heat to high. Stir the sugar as the water comes to a boil. Keep stirring until the sugar has thoroughly dissolved. Then remove from heat.For iced tea, allow the syrup time to cool down before adding it to your tea.
 Pour remaining water into a large pot on the stovetop. Turn the heat to high until the water boils. Switch the heat off and add your tea bags or leaves. Allow them to steep for five minutes.If using loose tea, strain the leaves out once they have steeped.
 Peel and slice your peaches. Discard all the pits. Place the sliced peaches in a blender, cover, and blend until they form a puree. If you like a lot of pulp, transfer the puree directly to a pitcher. If not, mush the puree through a strainer so the larger bits stay behind., Pour your simple syrup into the puree, along with the lemon juice. Stir to combine. Then pour your tea in and stir until all the ingredients have mixed evenly.If desired, slice additional peaches to add to each glass before serving.
For ice, allow the tea to cool off and/or refrigerate after brewing and then serve over ice.

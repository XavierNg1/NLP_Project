 When making a wall montage or gallery of pictures, it is unlikely that all of them will be so large as to require a stud. Plan to hang the largest picture or two on studs; once those positions have been established, the smaller pictures can be built around them.
 To ensure evenly spaced pictures, measure the distance between each picture's position in a group with a measuring tape before you actually hang any of them, and adjust as needed. Use square sticky notes to easily mark the corner positions of the pictures you plan to hang without making a mess of pencil smudges on the wall, and adjust these until you have an evenly-spaced layout.
 Three pictures of the same size can hang side by side to create a continuous, running effect; six or seven pictures of varying sizes can hang at different heights to define an overall space. Be adventurous and try a various different arrangements to see what creates the effect you like best. Remember to avoid hanging pictures so high or low that they seem out of place.


Work with the pictures you have. Several small pictures won't look good hung sparsely on walls by themselves across three rooms, but might look great on short walls or in concert with each other across a larger swath. Pictures that are wider than they are tall open up options that would never work with portrait-oriented pictures alone. Trust your judgment and experiment until you find the best way to display the pictures you have.
Tall furniture, shelving, lighting, and windows should all be taken into account when designing a spread of multiple hanging pictures. Very often, these elements already suggest some sort of definition for the remaining free wall space near them. Work with them rather than around them, and you will be creating a space that is uniquely and distinctively your own.

 There's no need to fill it up; you just need a few inches of water in order to steam the vegetables. Two to four cups of water will be sufficient, depending on the size of the pan you're using.


Steaming vegetables is the best way to preserve their nutrient content. Boiling vegetables is another option for softening them, but boiling has been found to destroy some of the nutrients.
 Fill the steamer basket with your vegetable slices and put the basket inside the saucepan. Cover the saucepan to begin steaming your vegetables. Avoid crowding the steamer basket with too many vegetables; you may have to do it in batches. After 15 to 20 minutes, the vegetables should be completely soft.


If you don't have a steamer basket, place the vegetable slices into the boiling water. Boil them for 15 minutes or until they feel tender when pierced with a fork. Be careful not to crowd the pan.
 Remove the vegetables from the steamer basket or saucepan using a slotted spoon or a stainless steel mesh strainer and place them in a bowl. Continue steaming batches of vegetables until all of your vegetables are softened and ready to puree.

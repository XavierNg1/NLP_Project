 Macaws and cockatoos need two types of toys: durable puzzle-type ones to occupy their bright minds and to (mostly) withstand their chewing; and safe materials such as untreated wood and cardboard that they can rip up and destroy each day.;
, Parrots find tooth-brushing hilarious and fascinating. They will understand that your hair-combing is a form of preening. And most parrots will love showering with you, which must remind them of the ancestral rain forest. Expect much exuberant screaming and other parrot silliness to result.
 Sit at a table with your parrot on the table top. Fold your arms on the table, put your head down on your arms, and drape a big fluffy bath towel over your head. Your parrot will not be able to resist running up to the edge of the towel and lifting it up with his beak so he can slip underneath to be with you.
 First, present your parrot with a medium-sized box with something fun inside to chew up like a big wad of newspapers. Once he's busily chewing, get an interesting-looking kitchen implement like a big, shiny ladle and gently tap with it on the side of the box. This will grab his attention. Gently tap the ladle closer and closer until you dip it briefly into view. This should get a huge reaction - possibly a full puff-out if you have a cockatoo. Repeat with different cooking utensils for maximum fun and stimulation.
 Place your parrot on the back of your hand and gently move your hand up and down or swoop your hand in figure-eights. Your parrot will flap his wings as you move him through the air. Stop and give the poor guy a break once he starts breathing hard.

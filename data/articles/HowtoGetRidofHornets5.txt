 Make a traditional wasp trap by cutting the neck off a large soda bottle. Turn the neck funnel downward and into the base of the soda bottle. This becomes the tunnel for the wasp to enter through. Pierce two holes either side of the trap and thread through a string handle for hanging; knot in place either side.


Inside the trap, place a cup of apple cider vinegar, a drop of dish soap and a little raw meat. The raw meat can be hung by string or fishing wire.
Hang where hornets have been seen buzzing around. Wait. Hornets will drop in and either drown or won't be able to find their way back out again.
To catch the queen, use this trap early in the spring to lure her in. Queens awaken in early spring and begin to look for nesting sites. If your trap catches her, that's one less colony in your backyard.
 Fill a bucket with sugar water, vinegar and a little mild dish washing soap. Set outside and wait for the hornets to drop by and drown.


Replace regularly.
 One trap may be sufficient but if you have various inviting eaves around the place, place several, just in case you accidentally ward off one spot only to encourage nest-building on the other side of the house!

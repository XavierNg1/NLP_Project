Go over the spilled area until as much of the paint has been removed as possible. The damp paper towels should remove most of the paint.You will have to go through several damp paper towels if the spill is large.
 To remove the remainder of the paint, mix several drops of mild soap into a bucket of water. Then, dip a clean cloth into the mixture. Use the cloth to clean up the rest of the spilled paint., If the paint has still not been removed, pour rubbing alcohol on a soft cloth and gently rub it over the paint. Press the cloth on the stain and allow it remain for ten minutes if the stain has not been removed. Then, remove the cloth and rinse the area with water.Make sure the area is dry after you rinse it off. You can dry it off by patting it with a cloth or paper towel.

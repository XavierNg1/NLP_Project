 If your fish has a contagious condition, it will need to be removed from the tank so that any illness does not infect other fish. Prepare a holding tank for your fish by putting fresh, conditioned water into the tank. Remove your fish from the original tank and put it in the new tank.


If your fish is experiencing stress because of a new fish or environmental change in its tank, you might find that it feels better after being isolated.
 Many disorders that fish have can be highly contagious. Anything that touched the fish or the water, including your hands, the fishnet, a spoon, etc., will need to be disinfected before it should come in contact with another fish. Use antibacterial soap to wash your hands.Disinfect any other item that has come in contact with the fish or the water in the tank using a bleach solution of 1 part bleach and 9 parts water. Soak items for 10 minutes in the bleach solution and rinse very thoroughly. Rinse again for good measure. Never add bleach to the fish tank when fish are in it, as this can kill fish.
 Once you have positively identified your fish’s ailment, you can administer a common fish medication to your fish.Give the medication intended for the ailment, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.


Be sure to give your fish the entire course of medication as recommended by the medicine’s manufacturer.
Use good judgment when giving medications to your fish. Don’t try out several medications guessing at the right one. If you are unsure, you might consider consulting an aquatic veterinarian.

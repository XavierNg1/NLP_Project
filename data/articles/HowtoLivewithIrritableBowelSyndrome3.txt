 Probiotics are "good" bacteria that normally live in your intestines and are found in yogurt and some dietary supplements and can be bought in drink form or pill form. Some studies suggest that probiotics may relieve symptoms of IBS like abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.Probiotics can be bought at your local health foods store either in pill form or in liquid form. The pill form is normally taken once per day; for the liquid form, follow the instructions on the bottle.
Another option is to consume more fermented foods such as Kombucha or sauerkraut, which offer the benefit of "good bacteria" without having to take probiotic supplements.
 Hypnotherapy is another proven method of coping with IBS and reducing stress.The hypnotherapist gives the patient methods of coping. In some studies, people with IBS had a 52% improvement of their symptoms after 12 weeks of hypnotherapy. , Acupuncture may help to ease symptoms and to reduce stress. Certain acupuncture points along the meridians of the stomach and large intestine are selected, causing IBS symptoms to diminish or even disappear in some cases., Peppermint may offer some relief from IBS symptoms. It is a natural antispasmodic that relaxes the muscles in the intestines and may relieve diarrhea and pain.Study results have been inconsistent, although some people find short-term relief. If you'd like to try peppermint, be sure to use enteric-coated capsules (otherwise it may worsen heartburn).One option is to take "enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules."These are specifically designed in a capsule so that they do not dissolve in the stomach (which could lead to symptoms of heartburn), but rather, travel into the intestines before dissolving and having their antispasmodic effect.
Taking a enteric-coated peppermint oil pill before each big meal has been shown in clinical trials to be helpful for patients suffering of IBS.

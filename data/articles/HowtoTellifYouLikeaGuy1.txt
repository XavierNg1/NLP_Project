 The poets were right--when you see someone you like, your pulse will start racing and you might feel like your heart is about to jump out of your chest. Being near that certain someone causes an adrenaline rush, almost like you've been running sprints.A higher heart-rate might make someone you're not that into seem more attractive, too. If you think you're crushing on that guy in 5th period gym but you don't know why, it might be because the adrenaline rush and not the guy.;
, If you like him your tummy may get a fluttery, nervous feeling. You may even feel sick! That's because your body is releasing tons of hormones that shrink the blood vessels in your stomach. The lack of blood in your vessels can make you feel queasy., The same chemicals that get your heart racing will also throw your sweat glands into overdrive, even if you're in an air-conditioned room. Your palms and underarms especially will start to sweat. It might be a little embarrassing, but it's a sure sign you really like someone.Guys may have this problem even worse than girls, so if you notice him sweating around you or if he touches you and his palm is sweaty, don't be grossed out! It probably means he likes you.
 If your words come out as a squeak when you try to talk to him, or if every time you're chatting with your friends and he walks by your voice suddenly becomes super high-pitched, it might be a sign you're crushing., You don't do it consciously, but when you are attracted to someone, you will often copy what they're doing. So, when he touches his cheek, you touch your cheek; when he runs his hand through his hair, you do the same.Mirroring someone's actions can actually make you seem more attractive in their eyes. So don't worry too much about being a copy cat--it works in your favor!

 You can part it down the center of off to the side. This style works best with shoulder to collarbone-length hair.
 Separate two thin sections of hair from your temples. Pull the rest of your hair back, then tie or clip it out of the way.
 Braid the first section, then tie it off with a clear elastic. Braid the other section, and tie it off as well.When you are done, they will be sort of dangling by your face. If you'd like to, you can temporarily clip them out of the way.
 Untie or unclip your hair. Split it down the center into two equal-sized sections, just like making two braids or pigtails.
 Do not include the mini braids from the top of your head. Tie each back braid off with a clear elastic.If your hair is very thick, you may need to use a mini hair tie or regular hair tie instead. Be sure to use one that matches your hair color, however.
 Take the left back braid. Pull it across the back of your head, towards your right ear. Secure it with bobby pins.








If your hair is very long, you may have to bring the braid back over to the left side of your hair, and secure it with more bobby pins.
 Take the right back braid, and pull it across the back of your head, right above the first braid. Secure it with bobby pins. Tuck the end under itself, and secure it with some more bobby pins.








The right braid should hide the end of the left braid. If it doesn't, then tuck and pin the end of the left braid out of sight.
Again, if your hair is long, you will need to wrap the right braid back towards the right side of your head.
 Unclip the mini braids. Wrap them across the back of your head, right above the back braids. Tuck the ends under themselves, then secure the mini braids with bobby pins.

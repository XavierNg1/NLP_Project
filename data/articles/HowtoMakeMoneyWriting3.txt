 While card manufacturers of all sizes accept freelance work, consider starting with smaller companies where competition may be less fierce.Consider what types of card-writing interest you. Perhaps you enjoy developing funny quips, for example, or consider yourself gifted at composing meaningful poetry. Understanding your own talents will help you target card companies that produce relevant card collections.
 Ensure that you're targeting your material to the company's needs. One manufacturer may be in particular need of rhymed poetry for sentimental cards, for example, while another might have a word limit for humorous text.


Study retail card displays. Reflect upon what types of material work well. Pay specific attention to the styles of cards each manufacturer provides so you can target your material most effectively.
 The greeting card format is more directly personal than most other forms of writing. Even a blog that you write with a confidential "me-to-you" voice actually reaches a host of readers; greeting cards, by contrast, are explicitly sent from one individual to another.


Composing greeting card text provides a great opportunity to practice "writing tight." Carefully consider each word to ensure your verse or quip packs maximum impact from minimum length.
 Greeting cards on a rack have an average of 1.5 seconds in which to catch a consumer's eye. Cards with strong "rack impact" will stand out to consumers. Ensure your text will attract potential buyers quickly.Remember that the cover of a card is what consumers see when they're scanning a rack or display. A high-impact beginning will ensure that potential buyers pick up the card and open it to view your amusing punchline or heartfelt verse.

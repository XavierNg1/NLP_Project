 You should only use ceramics or glass in the microwave, not plastic. About a half a cup or a one whole cup should be enough since pasta swells up after being cooked.

,, The plate will catch any water in case it boils over, but it shouldn't.
 Microwave the pasta for this amount of time. Depending on the strength of your microwave, it may take more or less time.
 Pop it in for a few more minutes if it's chewy.
 A small strainer would be the most efficient thing to use. If you don't have a strainer, you should be able to get most of the water out by tipping the bowl over the sink, pressing a large spoon to the edge, and being careful not to let the pasta slip out. You can also ladle it out spoonful by spoonful.
 Or alternatively, use salt and butter or olive oil. Add your chosen seasoning to the pasta.
 Bon appetit!

 Most children prefer being adopted by members since it gives them an opportunity to be spoiled, and since members get more options of clothing to be seen with a pretty/handsome mom/dad. They'll also receive more space, toys, and choices in the color of the furniture, a lot of babies are picky so this is important.


Being an Arctic Wolf mother is recommended, for that is a popular choice, and is easier to find a dad or mate with.
If you are a non-member and don't want to purchase a membership, you can use a normal wolf with bright, cheerful colors.
 Choose a cute outfit while looking modest, and change your patterns if you wish, also wear a head item, this is specifically recommended to be a little pretty hat. Avoid appearing frightening or too tough, unless if your child prefers you to look that way, a lot of them want that, but 10 moreÂ %age wants the other. Recommended clothes are the most important. they make your baby feel safe. (Though makes not much sense.):

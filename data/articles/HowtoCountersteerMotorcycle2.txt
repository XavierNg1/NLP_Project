 If you want to turn right, push the handlebars on the right side. If you want to turn left, push the handlebars on the left side. While this may seem incorrect, turning the bars in the opposite direction from the turn forces the bike to tilt slightly, while maintaining the proper speed allows it to stay upright. Memorize this countersteering mantra: Turn right, push right. Turn left, push left.
 As you approach your turn, signal at least 100 feet (37 meters) before the turn, and check your mirrors for signs of traffic. Move to the outside third of your lane–the corner opposite the direction of your turn. Don’t go so far that you’re putting yourself in danger of oncoming traffic. Just chose the outer third so that you can enter the turn with enough room to swing back to the inside.
 Turning on a motorcycle is dependent on the speed you are traveling, so it's important to brake on your approach to the turn, then hold steady on the throttle during the turn. Downshift before the turn if necessary, but never in it. You can shift into a higher gear during the turn if you want to, but don't do this until you get more comfortable.


The balance of the motorcycle is gyroscopic, which means that speed keeps it up. Depending on the grade of the turn you're making and the speed at which you're traveling, you'll probably need to slow down some.
Never, under any circumstances, should you slow in the middle of a turn, or brake in the middle of a turn, unless there's some emergency. Even then, it's safer to evade than to attempt to stop. If you absolutely must stop then level your handlebars out before you start to brake. Square your handlebars and then apply progressive pressure to both brakes at the same time. 70 % of your stopping power comes from your front brake, but don’t grab it – especially in a turn. Apply progressive pressure.

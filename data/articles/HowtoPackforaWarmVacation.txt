 You'll want to pack multiple tops if you're going for a week, or a couple days. Make sure to pack some T-Shirts, long sleeve shirts, and maybe one or two sweaters, in case it gets chilly.;
, If it's a warm vacation, you'll have to pack some shorts, leggings, and maybe a pair of jeans. You can also pack some dresses and skirts.
 You know? Underwear, bras, undershirts, etc. Remember to pack enough underclothes so that you have enough for the time you're going.
 Bring at least two, if you're going for a week.
 It might get cold during the night, and your feet might need some socks.
 Your head might hurt if you walk in the sun all day. Always wear a hat if it's really sunny outside.
 If you're staying at a hotel, they might provide you with an umbrella, but you never know!

, Pack some suntan lotion, cream (in case your skin gets dry), lip balm. Most hotels provide the soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. It's your choice if you want to bring some extras.
 Hotels don't provide those.Â :D

, In case you get a head ache or a stomach ache, or anything like that, you'll definitely need some medications (if you use them).
, It the vacation spot is rocky, consider packing shoes with a tough sole or if it is a sandy place, flip-flops or sandals might be a good choice.
 For example, electronics, sunglasses, jewelry, diary, hair elastics, etc.Hope this helped!

 It can be fairly easy to get your luggage mixed up with someone else’s, so a luggage strap is a great way to differentiate your luggage from all of the others. If you can choose a strap of bright pink or green, or with a multicolored pattern, it will give your luggage the pop it needs to be more recognizable.If you are traveling as a family and you have similar luggage, it can also be an easy way to identify whose is whose.
 Most luggage straps have the type of buckle on which you pinch the sides to release it. This is probably the easiest type of release to choose. It’s good to test the buckle out to make sure it is easy to open, but not so easy that it will open if it is jostled.


Some straps may come with a buckle that is similar to a belt, which would require you to weave the strap itself through a metal or plastic clasp. This type is not recommended as it will take you longer to secure around your luggage.
 Luggage straps help hold your luggage closed, but they can also provide protection against theft. Some straps come with a 3-digit combination that must be selected before the clasp opens. This can be a deterrent for potential thieves who would consider getting into your bag.While the security aspect is great, some people do advise against locking straps because they say it can pose a hold up with TSA who may wish to check your luggage and would be unable to.
It’s possible to purchase TSA approved luggage locks. These locks are made so that a master key, which TSA agents have, can unlock the lock. You can purchase these locks at most airports and travel accessory stores.
To make things easier, it is probably best to write down the combination and keep it somewhere you can get to it easily. You don’t want to be stuck somewhere without the ability to get into your luggage.

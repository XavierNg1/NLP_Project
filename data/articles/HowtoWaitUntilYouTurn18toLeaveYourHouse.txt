 You'll either end up getting injured, killed, or brought back to your parents anyway, so it won't help at all. Unless your situation is physically abusive, do not even consider running away as a minor.;
, If your parent(s) give you an allowance, this is extremely easy, just set it aside in a safe place and try not to spend money on toys, games, candy, etc and only food unless your parent(s) check what spending you have.
 If your parent(s) do not give you an allowance, try to do jobs. At 14, you're usually okay for doing babysitting jobs and at 16 you can get jobs at McDonald, Sonic, etc. Again, keep your cash safe and don't spend it unless necessary!

, Friends, other family, or your own apartment. Work out how much it will cost for food, rent, etc. on a month-to-month basis to see if you'll make enough.If it costs $500 and you only make $350, that won't work.
 A single suitcase should be sufficient. Clothes, any personal belongings (iPod, photos, etc), possibly some non-perishable food (Saltine crackers, rice bowls), and if there's any free space stuff whatever else belongs to you into it. If you can't bear to leave it behind, make sure its one of the first items in. Try not to bring unnecessary items, such as a cell phone or laptop, as these are expensive bills to pay after awhile for internet and service.
 Taking away whatever money you had saved, throwing away any suitcases/duffels you own, etc. It's best if you don't tell them until after you leave, perhaps leave a letter or call from a pay-phone.
, Parents argue all the time, and they WILL yell at you. This is made strictly for the kids who are yelled at for everything they do or don't do, every single day of the year. Not for the spoiled brats who think the world hates them if a parent tells them they can't have a toy!

 Cleanse and irrigate the wound with anything that you have available. Obviously potable water, also known as drinking water, is first choice because it is suitable for drinking and thus suitable for other human uses. If fresh water is unavailable, you can also use a carbonated beverage, such as cola. If you happen to have a small hand sanitizer available, cleanse the wound with this.Do not introduce anything that would increase the chances of infection such as juice, grease or milk. The same goes for scummy-looking pond or creek water sources. If you are near a beach, rinse in the ocean. Salty ocean water can act as a stand-in saline solution for your wound.
 Flushing out the wound with a flowing water source that has some pressure to it is recommended as one of the best measures you can take to prevent infection.If fresh, potable water is available to you, try to running that over the wound for several minutes. You'll want to use about 2 liters of water, an amount roughly the size of a large soda bottle.
 Find something that you can dry the wound with, such as a piece of cloth, towel or other soft material. Avoid using anything fluffy that could leave fragments in or get stuck to the wound., If you don't have any water or fluid available or if you're in a desert area, use a portion of your clothing to brush away any debris from the wound. Try to find the cleanest portion of your shirt or pant leg to use.

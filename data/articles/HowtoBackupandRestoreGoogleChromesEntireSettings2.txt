 Or, you can open your Google Chrome Browser, and paste this command; chrome://settings/ into the URL bar. Then click on the button that says Sign in to Chrome.
 There is no need to do anything in this step. When you sign into Chrome, it connects to your Google account and uploads/syncs bookmarks, skins, extensions, profile pictures, settings: technically everything onto your account. So whenever you sign in to Chrome on some different computer, it syncs all the saved information onto the new chrome. That is why it is not smart to sign in to Chrome while on an untrusted or public machine. After you sign into Chrome, you should see a little human head located to the left of the minimize button of a window. When you click on it, you should see your personal name and avatar, as displayed in the picture.

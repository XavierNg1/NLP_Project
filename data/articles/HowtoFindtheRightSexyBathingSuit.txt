 Stand nude before a full-length mirror. Do you have the type of body that will show well in a skimpy bathing suit? Can you imagine yourself in a small bikini or less?;
, Once you are comfortable with revealing parts of your body after a careful examination, then you will need to determine how much and what parts you are willing to expose. Some woman have very nice bottoms and tops. Others may have issues with exposing their buttocks or breasts. You need to decide for yourself, as if you are not comfortable in your suit, everyone will be able to see it in your face.
 You may be confident enough with your buttocks, so then maybe a g-string thong is in order. Brazilian thongs are larger and cover more of the bottom, and this may be an option for those concerned about a g-string.


If you are a woman that has a good looking breasts, then maybe a small micro top or a standard top that is sheer will fit the bill.
 Once you have determined which parts of your body are acceptable to present to the world, making the choice of which type of suit to wear should be much easier.

"Contract bar" -- holds that petitions for a decertification election cannot be filed during the first three (3) years of a collective bargaining agreement, except for during a certain 30-day "window period."
“Window period” -- for 30-days filing a decertification petition with the NLRB occurs 60 to 90 days "prior to" the expiration date or 3 year anniversary of the contract, whichever comes first. In the health care industry (such as hospitals), the 30-day “window period” occurs 90 to 120 days "before" the expiration date of the contract, or after the 3 year anniversary of that contract (if not expired), whichever comes first.
"Contract expired" -- a decertification petition can also be filed anytime after a contract expires or becomes more than 3 years old.
"Successor contract" -- if your employer and the union enter into a successor contract, the new contract will begin another 3 year "contract bar" on decertification elections. Thus, if you miss the "window period" for filing a petition for a decertification election, you may have to wait for another 3 years to request a decertification election.;

 Before you sew your two pieces together, draw a horizontal line on the inside of your front piece under the armhole. Your line needs to be about six to eight inches long., From your horizontal line, you need to draw two more lines that angle away from the tip of your horizontal line. Start from the inside of the line and angle out back towards the armhole. It should resemble a triangle when you are done., Take each angled line, and fold them onto the horizontal line. Use a pic to keep the fabric in place., Using a straight stitch, sew along the edges of your fold. This will create a more form fitting shape around your bust line.

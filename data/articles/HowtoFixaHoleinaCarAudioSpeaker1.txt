 Ideally, the speaker should be removed so both sides of the speaker cone are accessible. Remove door panels, grill work or covers to allow removal of the mounting screws or fasteners.
 The cone may be brittle if old, so be sure to handle the speaker with care. Hold the speaker so it does not fall when the last couple of screws are removed.
 It may stick to grommet material or paint if it has been in place for some time.
 Speakers require two wires to receive signals from the source or amp. Polarity (which wire connects to which terminal) is important. Take a photo (with cell phone), draw a diagram, label wires or make marks near the speaker terminals themselves to assist in properly reconnecting when reinstalling later.

 Protect its moisture from the dry air. Wrap it up in a scarf before heading outdoors. Use one that is made of silk, since other materials like cotton or wool will increase the buildup of static electricity,which can make your hair stick out in odd places, cling to your face when you don't want it to, and generally misbehave., If a scarf alone isn't enough to keep your head warm or your hair protected from snow, ice, or rain, add a hat. Wrap a silk scarf around your hair first to reduce the chance of static electricity. Then don a hat on top of that.If you don’t have a silk scarf, opt for a hat made of cotton instead of wool or acrylics, since cotton’s less conducive to static electricity., If you have long hair, refrain from wearing turtlenecks, which may help your hair knot up in back. Avoid the need to brush your hair more than you really have to. Because the cold air and low humidity of winter dries out your hair, over-brushing can damage your brittle hair, so preempt the need by ditching the turtleneck., When you’re washing your clothes, make sure you use this to reduce the chance of static electricity building up in your hair. Be sure to use it when washing hats as well any clothes that you’ll be pulling over your head.Definitely use it if those clothes are made of wool or acrylics.

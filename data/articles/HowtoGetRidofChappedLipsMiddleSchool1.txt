 Keep one in your pencil pouch at school or in your pockets. Also have one at home because your lips can feel dry at any given moment.;
, Try to look for one with at least a little bit of SPF in it. This will keep your lips nice and moist against those harmful UV rays. You can normally find one at a local Walgreens, and sometimes even regular grocery stores. For all you girls out there, find one in a red or pink to add a little extra pizzazz.
 And a few bad habits of chapped lips include licking your lips. DO NOT DO THIS, when you lick your lips, your are putting saliva (digestive juices) onto your lips and unintentionally "breaking them down". Break bad habits such as this, and get into a habit of using lip balm instead.

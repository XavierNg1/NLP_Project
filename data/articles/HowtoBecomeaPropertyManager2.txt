 Before you have the necessary capital, connections, and experience to invest in your own properties, you need to work in an entry-level job. You will benefit from this by having a supervisor mentor, a steady income, and gaining experience a variety of property management tasks. There are a few paths to go for finding an entry level job.
 It is often too time consuming for a real estate agent to split his time between selling real estate and managing rental properties. A good property manager is the key to proper management of a realtor's rental properties. Submit your resume highlighting your skills pertaining to property management.
 Many apartment complexes or government housing facilities utilize assistants. By taking on this role, you learn the ins and outs of the job without being entirely responsible for everything at first. Instead of being the one responsible for collecting rent and late fees, you might act as the contact for maintenance or janitorial services.
 After a few years you may find you are accumulating capital and have the time to devote to taking on extra work. In the long run, managing your own properties would likely result in the largest profit margin. It may also become more work than you bargained for, and new businesses can take many years to get themselves out of debt. Consider the risks and rewards before making any big decisions.

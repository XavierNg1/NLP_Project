 The cardboard will ensure that the gum stuck to your garment will not melt off and then get stuck on your ironing board. Place the piece of clothing down on the cardboard so that the spot with the gum stuck to it is in the middle of the piece of cardboard.


You can also use a piece of brown paper.
 Turn the dial on your iron so that it is at a medium heat. Medium heat is best because anything hotter would melt the gum. Instead, what you are going to do is try to heat the gum up so that it loosens from the fabric, rather than melting everywhere and making a mess.
 The fabric with the gum should be face-down on the cardboard so that you are ironing the backside of the garment and the fabric is making a barrier between the gum and the iron., Eventually, the gum should melt enough that it sticks to the cardboard rather than to the fabric. Pull the garment away from the cardboard. If the gum hasnâ€™t stuck completely to the cardboard, continue to iron the spot until it does.

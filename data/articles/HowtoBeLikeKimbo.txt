 Mainly those arms! Get some weights or go to a gym and get huge forearms, biceps, triceps and chest. Eat a lot! You need to get big and that's by eating all the food you can.;
, Don't shave, let it grow!

, Don't much around in class and don't be a bitch. Answer questions and be good at school grades, but don't be a big mouth or some troublemaker.
 Before doing so, punch the punching bag or get into some boxing classes. You have the muscles, the looks, and now you need a rep in the school hierarchy. Bulled! Perfect! Fight one of them in a one on one fist fight, making sure it's filmed and win! No mercy.
 Make peace with the bullies and become friends.
 Show that you're the greatest.

If you sew it (this option works best), push the threaded needle through the center of the medium pom-pom, and through the center of the large pom-pom. Then repeat it in reverse.
To keep the mouse from falling apart, tie the to leftover ends of the thread together tightly.
If you glue it (this is quicker and easier) you will need to wait for the glue to dry completely before continuing.;

The head is the medium pom-pom, which has been sewn/glued to the body, the largest pom-pom.
Cutting the pom-pom can be difficult, so be patient.
Try to cut through the middle of the pom-pom, or it will fall apart.
When you glue on the ears, make sure they are straight or facing the way you want them to.
Wait until the glue is completely dry before moving on to the next step.
Do not use glue dots for this part! The ears only stick if liquid glue is used.
 Use a glue dot or liquid glue to stick them on.


The tail length is best between the length of the mouse, or double that length.
Glue dots are greatly preferred over liquid glue, as they do not require drying time.
Paws should be small. You can use small balls of pipe cleaner, little hands made from pipe cleaner (these look best but are extremely hard to make) or even no paws at all!
Make sure that you glue the paws on first; that will help decide where the tail would look best.
If your mouse will have a bendy, twisty, or curly tail, do that before gluing.



This step is not necessary, and some people find that the mice look cuter without eyes.
If you do use eyes, make sure they are on the head and in the right place.

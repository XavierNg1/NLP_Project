, It is very important that you are showing a black image and not just a blank signal, as you need the backlighting of the LCD to be illuminating the back of the panel.
 A Sharpie marker with the cap on, an extremely dull pencil, a plastic stylus, or the end of a makeup brush would all work for this.


Before you proceed further read the warnings at the end of this article. Physically rubbing your monitor might actually make things worse.
 Don't tap hard to start with, just enough to see a quick white glow under the point of contact. If you didn't see a white glow, then you didn't tap hard enough, so use just slightly more pressure this time.
 Increase the pressure on the taps gradually for 5-10 taps until the pixel rights itself.
 If your tapping hasn't yielded any results, grab a damp (not wet) washcloth or paper towel. Fold the fabric so that you don't accidentally tear it, and hold it over the stuck pixel, and apply gentle but consistent pressure with the same object you used for tapping.


Try to apply pressure only to the stuck pixel and not the surrounding area.
 Display a white image (such as an empty text document, or sending your browser to about:blank and going to fullscreen with F11) to verify that you haven't accidentally caused more damage than you fixed. If you fixed the stuck pixel, your whole screen should be white.

 Writing time should be at least 15 minutes long, but 30 minutes may be better, depending on the type of writing you are doing.


Encourage students to free write. That is, have them write whatever comes to their heads, at least at first.
If you are working in a particular form, divide the time between a period for free writing and a period for putting it into the form.
Let students know that their writing doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s just a draft, not a finished product.
 Create a prompt by using one of your life experiences.


Start by thinking of a funny or weird story that happened to you, such as the time you found out that your cat crashed into the hedgehog cage, or how you landed a job by tripping over the CEO.
Write out the beginning of the story, changing details if you want.
However, leave out the end. That will prompt the writers to come up with their own story.
 Alternatively, come up with a bizarre question for a good writing prompt.


For example, a question such as “What happens when you step outside to find your house is in an entirely different location?”
Something interesting will spark the imagination of your writers. You can spend some time brainstorming to come up with an idea.
Try thinking of questions that help your reader imagine things differently.
For instance, you could come up with a series of questions that focus on the wrong sense for the object, such as “What does purple taste like?” or “What does classical music smell like?”

, The internet has any number of prompts that will help your students get started writing.


Choose one appropriate to the age level you are teaching, such as something silly for younger students.
 Have students bring in objects, and set them up in front.


Let students write on whichever one they want (leaving them all at the front of the room).
Old photographs or postcards also make great prompts. Basically, anything that will spark an idea can be used as a prompt.

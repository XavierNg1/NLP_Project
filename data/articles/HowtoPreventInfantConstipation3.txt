 Dehydration can cause or exacerbate constipation. Offer a bottle or the breast frequently to keep up the baby's fluid intake, especially during warm weather., Fruit juices draw fluid to the intestines and can help loosen stool. Start with 2 to 4 oz. (60 to 120 ml) of water, prune, apple or pear juice once or twice a day. But talk to your doctor about how much water or juice is safe for your baby., Discuss any changes in formula with the infant's pediatrician before making any changes. The doctor may have specific recommendations based on the infant's medical history and symptoms. Infants may react badly to certain ingredients in a formula. You also might ask the doctor if he or she would recommend adding prune juice to the formula to help loosen the stools., When feeding a constipated infant, avoid those foods that are more likely to trigger constipation, like bananas, carrots, and rice cereal. Instead, feed your baby prunes, pears, oatmeal, and barley cereal to help move her digestion along.

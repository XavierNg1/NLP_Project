 In order to get the best tasting experience from your wine, you will want to consider using glasses of a certain shape. For a white wine, use a glass with a smaller bowl that helps maintain a cool temperature and preserves the wine’s aromas. For a red wine, you will want a glass with a larger bowl that helps deliver the aroma and limits the burn of the alcohol in the wine.However, if you are not particular about how your wine tastes, you can serve it in any kind of cup you want.
 When you are setting the table for your Thanksgiving feast, you will want to be sure to place the wine glass to the top right of the dinner plate and next to the water glass. If you want to make sure that your guests get the correct glass for their wine, consider offering your guests wine when they arrive and then allow them to keep their wine glass for dinner. This sign of hospitality will keep you from doing any guess work.Avoid setting out more than two glasses. Too many drinks can overcrowd your dining area and lead to spills.
 The flavor of most red wines will improve significantly if allowed to sit in a decanter for 30 to 45 minutes. Simply pour the wine that you want to serve in a decanter and let it sit. Cheap red wines, in particular, will benefit from some decanting. In fact, most wines, with the exception of very old wines, will benefit from some decanting.You can also use an aerator that will decant your wine almost instantaneously.
 If you have any leftover wine after your Thanksgiving festivities, you should invest in a wine preserver. This will help preserve the wine’s flavor and aroma. Storing the wine in the fridge and keeping it out of direct sunlight will also help it last longer.If you have access to one, store your wine in a wine refrigerator.

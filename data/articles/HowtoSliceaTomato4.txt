 This is a fun alternative way to cut tomatoes, and is particularly helpful if you're squeamish with blades and don't feel comfortable with your knife skills, or if you're just looking for another way to repurpose that egg or apple slicer taking up space in your drawer. Egg slicers can work great for smaller tomatoes, while an apple slicer will work better on beefsteak tomatoes., Simply place your tomato into the slicer's center cradle, as you would a hardboiled egg or an apple.
 Gently yet quickly press down on the cutting lever to slice through your tomato.
 Enjoy!

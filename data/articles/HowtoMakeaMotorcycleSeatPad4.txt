Insert just enough staples to temporarily secure the cover.
Check to see that the seat cover is correctly placed. If it isn't, take out some or all of the staples and reposition it.
When the seat cover is correctly placed, shoot staples every 2 inches (5 cm) around the edge of the seat cover.
Check once more to see if the seat cover is straight and tight. If it is, shoot in a staple every 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm).

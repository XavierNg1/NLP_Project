 Before making any cuts, most woodworking projects will require you to make measurements and mark out your cuts on the wood. Essential tools for these tasks are a tape measure, a carpenter's pencil, and a combination square.;
, Of course, making cuts in wood is the backbone of woodworking. A handheld circular saw is an essential power tool for making straight cuts, while a jigsaw is ideal for making rounded cuts. A handheld backsaw provides a cheap and quiet alternative to these power tools.
 To create woodworking projects with elegant, finished appearances, you'll often want to shape the wood by creating beveled edges or intricate molding. Crucial tools for shaping wood include a block plane, which will allow you to create basic beveled edges, and a router, which can be fitted with a variety of bits allowing for more intricate patterns.
 Screws, nails, and glue are the go-to choices for assembling your woodworking projects. A cordless drill is essential for drilling holes, while a screwdriver, hammer, and clamps are also very useful. (For your first clamp try a one-handed bar clamp so you don't have to take both hands off the project.)

 You can quickly open the Applications folder from your Dock, or by clicking the "Go" menu in Finder and selecting "Applications". You can also press ⇧ Shift+⌘ Command+A. This is the most common location for installed programs to be found.
 Programs are either represented by a single icon, i.e. "Mozilla Firefox", or as a folder of programs, i.e. "Microsoft Office". You can delete entire folders at once or just single programs.


If you accidentally drag the wrong program into the Trash, just drag it back into the Applications folder.
 Right-click on your Trash icon and select "Empty Trash" to delete the program(s) inside. Click Empty Trash to confirm that you want to delete everything.
 Many programs will leave behind configuration files. These files can be helpful if you end up reinstalling the program. Sometimes, though, you'll want to completely remove the files.


Hold the ⌥ Option key and click the "Go" menu.
Select "Library" from the "Go" menu.
Find files related to the program in the ~/Library/, ~/Library/Preferences/, and ~/Library/Application Support/ folders. Drag these files to the Trash.
 Newer versions of OS X include the Launchpad. You'll find all of your installed programs here. You can only uninstall programs that have been installed from the Mac App Store. To remove any other programs, you'll need to follow the method above.
 If you are having difficulty removing a program, you may need to enlist the help of a program remover. One of the most popular removal programs for Mac is App Cleaner, available for free from freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/.

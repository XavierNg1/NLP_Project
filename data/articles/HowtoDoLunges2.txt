 Start the reverse lunge by standing straight up with your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Keep your shoulders square, which helps keep your back straight by engages the appropriate supporting musculature. Use your abdominal muscles to further stabilize your back.Throughout a lunge exercise your arms and hands can be in any position that helps you maintain your balance. Some people may prefer to put their hands on their hips while others may prefer to keep their arms held out to the side.
 Lower your body until your left foot touches the ground, toes first.
 Once your left foot touches the ground, continue to shift your body backward until both your right and left legs form 90-degree angles at the knees. Your right lower leg (shin) should be perpendicular to the floor and your right upper leg (thigh) should be parallel to the floor. Your left lower leg (shin) should be parallel to the floor while your left upper leg (thigh) should be perpendicular to the floor.You’re left foot will remain with only your toes touching the ground.
 Push off the floor with your left foot until you’re able to return to the starting position. Return your feet beside each other, both flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
 Repeat the reverse lunge by either continuing on your left side (left leg going backwards) or switch to your right side (right leg going backwards). It doesn’t matter what order you perform the lunges in, but try to do an equal number of lunges on both sides before you finish your exercise routine.

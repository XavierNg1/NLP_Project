 This will be the fabric of the dress, so choose whatever pattern/fabric you want. Cut the sleeve off of the shirt where it meets the body.

, Starting at the top where the diagonal cut has been made (because of the way the sleeve connected to the body of the shirt), turn the sleeve inside out and fold it on top of the rest of the sleeve so that there is approximately one inch of overlap on one side and 2-3 inches of overlap on the other side (because of the diagonal cut).
 Place a piece of elastic about 1/2 inch from the top of the dress. Pull it taut around the circumference of the dress and cut it at the desired length, gluing the two ends of the elastic together with fabric glue. Fold the extra fabric at the top over the elastic band and sew in a straight line below the elastic to create a casing for the elastic band.

 The diagonal cut of the dress (because of the original shape of the shirt sleeve) will create a hip maxi dress look with a diagonal overlay. Add a cute necklace to complete the outfit.

Most cleaners should sit on the stain for a set amount of time before being wiped off.
Look the safety instructions on your cleaner as well. Gloves or goggles may be advised.
 Lemon juice and baking soda can clean a lot of dirt and grime off of aluminum and leave it looking shiny. After applying a commercial cleaner to the stains, give the whole frame a scrub with a paste made of a half cup lemon juice and a quarter cup lemon juice., Rub the paste using a sponge or rag. The paste should remain on the window frame until it dries. The precise time this will take depends on the current climate in your area.Make sure you apply the paste to the entire window frame. Do not neglect cracks or crevices in the window.
If you need a smaller tool, such as a scrub brush, to get into certain places, use that to apply the cleaner.
 Use a damp sponge to remove the paste after it dries. Use water to rinse off the paint and any remaining traces of your commercial cleaner. Make sure to keep rinsing until the water runs clean. Any lingering residue could damage your windows.

 Your secret weapon is going to be healthy, hydrated skin, which makes your naturally beautiful skin glow and shine. After moisturizing, apply concealer lightly around your eyes and any spots or dark patches for a nice, even skin tone.









A light, liquid concealer that matches your skin tone will usually do the trick.
If you're going out at night, a light dusting of foundation may help. It can, however, look cakey in daylight if you over do it.
 Whatever color you chose for your eyes, understated is best. Using a finely-pointed eye-liner, draw a nice, clean line right on the eyelash line on top of your eye. Then make a similar line on the bottom eyelid, but only do the outer 1/3 of the lower lash.









If you have time, use a pencil smudging brush to smooth out and blend the line, especially towards the outer edge.
If you want to use eyeshadow, keep it light. Apply it first, then use a dark eyeliner to add the essential contrast to your eyes and make them pop.
Use liquid eyeliner if you find it easier.
 Work from root to tip, adding a bit more of that darkness at the root of your eyes. This also offsets any coloring in eye shadow, helping for a more vibrant look.









You only need a little mascara on the bottom lashes.
 Save vibrant or out-there colors for the evening. For now, a lightly pink, darker blush, something a little closer to your skin tone but still with a bit of rosy pop, will give your skin a beautiful glow.
 You can add a darker colored lip liner as well, if you have time. Otherwise, a nice, bright lipstick will bring the whole look together with an alluring burst of color.

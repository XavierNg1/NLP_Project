 Buy 4-5 traps depending on your level and how many you can use, and teleport to Feldip Hills, some methods of getting there include Gnome Gliders (after The Grand Tree), Feldip Hill teleport scrolls from clue rewards, or the Oo'glog lodestone teleport and running north. Go west of the hunter master.
 This allows you to catch the chinchompas in the most efficient method, and makes it easier to replace the traps afterward. Don't bother smoking or baiting your traps, as the bonus to catching is not worth the time and money spent on getting them.

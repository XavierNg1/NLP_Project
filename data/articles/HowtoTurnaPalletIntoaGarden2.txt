 Get your pallet, check it over for rotting wood or any joins that are giving way. Do any necessary repairs to make it safe. Paint it in a bright color.
 Take some empty tin cans (enough to fill the base of the pallet). Give them a very good wash and rub with steel wool to roughen up the surface and help the paint to stick.


Using a hammer and nail, put several drainage holes into the bottom. Apply a metal primer such as Rust-oleum, then paint with several layers of acrylic paint.






Finish with a coat of clear acrylic sealer.
 When nailing the cans to the pallet, be very careful of any sharp edges (you may like to file these down). Then put 2 inches (5.1Â cm) of crocks or gravel in the bottom of the cans before filling them with soil and planting up.
 These pallet gardens look best when propped against a fence or wall, rather than lying flat on the ground.


Alternatively you could hang up your pallet garden with chains to raise it vertically above the ground.






You could even attach plants to both sides and hang the pallet from a tree branch for visual interest on both sides.

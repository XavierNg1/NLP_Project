 A person cannot really be "removed" from a deed; rather, to remove someone from a deed, a new deed without the deceased's name must be issued. The new deed should be signed and notarized by all new owners of the property. To get a copy of the deed, you can do one of the following steps.
 Deeds are typically kept in the probate court, and you can generally get a copy of your deed for a small fee.


You can search by your name, the property address or the legal description of the property.
 The fees for mailing and faxing are usually similar to the fees you would pay to get a deed in person.


Check with the court that your deed was recorded in to see if they accept requests by mail or fax.
 Many counties allow parties to retrieve copies of a deed online, sometimes for free.


For example, Wayne County, Michigan charges $5.00 to search for deeds online and an additional $1.00 to print copies, while Georgetown County, South Carolina, has a free deed search online.
 In some states, title companies do home closings and record deeds. So, if you do not want to personally find a copy of your deed, the title company can do it for you.


Expect to pay around $100.00 for this service, plus any additional fees from copying the deed.
 A real estate attorney can find a copy of your deed for you. Additionally, the attorney can help you facilitate the process of removing the deceased ownerâ€™s name from the deed.

 Place your clean, cut MDF board onto your adhesive paper. Follow the perimeter with your pencil to outline it onto the paper. Now you’re ready to cut the paper along the outline with a utility knife or scissors.

If you’re using a utility knife to cut the adhesive paper, be careful you don’t accidentally cut into your work surface. You may want to put something underneath when cutting, like cardboard.
It’s best to cut your paper too large than too small. Paper that’s too large can be easily trimmed down to size after being attached., Carefully remove the backing on your cut piece of adhesive paper. Line up one corner of the paper with the corresponding corner of the face-up side of the MDF and press it into place lightly.

If you’ve cut your adhesive paper correctly, it should fit the MDF board perfectly.
 Use your clean fingers to smooth the adhesive paper to the MDF from the attached corner the one opposite. Check the alignment with the edge as you go and make adjustments as necessary.

You may need to lightly pull up the paper where it has been attached to reorient it so it is properly aligned with the edges of the MDF.
 Work little by little from the attached side to the non-attached side. Use your fingers or a tool, like a roller, to press the paper smoothly into place on the MDF. There should be no bubbling or folded over parts.

Bubbles can be chased to the outer edges of the paper with your fingers or a straight edge, like a ruler.
Worst-case scenario, use a pin to create a small hole in bubbled areas. When these deflate, smooth them as best you can with your fingers or a straight edge.
 You’re finally ready to mount your poster to the MDF! Peel the remaining backing off the adhesive paper and attach your poster in the same fashion you did the adhesive paper.

Avoid storing your plaque mounted poster in direct sunlight or exposing it to heat. These can cause the glue to degrade and lose its stickiness.

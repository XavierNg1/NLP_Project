 Drape the tie around the other person's collar, so the underside of the tie faces you. Let the wide end fall on the left side (from your perspective), and the narrow end on your right. The wide end should reach about 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) below the wearer's belt buckle, or about 12 inches (30 cm) below the tip of the narrow end., Bring the wide end of the tie over to your right side (the left side of the wearer's body)., Raise the wide end up to the loop at the wearer's collar. Insert the tip from above and pull through completely. Keep the wide end on the same side, without crossing the narrow end., The wide end should now be back in front of your left hand, with the seamless front side facing you., Fold the tip under itself and pull through the neck loop., Loosen the horizontal loop at the front of the tie with your finger. Bring the wide end through this loop and pull through. The wide end should end roughly at the top of the wearer's belt buckle, and completely cover the narrow end underneath., Pull down on the wide end and slide the knot upward to complete the look.

 Place 1 tablespoon (14 g) of the butter into a medium saucepan. Mince enough garlic cloves to get one tablespoon of minced garlic (about 9 g). Add the minced garlic to the pan. Turn the heat on to medium and let the butter melt. It should cook for a few minutes.The garlic will also saute as the butter melts. It should become lightly brown once it's finished cooking.
 Add the remaining 15 tablespoons (212 g) of butter and turn the heat down to low. Stir the butter as it melts completely. This should take a minute or two., Take a bit of fresh lemon and squeeze it, so you get 2 tablespoons of juice. Stir the juice into the garlic butter. You'll also need to add 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper and 4 teaspoons of fresh cilantro. Keep the heat on low and let the butter infuse for about 10 minutes.You can serve the sauce once it's steeped or you can strain it through a mesh strainer to remove any solids before you serve it.
Consider dipping seafood in the sauce or pouring it over cooked pasta.

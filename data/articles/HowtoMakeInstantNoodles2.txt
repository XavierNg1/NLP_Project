 Choose a saucepan that holds 2-3 quarts (1.9-2.8 liters) of water. Next, add 2 Â½ cups (600 mililiters) of water to the saucepan. Place it on your stove over medium-high heat and allow it to come to a boil.The pan should be large enough that it can easily hold the water but small enough so that the noodles can be submerged.
 Carefully open the noodle package and remove the seasoning packet. Open the seasoning packet and add it to the boiling water. Stir it with long chopsticks or a spoon to completely incorporate it into the water.


Be careful not to splash yourself with boiling water while stirring.
 Carefully place the noodles into the boiling water. Once the noodles are in the water, use a pair of long chopsticks to push them further into the water a few times. This will help cook the noodles that are sticking out of the water.


For long noodles, place the whole brick of dried noodles into the water.
For medium-sized noodles, break the brick into a few chunks before adding the pieces to the boiling water.
For hundreds of tiny noodles, crush the brick of noodles in the package before pouring it into the boiling water., Let the noodles boil for three to four minutes. Once the noodles soften, begin stirring them slowly with long chopsticks or a large spoon. When the noodles start to break apart, begin looking for the signs of a cooked noodle:


The noodles will change from a chalky white color to a semi-translucent yellow color.
The noodles will easily separate from one another and spread across the pan.
When you lift a noodle out of the pan, it will be springy and curly.
 Once the noodles are cooked, turn off the stove. Carefully pour the ramen and the ramen broth into a large soup bowl. If the noodles are steaming, let them cool for a minute or two before eating them.


Eat the noodles with chopsticks or a fork.

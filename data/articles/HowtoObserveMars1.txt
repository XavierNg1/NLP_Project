 For optimal viewing of the Mars, track its orbit with a sky map or chart to keep track of its distance from Earth. A sky map is a map of the night sky that indicates the location of planets, stars, constellations, and other celestial bodies.Interactive versions are available online (for an example, visit http://www.sky-map.org/), or you can download an app for your smart phone. Make sure to get the right map for your current location, and for the current date., Mars’ closest approach to Earth occurs every 26 months, but it appears the brightest eight days earlier, on the date of opposition. This date marks the point in the planet’s orbit when it rises in the east as the sun sets, which makes it visible in our sky overnight. While there are many other opportunities to view Mars in the night sky, this biennial event should not be missed if you are truly interested in observing the planet., Ensure that the weather will be favorable and the skies will be clear for the night and time when you intend to observe Mars. Cloudy skies, and certainly precipitation, will impede your viewing. Consult a local weather report, or a clear sky chart online to predict weather conditions for the near future.

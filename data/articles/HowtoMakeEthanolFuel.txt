If you intend to produce ethanol fuel in the United States, complete and submit the following form to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB): http://www.ttb.gov/forms/f511074.pdf



 


If you intend to produce ethanol fuel elsewhere, request proper instructions on how to legally produce ethanol fuel from the government agency that deals with such issues in your area.






Confirm that you are legally authorized to produce ethanol fuel before continuing.

Obtain throwaway fruit from your local grocer or another source. Fruit that is rotten may be used in lieu of edible food.






Add fruit until the barrel is approximately 1/3 full. It is important to not exceed this amount, as the barrel may overflow during fermentation.
,


Although standard yeast can be used, it is best to use ethanol tolerant yeast from a wine-making supply store.






Add 1 to 2 packets to the barrel.
,

Check the sugar content daily with a hydrometer.






Over the course of approximately 10 days, the sugar content should reduce gradually until none is left.



Do this immediately after the sugar is gone from the mixture. Not doing so could allow materials to develop that could ruin your engine.






Put the mixture into a reflux still.






Follow the manufacturer's instructions to complete the distillation process.


The ethanol that you are left with after the distillation process will still have a minor impurity of water inside of it. To remove this water, you need to use a specialized fuel filter that can filter the water out. These filters are made out of specially-designed fabrics that allow ethanol molecules to pass through while trapping the water.


Depending on your engine type and regulations that apply to ethanol production in your area, add the required amount of gasoline (petrol) to the mixture. A fuel that is commonly produced is E85, which is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline (petrol).

 You should have an Intervention or Barrett .50 cal. You can attach any equipment except silencer or thermal (these are for the stealthy or the campers). Use Sleight of Hand Pro, Stopping Power. The third perk is your choice however, if you noscope a lot, consider Steady Aim.;
, This way, you do not have to press twice to aim and move.
 Quick scoping is all about being quick when killing an enemy. When you see a guy, center your cross hairs on him and then scope in. Once you scope in, shoot instantly then zoom out. This takes a lot of practice. If you miss, quickly retry.
 When the center of the crosshair is on the enemy, it'll be in the center of the scope, too.
 If you've reached the end of your magazine, hit the reload button and double tap the weapon switch button at the moment of reload canceling required by your weapon.

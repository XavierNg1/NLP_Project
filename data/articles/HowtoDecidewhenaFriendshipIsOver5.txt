 Book clubs, astronomy clubs, movie-going clubs... the list goes on. Check social media and sites like Meetup.com for clubs and hobby groups in your area.


If book clubs are your thing, contact your local library. Larger libraries in big cities probably feature multiple book clubs, perhaps catering to particular types of literature. For instance, you might be able to find a history book club, an African-American literature book club, and so on.
 If you believe in a higher power, attend the religious service of your choice. In addition to fulfilling your spiritual needs, attending a religious service can be a great opportunity to meet new people who share your beliefs. Look for local services in your area and find one that’s right for you.Don’t be afraid to try several different churches, mosques, etc. before settling on one. Remember, it’s free to attend, so you should go to as many as you can until you find one you like.
 Becoming friends with your coworkers can make your work life more lively and enjoyable.Invite some coworkers out for drinks or dinner after work one night. Suggest to them, for instance, “Would you guys/gals like to grab a bite after work? I know a great place not far from here.”


Do not tell your coworkers you know a great place that is quite close to your place of employment if you in fact do not.
 There are many opportunities to join sports teams. Whether it’s an informal neighborhood basketball team or a well-organized community soccer team, sports can be a great way to make friends. The bonds built while training, playing, winning, and even losing together can last a lifetime.

Peeling paint should be removed--the area primed and repainted.
Small cracks or holes can be filled with wood putty, sanded smooth, primed and repainted. If the cracks are extensive, replacement is the better option.
Call an expert to repair insect damage, such as termites and ants.
Small dry rot repairs can be effected by cutting out the entire patch of rot as well as at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of clean wood all around the edges. Fill in the hole with a polyester wood resin filler, allow to dry, sand smooth, prime and paint. Large areas of dry rot may require replacing the siding entirely.

 Doing things other than sleeping in your bed can make it harder to fall asleep at night. Make sure that the only thing that you do in your bed is sleep. Do not watch TV, play video games, or do homework in your bed., Eating too close to bedtime can make it hard for you to fall asleep because your body is still digesting food. Try to schedule your last snack of the day at least two hours before bedtime. For example, if your bedtime is 9:00pm, then have your evening snack at about 7:00pm.


Don’t eat too much either. Just have a light snack.For example, try having a piece of toast or a small bowl of cereal with milk.Don’t drink anything that has caffeine in it after 3:00pm either or it may interfere with your ability to fall asleep., Doing things that require lots of energy or that get you excited may make it harder to fall asleep at night. Participate in active play activities earlier in the day and do more low key things later in the day.For example, ride a bike, play a video game, or play soccer in the early afternoon, and then read and listen to music in the evening.
 Having a set bedtime can make it easier to fall asleep at night because your body will learn when it is time to sleep each night. Make sure that you stick to the same bedtime, even on the weekends.For example, if your weeknight bedtime is 9:00pm, then keep that bedtime on the weekend as well.
It is also a good idea to wake up at the same time every day.

 Good goals are specific, measurable, realistic and timely.


Specific goals are clearly defined. "Make money" is not a specific goal. "Make $100k profit" is specific.
Set measurable goals defined in terms where you can easily see whether you have attained them, and check your progress. "Increase market share" is not measurable. "Increase market share to 55 percent" is.
Realistic goals are things you can reasonably reach given the resources and realities of your business situation. "Dethrone Microsoft" is not realistic. "Launch a viable streaming video product" is.
Timely goals are set with a specific timeline for progress. Without a timeline, it's difficult to gauge how much money to put into your budget for any given quarter.;
, Use the expenses from your budget history to estimate the costs of development.


If you're creating a business development budget for a new company, or a project your company has never taken on, you won't have applicable financial documents. In this case, you should base your estimates on numbers for other businesses in the same region and industry. You can get general industry statistics from trade associations and public records.
 Some examples include facilities, payroll, taxes, insurance, raw materials and cost of goods sold.
 Account for any unique costs associated with your particular business, such as payments to a former owner.
 If your budget is too small or too large, there's a good chance you missed an important consideration. Review your work and revise accordingly.

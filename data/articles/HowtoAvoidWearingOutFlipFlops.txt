 Try not to slide your feet so that the flip flop rubs against the ground. The more it rubs, the faster the sole will diminish and the greater the chances of slipping. Usually the heel part of the flip flop rubs out the greatest because of where the pressure is when walking.;
, Don't bend them unless you're walking. Dry them with a paper towel (or a reusable rag to avoid unnecessary landfill waste) if they're wet. Clean any dirt or sand that gets trapped on the soles; anything that gets trapped there, such as small rocks, will cause "wear and tear" with every step.
 When a dog wants to play, he will grab the first thing that looks interesting, and it may be your footwear. Dogs may chew on, scratch, dunk, or hide your flip flop. In the process, it may stretch out the "thong", the "Y" shaped material that divides your toes (see below)., It may be fun to do while you're sitting down, but stretching it too much will increase the chance of having it become too loose (and uncomfortable to walk with) or the bottom peg of the flip flop may loosen and pull out from the sole., Most people tend to put most of their weight towards the sole of the flip flop which causes a major wear-in. Try to put just as much on the "balls" of your feet as you do on the sole of your feet.

 Look for Google Chrome on your computer and open it. The web browser will load.;
, Click on the button with three horizontal bars on the upper right corner of the browser. This will bring down the main menu. Scroll down and click on “Settings.” The Settings page will load in a new tab.


You can also go directly to this page by entering “chrome://settings/” on the address bar.
 Scroll through the Settings options until you find the Search section. You will see what the current default search engine being used by the omnibox is.
 Click on the “Manage search engines” button to display the list of search engines you can use for the omnibox. A small window will appear listing Default search engines and Other search engines.


The first section of the small window is for the Default search engines. This contains the more popular search engines, namely Google, Yahoo!, and Bing.
The second section of the small window is for the Other search engines. This contains all the other sites that can be used as a search engine. Almost any website with a search bar or function can be put here. Some sites here may not be search engines for the Internet, but just for their specific websites. Your company’s Intranet search engine may be found here.
 If the search engine you want to use isn’t on the lists, you can add it. Use the scroll bar on the right to scroll to the bottom of the window. A row with three empty fields can be found there.


Type in the name of the new search engine on the first field, its keyword on the second field, and its URL on the third field.
Press the Enter key when done and the new search engine will be added to the list.
 Hover over the search engine you want to set a default for the omnibox. A “Make Default” button will appear over it; click on it. The selected search engine will now be used as the default search engine for the omnibox.


A text “Default” will appear beside its name.
 This will save your changes and exit the window.

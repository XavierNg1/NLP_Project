 Just like helicopters, airplanes can be found only on specific locations on San Andreas. You can only get airplanes from airports and military bases.;
, Approach an airplane you see on the locations mentioned above and press the triangle (for PS4) or the Y button (for Xbox 360) on your controller to get in.
 After getting on the airplane, press and hold the R2 (for PS4) or the Right Trigger button (for Xbox 360) to accelerate. Once you’ve gained enough speed, the plane should automatically take off.
 Once you’ve reached your desired altitude, use the arrow keys to move around the sky and fly to where you need to go.
 To land, press and hold the L2 (for PS4) or the Left Trigger button (for Xbox 360) to slowly decelerate. This will lower your altitude. As you come closer to the ground, use the directional keys to properly maneuver your plane to your desired landing spot.

 Place the minced garlic, Dijon mustard, white vinegar, and salt in a blender or food processor. Pulse to combine.Continue until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. You should still see pieces of minced garlic in the mixture; you do not need to blend them down into a smooth paste.
Note that you should use fresh minced garlic, not dried. If you choose to use whole cloves, smash and mince four cloves before adding them to the blender.
 Add the mayonnaise to the blender. Process for several seconds, or until a thick paste forms.


The mayonnaise acts as a replacement for the egg yolk found in more conventional Caesar dressing recipes. Mayonnaise contains egg, so it can add the same sort of thickness and richness to the dressing while minimizing the risk of food poisoning.
 Continue blending the dressing on low speed. Pour a thin, steady stream of olive oil into the dressing through the top opening, and blend until combined.


Once everything combines into a thick, even dressing, scrape down the sides of the blender with a spatula. Stir the dressing to mix in these scrapings.
 Pause the blender. Add the anchovy paste, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Pulse for several more seconds, or until combined.


Alternatively, you could stir these ingredients into the dressing instead of pulsing them in with the blender.
If desired, you may omit the anchovy paste. The Worcestershire sauce in this recipe will still give the dressing its characteristic deep, salty flavor, but adding the anchovy paste will further emphasize that particular flavor profile.
Taste the dressing at this stage and adjust the seasonings as desired., Toss the finished dressing into a prepared Caesar salad. You can serve it at room temperature or slightly chilled.


Ideally, you should use the dressing within one or two days. Store it in the refrigerator in an airtight container, then whisk well before serving.

Draw wide curved line for the chicken’s torso.
MS Paint offers different brush tools. I used the watercolor tool to avoid making it look flat.
You can use white or brown depending on what you want.
Don’t forget to set the shapes to Fill>”SOLID” and to set the secondary and primary colors properly.;

To do this, add an upside-down U for the head.
With simple and short strokes, work your way from the U to the body.



Adjust the chicken’s body as you see fit.



Use a red brush this time.



Use an orange brush color for the beak and black for the eyes.



For the wings, draw short strokes using a gray brush first. Do this to add some depth into the wings.
Then, add some white highlights.

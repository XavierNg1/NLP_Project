 For this look, the softer and more feminine the top looks, the better. Avoid bold patterns and prints. Instead, choose something in a light hue, like a white or pastel pink. Look for girly details like lace, ruffles, or frills. A free-flowing top works a bit better than a structured top, but a structured top with plenty of feminine flair can still work.;
, If you do have a more structured top, you can soften it up by shrugging on a dainty cardigan sweater. Other feminine over-shirts, like lace blazers, can also work well, but you should stay away from solid structured blazers if you are trying to accomplish this look., For free-flowing tops, a black, gray, or brown pencil skirt keeps the outfit looking balanced while hugging your curves in all the right places. If you have a more structured top, however, you might want to consider a frillier skirt. An A-line skirt with ruffles or pleats could work wonders, for example. Maximize your womanly charms by choosing a skirt that lands at or slightly above the knee.
 If the weather is still a little chilly, you can keep your legs warm by throwing on a pair of leggings beneath your skirt and tucked into the boots. Black or dark brown leggings will help your leg to look skinny and petite, maximizing the contrast you are trying to accomplish by wearing large, chunky combat boots. Tights that have a slight sparkle or lace pattern can also be worn as long as the rest of your outfit is fairly plain.
 Choose boots in black or brown, depending on which color best matches the colors of your clothing. The boots can be in good condition, but in order to really take advantage of the contrast, it might help if the boots look a little worn.
 Doll yourself up using your standard dressy make-up routine. If you do not have one, consider adding a little eyeshadow or lipstick to your face for an extra pop of feminine flair. Keep your accessories light but girly. Think of dangling pearl earrings or a sparkly gold tennis bracelet.

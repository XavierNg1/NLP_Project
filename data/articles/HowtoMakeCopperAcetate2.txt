 Add calcium carbonate to vinegar. Mix until the calcium carbonate is completely dissolved. You can order calcium carbonate from a chemical supplier, but this is not necessary as it is the main ingredient in chalk.Use plain white vinegar.
You can simply grind up chalk to make calcium carbonate powder.
Goggles and gloves should be worn while working with acids.
Use half as much calcium carbonate by volume as vinegar. For example, if you use two cups of vinegar, use one cup of calcium carbonate.
 Copper sulfate is another easy chemical to find at a home and garden store. It is often branded as a fungicide. It may also be labeled as a stump killer. It is found dissolved in water.Pour the calcium acetate solution in slowly until the color turns blue. The blue color indicates that you have made copper acetate.
The resulting solution should be blue in color.
Avoid getting the solution on your skin or in your eyes by wearing gloves and goggles.
 The blue solution contains dissolved copper acetate. There will also be a solid that precipitates out of the solution (calcium sulfate). Pour the solution through a strainer to remove the calcium sulfate. You will be left with a blue copper acetate solution.

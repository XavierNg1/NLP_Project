 The problem you will be working with is the following: -2x - 3 = 4x - 15. Before you proceed, make sure that both of the variables are the same. In this case, "-2x" and "4x" both have the same variable, "x," so you can move forward.
 To do this, you'll need to use addition or subtraction to eliminate the constant from the left side of the equation. The constant is -3, so you'll have to take its opposite, +3, and add this constant to both sides of the equation.


Adding +3 to the left side of the equation, -2x -3, will give you (-2x -3) + 3, or -2x on the left side.
Adding +3 to the right side of the equation, 4x -15, will give you (4x - 15) +3, or 4x -12.
Therefore, (-2x - 3) +3 = (4x - 15) +3 = -2x = 4x - 12
The new equation should read -2x = 4x -12

, To do this, you'll simply have to take "the opposite" of "4x", which is "-4x," and subtract -4x from both sides of the equation. On the left side, -2x - 4x = -6x, and on the right side, (4x -12) -4x = -12, so the new equation should read -6x = -12


-2x - 4x = (4x - 12) - 4x = -6x = -12

, Now that you've simplified the equation to -6x = -12, all you have to do is to divide both sides of the equation by -6 to isolate the variable x, which is currently being multiplied by -6. On the left side of the equation, -6x รท -6 = x, and on the right side of the equation, -12 รท -6 = 2. Therefore, x = 2.


-6x รท -6 = -12 รท -6
x = 2

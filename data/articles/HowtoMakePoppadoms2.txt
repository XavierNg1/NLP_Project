 Now that you've prepared your poppadoms for baking, all you have to do is carefully place them on a baking tray lined with foil. You can even oil it a bit to keep the poppadoms from sticking. Make sure you leave enough room between each piece of dough so they don't stick together when they expand a bit during cooking.


You may need to fit several baking sheets in the oven at a time, or to bake your poppadoms in several shifts if you only have one sheet.;
, Keep an eye on your dough after the first 10 minutes or so to make sure it doesn't burn too fast. The finished product should be crisp and dry, but not so dry that it instantly breaks at the touch.
 Set the baking sheet aside and wait for them to cool completely before you fry them.


If you are not ready to serve your poppadoms, you may store them in an airtight container once they have cooled.
 Now, you should heat 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) of oil in a frying pan and wait a minute for the oil to start bubbling a little bit.


If you don't want to fry your baked poppadoms and enjoy the crisp and dry baked version, then you can stop before frying them. However, frying your poppadoms after baking them will give you that delightful, authentic taste you may be craving.
 This should only take about 30 seconds to a minute on one side, and even a bit less time on the second side. Use tongs to carefully turn over the poppadoms once they have cooked on the first side.
 This will ensure that you don't overcook this tasty treat.
 Place the fried poppadoms on paper towels to absorb the excess oil while cooking the remainder of the batch.
 Serve this tasty treat on its own or with your favorite dish. You can enjoy them with hummus, chutney, baba ganoush, or your favorite Indian food.

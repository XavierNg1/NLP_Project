 Write a list of your qualities and your achieved goals. Add detail, such as times that you surprised yourself, or challenges you were especially proud of getting through. List every time you feel you won, and every reason that was significant to you. Soon, you'll have written a portrait of yourself as a winner., If you want to win, you must avoid becoming anxious and obsessive about winning. Stay in the moment by paying attention to your thoughts, senses, and feelings without interpretation or judgement.If you get stressed, try paying attention to your senses. Ask yourself "what am I smelling, how am I moving, what am I hearing and seeing?", To feel like a winner, eat regular meals of a variety of foods. Rather than taking vitamin supplements, eat many different kinds of fruits, vegetables, and grains.Don't skip carbohydrates or protein, but don't go crazy on them either. Carbs give you energy, and protein helps your muscles grow and repair.Cut back on sugar and soda. One sugary drink, dessert, or snack a day is enough., Dress for the job you want. Wear clean clothing that lets everyone know you take yourself seriously. You don't have to buy expensive clothing, or even spend a lot of time getting dressed. Instead, wear clothing that is the right size, not too worn out, and laundered. Shower often, but use shampoo no more than three times a week., Wake up feeling like a winner after a good night's sleep. If you are an adult, get 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. If you are a teenager or child, get 9-11 hours. Sleep deprivation can seriously slow you down, affecting your immune resistance, your weight, and your mental health.

 Locate the crown at the side of the watch. Pinch it between your thumb and index finger, then lift it straight out to the side.


If the watch has a second hand, wait until the second hand reaches the 60th second mark (the 12th hour mark) at the top of the clock before pulling out the crown.
The crown should click into an "out" position without resistance. All hands should stop moving.;
, Spin the crown so that the hands of the clock move forward or in a clockwise rotate. Continue turning the crown until the hands reach the correct time.


Turn the crown toward you.
To prevent the hands from jumping when you start the time again, you should set the minute hand roughly five minutes ahead of the correct minute marker. Then, gently turn it back to the correct minute marker by rotating the crown in the opposite direction.
 When you finish setting the correct time, push the crown back into the side of the watch.


The crown should click back into place and the hands should start moving again.

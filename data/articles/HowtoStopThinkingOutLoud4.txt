 We all engage in some negative self-talk, calling ourselves “Stupid” or saying “You idiot!” if we make a mistake. However, too much negativity can sap your self-esteem. If you feel yourself about to vocalize some negative self-talk, you should stop, take a deep breath, and try to think of something positive., One way to engage in some positive self-talk is to give yourself compliments throughout the day. If you make a good decision, tell yourself “Good job!” These little comments will help boost your self-esteem and make you feel a little better about yourself.For example, if you decide to eat a healthy salad for lunch instead of a greasy hamburger, you might tell yourself “I’m proud of you” or “Good job! That was a good choice.” You could even give yourself a little pat on the back.
 If you need a little motivation for a task, some positive self-talk can help you get motivated. This can be more dramatic self-talk, such as talking to yourself in a mirror before a big event, or more mundane talking, like motivating yourself to perform daily chores. Either way, a little pep talk will help you convince yourself that you are in control and that you can get things done.For example, if you are getting ready for a job interview, you might say something like “You’ve got this. You are the best candidate for this job!” or “You are going to blow their socks off during the interview.”
If you need a little pep talk to motivate yourself, you might say something like “Why are you laying around? You have time to get this done.”

, If you want to achieve a certain goal, talking aloud about how you will reach that objective can help you stay focused on it. Vocalizing your goal and the steps necessary to achieve it focuses your attention on the task and reinforces the message you are trying to convey. It also helps control your emotions and filters out distractions.For example, if you want to run every day, you might say something like “I’m going to go run” each morning.

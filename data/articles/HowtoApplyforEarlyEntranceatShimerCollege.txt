 You can choose either one, but you have to do well on it; to be considered for early entrance at Shimer, you must score in at least the 75th percentile. Therefore, whichever test you choose, make sure you have prepared for the test as best you can.;
, The early entrance application is somewhat different from the standard application, so you'll want to make sure you are using the right one.
 Talk to an admissions counselor to make sure that Shimer is the right school for you, and to verify that you are eligible for early entrance. At this time you can also make arrangements for your interview. Interviews are usually done in person, so you'll probably need to schedule a visit to the campus.
 At least one of the letters (and preferably both of them) must be from a high school teacher who can verify that you are ready for college-level work. These letters of recommendation are especially important for early entrants, so give some thought to whom and how you ask.
 You can choose either to respond to the prompts on the application, or to submit a portfolio of your expository writing. But whichever you choose, leave nothing to chance; revise your writing until it is the best that you can do. Be prepared to defend your thesis in conversation.
, But before you seal the envelope, review the checklist on the application to make sure you haven't missed anything.
, This is required in order to get student loans, and also in order to be considered for any Shimer scholarships, including the Hutchins scholarship for early entrants.
 Is college the right step for you? Is Shimer the right college? When you visited it, did you like what you saw? If you have any doubts about your decision, talk it over with someone you trust.

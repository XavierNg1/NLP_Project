 Photodynamic treatment is an in-office dermatological therapy that consists of using a medication that is activated by a light or a laser to shrink sebaceous glands, therefore limiting oil secretions that cause acne.


Your dermatologist coats the affected area with a photosensitizing ointment that is absorbed into the skin for 30 minutes to three hours. From there, you sit underneath a lamp or have a laser treatment that causes your sebaceous glands to dry out and therefore shrink. This treatment takes place up to three to five times with a few weeks between each session.
This treatment is both effective at addressing current acne concerns and also serves as preventative maintenance.
 Isolaz is a laser-based therapy that targets bacteria that causes acne. It is done in-office and during the session, your dermatologist uses a strong vacuum to suck debris out of your pores, making them extremely clean. Then a laser is applied to the skin to kill off bacteria.Isolaz is a non-invasive, outpatient treatment that has two-sided effect â€” it both cleans the pores and kills acne-causing bacteria.
Consult your dermatologist if your skin is suitable for Isolaz therapy.

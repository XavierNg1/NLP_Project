 Use the flip-and-fold method (like you did to construct the body) to make a slightly oversized rectangle, then trim it down to size. This will later become an internal pocket with an opening facing the central crease of the wallet.









Side pockets are great places to store cards you donâ€™t use often and other odds and ends.
Note that a side pocket is the same height as (but slightly narrower than) half of the wallet body. This is to ensure that the wallet can still fold in half once the side pocket is installed.
If you modified the size of your wallet body, you will have to do the same with the side pocket. For example, if your wallet body is 3 inches high by 8 inches wide (7.5 x 20cm), make your side pocket 3 inches high by 3.75 inches wide (7.5 x 9.5cm).
 This will sit on the opposite side of the interior of the wallet, meaning its opening will face the opening of the other pocket.
 With the wallet body unfolded in front of you, place each side pocket over one side of the fold so that the outermost sides and bottoms line up. Fold tape over the bottoms and the two outermost sides, taking care to leave the interior edges (where the openings will be) uncovered. To tape the tops, place a 3.75-inch (9.5cm) piece of tape along the top of the side flap, then fold it over the interior flap of the wallet body, making sure not to tape the opening of the wallet shut.

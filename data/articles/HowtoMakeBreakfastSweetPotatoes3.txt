 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the sweet potatoes, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully., For the breakfast baked potatoes, you’ll need 2 large sweet potatoes. Use a fork to pierce the potatoes several times, and place them on a baking sheet. Set them in the preheated oven, and allow the potatoes to bake for 45 minutes to an hour.You’ll know the sweet potatoes are done when you can easily insert the fork into them without resistance.
 When the potatoes are finished baking, cut each one in half with a knife. Set them on a plate and allow them to cool for about 5 minutes.The potatoes will be very hot when you remove them from the oven, so be sure to use a potholder or oven mitt to handle them as you cut.
 When the sweet potatoes are slightly cooled, run a fork between the flesh and the skin to gently separate the two. Next, divide 1 cup (245 g) of vanilla yogurt, a handful of walnuts, 2 tablespoons (20 g) of hemp seeds, and a pinch or two of cinnamon and/or nutmeg between the potatoes to top them.You can also drizzle some honey or agave over the potatoes for added sweetness.
You can use any flavor of yogurt that you like on the potatoes and substitute your favorite type of nuts for the walnuts.
Feel free to customize the toppings for the baked sweet potatoes to suit your preferences. Maple syrup, almond butter, banana, and diced apple are tasty options.
 To serve the potatoes, use a fork to mix the potato with the toppings. Add your favorite breakfast protein, such as eggs or bacon, to the dish, and enjoy.

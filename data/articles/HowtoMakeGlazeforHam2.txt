 Whisk the brown sugar and prepared mustard together with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of apple cider vinegar.


If the glaze seems chunky or won't hold together, add another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of apple cider vinegar and continue whisking. The final glaze should form a thick, consistent paste.
Note that you do not need to heat this glaze prior to using it. You may need to periodically remix it, however, if it sits out for more than a few minutes before use.
 Brush this glaze over the ham once the ham only has an estimated 60 minutes left in cooking time. Reapply the glaze every 15 minutes until the ham is finished.


Whisk the remaining glaze immediately before each reapplication.
Ideally, you should apply this glaze to the ham a total of four times. Do not re-glaze the ham after it finishes cooking.

 If you are too shy to talk to her, bite the bullet and talk to her in person or over the phone. If you talk to her, you are more likely to be seen as a good acquaintance or friend than just a stalker. Compliment her on her clothes, hair etc. Find out what she is interested in and what she likes to do for activities, her job, etc.;
, If she says yes, proceed to step three. If she says no, ask her if she is on other sites or just ask her for her number, like the good old days. Ask her for her URL.
 If she does not have one, go to find people and search for her first and last name.
 You don't want to be hooking up with somebody who is acting single but it is really taken. If her profile is private, give it a gamble and add her anyway. It is mandatory by law and Myspace regulations for 14 and 15 year olds to have private profiles and there are lots of older people that have private profiles as well. If you are older than 18 and are digging for a minor, it will ask you if you know the person. By that time, it is better off to date adults than teenagers.
, If she doesn't add you back, she might be a rare Myspace user or she might not know you enough to add her on Myspace. Check the last login date. If she was last online three to six months ago or earlier, she probably gave up Myspace or is a very rare user. Get to know her a little better in real life, instead.

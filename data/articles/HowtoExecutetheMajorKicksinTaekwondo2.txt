 As the name indicates you need to be positioned in a way so that your target is to the side of you. A side kick is not appropriate if your target is located in any other place. Before carrying out this kick, place your body in the correct position.
 If you draw an imaginary line from your opponent to yourself, your foot should run perpendicularly. The key to this kick is a solid base. You must be able to balance your body as you perform the Yop Chagi. Most Taekwondo masters rotate their foot into this position as they are kicking. Doing so allows you to execute the kick quickly.
 Bend your knee so that it raises towards your torso. This motion gives you the ability to extend your leg farther, faster. It will add much needed force to your kick.
 While you extend your leg out, your hips should open up as well, which will add some momentum to your kick.
 Unlike the front kick, you use more of your foot for a side kick. Like a front kick, you want to avoid making contact with your toes to avoid injury.

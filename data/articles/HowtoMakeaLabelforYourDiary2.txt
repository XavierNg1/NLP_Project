 Decide where the label is to go on the diary and choose the measurements. Use these measurements for the paper piece you're about to create.
 There are many options here, just be sure that whatever you use is durable enough to serve as a label. Some of the possibilities include gift wrapping paper, construction paper, old cards, printer paper, craft paper, a paper doily, etc. Recycle where possible.


Layering of different kinds of paper is another possibility.
 The shape possibilities are endless, so here are just a few suggestions to help you decide:


Use a simple geometric shape, such as a rectangle, a square, an oval, etc. You can also round off or indent the corner edges for added flair.
Use a luggage label as the paper shape. Draw around it on your favorite paper and cut out the design.
Use a stencil, such as of an animal, a flower, a letter (your first initial maybe), a tree, a favorite object, etc.
 Cut out the label shape, taking care to keep its true form intact.
 Simply glue it in place where you want it. Allow to dry.
 Add your name, a message or simply "My Diary", as wished.


To prolong the label's life, consider covering with contact paper or sealing with a clear drying sealant such as Mod Podge.

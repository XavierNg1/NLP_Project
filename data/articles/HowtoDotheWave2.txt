 The wave is a classic hip hop dance move originated with B-Boys and break dancing. You don’t need to listen to early hip-hop to do the wave, but it doesn’t hurt. If you want to listen to the authentic stuff, put on Funk You Up by The Sequence.


You could also listen to contemporary rap or anything that has a groovy beat.
 Hold your arms out so you’re making a “T” shape with your body.Be sure that you stay loose while extending your arms. Dancing is all about staying loose.
 While in the “T” position, attempt to relax your shoulders. Don’t drop your arms, but try to rest the shoulder muscles. Your arms should be able to still hold with relaxed shoulders.
 Start with your right arm and flop it down so that your fingers point to the floor while your elbow points up. You could also begin by pointing your hand up and your elbow down.


Feel free to start with your left arm, if that feels more comfortable.
 Imagine the crest or trough of the wave must move through your arms.Move the wave through your shoulders. The key is for one shoulder to move up and have the other down. Then, as you move the wave you will switch shoulders.


The shoulder that was down will go up and the one up will move down., Once the wave passes through your shoulders, it must enter through your other arm. Once the shoulder is up, move the elbow down and move the wave into your hand. When the wave is in your hand, your hand is up while your elbow is down.
 Once you’ve sent the wave through one arm, it must return to the “T” shape. Only keep your arm in position until the wave comes back to this arm.
 Practice sending the wave to both sides and then reverse the process. You may need to practice a few times before you can send the wave through your arms and reverse.The key is to move with the music. The aforementioned song is slow enough that you can practice each piece of the wave.

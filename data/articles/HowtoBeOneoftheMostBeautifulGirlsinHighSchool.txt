 You are a beautiful person just by dint of being you. Your life is a precious miracle, your individuality is special. While fashion fads, preferences for certain body shapes or parts and styling requirements come and go, one thing never changes, and that is that you matter. You can always work on attitude and appearance but never forget that your very essence is something to always be proud of.


Realize that you deserve to have a healthy, happy and well educated life. You are also responsible for ensuring that this happens.;
, Confidence is a skill that can be learned and practiced. The more you put it into practice, the more it will become second nature. If you grow up in a gregarious society, such as the United States, it's an expectation, so you'll have plenty of role models to imitate.
 Smiling shows that you're happy and comfortable in your own skin. Smiles suggest that you're approachable, friendly and nice to talk to.
 Don't just give the impression of being nice, then fail to deliver. To be seen as beautiful, it's important to exude a beautiful attitude toward everyone. That means showing other people kindness, consideration, thoughtfulness and compassion. Each of these will add up to your beautiful aura.
 Make the most of your natural talents by working hard to hone them. Learn as many skills as you can so that you can be self-sufficient, capable and most importantly of all, competent. You owe it to yourself to be a fully-rounded person who can do things for herself.
 It's one of the first things people look at with respect to appearance.


Get a haircut that matches your face shape.
Aim to keep your hair as natural as possible. Don't spray a lot of hairspray, it damages hair and the stiffness it creates is uncomfortable for you and it looks fake.
Soften your hair if needed. There are plenty of treatments available to help you with this.
Try different hairstyles through the week. Switch it up to keep everyone wondering what's next.
Talk to your hairstylist first if you're planning on changing color or doing anything drastic.
 Wash it daily. If you have acne, consider using an acne treatment or see a dermatologist for advice.


Don't wear a lot of makeup. A little mascara or foundation and lip gloss is fine here and there, but it is best just to look more natural. Plus, makeup isn't the best for your face. If you do tend to wear a lot, make sure you wash it all off every night.
 If wished, add clear gloss or a pretty nail color.
 Bathe or shower daily, use deodorant or anti-perspirant and wash with soap. You can use body spray if wished but it's not necessary.


Change your sanitary ware frequently during your period––pads and tampons do not breathe well and are the principal sources of foul odors, not you. The more frequently they are changed, the better.
 Fashion is what you say it is, including following the fads of the day, if that's your thing. The most important element of style is that the clothes fit your body shape well, they're comfortable and you feel good in them

, Frequent movement is important to keep your amazing body healthy and in good shape. If you sit a lot during the day, be sure to take breaks and move around so that you stay flexible and well toned. Do a sport or physical activity regularly, to keep fit and strong.
 Avoid eating too much fast food. Learn to make salads, cook basic healthy food and make your own snacks. Eat small amounts and keep to regular mealtimes that fit into your schedule.
 This is important for your well-being, as you get to do something interesting, bond with like-minded people and have fun at the same time. There are many possibilities and, provided you have the time, you can do more than just one activity. Examples include sport, hobby clubs, dance, volunteering, caring for animals, modeling clubs, debating, athletics, drama, and so forth.

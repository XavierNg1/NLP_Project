 Concealer can really help if you have allergies that affect your eyes or nose. The color from the product can cover the redness, puffiness, or circles under your eyes.Make sure to choose a yellow or gold-based concealer around your nose. Around your eyes, try one that is two shades darker than your skin tone. If your entire face is red, try a green-based concealer.
Use a concealer brush to blend the produce into your skin or gently pat it smooth with your finger.
 Covering your face in foundation can help cover redness. You may want to try using a concealer first. Then, spread foundation on your face, paying particular attention to the spots that are red.If your nose is red, add some additional foundation around this area to help cover the redness.
 If your eyes and nose are red, try to detract from them by making your lip the focus of your face. Instead of putting a lot of eye makeup on, try lining your lips and then complete the look with a lipstick or lip gloss., When you have allergies, you will probably blow your nose or wipe it often. This can cause irritation, redness, and flaky skin. To help with this, cleanse your face and then exfoliate the affected area.Add additional moisturizer around your tender or cracked nose to help prevent flaking.
 Improper cleansing can irritate your face more than it may already be from the allergies. During allergy season, use gentle cleansers that are fragrance or perfume-free. Harsh cleansers could make your skin redder and aggravate allergy symptoms.Make sure to remove your makeup each night. Leaving on your makeup could make your allergy symptoms worse.

 Push both ends of the shoelaces through the eyelets closest to the toe of the sneaker. The shoelace should now form a bar across the bottom with the laces going inwards. Pull the ends of the laces up over the bar and then downward toward the toe.
 Insert it down through the second eyelet going up the shoe. The right lace should now be crossing the tongue of the shoe with left lace emerging from between the bar and the cross-lace. Pull the crossed lace to the left (away from the shoe) to get it out of the way.









It's usually easiest to do this with the shoes off and the sneaker facing you. Whether you go by your right or the shoe’s right doesn’t matter. Just stay consistent and the end result will be the same.
 Insert it downward through the second eyelet up on that side, just as you did on the other side. You should now have a bar and two cross-laces in your lacing. Pull the newly-crossed lace to the right (away from the shoe) to get it out of the way.
 Start by crossing the lace on the right-hand side over to the left side and downward through the eyelet, making sure that the other lace now emerges from between two crossings. Pull the newly-crossed lace to the left to get it out of the way, then cross the left lace over to the right side. Repeat until the shoe is completely laced.









Lacing the shoes this way ensures that cross-laces going in one direction always dominate the cross-laces going in the other. When the time comes to lace your other shoe, be sure to reverse the process so that your laces mirror each other.

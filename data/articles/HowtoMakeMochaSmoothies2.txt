 Peel 2 small bananas or 1 large banana. Use a knife to cut the bananas into small slices. Lay the banana slices on a baking sheet or large plate and put the slices in the freezer. Let the bananas chill until they're completely frozen.Try to freeze the bananas the night before you want to make the smoothies. Or quickly chill them for a few hours before you need them.
 Measure out and place the smoothie ingredients into the blender. Pour the milk in first, followed by the powders and then the yogurt. This will help your blender combine the smoothies easily. For two mocha protein smoothies, you'll need:8 to 12 ounces (226 to 340 g) of plain or vanilla Greek yogurt
2 teaspoons of espresso powder, ground coffee, or instant coffee
2 teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa powder
2/3 to 1 cup (160 to 240 ml) of milk
2 scoops of protein powder

, Put the lid on the blender and blitz the smoothies until the ingredients are combined. Remove the lid and pour the smoothies into two large glasses. Serve the smoothies immediately before they begin to separate.If you want thicker smoothies, consider adding a few handfuls of ice before blending them.

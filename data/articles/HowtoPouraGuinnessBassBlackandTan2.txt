 A transparent pint glass ideal, but a clear beer flute works, too. Anything you can see through that's big enough, really.
 Pour until it's roughly 2/3 full with a thick head. When the head settles, it'll be close to 1/2 full.
 Pour the Guinness over the center of the upside-down spoon to dispense the flow. Pour slowly but confidently -- it needs to be a constant flow or else it'll end up flowing along the bottle or can and not over the spoon.
 Top off with a bit more Guinness if need be. Enjoy!

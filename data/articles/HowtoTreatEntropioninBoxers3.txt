 The only way to treat entropion is surgery to repair the lid abnormality. You will have to work with your vet to figure out when the best time is for your Boxer to have the surgery. There may also be other conditions and considerations that need to be taken into account before your Boxer can have surgery., In preparation for the surgery, your Boxer will be under general anesthesia for this surgery.During the surgery, your Boxer's eyeball will first be covered in order to prevent damage during the procedure. The vet surgeon will then cut an elliptical shaped piece of tissue from under the eyelid margin and sutures it together with the upper lid.


This will pull the eyelid margin and last area back into the place they belong., After your Boxer goes through the surgery, the eye sutures will need to be protected from irritation, scratching, or anything else your Boxer may do to them. Because of this, your vet will likely give your Boxer a cone to wear until the sutures heal.


In some cases, antibiotics drops and ointment may also be used to help protect and heal any eye damage.Your vet will also likely tell you to not bath your Boxer until the sutures come out.
 Once your Boxer's entropion has been treated with surgery, he will need some follow up visits with the vet to take care of his eye or eyes. Your Boxer will likely be on antibiotics to help prevent any infections from occurring in his eye as he heals from the surgery.


You may also need refills for any eye drops or ointments prescribed at the time of surgery to continue healing your Boxer's eye and eyelids.

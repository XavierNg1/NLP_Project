At the start of the fourth growing season, the hedges can be shaped with greater detail. Purchase a pair of stakes that are equal to the height which you want your hedges to be.
Push the stakes into the ground on either side of the length of the hedge. Tie a piece of light-colored string to each stake, aligning it at the desired height of the hedge.



With this piece of equipment, carefully trim the top of the hedge down to the height of the string. Use care to ensure that the top of the hedge is level at all locations.



Repeat the process above which describes how to trim the hedges along their length. Instead of placing the stakes in the ground on the either side of the length of the hedge, however, insert them into the ground on either side of the width of the plants.
Tie a string around both stakes, making sure that it is even with the top of the hedge.
Use an electric trimmer to remove any growth that falls outside either of the staked markers.

 While it is better to hang skirts and dresses, even if you don't have the proper skirt hangers, you can still fold them, especially if you're looking to travel (see the method on travel folding).









Fold the hem to waistband or collar, depending on whether you're folding a skirt or dress.
 The hem or collar should be inside the folded garment. You will want your folded item to be in a rectangular shape.
 You'll be folding down, in a horizontal manner. You should end up with a square of folded fabric.

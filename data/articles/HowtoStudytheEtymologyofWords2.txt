 Now that you know what to look for, start studying the etymology of those words that make you wonder: “where did this come from?” It’s an entertaining way to get to know the historical meaning behind the things you say, and you’ll often be surprised about where they come from.


It’s also edifying to look up those words that seem so normal that you’ve taken their origins for granted. For instance, if you study the etymology of a familiar word like “nostril,” you’ll find that it comes from Old English “nosu” (nose) and “pyrel” or “thrill” (hole). It’s literally a “nose hole.” You’ll also note that “pyrel” and “thrill” once sounded alike in English, which shows how far the language has developed phonically. That also means that the word “nostril” is surprisingly related to the word “thrilling.”

, If what you find when you look into the etymology of a particular word does not make obvious sense today, do some research to figure out why its original meaning is what it is.


For instance, you may wonder where a word like “disaster” came from. When you look it up, you’ll find that its Greek roots are the negative prefix “dis” and “astron” (star). So, it’s earliest meaning was something like “bad star.” This might be surprising until you consider Greek astrology and their strong belief that celestial bodies exerted control over our lives on Earth., Now that you know the origin of a particular word, you can use it to identify words with similar histories and therefore with related sounds and meanings.


In the case of etymology, there are not a lot of related words, but you can see that “etymological,” “etymologically,” and “etymologist” are all closely related forms. In the case of a word like “autopsy” with the Greek root “autos” (meaning, “self”), there’ll be a whole host of related words, from “autonomy” (self-governing) to “automobile” (self-moving) to “automatic” (self-acting).

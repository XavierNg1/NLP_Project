 It can be microwave or stovetop, so long as you have enough of it. Four cups of popped popcorn is only about two tablespoons of unpopped popcorn, though, so keep that in mind if you're measuring it yourself.;
, Scoop it into a small, microwave-safe bowl and cover it loosely with plastic wrap. Microwave this on high for 30 seconds (or until the butter is sufficiently melted). Using oven mitts, remove the bowl from the microwave. Carefully remove the plastic wrap and drizzle the butter over the popcorn.
 Then gently toss the popcorn to spread the butter around, making sure to get the popcorn on the very bottom. If you don't think you have enough butter, you can always melt some more.
 You can continue tossing the popcorn it to mix it in, or you can just let the cheese melt on top of it. Add some salt if you like and you're done!

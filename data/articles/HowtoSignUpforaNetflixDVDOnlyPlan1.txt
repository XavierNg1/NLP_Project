, The next page will show a list of three different DVD plans. Starting with the cheapest on the left to the most expensive on the far right. The differences between the accounts is the number of discs able to be checked out. This ranges from 1–3 discs at a time. The second difference is choosing if you would like Blu-ray versions of the different movies or series. The more discs you rent, the more it will cost. Also, selecting the Blu-ray account types will increase the price as well.


There should be two different options listed under each of the three options at the top of the page. Click either the light-blue Blu-ray button to continue or the darker-blue DVD button.
Price differences range from US$7.99 to $19.99.

 Your profile will appear., It’s at the top right corner of the screen., It’s under the “My Account” heading.,, Once you make your choice, Snaps and Stories will save to this location whenever you tap Save.

Memories: When you save a snap, it will be saved to your Snapchat account (online) but not to your device. This is great if you don’t have a lot of space on your phone. You’ll only be able to view these Memories in the Snapchat app.
Memories & Camera Roll: The snap will save to your device and your Snapchat account.
Camera Roll Only: This skips the Memories feature entirely and just downloads the Snap to your phone.

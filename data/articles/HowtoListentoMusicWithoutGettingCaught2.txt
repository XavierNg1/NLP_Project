 Keep the volume on your computer, CD player, record player, radio, or other speakers low. If you can’t get away with playing music out loud, put headphones in.
 Choose times of day when your parents or other people in the house are gone or sound asleep.
 Choose the basement, attic, or other room of your house that’s far away from other people and well-insulated.
 Stuff a towel under the crack of your door and layer with extra blankets or pillows to help keep sound from escaping, and even cover the whole door with a blanket if you can. Lay down some thick rugs on the floor if you’re concerned about being heard from below., Start the music playing in your room, then go into other rooms of the house where you don’t want to be heard to see if you can hear the music, and adjust the volume accordingly. If you’ve blocked your door for soundproofing, have someone else in the house who you don’t mind knowing about your music do the test for you.
 If you’re listening to CDs, records, or an MP3 player, hide them well when you’re done. Consider streaming music online through services like Spotify, Pandora, or YouTube if you’re not supposed to own a certain kind of music and if you want to leave less of a trace.


Go to “History” in the browser you use to clear any music sites you’ve visited, and go into your browser settings to find and empty your cache file. Or you can listen to music sites without them showing up in your history at all by opening up a “private” or “incognito” window.

 Remove a large enough strip of paper towel to wrap around your celery stalks. Run the paper towel under the faucet. Get the towel damp, but not soaking wet.You can also use filtered water to wet the paper towel, if you prefer.
 Fold the paper towel in half. Then, wrap the towel tightly and make sure to cover the full stalk. When the towel is fully wrapped, take a rubber band. Use this to secure the paper towel to the celery stalk., You can now place the celery back in the plastic bag it came in. However, you do not want ethylene to get trapped in the bag. Ethylene is a ripening hormone that can cause celery to go bad faster. Wrap the bag around the celery tightly, as this will allow the ethylene to be released. Then, use rubber bands to secure the bag in place., Watch for signs the celery has gone bad. You may notice the stalks bending away from the stem, the celery turning white, and the middle becoming hollow. Celery generally lasts anywhere from three to four weeks in the fridge.

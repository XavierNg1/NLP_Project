 Chill the water before you prepare the pomegranate so you can soak it immediately. The colder the temperature, the looser the arils will be.








If you chill the water with ice, remove any ice cubes before you soak the pomegranate.
 Cut off the pomegranate's top. Then, cut it into quarters. Make each quarter even so they soak for the same amount of time.









Sharpen your knife before you score the pomegranate. Dull knives are both more time-consuming and dangerous. You'll get a cleaner, more accurate cut with a sharp knife.
 For best results, keep the pomegranate fully submerged. Your pomegranate will be easier to seed as it gets colder.
 Expose the arils and the pomegranate skin, and remove the outer skin from the bowl.









Keep a trash can nearby to discard the skin quickly.
 Keep the quarters submerged underwater as you do so for easier seeding. Nudge the seeds out of the skin to avoid them bursting open.









After you have separated all the seeds from the skin, discard the pomegranate skin. The skin should float to the top for easy removal., Let the seeds dry for five minutes before you eat them.

 Typically courts are willing to reduce your sentence in cases of extraordinary circumstances such as terminal illness.Federal law allows a sentence reduction or modification upon motion filed by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons., Federal law requires the Director must file a motion on your behalf seeking a reduction in your sentence.


The Director may file a motion for the reduction of your sentence if you are 70 or older, have served at least 30 years on a life sentence, and the Director believes you are no longer a danger to the public.Individual states may have their own laws allowing for the reduction of a sentence under similar circumstances.
 Sentence reductions sometimes are available if you were sentenced according to specific guidelines, and those guidelines were later lowered.


Some states have reduced or eliminated mandatory minimums, so if you were sentenced under a mandatory minimum law that has since been abolished, you might be able to file a motion and have your sentence reduced accordingly.

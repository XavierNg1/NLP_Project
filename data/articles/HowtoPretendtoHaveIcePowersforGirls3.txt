 Engage in winter sports to become really in touch with ice and snow. You could try ice-skating or skiing, or if you’re less athletic go sledding.If people comment on how often you do winter activities, you could say, “I only feel comfortable around the snow….”

, Use your free time to play in the snow on snowy days. Make a snow angel, start a snowball fight or build a snowman with a friend.


If someone comments on your snowman, you could say, “You should have seen him before I turned him into snow!”

, Watching movies where people have ice powers will give you ideas about how people with real ice powers act. Make a list of things they do to illustrate their powers so you can copy them.Frozen, Jack Frost, Batman, and Adventure Time are all good movies to seek out featuring characters with ice powers.
 Reading wintery books will keep you in an icy mindset. They often have characters with ice powers you can draw inspiration from. Good choices to seek out are The Snow Queen, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Frosty the Snowman.

 Keep in mind that the online version puts some restrictions on output size and resolution.;
,, The Rasterbated image will be automatically split onto several pages, so you need specify the format of each unit paper (e.g. A4, A3, etc.) and its alignment, whether horizontal or vertical. If you plan to print poster yourself then make sure to select paper format supported by your printer(e.g. A4)

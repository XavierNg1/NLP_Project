 If your child displays symptoms like swelling of the mouth, tongue, or throat, trouble breathing, or symptoms involving two different parts of the body (like hives and diarrhea), they may be having a serious allergic reaction to milk. Inject them with an epinephrine auto-injector as soon as possible. An epinephrine auto-injector contains prescription medication in a container about the size of a pen. Ask your doctor to show you how to use it correctly.

Keep in mind that a severe reaction usually happens immediately after ingesting milk, but it can happen hours later.
Keep two epinephrine pens on hand in case of an emergency., Even if you have injected your baby with the epinephrine pen, you should take them to the emergency room after a severe allergic reaction. It is important that your infant is under medical supervision, even if it seems like the worst has already passed. It is possible to have a second wave of severe reactions hours after the initial reaction.Be prepared to discuss your childâ€™s allergies with the emergency room doctor so they can administer care without causing further complications.
 If you are unsure what to do when your child has a severe allergic reaction or are unable to get them to the hospital immediately, call 911 to help. The operator can walk you through the steps you need to take to help your child and send an ambulance to take them to the emergency room.

Every second counts in an allergic reaction so it is best not to risk that your child can wait to see a doctor or be treated.

 You can use printer paper or a piece of 8 1/2" by 11" looseleaf paper. Any other piece of rectangular paper should also work.






;
, Use your finger to make a good crease down the middle of the paper.
 Use a scissors to cut the paper in half. If you don't have a scissors handy, fold the paper back and forth along the crease until it's easy enough to tear in half.
 You should now have two pieces of long, skinny folded paper.
 First fold the bottom corner of one of the rectangles up to create a triangle shape. Fold the other corner down to create a second triangle shape.
,, The centers of the pieces of paper should cross over each other.
 Looking at the shape you've made with the two pieces of paper, you should have a cross with a triangle at every point. Now fold the bottom triangle to the center of the cross. Next fold the left triangle to the center, overlapping the one you just folded. Fold the top triangle to the center, too.
 Fold the last triangle so it overlaps the top triangle and tucks under the bottom triangle.
 You can color each triangle a different color or create a pattern. If you're using the spinner for a game, you can draw an arrow in one corner so that it will land on someone when it's spun.
 Use your hands to set the spinner in motion on a flat, smooth surface, like the table or floor. To help it spin even faster, you can fold it along the triangle lines to create a slight point on the bottom.

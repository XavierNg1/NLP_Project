 Your cashews or macadamia nuts will act as the binder or flour replacement for your truffles. Grind them into a fine powder in a food processor before transferring them to a large mixing bowl. Make sure to remove lumps or large pieces because they can ruin the texture of your truffles., Add your dried coconut, coconut nectar, and coconut oil to the mixture. Mix it with the nuts until everything becomes well incorporated. At this point, your batter should start to thicken., Peel your lemon and squeeze out the juice. Use the peel to scrape off lemon zest. Add the 1 tsp (4.9 mL) ground vanilla beans and pinch of salt and continue to mix everything together. Whisk your bowl until the ingredients are all incorporated.
 Set aside some ground nuts or extra dried coconut and use that as a sweet coating over your truffles. When grinding nuts for the coating, do not grind them as much as you would to form the nut flour. Leaving larger pieces intact will add to the texture of your truffles.If you want saltier truffles, try adding a pistachio nut coating over them.
 Allow your vegan truffles to set in your refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before eating them. Once they have hardened, you can take them out and serve them.

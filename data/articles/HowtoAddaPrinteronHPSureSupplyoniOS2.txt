 Locate the app on your device and tap on it. The app icon has the HP logo on it with a colorful border.
 Tap the printer icon from the bottom menu bar, and you will be brought to the “Add a Printer” screen. The options for adding a printer will be shown. The second one is “Catalog”; tap on it.
 A text field will be presented to you. Enter the model of the printer you’d like to add, and the app will search its database or catalog for all the compatible HP printers matching your search. A list of matches will be displayed as you type.
 Tap from the list of printers the one you’d like to add. A couple of buttons will appear to the right. Tap the “Add Printer” button, and the printer will be added to SureSupply.


If the printer is turned on and is on the same Wi-Fi network as your iPad or iPhone, the app will immediately find it. The newly added printer will then be displayed on the screen, with all its ink levels properly stacked by color. You can immediately see which inks are running low.

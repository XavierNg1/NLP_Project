 Coffee and tea are known to stain your teeth and it can be difficult to properly remove coffee or tea from your teeth when you have braces. As well, sodas and other sugary drinks like sports drinks usually contain phosphoric acid, which can erode the enamel on your teeth and lead to a buildup of plaque, causing cavities and tooth sensitivity., Though it may be tempting to maintain a diet of soft treats, like ice cream, pudding, jello, and hot chocolate, avoid overindulging on sweets. Too much sugar can lead to the development of dental issues like plaque-building cavities, which can lead to white spots when your braces come off.Cut down on known cavity causers in your diet and try to only eat treats or sweets occasionally. Always brush your teeth well after eating foods high in sugar and artificial flavors or colors so these products do not remain on your teeth for a long period of time.

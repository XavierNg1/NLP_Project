 Blood donors should overall be healthy and feeling well. This means that you are not sick, running a fever, have an infection, or other illness. You should be able to perform normal activities.You may be eligible to give blood if you have certain chronic conditions, like diabetes, if you are treating it and it is manageable. If you are unsure about your condition, contact the Red Cross or your doctor.
 You can give blood multiple times a year. However, each donor must wait 56 days between each blood donation., To make sure you have enough iron in your body, eat foods that contain a lot of iron before and after you give blood. These foods include red meat, fish, poultry, spinach, cereals fortified with iron, and beans.Donâ€™t eat fatty foods before you donate blood. This includes hamburgers, fried foods, French fries, or ice cream. These foods can negatively affect your blood and cause you to not be able to donate.
 Before you donate blood, make sure to hydrate yourself. Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water or other non-alcoholic fluids the days leading up to your donation. On the day you give blood, make sure to drink an additional 16 ounces of water or fluids., Sometimes, potential blood donors are declined. Many factors may influence this. If you are declined for a reason that is not related to an unchanging lifestyle or medical situation, then go back to try to give blood again. Many people are turned away up to three times before they can give blood.

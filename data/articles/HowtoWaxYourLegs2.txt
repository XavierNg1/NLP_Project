 Use the wooden stick that comes inside your waxing kit to apply the wax. You also should read the specific directions that your waxing kit offers. Apply enough wax to cover your hair but not too much. 







, Make sure you press down firmly. You should put the strip on in the direction of your hair growth. Leave a leftover bit of strip hanging off at the end not touching any of your hair. This will serve as your handle and make it much easier to pull off. 







, Do this fast and use your leftover piece as a grip. Make sure you are holding the skin taut with your other hand while you pull the strip off. Try to relax, the more you tense up the more painful it’s going to be. If it hurts after you pull off the strip push your palm down on your leg and apply some pressure. This will quickly relieve the pain.
 You’ll have to do this anywhere you want waxed. Once you get the hang of it the whole process should become faster and easier.
 If you’re in pain Aloe Vera is probably your best choice, if not you can just stick to moisturizer. This will help to soothe your legs in the immediate aftermath of the waxing and make your legs feel smoother the next day. Apply everywhere you waxed.

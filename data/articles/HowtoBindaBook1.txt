 To create your own book, you can choose to use any paper you would like. Regular 8Â½ x 11 printer paper can be used, as can any variety of handmade papers or cardstock. Make sure that you have enough pages prepared to fill your whole book, around 50-100 sheets. You will be folding each sheet in half, so your total number of pages will be double the number of sheets you use.;
, A signature is a grouping of pages that are folded together. Each signature should consist of 4 sheets of paper folded directly down the center together. Use a bone folder for the cleanest crease and a ruler to make sure you have the fold centered down the direct middle of the signature. Your book will contain several signatures, so make as many as are necessary to use all your paper.
 Pick up all your signatures together, and tap them into place against a hard, smooth surface so that they are level. Make sure that all the pages are lined up and even along the spine; your signatures should all be facing the same direction.

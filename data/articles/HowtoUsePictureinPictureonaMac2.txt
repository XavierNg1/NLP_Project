PiP is also usable in iTunes.
 YouTube and Vimeo are both popular video streaming sites.


Some video streaming sites may not support Picture-in-Picture.
 This will reveal a drop-down menu.
 Clicking on this icon will enable Picture-in-Picture, causing the video you're watching to open in a new, smaller window.


Some video players such as Vimeo will have a Picture-in-Picture icon built into the window. This is an icon at the bottom-right corner of the video window that displays as a white rectangle "popping out" of another rectangular frame. Clicking on this icon will enable Picture-in-Picture.
 Click on an application in your dock or double-click on an application in your finder to open a new application. The video window will remain in the front of the screen.
 Swipe three fingers to the left or right on your trackpad to navigate to a different desktop view. You will notice that the video still remains at the front of your screen.
, By clicking on the video's pop-out window, you'll see three new options:


A close window button in the upper-left corner.
A pause/play button at the bottom of the window.
An Exit PiP button next to the pause/play button, which will send the video back to your web browser to continue being played.

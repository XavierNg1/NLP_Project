 Before trying to clean the spot, you need to blot up as much grease as you possibly can. Without removing extra grease, your effort to clean up the spill won’t go so well. Make sure to:


Blot a balled-up paper towel on the grease spill.
If you’re cleaning a spill on a fabric or wood, make sure to blot very gently. The goal is to remove as much grease as possible without making the grease penetrate the material.
If you’re cleaning fabric or a carpet, you may consider getting a spoon, a coated piece of cardboard, or something similar and using it to collect as much grease as you can.;
, Warm water and white vinegar together will cut through grease and help clean the surface of cabinets, countertops, and similar surfaces. To create the mixture:









Pour 5 cups of warm water in a bucket.
Add 5 cups of white vinegar.
Mix them together., Take a kitchen sponge or a spare rag and soak it in your mixture. Use the sponge or rag to wipe down the surface.









Dunk the sponge or rag after it has accumulated grease.
Change out your water (and create a new solution) if it gets too greasy or dirty.
If the oil stain isn't coming out, try using 100% white vinegar instead of the water and vinegar mixture.
Avoid using vinegar on granite.

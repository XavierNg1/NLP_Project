 Look for the game app on your device. It has an app icon with a cow on it. Tap on it. On the welcome screen, tap the “Play!” button, and the game will start.;
, The game always starts with a handful of basic cows. They’re all plain white-and-brown and white-and-black cows. Each basic cow you get to the barn earns you 1 milk point.
 Every now and then, a golden cow will mix with the cows. When you see it, get it to the barn quickly to earn some bonus milk points. A Golden Calf earns you 10 milk points.
 You may also see a blue cow with a big star on it. This is the Magic Cow. When you get it to the barn, it pulls all the cows on the field to the barn. Maximize the opportunity by waiting for more cows to come into the field so you can pull more of them in.


Aliens will be left on the field.
 You may also see a brown cow. Do not confuse this as a plain cow. The brown cow is the Dynamite Bull. Get it to the barn and all the aliens on your screen will explode.
 There may be times when you see an extra-large cow on the field. When you get this to the barn, it won’t go in right away. It will block the entrance, preventing other cows and aliens from entering it. Double-tap on the bloated cow to push it into the barn.
 All the aliens come in its own spaceship. They come in different colors, but all act the same. When you see an alien on the field, push them off the cliff right away. Never let them near or inside the barn. When one does, the game is over.

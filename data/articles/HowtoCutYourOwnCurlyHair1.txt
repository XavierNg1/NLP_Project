 Before you begin trimming your curls, start with dry hair that is styled how you normally wear it. Make sure that your curls are laid out the way that you like them to be.;
, Secure the towel with a strong hair clip or safety pin.The towel will help prevent hair from getting on your neck and clothing. You may also want to put some newspaper on the floor to catch the hair that you trim off.
 Before you begin, make sure that you will be able to see the front and back of your hair by placing one mirror in front of you and another behind you. The mirrors should be facing each other. Adjust the mirrors until you can see the front and the back of your head in the mirror in front of you. If you have long hair, this step is optional since you should be able to bring each strand forward as you trim your curls., Using a pair of sharp haircutting scissors, trim the ends of each of your curls. Make sure the scissors you use are meant for cutting hair and that they are very sharp.Cut the hair near the ends or in the curve of the curl. Begin by trimming the topmost layers and work your way down through your curls, layer by layer.
 After you finish trimming the ends of one layer, use a hair clip to separate the trimmed hair from the hair that you have not yet cut. Keeping the trimmed hair separate will help prevent you from cutting the same curls twice. Continue trimming the ends of your curls until you have trimmed them all. This may take a while, especially if you have thick hair. Just be patient and don’t rush!, When you are finished, run your fingers through your curls and shake them out.
 Inspect your hair from all angles and make sure it looks how you want it to look. Use the scissors to touch up any spots that don’t look right. Look for any strands that are drastically longer than others or that are angled differently and trim as needed.

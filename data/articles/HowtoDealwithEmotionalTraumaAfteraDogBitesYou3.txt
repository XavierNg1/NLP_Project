 Start small and face your fears gradually. Look online for images and videos of people and dogs playing. Look for cute pictures of puppies, people cuddling with their dogs, and other positive imagery.Try looking for books at your local library. For example, the American Kennel Club’s The Complete Dog Book is a good start.Say to yourself, “I had one negative experience, but I can have positive experiences with dogs in the future. It is possible and probable that I will interact with dogs free of fear and worry.”

, Think of a trusted friend or family member who owns a dog. Try to find someone who owns a smaller, less intimidating breed (unless you find smaller dogs provoke more anxiety). Have them keep their dog leashed in the same room as you.When overcoming a fear or phobia, it’s important that you retain a sense of control. Do the exercise wherever you feel most comfortable, whether it’s at your loved one’s home, your home, or a neutral location.
Keep the interaction to a minimum at first. Just spend a half hour or so in the same room as a dog once a week.
 Over time, decrease the distance you keep between you and your loved one’s dog. Try to move a few feet closer each time you meet them.Eventually, try to get to the point where you can hold your hand close to the dog and allow it to sniff you. Let it smell your hand and get to know you, then gently pet the dog. If your friend has a treat handy, try offering it a treat or giving it a command, like “Sit.”

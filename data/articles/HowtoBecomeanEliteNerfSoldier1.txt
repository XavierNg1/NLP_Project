 The Strongarm is an updated Maverick and shoots farther. The Recon CS-6/Retaliator works well in intimidation, and is easy to load and shoot. Or,the Alpha trooper, or Rampage works well. The Stryfe is a particularly well-rounded blaster (especially when modded) because of semi-auto firing and can be used as a primary or a sidearm. If you want full-auto firing, Look at the Rapidstrike or the Hyper-fire.
 It is important to be able to work the gun, as well as the ability to use it properly, and to your advantage! You can use just about anything as a target, such as chalk on fence, or using old archery or rifle targets!

, You will at least need a pistol (a Strongarm, Fire Strike, or Retaliator CS-12 with detached front barrel and stock, etc.), a rifle or two (Slingfire with a 25 round drum magazine or Retaliator CS-12,etc.), and a machine gun (Rampage Rapid Fire CS-25 or a Havok Fire EBF-25 etc.).

 In Chicago, you also use the title first on a reference page citation. Next, add a period, followed by the journal title in italics:


‘Grapes for Wine.’ Wine for Life

Note that you do not use a period after the journal title.
 Follow that with the volume number, a comma, the abbreviation “no.,” and the issue number. Place the date of publication in parenthesis next:


‘Grapes for Wine.’ Wine for Life 20, no. 2 (1987):
Note that you use a colon after the date.
 Also include the date you accessed it, if it’s an online article, followed by a period and the doi (digital object identifier) number or the url:


‘Grapes for Wine.’ Wine for Life 20, no. 2 (1987): 22-44. Accessed Jan 20, 2002. doi:234324343.
 For a newspaper or magazine article, use a similar format:


‘Trees in Deserts.’ All You Need to Know about Trees March 25, 2005: 22-23.”

, For the in-text citations, you insert a footnote by clicking at the end of the sentence you want to cite, then using your word-processing software to insert it. It will create a small number at the end of the sentence that corresponds with one at the end of the page. In the citation, you will replace many of the periods with commas, like this:


‘Grapes for Wine,’ Wine for Life 20, no. 2 (1987): 23, accessed Jan 20, 2002, doi:234324343.
Also, note that you only use the page number with the in-text citation.

 This unconventional trick can work surprisingly well, making it a favorite of many amateur cleaners on the internet.To start, find an old rag and dampen it with hydrogen peroxide. Lay your scorched item flat on your work surface and cover the scorch with the damp rag.


Hydrogen peroxide, a cleaning solution with mild bleaching properties, is usually available at grocery stores and pharmacies for quite cheap.
If you have ammonia handy, you may also want to splash a few drops directly onto the scorch mark itself. Though ammonia and hydrogen peroxide are safe to use with each other (unlike ammonia and bleach), this isn't a mixture you'll want to ingest or rub into your face, so be sure to wash your hands when you're done.
 Next, put a clean, dry rag on top of the hydrogen peroxide-soaked rag. To be perfectly clear, you want to have three things stacked on your work surface: on the bottom, your scorched item, in the middle, your peroxide rag, and on top, your dry rag.
 Let your iron heat up to a fairly hot (but not extremely high) temperature. Start gently rubbing the top cloth. The heat will gradually permeate through the layers and into your scorched item, where it will help the hydrogen peroxide work into the scorch mark and start to remove it. Be patient â€” this process can take some time.
 Check on your scorch mark frequently as you iron the top cloth. For mild to moderate scorch marks, you should notice steady, gradual improvement. If, at any point, you notice that the middle cloth is starting to dry out, remove it and give it another application of hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, if you initially sprinkled your scorched item with ammonia and you notice that it has dried out, give it a few more drops. Doing this keeps the cleaning process as quick and effective as possible.


You'll also want to remove the top cloth and replace it with another if it ever becomes soaked with hydrogen peroxide from the middle cloth. This prevents rust stains on the iron.

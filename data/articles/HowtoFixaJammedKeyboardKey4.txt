 Use a screwdriver or other flat instrument to get under the key, and pull up slightly on one of the edges. You can also use your nail.


If you are working on a laptop (whether PC or Mac), the key is held in place by a flimsy plastic clip, which also serves as the spring. The keys are attached in slightly different ways on each type of keyboard, so removing them will be different on each type.If you're unsure if or how your laptop keys come off, consult your manual.Das keyboards (called by their company the best mechanical keyboards on the market) should not be fixed by prying at the keys. They provide a special clip that will pop individual keys off of the keyboard.
Don't remove all the keys at once, as you may have trouble remembering where they all go. Don't do more than a couple at one time.
 Clear out any obstructions or crumbs that are jamming the key or the hinges underneath. You can use tweezers or toothpicks to help., Be sure not to have so much alcohol on the swab that it drips., You don't want to leave any liquid underneath the keys, even rubbing alcohol.
 Gently press the key down. It should snap back into place.If using a laptop, insert the clip into the position it originally held before you place the key back into its spot.
 They should be unstuck now. If not, you may need to take it into someone who repairs computers.

 Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are very large and can reach up to 140 pounds.Bathing them in a bathtub can be a challenge because they take up a lot of space. Weather permitting, you can bathe your Swissy outside with a hose, as long as the hose is hot water equipped.


You can also take them to a pet store that offers grooming. These stores may have bathing stations that you can pay to use. This way, you won't have to worry about making a mess inside your bathroom at home.
Be prepared for your dog to shed a fair amount of hair during a bath. This may clog a drain in a bathtub, so place a wire trap over the drain.
 Purchase a mild dog shampoo that is pH-balanced to use on their coat. After you wet their entire coat with warm water, work the shampoo into their fur. Massage the shampoo into their coats, but be extra gentle around their faces and ears. Rinse all of the shampoo out of their coat whenever you are finished.


Try not to get any water into their ears. Trapped water in the ear is a breeding ground for bacteria can lead to an ear infection.
 After you’ve finished their bath, you’ll need to dry them off. Use a towel to dry their entire coat. You can use a blow dryer on a low setting, to dry them off if you’d like. Drying their coat with a blow dryer will take more time than a towel will, but it can add shine to their coat. Make sure the blow dryer is on the low or no heat setting. Use a soft cloth to dry their ears and their face.
 Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are naturally clean and only need to be bathed every month or so, unless they have rolled in mud or something smelly. Baths can also help to keep their shedding more manageable.

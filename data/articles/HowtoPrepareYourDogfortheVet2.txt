 Most veterinary clinics weigh their patients as this helps monitor the pet's health and provide an accurate weight for drug dosages. But, the scales will tip slightly under your dogâ€™s paws and could freak him out enough that he will refuse to go back onto the scale.


If your dog is small enough, get him used to the tipping sensation by putting him on a bathroom scale.
If he is a larger dog, make an impromptu wobble board, perhaps using a coffee table with one leg resting on a slim book. Once he is on the board, give him lots of praise or a treat to reward his bravery.
Do not force your dog to stay on if he is panicking. A few seconds is fine for the first attempt. On the next try, get him to stand on the scale or board a little longer for the promise of a treat.
 If you have a large dog, your vet will likely examine him on the floor, so you do not need to worry about this step. But medium sized dogs will be picked up by your vet and placed on an examination table and this may unsettle him.


Once he is on the table give him lots of praise or a treat. Your aim is to get him to associate the table with positive things. Initially, put him on the table and then lift him down after a few seconds so that he doesn't have time to develop negative associations.
With each repeated trip up onto the table he will increasing associate it with pleasant things (a treat or petting and attention) and come to look forward to it.
Once he gets used to the table at home, it will be less alarming at his vet appointment.
 Dogs are creatures of habit and cancelling a walk will alert him that something is up.
 Burning off excess physical energy will likely tire out your dog and make him less likely to have any spare energy for nervous anxiety at the vet.

 In order to burn a dual-layer project, you must be using a dual-layer DVD, and your drive must support burning dual-layers. If you try to burn a dual-layer project to a single-layer disc, you will encounter errors.;
, This program will come installed with certain DVD burners, or can be purchased directly from Nero. Start a New Project and then select Data. In the Data submenu, select Data DVD.
 By default, your project will be a standard single-layer DVD, even if you have a dual-layer DVD inserted. Click the dropdown menu next to the capacity meter. Select DVD9 to switch it to dual-layer. Click the Add button to add the files that you want to burn from your computer, or drag and drop them into the window.
 As you add files, the meter on the bottom will fill up. Dual-layer DVDs can hold up to 8.5 GB of data. If you have less than 4.7 GB of data, it might be cheaper to burn it to a standard DVD. Press Next when you are finished adding files.
 In the next screen, give your disc a name so that you’ll recognize it when it's inserted. Make sure that you have the correct DVD burner selected in the “Current recorder” section.
 Nero will show you the status to let you know when the process has completed successfully.

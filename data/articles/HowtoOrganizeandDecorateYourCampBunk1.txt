 A good idea is to get some collapsible storage bins that you can store things like shoes and folded clothes in, then slide them under your bunk and out of the way. If you prepare storage properly, it's much easier to keep your things tidy whilst you're at camp.;
, These can attach to your bunk and are useful for hanging things like hats, jackets, lanyards and other things that are easily lost. (If you buy adhesive hooks, make sure you can remove them when it is time to come home!)

, Keep all your shoes together and not strewn across the floor by getting yourself a shoe organiser.
 This will be essential for your time at camp to keep your dirty laundry separate from your clean clothes! You could even get two and use one to store extra pillows and bed sheets. Pop-up hampers are best as when they are not being used, they can be folded and put away.
 This will stop things from getting lost and can also end up being a nice collection of memories from camp.

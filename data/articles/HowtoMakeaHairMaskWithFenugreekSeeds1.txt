 For the mask, you need fenugreek seed powder. Place 2 tablespoons (22 g) of the seeds in a spice or coffee grinder, and grind them until they are a fine powder.You can find fenugreek seeds at many grocery stores, but if your local store doesn’t carry them, visit an Indian grocery, organic grocery store, or a health food store. You can also order the seeds from online spice retailers.
If you don’t have a spice, nut, or coffee grinder, you can use a blender or food processor to grind the seeds.
You can also find fenugreek seed powder at the grocery store. However, you’ll get better results if you grind the seeds fresh for your mask.;
, Add the ground fenugreek seeds and 1 tablespoon (13 g) of coconut oil to a small bowl. Stir the ingredients well with a spoon so they’re fully blended.You can substitute olive or argan oil for the coconut if you prefer.
 Once the mask is mixed, use your hands to carefully apply it through your hair. Pay special attention to areas where you’re experienced thinning hair or hair loss. Allow the mask to dry for approximately 10 minutes.You can warm the mask before applying it to help it penetrate your hair more easily. Mix the ingredients in a glass bowl, measuring cup, or jar, and place the container in a pot of warm or hot water for several minutes to heat it gently.
You can also place a shower cap or plastic wrap over your head with the mask on to generate some heat.
 When the 10 minutes are up, wash the mask out of your hair with warm water. Next, use a mild shampoo to wash your hair as you normally would and follow up with a conditioner.

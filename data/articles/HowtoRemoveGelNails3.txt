 Gels tend to chip off after a week or two, and its best to wait until they're mostly gone to start peeling them yourself, so you reduce damage to the surface of your nail.
 Work it gently under the gel until the gel is slightly raised around the edge. Don't dig too hard under the gel, or you may damage your natural nail.
 Use your fingers or a pair of tweezers to grasp the edge of the gel and peel it back. Repeat with each finger until the gels have been completely removed.









Don't rip off the gels. A layer of your natural nail will come up with them.
If the gels are tough to peel, consider using another removal method.
 Use a file to smooth out the edges, and use a nail buffer to smooth out the rough spots on the surface of your nails. Rub lotion or oil on your nails and hands. Wait a week before applying another set of gels.

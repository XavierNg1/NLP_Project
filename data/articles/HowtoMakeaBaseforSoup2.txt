 Coarsely chop 1 carrot, 1 leek, 1 stalk celery and 1 medium-sized white onion. Finely chop 1 tsp. (5 mg) thyme and 1 tsp. (5 mg) parsley. Set the herbs and vegetables aside.
 Preheat a stock pot on medium heat with 1 tbsp. of margarine or butter. Place 14 to 18 oz. (400 ï¿½ 500 g) of chicken wings in the stock pot and slightly brown the skin of the meat before adding the vegetables and herbs.
 Stir in the vegetables and add 1 tsp. (5 mg) salt, 1 tsp. (5 mg) white pepper and 1 clove. Cover with water and let simmer 25 to 30 minutes.
 Remove the stock from heat, strain and set aside to cool. Once cooled, any fat content will congeal and collect on the surface of the stock, making it easy to scoop off with a spoon and discard.

 A common cause of a "crooked shoulder" (and crooked spine) that is ongoing in nature is scoliosis. Scoliosis is often first detected in younger children. It may worsen as one grows, or it may cause no significant problems, depending upon the severity of the problem. Signs that you may have scoliosis include:Uneven shoulder heights
An uneven waist with one hip higher than the other
A curve in your spine when examined from behind
One shoulder blade that protrudes more than the other
Although scoliosis is fundamentally a spine issue, it sometimes manifests as a crooked shoulder that appears to need adjustment.
 The most important thing to do if you suspect that you may have scoliosis is to see your physician sooner rather than later. It is most often a condition that can be monitored over time and does not require immediate treatment. However, in very severe cases, it may warrant braces to reposition your spine and shoulders, and/or surgery to correct the alignment., Although this will not alter the alignment of your spine and/or shoulders, it will strengthen the muscles of your back and shoulders and thus may help to keep your mobility as good as possible.

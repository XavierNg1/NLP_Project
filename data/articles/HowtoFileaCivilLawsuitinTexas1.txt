 Justice and small claims courts allow you to settle disputes involving smaller amounts of money using simplified, less formal procedures. However, your case must meet the requirements for a justice or small claims court to have jurisdiction.In Texas you must be over the age of 18 to file a suit in justice or small claims court. You also can file suit as an association, partnership, corporation, or other business entity, as long as you aren't a collection agency or in the business of lending money at interest.For example, if you own a construction business and you want to sue a contractor for damages worth $5,000, you can sue in small claims court. However, a bank couldn't use small claims court to sue you to collect on a $5,000 loan.
Generally, small claims courts in Texas hear claims for money damages of $10,000 or less.If the damages actually are worth more than $10,000, the court doesn't have jurisdiction, even if you claim a lesser amount.
In many states, you simply forfeit your claim to any greater damages if you file in small claims court. However, in Texas, if the evidence shows damages greater than $10,000, the court will dismiss your case. You can't get away with telling the court you're willing to settle for the smaller amount.For example, if the defendant caused $12,000 worth of damages to your car when he drove into a tree, you can't sue him for $10,000 in small claims court.
Justice courts also are limited to claims under $10,000, but also have the ability to order defendants to do something such as return property, or enforce liens on real property. However, as with small claims the amount of property in contention must be $10,000 or less.You can only sue a business or person in Texas if they are present in the state. In the case of a person, this typically means you sue in the county where they live. If you want to sue a business, you generally must sue in the county where the company is headquartered or has an office.;

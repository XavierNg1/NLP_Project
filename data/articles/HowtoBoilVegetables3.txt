 You begin blanching and shocking vegetables in the same manner that you would normally use to boil them. Make sure that before you boil your vegetables, you peel, trim, and cut them.


You should have enough water boiling to fully submerge your vegetables.
You can blanch and shock nearly every vegetable, whether it be a root or green veggie., Lower your vegetables into the pot of boiling water carefully once your water has reached a rolling boil.


Use a heat resistant spoon to lower your vegetables into the water.
 A great sign of your veggies being boiled is if they get softer or greener. Make sure that your vegetables are still a little firm so they retain their crunch.Asparagus takes 2-4 minutes to blanch.
Green beans, rutabaga and turnips take 3 minutes to blanch.Watch your pot while your vegetables are cooking so that you don’t overcook them.
 This bowl of water will be used later to shock your vegetables so that they immediately stop cooking and retain their crunchy texture.Don’t place your ice water too close to the stove or your ice may melt.
 Putting the boiled vegetables into ice cold water will stop the vegetable from cooking internally, and is a way to prevent them from getting mushy even after you take them out of boiling water. This step is also known as “shocking” the vegetables.You can use tongs or a slotted spoon to get your vegetables from your pot to the bowl of ice water., Once your green vegetables have been cooled, you can drain them using a strainer or colander. They should retain their firmness, but taste cooked through.


You can buy a strainer or colander at most home goods or department stores.

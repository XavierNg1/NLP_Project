 If you do not want to deal with stomach hair in the long run, get your hair removed with laser treatments, which use a pulse of light to destroy hair follicles. Although it requires multiple treatments, laser hair removal can provide extended hair-free periods or completed removal of your stomach hair.Laser hair removal is most effective on individuals with light skin and dark hair because it is easier for the laser to penetrate the hair follicle with these conditions.Laser hair removal is a medical procedure and should be done under the supervision of a doctor or trained professional for best results and to help minimize the risk of burning your skin.The number of treatments you require depends on how much hair you have. You may need four to six treatments scheduled approximately six weeks apart.Laser hair removal doesn’t always guarantee permanent hair removal and may require periodic maintenance treatments.The Food and Drug Administration has approved at-home laser devices for hair removal below the neck. Talk to your doctor to see if this is a viable option for you, knowing that performing laser treatments at home comes with significant risks., Like laser treatments, electrolysis is a medical procedure that destroys hair growth, though it uses shortwave radio instead of light. Electrolysis can effectively and permanently remove hair from your stomach area.Electrolysis involves a thin probe being placed under the skin and into the hair follicle. A pulse of shortwave radio is then sent through the probe to destroy the follicle.You will likely require a series of treatments over a period of time to fully remove your stomach hair.Have electrolysis done by a medical or trained electrolysis professional to minimize your risk of infection from unsterile needles or scarring from bad technique., Similar to both lasers and electrolysis, needle epilation uses an electric current to destroy hair follicles. This can be an effective and permanent way to remove smaller amounts of stomach hair, though not necessarily practical for something who requires extensive removal.Needle epilation involves inserting a fine wire close to the hair shaft under the skin. Your doctor or epilation professional will then send an electric current down the wire to destroy the hair at the base of the follicle.After this, she may use tweezers to remove loosened hairs.You may also require a series of treatments with needle epilation to remove all of your stomach hair.
 If your stomach hair is especially bothersome or doesn’t go away with treatments, it may be a sign of an underlying medical condition such as hirsutism.Schedule an appointment with your doctor to ensure that you do not have any condition that may be affecting the efficacy of your hair removal treatments.Hirsutism is a condition in women and some men that presents as unwanted male-pattern hair growth in women as a result of excess androgens including testosterone.Hypertrichosis is a condition that presents with excessive hair growth on some part of the body that is not related to androgens.There are few treatments available to persons with hypertrichosis and the results are often unsatisfactory.In most cases, doctors suggest hair removal procedures to alleviate excessive hair growth associated with hypertrichosis.

 Exercise is one of the most important factors in staying healthy as you age--both for your body and your mind. You don't have to run marathons or climb mountains--simply walking for 20-30 minutes a day can benefit your heart, help you lose weight, strengthen your bones, keep your mind sharp, prevent constipation, increase blood flow, and much more., Look for diets that are low in sugar and rich in vitamins. As we age, our bodies can have trouble creating essential vitamins or we may begin needing more vitamins to maintain our health.Vitamin E is found in nuts and seeds, leafy greens, and vegetable oils. It repairs free radicals that damage your cells and can lower your risk of stroke and heart attack.Vitamin C repairs free radicals and increases Vitamin E production. It can also repair collagen and may reduce your odds of developing cancer, cataracts, and cardiovascular disease. Get your dose from citrus and potatoes.Vitamin D helps maintain healthy bones and we need more as we get older. You can get Vitamin D from the sun, but if you need to stay in the shade, you can get it from milk and yogurt., Studies have found that watching excessive amounts of TV can be just as harmful to your health as smoking or lack of exercise and can actually shave years off your life.You don't necessarily have to jump off the couch and onto the treadmill: simply going from inactive (sitting and watching TV) to slightly active (getting up off the couch and doing something else) can make a positive impact on your health., Neglecting your teeth and gums can have dire consequences. A receding gum line or dry mouth can increase chances of decay and infection, which can spread if untreated. Cavities and gum disease can even cause your teeth to fall out. Keep up with dentist appointments, and continue to floss and brush.False teeth should be cleaned and maintained with just as much care. Your mouth may change shape as you age, so be sure to have your dentures refitted if necessary.

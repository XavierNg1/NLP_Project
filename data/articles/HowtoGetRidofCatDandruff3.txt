 Some cats have dry or scaling skin because of a dietary deficiency of vital nutrients that keep the skin in good condition. Typically a diet that is low in essential fatty acids has a detrimental effect on skin condition, leading to excessive scale and skin flakes. Cats have a high requirement for linoleic acid and arachidonic acid to be supplied in their food, because they are unable to make them in the body. Good quality diets are usually well supplemented with these fatty acids, but a cheap diet or a food that has been incorrectly stored and exposed to high temperatures may contain reduced levels.To prevent this make sure to feed a good quality food that lists a named meat as the main ingredient. Also make sure it is stored appropriately and away from extremes of temperature, which could degrade the vital fatty acids.
 To provide additional conditioning for the skin consider giving a supplement of omega fatty acids, also known as PUFA or polyunsaturated fatty acids. These should be given with food to improve absorption into the bloodstream. Fish and marine oils that are a balanced source of Omega 3 and 6 are ideal for your cat.


Around 75 mg / kg a day is the advised dose, which means giving an average 4 - 5 kg cat around 300- 450 mg a day., Dehydration can also cause dry, flaky skin. Most cats don't need a lot of water but it's important for the cat's health that it has access to water at all times. Provide your cat with plenty of clean water every day, whether you think it is drinking it or not.


Change its bowl frequently to ensure it always has good water to drink.
It's also a good idea to wash the water bowl from time to time to kill any bacteria in it.

 How many pets is the person looking after? Naturally, two dogs will cost more than one. Usually, people don't double the costs for two animals however they raise them. For example if you would charge $10 for one dog, charge $15 for two.;
, Caged animals such as hamsters and rats are much smaller and easier to care for than dogs. If caged animals are $10, charge $25 for non-caged such as dogs.
 The amount of work and time will affect the pay. Dogs need to be walked, fed, given water, washed and interacted with, therefore you should pay the sitter more than a sedentary animal such as a hamster or fish.
 How long are they looking after your pets for? Usually charge per day and an equal amount per day.
 Are you giving them materials or will they buy food, cleaning products etc. If they are buying it, you need to pay them for those too.

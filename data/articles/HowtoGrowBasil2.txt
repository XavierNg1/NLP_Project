 Once two sets of leaves have formed, basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers. Basil does not tolerate frost so don't plant too early. It's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil.To plant the basil in the garden, dig holes spaced at least 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems. Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets.
If you want to plant the basil in a container, make sure it's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you're growing; they need to be planted 1 foot (0.3 m) apart, since they grow quite large.
 Basil does best in well-drained soil, and should not be subjected to standing water. Water the mature basil plants once a day, in the morning, so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight.
 When you see flower buds, pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off. Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves, as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows. This is called "bolting" and is more likely to happen when there's extra sunshine. You'll notice that if you leave the flowers, the plant will become lanky and the leaves won't be as full or tasty.
 Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles; the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand.If your plants show signs of mold growth, they may not be getting adequate sunlight, or they may be too close together. Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space.

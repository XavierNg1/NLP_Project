 When gripping the racket, your hand should imitate the act of shaking someoneâ€™s hand. The head of the racket should be perpendicular to the floor when you hold the racket straight out in front of you., Hold the shuttle from your body at a comfortable distance. Your arm should be relaxed, i.e., not locked or stiff.At this point, your racket should be cocked back in order to generate momentum to hit the shuttle, as opposed to underneath the shuttle.
Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart. Your dominant foot should be back. Also stand near the center line.
 With an underhand stroke, hit the bottom of the shuttle below your waist. Your arm should cross your body and end near your opposite shoulder on the follow-through.Remember to aim the shuttle toward the court that is diagonal from you.
For short serves, the trajectory should be flat. This will force your opponent to return high.
For long serves, the shuttle should travel high towards the back line. This will force your opponent to move back to return the shot.

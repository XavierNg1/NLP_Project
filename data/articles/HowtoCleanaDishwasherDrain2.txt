 In order to unclog the drain from inside the dishwasher, you need to remove the bottom rack. This way you will be able to access the drain, catch basin, and filter. Always make sure the power is fully disconnected before you begin working on the dishwasher.
 Using a screwdriver, remove the drain catch and filter that is typically located in the center of the bottom of the dishwasher. You can consult your ownerâ€™s manual in order to locate and remove the filter., Once the filter and drain catch have been removed, you should be able to see down the drain. Remove any clogs from the drain using a straightened wire hanger or auger., In order to remove any additional debris, grease, or scum from the drain, you can use a baking soda and vinegar mixture to flush out the drain. Pour 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of vinegar down the drain.Alternatively, you could use a commercial drain cleaner, but these can contain harsh chemicals that may remain in your dishwasher for some time.
 The baking soda and vinegar will help to break up any clogs that may remain in the drain. After 10-15 minutes, pour hot water down the drain to help remove the mixture along with any remaining debris., Once you have unclogged the drain, reconnect the dishwasher and run it on a normal cycle. The dishwasher should now drain properly and water should no longer pool in the bottom of the machine.

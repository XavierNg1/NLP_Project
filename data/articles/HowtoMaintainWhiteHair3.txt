 A good choice for bleached hair is purple shampoo or 'silvering' shampoo. This shampoo contains purple pigment which neutralises and knocks all traces of yellow and brass from the hair. If your hair is orange this shampoo will not work and you will need to bleach your hair further. You will also need a moisturising conditioner and a protein shampoo to use in-between toning with purple shampoo, you want the hair to remain as healthy as possible. Look at the labels!

, Try organic, no sulphates, no parabens, vegan and no silicone products.
 Some are good, but the ones to give a 'miss' are Isopropyl alcohol, Propyl alcohol and Ethanol, alcohols such as these dry out the hair and de-structure it over time from the inside out.



Deep conditioners are concentrated conditioners which penetrate further into the hair giving deep nourishment and hydration, oils are also amazing for damaged hair, especially coconut oil. Coconut oil has the ability to penetrate the hair deeply because it has a very small molecular structure allowing it to travel inside the follicle and repair the hair from the inside out, and because of it's high saturated fat content (90% sat. fat) it is very moisturising.

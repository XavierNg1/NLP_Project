 If you are a beginner, try one of the smaller tracks without a lot of hairpin turns. As you get better you can move on. If you feel extremely confident with handling, you could try slick-racing.
 A small track, with only one or two karters, will help you start getting the feel of the kart. Drive cautiously.
 Even the best karters spin out on slick tracks and slippery ovals.

 Connecting your printer to your local Wi-Fi network helps save space and less trouble in cable connections.


To connect your printer to your Wi-Fi, connect your printer to your router, enable network sharing of your printer, then add it as network printer. The user should be an administrator to do this.
 Access restrictions have been enforced to avoid exploitation of the network. Without these restrictions, the security of your unit could be compromised, and therefore, IT services deems them necessary. Access on the wireless network will be limited to the following ports:


RealPlayer ports (554, 6970, 7070)
FTP
Lotus Notes
SSH
Popular IM ports (Yahoo IM) - Webcam via Microsoft applications is not available due to security risks, Yahoo and Skype do work
ArcGIS (Earth Science application)
SciFinder Scholar (Science/Library application) and a few others mainly used for staff purposes
Printing (515, 9100, 631)
Basic Web-Browsing ports (HTTP, HTTPs)

, Open any file that can be printed, such as a photo, text document, or PDF. From the File menu, choose Print (or press Command + P).


In the resulting Print dialog, see if your printer is in the Printer pop-up menu. If it appears, select it, and you should be ready to print.
If the printer does not appear in the Print dialog, choose ”Add Printer” from the Printer pop-up menu; the Printer Setup Utility will open. Click the “Add” button in the Printer List window. A list of printers that are available to you should appear. Select your printer and click “Add.”
After selecting your printer, you should be ready to use your printer.

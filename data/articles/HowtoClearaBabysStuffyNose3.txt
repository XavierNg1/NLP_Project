 Before putting your child to bed, run the shower to steam up your bathroom. Sit or stand with your baby in the steamy room for 5 minutes. The moist air will thin and loosen mucus, helping your child to breathe.Do not take your child into the shower, as the hot water may burn him or her.
 Always use a cool-mist humidifier. Hot or warm mist could cause burns.Place the humidifier near your baby, and aim the mist away from the crib to avoid wetting the bedding.Change the water daily and clean the unit with bleach or Lysol to prevent mold growth., In the past, doctors sometimes recommended filling a bowl with hot water and letting your child inhale the steam, but studies show that this method leads to a high risk of burns. It is no longer recommended for children., Vaporizers are no longer recommended due to the danger of burns.For warm, wet air, take your child into a steamed up bathroom.

 Even though you’re not syncing with this method, you still need Windows Media Player to be able to process MTP in order for your phone to connect.
 Windows will automatically recognize it as an MTP device. If an Autoplay window comes up, select “Open device to view files using Windows Explorer.” The icon will look like a folder.


Your screen cannot be locked during this connection process. If it is locked, nothing will show up when you open your phone. Simply unlock the screen to continue.
If an Autoplay window did not appear, open your Computer by clicking the Start button and then selecting “Computer” or “My Computer”. A window showing your connected devices will appear. Double-click on your phone in the list to open it up.
Right-click on your phone and select “Properties” to see how much free space it has. This will impact how much music you can copy.
 Windows will open your phone in the browser, showing you all of its folders. Sort them alphabetically and open the folder labeled “Music”. This is where you will copy your music to.


Be careful when moving files while in your phone’s storage. Many of the folders you see contain critical information to keep your phone working.
 The most common place to find your music on your computer is in the Music folder found in either the Documents or Username folder.
 Right-click on the selected music and click “Properties”. Make note of the size for the music you are copying over. If you try to copy too much, Windows will copy over everything it can until it reaches the limit. Click and drag the music over to the Music folder on your phone.


Hold down the Ctrl button while dragging your music to make sure you copy it and not move it.
You can copy over folders as well as individual songs.

 If you'd like a less-sweet vanilla latte, use less vanilla syrup., Because you are making an iced latte, you do not need to steam the milk., For a stronger iced latte, use 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of espresso. You can brew the espresso using an espresso machine. If you don't have an espresso machine, brew some extra strong coffee using a coffee maker, or an instant coffee., Be sure to scrape the bottom of the glass with the spoon so that the syrup mixes evenly into the latte., How much ice you use is up to you. If you like your iced lattes extra cold, fill the glass the rest of the way with ice. If you like your iced lattes lightly-iced, then add in only a few ice cubes., For an extra fancy iced latte, drizzle some chocolate or caramel syrup on top.

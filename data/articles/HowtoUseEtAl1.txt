 with in-text citations. The intention is to make references shorter and easier to absorb. Aside from authors, this can also apply to characters in a book or novel. In general, it’s used in academic situations or when writing very formally such as in-text citations and parenthetical remarks. If Lewis, Gilbert, and Lamar wrote something about teamwork, the reference could be: ”Lewis et al. (2006) demonstrated teamwork environment is critical to success.”;
, after the last dissimilar author. Cite similar references based upon the first different names. Whenever you have multiple, initial authors that are the same, citation should go to the first dissimilar author. This rule does not apply when the leading authors are different. The following examples demonstrate how to solve the dilemma of nearly identical authors.In 2009, Dobbs, Almond, and Chen wrote Alpha

First citations: (Dobbs, Almond, & Chen, 2009)
Subsequent citations: (Dobbs, Almond, & Chen, 2009)


Dobbs, Almond, Chen, Brown, and Ender wrote Beta

First citations: (Dobbs, Almond, Chen, Brown, & Ender, 2009)
Subsequent citations: (Dobbs, Almond, Chen, et al., 2009)


In 2009, Wilson, Dobbs, and Almond wrote Gamma

All citations are (Wilson, Dobbs, & Almond, 2009), and do not coincide or conflict in any way with the previous two citations because Wilson is the lead author, and different from the lead author (i.e. Dobbs) on the other two.
 There is some confusion and disagreement concerning the usage of a comma before et al. The guidance is based on whether or not the Oxford comma (i.e. the pre-conjunction comma in a list greater than two) is being preferred. In general, however, literally substituting the words “and others” into the phrase can help you make the decision. Use the following examples for guidance:


Not using the Oxford comma, “Moe, Curly, Larry and Shemp” would be “Moe, Curly et al.”
Using the Oxford comma, “John, Paul, George, and Ringo” would be “John, Paul, et al.”

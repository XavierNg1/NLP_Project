 Time is of the essence if heat stroke is involved. If you're not alone, one person can begin first aid while the other calls. If you are alone, then once you know that help is on its way, you can concentrate on using the various cooling techniques listed to aid the heat stroke victim â€” but make sure you call for help first.;
, Take care to provide clear and accurate directions to your location (or an accurate address) when you call emergency services. This should be the first piece of information you give. Even though time is crucial, stay calm. Speak slowly. Be sure the operator understand clearly where you are.
 You may be asked to provide additional information about the heat stroke victim's condition. This might require speaking to the victim, or observing symptoms at close range and relating them to the operator.


If the victim's physical condition is deteriorating rapidly, you will need to be in position to recognize this so that you can make the call quick and tend immediately to the victim.
The operator may be able to guide you in how to best help the victim while you await help.

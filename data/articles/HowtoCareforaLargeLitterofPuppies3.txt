 Puppies should drink their mother’s milk for the first few weeks of their lives. Then, around three and a half to four and a half weeks of age, they should be switched to solid food.Start getting the puppies to eat solid food by mixing puppy food, milk replacer, and water together. Put it on a flat saucer instead of a bowl.
You will probably have to press the puppy’s nose to the food a few times each day until they are ready to start eating. You may have to do this for around two to three days.
After they start eating this mixture, you can switch to canned or dry puppy food. Just make sure to use milk replacer or water to make it soggy. Decrease the sogginess each day as they learn how to eat solid food.
 Prior to this, the puppies are protected from the antibodies found in the mother dog’s milk. By six weeks, these antibodies are dying off, which means the puppies should be vaccinated.Take your litter to the vet when they are between six and eight weeks old for their vaccinations.
 Worming is important to keep the puppies healthy. Your vet will likely recommend worming with fenbendazole (Panacur) every two weeks from two weeks of age. This covers a critical time in the puppies' young lives when round worms hatch out rapidly in the puppies' bowel.
 During the first weeks of life, the litter should remain together and near the mother. When the puppy starts walking and playing around four weeks of age, they will learn social skills from the litter and discipline from the mother. Keep the litter together during this time is important for the dog to develop mentally and behaviorally.The puppy shouldn’t be separated from the litter until at least eight weeks old, though many believe they should stay together until 12 weeks.

 Place the dried lemon peel, ground black pepper, and table salt in a bowl. Stir the three ingredients together until evenly and thoroughly combined.


Since all three spices are already in finely ground forms, they should mix together without difficulty.
You can skip the salt or reduce the amount if you'd prefer your seasoning blend to have less sodium. You can also change the amount of lemon peel and pepper used, but these proportions will result in a seasoning blend similar to commercially prepared versions.;
, Pour the lemon pepper seasoning into an airtight jar or similar container. Store it in a cool, dry location for up to six months.

 Locate the application or software on your desktop computer and open it.
 Click the “New Message” option from the left panel menu. A new window will appear containing your contacts list.
 Click the contact or contacts you will want to talk to. Their names will be added to the To field at the top. You can also search for them by typing their Wickr names in the To field.
 Click the “Create Message” button right beside the To field. A new window will appear for your conversation screen.
 Wickr destroys all the messages exchanged after the time limit has passed. You set this destruction time for every new message you send. Click the bomb icon located at the top of the message field at the bottom of the window. Use the slider bar that will appear to adjust the destruction time. You can set it from days to seconds.
 Type your message in the message box at the bottom of the screen. Hit Return or Enter on your keyboard to send your message to your recipients.
 Your message will appear on your conversation screen with the recipients. Once a message is received, it will appear here, along with replies from the recipients.

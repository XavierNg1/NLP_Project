 What is the sale price?" or "A colony of 4,800 bacteria grows by 20%. How many bacteria are there now?"

, Something like a sales tax, for example, is an increase situation. A discount, on the other hand, is a decrease situation.
 So an 8% sales tax becomes 108%, for example, or a 12% surcharge becomes 112%.
 If something is 30% off, you will be working with 70%; if something is discounted 12%, you'll be dealing with 88%.
 This means moving the decimal point over two places to the left.


For example, 67% becomes 0.67; 125% becomes 1.25; 108% becomes 1.08; etc.
If you are unsure of how to do this calculation, you can also divide your percentage by 100. This will give you the same number.
 If, for example, we're working on the problem "A $25 pair of jeans is on sale at 60% off. What is the sale price?" the following is an illustration of this step:


25 x .40 = ?
Remember that we subtracted our sale price of 60% from 100, giving us 40%, and then turned it into a decimal.
 For our own example, we last had:


25. x .40 = ? Multiply the two numbers together and we get '10'.
But '10' what? 10 dollars, so we say that the new jeans cost $10 after the 60% sale.
 To better understand this type of problem, read the prompt and see if you understand how to finish the following problems:


Problem #1: "A $120 pair of jeans is on sale at 65% off. What is the sale price?"

To solve: 100 - 65 gives 35%; 35% converts to 0.35.
0.35 x 120 equals 42; the new price is $42 (and quite a deal it is, too!)


Problem #2: "A colony of 4,800 bacteria grows by 20%. How many bacteria are there now?"

To solve: 100 + 20 gives 120%; that converts to 1.2.
1.2 x 4,800 equals 5,760; there are now 5,760 bacteria in the colony.

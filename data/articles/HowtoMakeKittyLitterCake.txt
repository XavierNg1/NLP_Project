 Follow the directions on the boxes, but don't worry too much about pan sizes: we're not going to frost it the normal way! Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature.;
, While the cakes are baking, make the pudding, and let chill in the refrigerator.
 You can use a food processor (scrape often to get every little piece), kitchen mallet, or just crumble them by hand. Set aside all but about 1/4 cup.
 You can either mix them together with a fork or shake them together in a closed container such as a jar or Tupperware. Set aside for now.
 Toss gently with half of the remaining white cookie crumbs and enough chilled pudding to moisten (not soak) the crumbs.
 Add the cake, cookie crumbs, and pudding mixture into a brand new, clean litter box. If you donâ€™t have one, find a large rectangular Tupperware container to act as a stand-in (or sit-in).
 Heat three unwrapped Tootsie rolls in a microwave-safe dish until they're soft and pliable. Pinch off the ends so they are no longer blunt and look convincingly like what cats put in the litter box. Repeat this process with as many Tootsie rolls as you'd like to add, microwaving them in batches of three. Reserve three for the final garnish.
 Sprinkle them with (normal-colored) cookie crumbs to make it look like litter has been kicked onto them.
 This will mimic real litter, where many of the grains are often blue or green.
 Scrape them on top of the cake. One can hang over the side of the litter box. Sprinkle them lightly with cookie crumbs to make them look more recent.
 Place the box on a newspaper and sprinkle a few of the cookie crumbs around. Serve with a brand new, washed litter scooper for that extra touch!

, Take a scoop of chocolate ice cream and flatten it out on the plate. For extra realism, thoroughly mix crumbled shredded wheat with softened ice cream, shape into cow patties, and re-freeze.

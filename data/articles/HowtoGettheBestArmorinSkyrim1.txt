 The Daedric armor requires at least a level 90 Smithing. The Smithing level of your character can be increased by constantly forging items in the Blacksmith’s forge.


To forge items, approach a Blacksmith forge that can be found in any town. Press the interaction on your keyboard or controller to start forging weapons and armors.
Your Smithing level will increase regardless of what item you forge.;
, Open your Skills menu inside the game and select Smithing to view the Smithing skill tree of your character. The second to the top point of the tree is the Daedric Smithing perk.


To unlock this, all you need to do is to use all the skill points you gained when you were leveling up your Smithing skill (step 1) and unlock all the perks below the Daedric (there are 8).
 The Daedric armor set composes of five parts, namely: the chest plate, boots, gauntlets, helmet, and the shield. To get the complete set, you’ll need the following:


10 Leather Strips — This can be bought from merchants all over the game for 3 Gold.
17 Ebony Ingots — This can be bought from merchants all over the game for 150 Gold once your character reaches level 27.
5 Daedra Hearts (for each piece of the set) — This can be obtained by killing a Dremora inside the Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon located at The Pale, one of the nine “Holds” in Skyrim.
 Once you’ve collected all the required materials, approach a Blacksmith forge and press the interaction key to start creating an armor. Once the armor has been created, it will automatically be added to your bag.
 Open your character’s bag and select the Daedric armor pieces. Using your controller’s navigation buttons, equip each item of the set one at a time.

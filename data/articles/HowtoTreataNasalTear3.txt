 If you want to avoid having surgery on your nose, your doctor can try plugging your nasal tear with a special button made of soft plastic. The nasal button can help to reduce crusting and nosebleeds. It can also help to stop the whistling sound you may make when you breath through your nose due to the nasal tear.Speak to your doctor about this option as well as any side effects of the procedure before you go through with it.
 A septoplasty is a surgical procedure that will help to close the hole in your septum. During this procedure, the doctor will take tissue from another part of your body, such as inside your nose, and sew it into the hole. They can also use the tissue to create a flap that will cover the hole in your septum.You will be under general anesthesia during the procedure. The doctor may also use a local anesthetic to numb your nose during the procedure.
 If you do opt for a septoplasty to correct your nasal tear, make sure you are aware of the recovery process before the surgery. You will need to keep gauze in your nose for 48 hours after the surgery. You will likely experience pain and bleeding from your nose. The doctor will give you pain medication to manage your symptoms as you recover.During your recovery, you will need to avoid decongestant nasal sprays, smoking, and medication that contains caffeine.
If the hole is very large in your septum, there is a risk it may open up again, even after the surgery. You may then require another surgery to repair the hole again.
After surgery, there will be swelling which may make it difficult to breathe through your nose.
Avoid forceful nose blowing or insertion of any objects (including fingers) into the nose.

 You can use rubber bands to fasten paper towels or a cleaning wipe to a paint roller, which can then be rolled across the fan blades.If you don't have these materials you can use a broom to dust the blades of a ceiling fan.
 You'll need a broom to sweep wood and tile floors and a vacuum to clean any carpets.


You can sweep from end to end, or start along one wall and clean the perimeter of the room, working your way inward.Use a similar method for carpeted rooms.
 Once you've swept the floors, you may need to mop to clean up any dirt and dust that accumulated over the winter.


Fill a bucket with warm water and a cleaning agent like Murphy's Oil or Pinesol.
Dip a mop into the bucket, ring it out thoroughly, and work your way across the floor. Start in the corner farthest from the door you'll use to leave the room, so you don't have to walk across a wet floor.Use short strokes and move with the grain of the floor, if the floors are made of wood.

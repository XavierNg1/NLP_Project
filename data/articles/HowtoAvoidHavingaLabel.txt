 Clothes are one of the main things a label possesses. Dark clothes point towards goth and emo. Pink, Pastel, Polos and Clothes equal preppy. Bright, colorful, tight clothing scream scene. Weird, kiddish clothes speaks nerd or dork. Oversized hoodies, jeans hanging off the bum, jerseys, bling, and baseball caps usually equal swag. Thrift shop stores means that you're a indie or hipster. Flannel and hunting attire usually means that you're a flat out redneck or farm boy.;

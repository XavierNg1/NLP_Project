 It's the green app with a white phone icon on it.


If you haven't yet set up WhatsApp, do so before continuing.
 It's either at the bottom of your screen (iPhone) or the top of the screen (Android).


If WhatsApp opens to a conversation, first tap the "Back" button in the top-left corner of the screen.
 Doing so will open the conversation, allowing you to chat with any contacts in the conversation.
 It's on the far-right side of the box where you can write your message. Holding this button will prompt WhatsApp to begin recording.


On the web version of WhatsApp, you only need to click once on the microphone icon and then click "Allow" on the system request that appears to begin to record a voice message.
 Doing so will deliver the message to any contacts in your conversation.
 If you don't wish to send the message you've recorded, slide your finger to the left while still holding down the microphone button.
 When your contact has seen the media you've sent, you'll see two blue checkmarks display next to your message.

"Break the Targets!!" mode. This mode tasks you with destroying all of the targets on the level as quickly as possible.
 Each character has a unique Break the Targets level that requires you to use their special abilities. You'll need to destroy all of the targets with Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Pikachu, and Fox.Don't worry about doing it quickly, you only need to break all of the targets to unlock Luigi.
See the video below for a walkthrough of each of the Break the Targets levels.
 Luigi will challenge you to a 1-on-1 battle as soon as you finish the last of your Break the Targets levels. This means that you will be using the character that you just finished the level with. You can use this to your advantage to ensure that you are using a character you like against Luigi.


Once you defeat Luigi, he will be added to your character roster.

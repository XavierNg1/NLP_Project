 You want the bandage or fabric to have some stretch to it, and be long enough to wrap around your foot and ankle several times.


If you do not have a bandage wrap, any strip of fabric, such as cotton or T-shirt material, will do.;
, Place the end of the bandage on the ball of your foot, and roll the bandage over the top of your foot. Keep rolling the bandage around your foot and ankle, leaving the heel exposed, until you reach your lower-calf. Be sure you have enough bandage left over to wrap around an icepack.Do not wrap your ankle too tightly, or else you might cut off blood circulation. If your toes are turning blue or purple, or if you feel any numbness, you might be wrapping the bandage too tightly.
 Roll the bandage back over the icepack, covering it, cut off the extra, and secure it.


If you do not have an icepack, you can make your own by putting ice into a plastic bag and sealing it.
If you are using an elastic bandage, you may notice that some metal hooks or latches have been included in the packaging. Use these to secure the bandage so that it does not unwrap.
If you did not find any metal hooks or latches with your elastic bandage, you can secure the bandage with a safety pin.
 Let the ice pack stay on the sprain for 10 to 20 minutes, then take it off for 2 to 3 hours. Do this for 2 to 3 days.Do not leave the ice pack on your ankle for more than 20 minutes.
 Lay down and prop your ankle above the level of your heart. Do this for 2 to 3 hours every day.

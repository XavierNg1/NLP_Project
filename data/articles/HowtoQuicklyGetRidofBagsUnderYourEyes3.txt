 Before going to bed, thoroughly wash off any makeup you applied to your face earlier in the day. Eye makeup can cause your eyes to water while you sleep, which will increase the amount of puffiness you wake up with.If possible, try to use actual makeup remover to strip cosmetics from your skin before bed. Removers are specially formulated to cling to the makeup particles and lift them away, making them more effective than plain soap and water.
If you don't have makeup remover, though, regular facial cleanser and plain water will still work. Just make sure that you keep washing until all eye makeup is completely gone.
 Slide an extra pillow beneath your head before falling asleep. You could also prop up the head of your mattress or elevate the entire head of the bed. The main idea is simply to keep your head higher than the rest of your body.Keeping your head elevated should help drain excess blood, mucus, and other fluids away from your face, preventing them from pooling beneath your eyes and creating bags.
 If you sleep on your stomach or your side, switch to sleeping on your back for the night. By keeping your eyes facing up, you allow gravity to pull excess fluid away from your eyes instead of letting it gather there.If you think you'll naturally roll back onto your stomach or side during the night, try wedging pillows on other side of your body to help reduce the amount of tossing and turning you can do.
 Poor sleep is one of the better known causes of bags beneath your eyes. Plan ahead when choosing your bedtime so that you can get about seven to eight hours of sleep before your alarm goes off the next morning.Sleep deprivation causes your body to release cortisol, the "stress hormone," which can cause the collagen in your skin to break down. This makes the skin beneath your eyes weaker and more prone to dark circles.

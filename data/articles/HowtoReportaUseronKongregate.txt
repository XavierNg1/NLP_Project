 Don't report people who beat your highscore or downvoted your comment. Instead, report users who:

have an inappropriate username. Anything offensive, inflammatory, hate-based, harassing, or sexual in nature.
have an inappropriate avatar. Anything copyrighted, violent, offensive or pornographic.
have offensive profile content. Anything offensive, inflammatory, hate-based, harassing, violent, copyrighted, or sexual in nature.
exhibit chat behaviour. People who are constantly chatting about things that are absolutely not related to Kongregate or games in general. People who are spamming chats should be reported as well.
Reporting users without a legit reason could actually result in you getting banned.;

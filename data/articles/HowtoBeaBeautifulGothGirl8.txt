 The scene all started with the band Throbbing Gristle forming their own label, Industrial Records, for a new genre of extremely weird experimental electronic music. For some Rivet Heads, this is the only “real” Industrial music - bands like SPK and The Leather Nun which spawned from this scene of the early 80s.
 The modern Rivethead may listen to Darkwave bands resembling a heavier form of EBM (Wumpscut, Skinny Puppy), or even the commercial “Industrial Metal” bands (Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, KMFDM).
 It is also undeniable that Sc-Fi movies such as The Matrix have inspired the look of many Rivet Heads - a lot of them will refuse to remove their trenchcoats even in the sweatiest clubs.

 Choose from these options:


Apple cider vinegar and water. This natural solution works well to break down the adhesive, but it can leave a smell on the wall; only use it if your wallpaper is covering paint, not a bottom layer of wallpaper.
Liquid fabric softener and water. This solution is cheap and effective, but you may not want to use chemicals on your wall.
Manufactured wallpaper stripper. You can buy wallpaper stripper solution from the hardware store to use on your walls.
Warm water. When all else fails, plain water usually does the trick.
 This is especially important if the border is made of vinyl. If you don't score it, the liquid solution won't be able to seep in. Scrape the scoring tool over the border for several minutes, until it's covered with hundreds of tiny holes.


Make sure the perforating tool you use is made of plastic, not metal. A metal scraping tool could harm the wall underneath.
If you don't have a perforating tool, use a plastic knife to make criss-crossing scores across the border.
 Spray it all over, in the corners, near the edges, and in the middle. Don't skimp with the solution; the wallpaper needs to be completely wet for the adhesive to begin to loosen. Let the solution sit for 15 minutes before continuing.
 Use a plastic scraping tool (similar to an ice scraper) to life the edge of the wallpaper and begin scraping it away. Use one hand to scrape and the other one to peel. Keep scraping and peeling across the length of the border.


If you run into a stubborn area, douse it with solution. Let it sit for five minutes before continuing.
Don't rip the wallpaper off in strips; this makes it a lot more difficult to remove the tiny pieces.
 You may have to saturate the stray pieces with more solution. Use the scraper to loosen them, then peel them away.

 Because of the algae needs water flow and floats, you can place it in the sump compartment of the aquarium filter system. Sump compartments are the secondary tanks that are connected to the display aquarium tank that helps filter the water.This will allow the algae to absorb the nitrates and phosphates it needs for growth., After the algae has filtered the nitrates and phosphates, you can move the algae into the main part of the aquarium. You can prune part of the algae and place it in the tank for the fish to eat. Alternately, you can move the entire plant into the main aquarium part for the fish to eat on., If you donâ€™t want to place the ulva algae in the sump compartment, you can place it directly in your aquarium. You can drop it in the water, where it will float on top of the water., Algae is a free floating plant. However, you can attach it to a rock or shell in your aquarium. Use a touch of superglue to attach the algae to whatever surface you want in your tank. Alternately, you can try tying a string around part of the algae and the surface you want to anchor it to.

 Don't just sit there and shoot. You will be an easy target and die if you do that. Don't shoot while dodging though, because weapons have much less accuracy when jumping and dodging. Also keep jumping randomly so the opponent misses their shots.;
, If you keep missing, you will be hopeless and lose a lot of ammo. Playing campaign a lot, especially the first level (the tutorial) you will eventually improve your aim.
 It is always important to be at high health and have ammo so you are prepared. You can also grab a Energon Recharger. When you have the Energon Recharger item, you can repair yourself during a big fight.
 Most people don't use cover and get killed. When under heavy fire, make sure to hide.
 Every loadout is different. Make sure you have the abilities and weapons that suite you the most.

 First, you will need to have enough money for a bottle. Don’t worry, this investment is well worth it. The bottle enables you to store caught insects.;
, Enter, and you will see the Bee Guy. Press “A” to talk to him. He will end up giving you the Net, which can be used to catch bugs.
 You will find it in the lower left corner of Kakariko Village. Cut the grass by swinging your sword. Hopefully, a bee will appear.
 If a bee does appear, press "X" or “Y” to use the net, and catch it.


If a bee doesn't appear, then go into the nearest building, and come back out to reset the grass. Keep repeating the process until you catch a bee.
 He will give you 50 rupees in exchange for the bee. Now your bottle is empty again.
 The Bee Guy will buy an unlimited number of bees, so as long as you’re willing to grind, you will keep making money.

 During pregnancy, women do not menstruate. While you may experience some light spotting, you will not have your period during the course of pregnancy. If your period has suddenly stopped, pregnancy may be the cause.


Many home pregnancy tests are accurate on the first day of a missed period. For most tests, you immerse a small stick in urine and wait several minutes for results. A plus sign, changed colors, or the word "pregnant" indicate pregnancy depending on the test.Home pregnancy tests are generally very accurate. Most are about 99% accurate, but some tests are not as good as detecting pregnancy as they claim. It might be a good idea to take two different tests to assure accuracy.It's important to see a doctor as soon as possible to confirm your pregnancy with a blood test., Usually, after pregnancy menstruation returns.

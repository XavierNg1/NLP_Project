 Splash water up over your faucet to wet the surface and wash away debris.









You should clean your faucet weekly to remove spots and stains. Toothpaste and soap often leave flecks on faucets, and they are easiest to remove when they are recent.
 Create a cleaning and polishing agent using white vinegar and hot water. Your water should be hot, but not boiling.
 Dip your cloth in your vinegar-water mixture. Be careful not to burn yourself with the hot water.
 Work the cloth in circular movements as you polish away hard water spots and other splash marks on your faucet.









Use a clean cloth to dry the faucet so that you donâ€™t leave streaks.

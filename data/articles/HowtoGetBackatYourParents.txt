 Start after an hour or two.


Wait for a good moment. Walk past them casually and say "Hey mom/dad!". This way, they won't suspect that something's up.;
, If they took something away from you, sneak into their room and take their cell phone or MP3 player or something. Then when they accuse you, refuse it. After that secretly put whatever you took in a simple place they will find it. This will make them feel bad they blamed you.
 Lock them out if you can and tell them that you'll let them in when they agree to stop bullying you.
 Lock all the doors you can around your house. Steal your parents' house keys. Steal your parents' wallet.
 Download some annoying music to your iPod and play it out loud from your iPod speakers. Pick a song like "Do You Like Waffles" or "Peanut Butter Jelly Time."

, Go on the computer, type an essay called "Why I Hate My Parents" and put it somewhere they will find it.


After they find the essay, pack up a few things and leave. Don't really leave. Sit on your porch or in your backyard.
 If it's raining or something else that will prevent you from running away, ignore them for at least 2 days (silence is the best policy).
 While your parent is in the room, take out your cell phone and pretend to call your grandma and ask if you can live with her and when she asks why, say "Because my mom hates me" , but not too loudly/obviously.

, Use a vegetable scrubber to scrub the skins, then pat the apples dry. If you prefer peeled apples, peel your apples after washing them. Any type of apples will do, but Fuji or Granny Smith apples are both great candidates for slicing and roasting. The tart flavor and firm flesh holds up well to the cooking process.
 Stand an apple upright and use a sharp knife to slice the apple in half through the middle of the core. Slice the halves in two, leaving four large pieces. Cut out and discard the core. Repeat with the remaining apples.Apples break down as they roast, so keep this in mind when you decide on the size of your slices. Apples sliced into eight parts tend to come out with the best texture.
If you have an apple corer, use that before slicing the apples.
 Place them in a bowl and toss gently to completely coat them with sugar and spice. If desired, add a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon juice.
 Try to make sure none of them are overlapping.
 Try to distribute them evenly among the apple slices. The butter will melt to coat the apples as they bake.
 The apples should be golden brown and bubbly when they're ready. Remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.
 Roasted, sliced apples are delicious with vanilla ice cream, plain yogurt, or as a topping for oatmeal. You can store leftover apples in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three days.

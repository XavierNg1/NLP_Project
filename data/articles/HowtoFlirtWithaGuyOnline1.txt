 A profile picture says a lot about you, and if you're wanting to flirt online, having a good photo of you to go with your posts goes a long way.If you already have a lot of good photos of yourself online, you should pick one that highlights your face, preferably in a high resolution photo quality. If you don't have many photos, try taking a few and see if there are any that stick. You won't have a physical presence save for this picture while flirting online, so make it count.


If you're torn deciding what photo you should use, get a friend to help. A friend's advice can give insight into how your photos will be perceived by other people.;
, This bodes well if you're trying to get someone interested in you. If there's something on your mind, make a post about it. If you got up to something interesting the other day, let the internet know about it.


Quality is ultimately more important than quantity, and spamming with a large number of shallow or poorly worded posts will actually have the opposite effect you're going for.
 Most social media outlets (like Facebook) have a feature that will quickly allow you to express interest in a post. The 'like button' is incredibly fast to use, and shows someone you're interested in what he has to say. If you're already interested in a guy, you should go out of your way to show his online posts some love and attention. If they're the sort of posts that might benefit from having a wider audience, you can even share them to your own profile.

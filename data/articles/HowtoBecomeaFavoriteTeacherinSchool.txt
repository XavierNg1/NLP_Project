 Students respond to teachers who are firm but fair. Don't scold children very much for minor infractions - be reasonable and hold them accountable, but don't go overboard. Maintain a respectful demeanor throughout, and you're more likely to get the same in return. Make sure that you don't use any word that insults the children in the front of the class as it will ruin your image.;
, This term means only appointing a few students for monitoring, keeping the registers, etc. This will make other students feel bad. Make sure you share out the duties and responsibilities, and opportunities among all your students, rather than playing favorites.
 Showing that you feel happy will make others feel happy, too. Friendliness and happiness can be contagious, and spreading a little cheer around the school will improve everyone's impression of you.
 Have a sense of humor, and be willing to laugh at yourself and your students. If your students know they can be light-hearted and have fun in your class, they'll be more relaxed and enjoy it. Having a little sense of humor doesn't have to get in the way of learning.
 Always try to arrange time for your students - this is the most powerful tip. Respect their time and pay attention to them when they need help. Don't be pushy, but be available when they need extra help, advice, or a mentor. Let the kids come to you, offer them attention and support, and you'll soon see them thinking of you as their favorite.

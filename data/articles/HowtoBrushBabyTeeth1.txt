 Though rare, some babies have come into the world with teeth already present. Check for the presence of teeth by gently sticking a clean finger into the babyâ€™s mouth and feeling around the gums. Feel for tiny ridges or a mild inflammation along the gum line.;
, The speed at which a tooth erupts varies, and while some babies teethe for weeks before the tooth breaks through the gums, other babies can go from no teeth to 2 teeth in a weekend. Checking the gums at least once a week will ensure that you find any new teeth shortly after they come through, allowing you to begin brushing them immediately.

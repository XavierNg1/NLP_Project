 Not all cable providers are available everywhere. Find a provider that operates in your area first. You can do this by doing an Internet search such as “cable provider + ”. If you find that the provider isn't offering as good a deal as ones you've researched online, this will be a time of negotiation, in which you can point out what you'd like and what is offered elsewhere.
 Remember that providers are not required to advertise the “basic” package in the United States, and so most list only the “standard” and higher packages on their websites. That means, if you want the cheapest package, you will need to call and discuss your desired package in person, rather than purchase online. Any special tweaks needed to be made to your package will have to be done over the phone, or in person, where possible.
 The operator may try to sell you the “expanded basic” or “standard” package when you ask for “basic.” Politely insist that you want the most basic package, not the standard package. If pressured, remind the operator that you know the company is required to sell it to you. If they're particularly insistent, simply tell them it's all you can afford and it's that or nothing (most salespeople want something over nothing).


Ask about pricing and available channels. If you have favorite channels you're hoping to get, be sure to clarify the availability with your package, as you may or may not be able to get cable channels such as ESPN.

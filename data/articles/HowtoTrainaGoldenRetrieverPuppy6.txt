 Golden retrievers love to fetch, and it is a great way to exercise them. You probably won’t need any help getting your puppy to chase a ball or toy. But be sure to instill good habits early on to make sure they learn how to bring the toy back and drop it near you.
 Throw one, and when your dog picks it up, show the other toy and throw it the other way. While he is chasing it, pick up the first toy.Do this until he is accustomed to fetching and then running towards you.
Eventually, you can call your dog without showing the second toy. If he comes, say drop it and show the second toy.
When your dog will drop on command, you can eliminate the second toy.



If he follows give a treat.
If your dog still runs away, reel him in with the rope. Praise and reward when close.
Don’t always throw the toy right away. Let your dog chew on it sometimes after returning. You don’t want him to think he will lose it every time he returns.
After a few weeks, your dog should stop trying to escape with the toy.
 Say “drop it” and put a treat right in front of your dog’s nose. This will get even the most stubborn dogs to give up the toy.If your dog still won’t drop, try a more irresistible treat, like bits of bacon or cheese.
Eventually you will not need the treat, but still give one every so often.
 Just before your dog drops the toy, say “bring it” and move away. When he reaches the place you were standing, say “drop it” and walk back to him to pick up the toy. It may take a few weeks before your dog learns to bring the toy to you., Tell your dog to sit and stay when he drops the toy. If your dog tries to grab it when you bend down, immediately say “no” or “uh, uh” and stand up. Eventually, your dog will figure out that if he wants to keep playing, he will have to sit and stay while you pick up the toy.When he does hold the stay, remember to say “okay” to release him before you throw the toy again.

, Go to the top of the dome; see the crypts, monuments, painting, and statues along the way. You can even decide to visit the Vatican Museums: the ticket costs about 14 €. It is worth to see if you are fond of Arts. The only bad thing is that the line could be very long and it would take you hours to get in it. If you are interested in visiting the Museums, go there early in the morning (around 07:00-07:30....quite early it is) to avoid long waiting.
 Enjoy dinner at a local cafe.
 Walk to the historic places you missed, and do some shopping for your family and the special lady/guy in your life.

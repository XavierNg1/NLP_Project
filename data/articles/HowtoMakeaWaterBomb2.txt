 Get a pack of sponges from your local convenient store. The cheaper sponges will do just fine. Look in the cleaning or cooking section and pick up a pack of five dish sponges. You'll also need a pen, ruler, scissors and string.


If you're not as confident tying knots, you could use wire ties., Outlining with a pen will help you create even strips. These strips will come to make the ball. Orient your sponge so that it is in a horizontal position. Using your pen and ruler, mark five lines across your sponge, 1/2 an inch apart.If you don't have a ruler, you could just divide five lines with your pen, and use your best judgement.
 Using your scissors, cut along the lines you created with your pen. You should have five strips of the sponge afterwards.Be careful not to cut yourself. Watch over children handling this process.
 Prepare the strips of sponge together by creating two stacks. One stack will have three strips and the other will have two. Position the stacks so they are touching each other. Use your sting or wire ties to connect them. Once they are tied together, fluff the strips out to form a ball shape.Use a standard knot. Don't use the knot you tie your shoe with because this could become undone.
 Repeat this process to however many sponge balls you wish to create. For a colorful effect, combine two different colored sponges. Take three strips of a yellow sponge and two strips of a blue sponge. Get creative and have fun!

 There’s a reason three different teas have been included on this list - they work! If you want to bring out red highlights in your hair, use a naturally red tea and let your hair soak. Find a berry or fruit tea that is red when brewed, such as raspberry, blackberry, or pomegranate. Let several of these teabags steep in a few cups of water and then pour it through your hair. Let it soak in your hair for at least 30 minutes before rinsing out.
 If you’ve ever cooked beets, you know how potent the staining ability of beet juice is. Bring out the natural red in your hair by letting some beet juice work its magic. Mix it with a bit of distilled water to dilute it, and the coat your strands with the concoction. Let it soak for 15-20 minutes, and then rinse out with warm water.
 Brewing up some hot cinnamon tea using real cinnamon is a great way to bring out the caramel undertones in your hair. Mix a few cinnamon sticks or 1-2 tablespoons of cinnamon with a few cups of water (more or less depending on the length and thickness of your hair). Coat your locks and let it soak for a while before rinsing out.
 This trick is almost cheating, as henna is used primarily as a dye for hair and skin. Mix henna with water (or tea, for extra lightening powers!) to form a paste, and coat your hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap and leave the henna on - the longer you wait (2 hr -8 hr), the more red your hair. Rinse out with water as per usual, and be amazed by your luscious ginger locks! If you have brown or black, you most likely will end up with a shade darker than your natural hair color, that is black or very black hair. Chemical dyes may not work as expected on hair which has been previously dyed with henna. Henna at best colors vibrantly grey hair, and may add a dark red hue in bright sunlight for dark colored hair. For African hair, henna might leave your hair feeling brittle. To alleviate this sensation do a hot oil treatment after henna coloring.

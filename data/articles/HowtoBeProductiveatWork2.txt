 A great way to prepare for a productive day is to close work with tomorrow morning in mind. Take a moment to review what you’ve accomplished and what you haven’t completed. Write out a to-do list for tomorrow morning. By reviewing what you need to do tomorrow, you’ll gain a sense of accomplishment and determination for when you walk up to your desk the following morning.


Place the physical to-do list on your desk. A great way to follow this system is by keeping the list visible for you to use as an organizer., Don’t leave work with your desk or work space in shambles. Before leaving to go home, take a couple minutes to organize your space and clean up any sort of clutter that has accumulated. A clean work space will cause you to begin work on a cheerful note instead of having a lazy-aura looming over your desk.
 After compiling a to-do list for your next day of work, take a couple of minutes to prepare any necessary tools for your day. Print off documents that you know you’ll need to start work on in the morning. If you have a meeting in the morning, review the material before leaving the office.


It is best to hit the ground running as opposed to wrapping your head around the work ahead of you.

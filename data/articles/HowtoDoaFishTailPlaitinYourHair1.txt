 Remove any tangles and brush your hair smooth.;
, Divide it into two large sections with the part running straight down the middle. Use the tip of a comb to make the part look neat. Hold one section of hair in each hand., The smaller the strand, the finer your braid will be. If you're in a hurry, grab a bigger strand.
 Cross it over to the other side and place in the other section.
 Take a strand from the outside of the right section and move it to the inside of the left section. For a neat-looking braid, make sure the strand is the same size as the previous strand you moved.
 Keep taking small strands of hair from each side and crossing them over to the other side. As you work, pull the plait tight to keep the strands from getting too loose and falling out., Use an elastic, a ribbon or a hair bobble.

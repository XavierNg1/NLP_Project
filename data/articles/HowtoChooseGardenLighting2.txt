 To light up areas like your front and back doors, choose a brighter light that illuminates the whole area. Wall lights are a good option, as are mini floodlights. These lights can be both decorative and practical, as they help to keep crime at bay.Make sure to think about your neighbors when placing your lights. You don't want a floodlight that shines directly into someone's bedroom.
 When lighting up your porch or back door for security purposes, it's a good idea to set up lights that will turn on by themselves. You can choose ones that are motion-activated, so they light up when anyone walks by. You can also install ones that are set to come on at dusk and turn off in the morning, thereby automatically lighting up the area through the night.To keep your energy bill low, use LED or other low-energy lights.
 High-quality solar-powered lights can provide steady light, but they are less reliable overall than wired lights because they need sunlight to charge. Plus, they tend to wear out quicker. Electric lights, on the other hand, tend to be more reliable. They will provide lighting as long as they have working light bulbs and you have power.

 Oklahoma applies what is called a Graduated Driver License program (GDL). According to this program, you need to use the license at one level before you are eligible to move ahead to the next level., During the six months that you have your intermediate license, you must avoid any traffic violations. If you are convicted of a traffic violation while driving with your intermediate license, the six month waiting period begins again. You must have a period of six full months clear of any traffic violations before you are eligible for an unrestricted license.If you have not successfully completed a driver’s education program, then you must keep the intermediate license for one full year before moving to unrestricted status.
 After you have used your intermediate license for six months (or a year if you did not complete a driver’s education program), you automatically obtain unrestricted status. You do not need to submit a new application or take any additional test. Unrestricted status allows you to drive at any time with any number of passengers in the car. Obviously, all regular rules of the road apply., Individuals who are over 18 years old may pass over the learner’s permit and intermediate stages and apply directly for an unrestricted license. To do so, you must present the required forms of identification (generally a passport and social security card), and pass the written test, vision test, and driving skills test.If you are applying directly for an unrestricted license, you should begin by obtaining a copy of the Oklahoma driver’s manual by downloading it online at https://www.dps.state.ok.us/dls/okdm.htmlor visiting an office of the Oklahoma Motor License Agency (known as Tag Agents).

 Manufacturing and marketing an invention can be an exciting and rewarding approach for some inventors but the process should be looked at more as a business venture, as it requires the inventor to have substantial capital and a well thought out plan on how to develop, manufacture and market their idea. Manufacturing is very different than finding a company to license the invention, and should not be jumped into without examining the risks and carefully planning the best route for success.
 But you also assume the various risks and costs associated, such as: research, engineering, tooling, molds, inventory, warehousing, freight expense, distribution, etc. You also assume the investment of your own time, which for many inventors who hold full-time jobs, is difficult.
 Other, more complex inventions may require far more investment. Minimum order requirements can also present inventors with a challenge, both financially and in terms of storage space. For the inventor who finds these aspects of manufacturing to be too costly, too difficult or too much of a hassle, seeking a licensing agreement could be a more suitable solution.

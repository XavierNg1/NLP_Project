 It's important to sign off at the right time so you leave your special someone wanting more. You shouldn't leave too soon, but should say goodbye while things are still interesting. Here's how to do it:


Wait for an interesting conversation to start wrapping up, and say you have to go. That way you can say one or two more things about the topic and then say goodbye. This will leave your crush wanting to talk to you more, and will help you avoid that long awkward pause that may happen after an hour of chatting when both of you are running out of things to say.
 If you want to play it cool, you shouldn't be too obvious about why you're leaving and make your crush think you are interesting and mysterious. Here's how to do it:


Casually say, "I'm going out now," so your crush wonders where you're going and who you're going with. Leave it ambiguous. This will also make it sound like you have lots of friends and an active social life.
Even if you have no reason to go, don't say so. Don't say, "Well, I guess I better stop chatting so much," or "Gotta go water my plants." This will make it sound like you have nothing exciting going on in your life.
 You don't have to be obvious about it, but you can let your crush know that you had fun chatting and that you're looking forward to talking again. Here's what you should say:


"It's been fun talking to you" or "thanks for the advice about..." Let him know that the conversation was meaningful without overdoing it.
"I'll talk to you soon." This will show that you are excited to talk to him again, but that you won't spend hours waiting around to see his screen name pop up again.
Don't be creepy. Avoid saying things like, "That was the best conversation I've had in my entire life" or "What time will you be on MSN again so we can chat more???"

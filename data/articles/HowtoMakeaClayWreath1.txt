, Then pound down flatter, to spread it into a circle shape.
 Using your fingers, mold the flattened piece into a perfect circular shape.
 Use a small round object to cut out a hole from the center, in much the same way as cutting a cookie. Measure the object first to ensure there is plenty of wreath left.


Cutting objects could be made from a toothpaste tube lid, a drink bottle lid, a miniature round cookie cutter, etc. Whatever you use, make sure it is clean and won't transfer drink dye or sugary stickiness onto the clay.
 Shape a little bow from the clay or use a ribbon bow; whichever you find easiest or prefer. Use fresh clay to adhere the bow to the wreath.


Smooth the edges on the inner circle once you've removed the inner circle of clay. This will neaten the wreath.
 This will depend on the type of clay that you have used; follow the manufacturer's instructions.

If baking, do not add the ribbon bow until after the wreath is baked; it risks burning or curling up in the oven.
 Thread a ribbon or piece of yarn around what is the top of the clay wreath decoration and hang it on the tree. Alternatively, hang it on your dollhouse door.

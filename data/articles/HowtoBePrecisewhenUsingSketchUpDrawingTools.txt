;
, Then start to pull the rectangle up. Type in 3' or 36". If your default measurement is in inches, then you only need to type in 36:


3' or 36" and then press Enter.

This creates a rectangle with the dimensions of 6 X 4 X 3.
 You will be setting the radius of the circle. This circle's radius will be 6' (6 feet). It will also be 6" deep using the Push/pull tool:

6' and then Enter






6" and then Enter.
 Start to draw a polygon and then type in the number of sides that you wish it to have. To do that, once you start drawing the polygon, type in the number you want and 's':


8s and then Enter.
 While the line is still being drawn or still selected, type in the length that you want. 24' would bring about a line that was 24 feet (7.3Â m) long.


When creating a shape by attaching lines, be very careful that they are all on the same plane. When you close a surface and it doesn't automatically fill, that means that your surface is on multiple planes.

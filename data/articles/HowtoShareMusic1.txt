 MP3 is the most universally-supported music format, so it's best to convert to this if your music is in a different format. This will help ensure that your friends will be able to play the files.


If your music is in iTunes, you can use iTunes' MP3 encoder to create MP3 versions. Open the itunes Preferences window from the "Edit" (Windows) or "iTunes" (Mac) menu. Click the Import Settings... button and select "MP3 Encoder" in the dropdown menu. In the "Setting" dropdown menu, select "Higher Quality". Right-click on any of your songs and select "Create MP3 version" to convert the file to MP3. Click here for more details.
If your music is in WAV format, you can use Audacity (a free audio editing program) and the LAME encoder to create MP3 files. Open the WAV file in Audacity, select "Export Audio..." from the menu, choose "MP3" as the format, and then load the LAME encoder. Click here for more details.
 Uploading a bunch of individual tracks can make downloading each one a hassle, and it also makes it more obvious what you are sharing. You make things a lot easier for the people you're sharing with by creating a single ZIP file with all of the songs you want to share.


Collect all of the songs into a single folder, or into a single folder with multiple subfolders.
Right-click on the folder and select "Send to" â†’ "Compressed (zipped) folder" (Windows) or "Compress FolderName" (Mac).
If you want to create a ZIP file with a password, you can use the free 7-Zip utility.

 You may also want to set up a blog through WordPress or your own website, where you, or various employees, write about the company, its products or company culture. Set up all the accounts in your exact business name, or something very close to it, if they are not available.;
, The number 1 rule in social media is consistency. You cannot attract and maintain customer interaction if you do not update your status often with interesting content.


Appoint someone who knows the differences, strengths and weaknesses of all these social channels. For example, Twitter accounts should be text-based and conversation-oriented. Facebook is great for pictures and event marketing. LinkedIn content should be focused towards professionals, employment and press releases.
 More and more, companies are interacting with their customers on Facebook and Twitter, encouraging both problems and praise to be posted. Encourage customers to direct message the company accounts with customer service problems, questions, reviews and more, making sure your rep always responds in a timely, consistent manner.


Appoint someone who is talented at handling criticism. Most customers are savvy enough to know that there are always a few bad reviews in a mountain of good reviews, because mistakes are occasionally made. The mistake is not as important as how you react to it. Choose someone who can take criticism, offer a solution and turn it around to your advantage, rather than deleting the comment.
 Create a list of parameters in which they should feel comfortable to post, share and comment. Make sure they never post anything that is inappropriate or damages the company image.


If you do not feel your entire staff has either the Internet experience or a good grasp of using social media for business, invite individual employees to contribute. They may be paid for their time or they could be rewarded based on the popularity of their posts.

 Dark bronzer across the top of the breast will define your breast shape, while a lighter, slightly gold hue dusted between your breasts will create depth. Put on your bra before applying makeup. If possible, get completely dressed and protect clothing in the area where you'll be applying the makeup with some facial tissue or toilet paper.
 Use a powder puff to apply a light layer of self-tanner to the area below your collar bone and over your bust. Next, use a makeup applicator pad to apply a second layer of self-tanner directly to the collar bone, breast arch, and cleavage crevice. This layer will dye your skin darker in key areas creating the illusion of rounder, larger breasts. After blending harsh lines with a clean makeup brush, use a hair dryer set on cool to quickly set and dry the tanner. With the powder puff, draw crescent moons along the natural curve of each breast as you are blending the first layer of self-tanner.
After the second application, dab baby powder in the middle of your breasts to slow the darkening process.
 Professional tanning salons are now offering specialized contouring services. Using spray tanner, the spray tan artist will highlight your nature curves with lines of bronze, which create depth.

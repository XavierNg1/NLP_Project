 Make sure the volume is turned up and that the output is enabled on your music playback software. I know it's like asking "is it plugged in," but very often, it's something that simple that's the root of the problem.
 If they work on a totally different computer, that's another way to verify that there's nothing wrong with the speakers themselves. Time to check the drivers!

, From the Start menu, click Control Panel, then System and Security, and then under System, click Device Manager.
 If a sound card is listed, your drivers are present. If your audio device drivers are not present, try installing the appropriate drivers. There are a few ways to do this.


Use Windows Update. Run Windows Update and have it download and install recommended updates. Doing so can update system features and other software that might help to fix your sound problems.
 It will check for updates on all system and built-in sound card software.
 For example, if your device came with a disc, that might have the software you need. Run the installer, and it will install or update your sound card driver.



Get the latest version from the Internet. Go to your speaker manufacturer's website, locate the driver there. Look under Drivers, Downloads, or Supportâ€”that's where they usually hide those things. Download the latest version, and install it.
 Troubleshoot. If you still have problems after all that, check any other sound port on your computer. If there are front ports and back ports, try the one you don't normally use.


Also check the sound card connection inside the computer, and make sure it's secure. Look for the same thing you looked for inside the speakers: loose wires, cold solder joints, or anything that looks out of place.
 Good luck and happy listening!

 Babysitting is a classic way that preteens can make some extra money. Talk to your friends or your parents to see if they know someone that has younger kids that need looking after.


Have a family or friendly connection with the kids you want to look after is safer and often easier.
Always talk to the parents of the kids to settle on hourly rate and other rules you might need to know before you agree to babysit.
 Being a dog walker is another job you can do to make money. Like babysitting, talk to your friends and family to find dogs that need to be walked.
 Lawn and yard work always needs to be done. It is not necessarily an easy job, but your hard work can pay off with good money.In the fall, ask your parents and neighbors if they will pay you to rake and remove leaves.
In the winter, ask your parents and neighbors if they need snow removal services.
In the spring and summer, ask to weed gardens or mow lawns.
 Go to a local grocery store and ask if you can make some money by bagging groceries. Some stores may ask you to deliver groceries to elderly or recurrent customers.
 Like lawns and yards, houses need a lot of maintenance. You can make some quick cash by cleaning houses. Ask you friends and family if they will pay you to wash windows, sweep floors, wash down walls, do dishes, etc.,


For example, you may win money through specialty groups (like the agricultural group 4-H).
You may be able to win scholarships for college.

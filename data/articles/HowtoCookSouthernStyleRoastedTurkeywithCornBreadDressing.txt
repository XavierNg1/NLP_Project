;
, Rub a stick of butter on the turkey, all over it. Add a sprinkle of salt, a sprinkle of pepper, and a sprinkle of poultry seasoning. Leave these ingredients out on the counter because you will need them again. Set aside the turkey.
 You will need:


1 cup white cornmeal
1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup shortening (plus more for cooking)
1/2 cup milk.
 Mix until crumbly in texture. Pour in the milk.


If this mixture seems to be too thick, add 1/2 cup of water.
, If made correctly, you will see it sizzle.
 To test that it's done, take a toothpick and place it in the center of the corn bread once it looks brown. If the toothpick is wet, leave the corn bread in the oven a little longer, checking again with the toothpick shortly.
 Use:


1 can of poultry seasoning
1 can thyme
1 can sage
Salt
Pepper
Bay leaves.
, Cut them up finely. Once that is done, add in the corn bread, mix well together––there should be no lumps. Use your hands if you have to to feel for the lumps, making sure that there is plenty of juice from the gizzards.
, Sprinkle each seasoning once, stir the mixer and add the seasoning again. Crumble the bay leaves––do not add them whole.
, Once you see that the turkey is starting to cook, take it out; there will be a little blood from the turkey, so remove that with a spoon. Replace it with the corn bread dressing. 

,  If there is any dressing left over, place in a pan and cook it on the side.

 Besides being a good thing to do, sponsorship can expose you to new audiences and new leads. If your company has the budget to be a title sponsor or cosponsor, it should consider sponsoring local organizations. It might be a dance company, baseball team, or youth mentorship program. These types of sponsorships often give you access to local business and civic leaders that can provide leads.
 Don’t forget “traditional” or offline media. You can place ads in your local newspapers or on radio stations or billboards. These ads should direct people to either call or visit your Web site. You can usually get more leads if you offer a discount or special offer, or a particular discount when someone mentions the ad.
 Direct mail still works for a variety of businesses. You can purchase a mailing list that fits certain specifications, such as neighborhood or income level, and send your mailing to these people. Be sure to target demographics that fit your product. The more targeted your mailing is, the greater likelihood you will receive interested leads.

 Avoid letting your parents be home bound as long as possible. Regular social activity can improve their mood, avoiding depression.
 Your disabled parent may no longer be able to cook, so a homemade or restaurant meal may improve their quality of life. If your parents are seniors, you can also research community meals at the local Elk's Club, Senior Citizens Center or other clubs.
 If your parent can still live somewhat independently, they may be able to take up residence in a community environment. Assisted living facilities provide a space where people of similar age and health can eat, talk and do activities on a daily basis.

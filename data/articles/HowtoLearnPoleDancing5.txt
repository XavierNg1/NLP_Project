 This is the perfect standing transitional move between any spinning or climbing moves. To do the body wave, just stand facing the pole and grab it with your dominant hand. Your knees should be slightly bent and your feet should be positioned on either side of the pole, so that your torso is about a foot away from the pole and your feet are comfortably spread apart.


First, push your chest forward toward the pole, then push your hips back, and then push your shoulders back, and then push your hips forward again and repeat this movement. The body wave should look like one fluid motion instead of a series of moves.
 To do this sexy move, start by standing straight up with your back against the pole. Reach up behind your head to grab the pole with both hands. Then, gyrate your hips from side to side as you slide down the pole until you're crouching. As you do this, run your hands down the front of your body all the way to your knees.


Then, push your knees apart so that your legs are momentarily spread and then quickly pop back up into a standing position.
 For this type of gyrating movement, you should stand facing the pole with your feet on either side of it at a comfortable distance. Grip the pole with your dominant hand just below the height of your head. Then, gyrate your hips from side to side as you slide down the pole until you're crouching. Once you're crouching, push your hips back and raise your body up until your upper body uncurls into a standing position.

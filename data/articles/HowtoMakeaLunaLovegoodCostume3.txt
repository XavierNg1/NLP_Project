 Imitate Luna’s hair, which is described as dirty blonde, waist-length, and straggly. Style your hair or use a wig to achieve this look.


Get the wavy, straggly look that appears on Luna in the movies and the book illustrations by using a crimping or curling iron, then brushing out the hair for more subtle waves and volume.
Buy a long blonde wig, or use a temporary dye if your hair isn’t already blonde. Or simply do the styling for an approximate look.
 Carry a wand that Luna would use for spells. You can buy carved Harry Potter-style wands, or fashion your own simple one from a stick.


Make an easy wand by peeling the bark off of any stick, sanding down the surface, and coating it with wood varnish.If you don’t want to carry the wand in your hand, stick it behind your ear for safekeeping, a common quirky Luna trait.
 Make your own version of the magazine that Luna’s dad publishes, The Quibbler. You can sit and read it upside down, as Luna is doing the first time Harry meets her on the train to Hogwarts.


Adorn the magazine with photos and stories of unusual magical beasts or plants, as that’s where the Lovegoods’ interests lie.
You can make your own full magazine with glossy paper and printed stories and photos, or simply wrap your own or a printable Quibbler cover design around an existing magazine.

 First, wait for it to cool down until it’s safe to handle. Then unscrew the top piece (the server) from its base (the boiler). Next, take the funnel out of the boiler and empty the grounds into the trash., Give the server, funnel, and boiler a thorough rinse both inside and out. Use your fingers or a clean, soapless sponge to rub away any visible residue that doesn’t wash away with the water. Do not use dish soap or scrub too vigorously, though.Dish soap will dull the pot’s shine over time. It will also leave behind a lot of soapy residue, which will require excessive rinsing in order to avoid a soapy aftertaste to your next batch of coffee, especially if the pot is made from aluminum.Dish soap and/or excessive scrubbing will also strip the insides of the coffee’s oils. These oils actually form a barrier that helps reduce the risk of corrosion from water.
 Give each piece a couple shakes to get rid of some of the water. Then wipe away as much excess as you can with a clean dishtowel. Next, use a fork or butter knife to remove the rubber gasket from the bottom of the server. Remove the funnel filter, too, so you can dry these two pieces individually, plus the bottom of the server., Place the pieces on a fresh towel or a drying rack. Leave until they have thoroughly dried. To ensure that no moisture collects (which can cause corrosion), store as is, in separate pieces, until next use, rather than put it back together again., If you use your pot on a daily basis, a quick rinse in hot water will suffice most of the time, since the coffee oil inside the pot protects it from corrosion. However, expect these oils to grow rancid over time. Give it a more thorough cleaning about once every week or two.

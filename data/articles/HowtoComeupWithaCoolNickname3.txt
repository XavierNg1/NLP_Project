 Pet names are a way to show your affection.Popular pet names for women include: gorgeous, beautiful, honey, angel, and princess.The top pet names for men include: babe, baby, honey, bear, and boo., While nicknames from your childhood can be embarrassing, especially ones your parents gave you, they can be cute and endearing if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend.Ask your significant other’s parents if they had a nickname when they were little. Use it the next time you see your boyfriend or girlfriend and see how they react.
 Create a nickname that you and your significant other use when you’re alone. You can use a standard nickname such as “Boo”, “Honey”, or “Babe”, or come up with your own.


Create a name based on what do you find most attractive in your significant other. For example, if your boyfriend is a good kisser, call him “Sweet Lips”, or if your girlfriend is pretty and kind, call her “Angel”.
 Many celebrity couples are known to their fans by their nicknames, such as “Brangelina” (Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt), “Kimye” (Kim Kardashian and Kanye West), or the original “Bennifer” (Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck).Experiment writing down different combinations of your first and last names. Start using it when you are around friends so it sticks.

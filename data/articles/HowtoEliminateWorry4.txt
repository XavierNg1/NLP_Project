 Most people need seven hours of sleep a night. Since sleep deprivation can contribute to elevated stress levels, which leads to worry, it’s important to get enough sleep.


If you have trouble sleeping at night because of your worrying, speak to your doctor. Sleep aids may be needed to get your sleep back under control, and that may be enough to eliminate worry.
For those who want a natural sleep aid, consider taking melatonin.Speak to your doctor before taking it to make sure it's safe for you.
 The vitamins and nutrients you get from healthy foods can help reduce your blood pressure and improve brain functioning, which can help with stress. This can then lead you to worry less.
 Exercise reduces stress, so you don’t worry as much. When you are worrying, it can help to go for a run since it’s difficult to be physically active and worry. Vigorous activity can also release endorphins, which can calm you while giving you energy to get through the day.

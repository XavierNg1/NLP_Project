 This haircut If it’s not already straight, you may want to straighten it as well.


This haircut may not be suitable for people with fine or thin hair as it will remove quite a bit of weight from the bottom of your hair.
 Using a fine-toothed comb, divide your hair into two equal parts, using a mirror to ensure that the line down the center of your head is straight, and that the two halves are even.
 Tie the two halves of your hair into two separate ponytails (also known as pigtails). Ensure that they sit low on your head, behind and below your ears — close to where your hair meets your neck at the sides of your head.
 To tighten each pigtail, grab your hair a couple of inches below the ponytail holder/elastic band, and split it in half so that each hand holds one half. Then, gently pull the two halves away from one another so that the elastic band moves upwards, closer to the base of your head.
 When you've reached the desired length STOP!

, Do this for both sides. If you cut your hair straight across, it will look choppy; for a more natural look, hold the scissors at a 45-degree angle and cut upward into your hair.
 Once you’ve cut each pigtail, you’ll notice that your hair comes to a point at the back.


If you like the V-shape at the back of your hair, move on to the next step. If you don’t like it, you can remove the point by tying your hair into a single ponytail at the nape of your neck, and then clipping off the point., Trim your ends and snip any bits of hair that seem longer than the rest. When point-cutting into the ends, hold the scissors at a 45 degree angle to the hair.

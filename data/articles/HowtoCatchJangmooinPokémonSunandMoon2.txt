 Once you are almost done with Poni Canyon, you will see a small patch of grass near the trial site.


In this patch, you have a 5% chance to find a Jangmo-o.
 Your chances can be boosted by having a Pokémon with the move Sweet Scent in your party, or an ability that increases encounters with wild Pokémon.

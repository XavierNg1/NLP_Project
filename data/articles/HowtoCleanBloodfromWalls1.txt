 If possible, clean up a blood stain as soon as it occurs.;
, If the blood is still wet, use a cloth or paper towel to soak it up. If it is dry, see if you can gently scrape it from the wall, using a plastic putty knife or similar tool. Be careful, though, not to scrape the wall surface.Wet old stains gently with water., Begin by trying to clean the stain with water. If that doesn’t work, move on to detergent, and then to stronger cleaners or specially-designed stain products.


Use your own saliva to clean up your own blood.Test the effects of any cleaning product on an inconspicuous area before beginning to clean in earnest.
 Wear gloves and use a disinfectant. Be especially cautious when handling blood stains or spills of unknown origin. While getting ill from cleaning a blood stain, especially an old one, is very unlikely, it’s better to be safe.Use freshly diluted bleach or a disinfectant that is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar body and is labeled for use with potential blood-borne pathogens such as HIV, HBV, or HCV.
If the spill occurs in a public facility, such as a school, prison, or hospital, consult and follow the facility’s procedures for cleaning up bodily fluids.

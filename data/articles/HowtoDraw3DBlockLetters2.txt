 Begin by sketching a thick lettering of your word or name in the middle of your paper., On any space of your paper mark an “X” on the left or right-most upper part of your word on your paper. Then draw lines from letters of your word or name to the “X” mark. Remember also to draw the lines from the corners of the letter., Then after creating the lines, use them as a guide to create a thick dimension on the letter., Keep applying the steps, until you are able to finish each letter. In this case, the number “3” is the last letter or number to 3D. Remember also to carefully erase the lines once you’re finished with one letter to help you easily draw the effect., Outline your drawing with a black pen or marker and erase also your pencil marks to clean-up your drawing. Draw also a thick line on the contours of the word; use a pen with a large point., Use one color with a light and dark variation such as on the illustration purple and dark violet.

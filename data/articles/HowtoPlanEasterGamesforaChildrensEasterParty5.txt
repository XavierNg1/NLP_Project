For garden or yard hunts, if your garden or yard is not wet, slushy, muddy, or snowy, then you can forgo the plastic cover and put the treats out as they are, in their own packaging.
 Make sure you know how many you hid, and ensure that you have enough for each guest.
 Set a limit for how many they can have each, so that nobody is left out. Once you're sure all of the eggs or other treats have been collected, allow the kids to play with or eat their prizes!

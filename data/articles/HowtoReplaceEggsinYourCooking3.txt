 Baking soda and baking powder are different chemically, but work in much the same way (baking powder actually contains baking soda). Baking soda will react with acids in your recipe (like vinegar, buttermilk, cream of tartar) and release carbon dioxide, causing your baked goods to rise. Baking powder actually leavens twice--once when it becomes wet and a second time when it is heated.Substitute one egg with 1 Tbsp. vinegar plus 1 Tsp. baking soda, whisked together.Substitute one egg with 2 Tbsp. water plus 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil plus 1 Tsp. baking powder, whisked together.Baking soda will give your baked goods a warm, golden brown color. Baking powder will give you a lighter, fluffier product., Agar powder is also known as agar-agar, Kanten, Japanese isinglass, or Ceylon moss.Mix 1 Tbsp agar powder in 1 Tbsp water. This is equivalent to one egg white, so increase as necessary for the recipe.Whip the mixture, then let it chill in the fridge. Then whip it again and it will be ready to use.


Agar is vegan and can also be used to replace gelatin.
 A can of soda (12oz) is equivalent to adding three eggs to your recipe. This isn't exactly the healthiest egg alternative, but it will leaven your cake and can add an interesting flavor.

 Being comfortable can make your daily commute more relaxing and enjoyable. Examples of items you can bring with you are warm cups of coffee on cold weather days, snacks for extremely long commutes, and an extra, padded cushion for your car seat.;
, You can either read for pleasure, or read work-related documents to prepare yourself for your upcoming work day during morning commutes.


Choose a reading tool that works best for your commute style. For example, you can read books on your smartphone or e-reader if you lack room in your bag for physical books, or listen to audiobooks if you walk, or drive to and from work.
 You can either listen to your favorite music or radio programs, or listen to educational tools that teach you a foreign language or other topic of interest.
 This step can sometimes help prevent you from arriving to work disorganized or unprepared. For example, create a to-do list on your smartphone during morning commutes, then mentally prepare yourself for the gym or think about activities you can do with your family for when you arrive back home.
 Exercise is an ideal way to make the most of your commute because it keeps you healthy and helps contributes to a green environment. For example, walk or ride a bike to work, or take a longer or different route to the bus stop or subway.
 If you find that you lack time in your day to make or return phone calls, take advantage of your commute to follow up with professional contacts and family, given that your environment allows you to do so.


Verify the cell phone laws in your city or state before making phone calls if you drive to and from work. Some regions outlaw talking on cell phones while you drive, or require you to use hands-free devices.

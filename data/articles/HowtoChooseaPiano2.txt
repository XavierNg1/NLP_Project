 Be sure to find out whether or not they are registered dealers. You can simply call and ask to find out. Look for deals. Like car lots and department stores, piano dealers have sales and coupons too.


Ask about warranties. A good piano manufacturer will stand by their product and will offer a warranty. Warranties can help offset the costs for repairs., If you're just beginning your piano shopping experience, bring someone with you who can help you choose a piano with quality sound.


This is the ideal situation. They will be able to examine the quality of the piano. They can play them to make sure they are in working order. They can also make recommendations on the spot about types of pianos and the materials used in pianos.
 Doing so ensures both your peace of mind. Bottom line: Find a dealer you trust and who knows their products. You could be buying from someone with little or no in-depth understanding of pianos.


You may not be able to tell if a dealer is trustworthy, but you can ask questions to help avoid scams. Always ask:
How long have you owned your business?
What is your warranty policy?
Can you provide me with any testimonials?
Do you have your own repair shop?
What is your purchase and return policy?

, Sales associates take a commission of their sales. Remember that pianos are huge investments and take up a lot of space. Donâ€™t burden yourself in either department.



When you buy a new or used car, it is always a good idea to get a knowledgeable mechanic to inspect it. Pianos are no different. Sometimes, a specialist will recognize a problem that the salesperson failed to mention and you completely missed.

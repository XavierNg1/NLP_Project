 Although you might have been able to sign up with an Amazon account, if your account is older and you didn't have that option, you'll have to connect your Amazon account to your Goodreads account to continue with this option.


Hover over your account icon and click "My Settings".
Sign into your account if it asks you. Your settings are secure and private things that only you can manage and they want to make sure that it's you who's really trying to take this action.
Click the "Apps" tab.
Scroll down until you see the Amazon symbol and a link to connect your Amazon account to this Goodreads account.
Follow the normal sign-into Amazon routine as you would if signing into Amazon alone using your Amazon credentials and click "Sign in".
Follow this back to the Settings page and refresh your page if your browser doesn't refresh it for you.;
, Click the My Books tab from the top tab bar of any Goodreads page.
 You will come to a link that says add Amazon book purchases. You'll need to click this link to continue.
 It will take a few minutes to display these books, but it should turn up as many as you've used that you haven't added to any shelves yet, but that you've purchased from your purchase history of both paperback/hardcover as well as digital (Kindle) books.


Despite Audible being owned by Amazon, these purchases will not show up in this list, but with a few additional clicks to find the ASIN for the book or the paperback version of the book and clicking to find the Audible version from the list, Audible versions can be added to shelves rather easily too.
 You can decide to further move them around later or, from the get-go if you'd like to add them to another shelf, hover over the button and click the particular shelf you'd like to add them to.

 A drop or two of vanilla extract in a liter (quart) of reconstituted dry milk can greatly improve the flavor.
 Reconstituted dry milk contains just as much sugar as regular milk, but extra sweetness can hide unpleasant flavors. Stir a small spoonful into your glass, or make a pitcher of "dessert milk" by adding 30mL (2 tbsp) sugar in one liter (quart) of milk.


Chocolate syrup covers poor flavors even more.
 This may surprise you, but a small amount of salt can enhance other flavors without making your milk taste salty. Stir it in well and you may notice a sweeter taste to your milk.
 Peel a carrot, chop it into large pieces, and let it sit in a refrigerated jug of milk. Strain it out when you're ready to use the milk. This won't have a major effect, but it can improve the taste a little.

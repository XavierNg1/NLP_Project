 Ants build habitats around food sources. Periodically moving the feeder will keep a colony of ants from settling near the feeder. Every couple of weeks, move the feeder to a different location in your yard., Ants may be less likely to invade a feeder found in a shaded area. However, a completely shaded area will fail to attract hummingbirds. Look for an area that's partially shaded so hummingbirds can still access the feeder., If you have a fountain or other body of water in your yard, hang the feeder over that. This will prevent ants from crawling towards the feeder as ants will stay out of water.

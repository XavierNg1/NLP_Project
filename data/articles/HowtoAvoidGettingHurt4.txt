 Try to not think about the pain. Think of something else that will calm you down.
 Getting any part of the object's weight off your body will make it easier to get the rest off. Once the object is slightly off of you, pull yourself out as quick as possible. If your chest is under the object do whatever you can to get it off your chest so that you can breathe freely. A good ability to draw a full breath will make you stronger than if you're trying to move something heavy without being able to draw a deep breath.

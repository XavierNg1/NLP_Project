 You will want to investigate several websites before making a final choice because of the number of options that are out there.;
, This will determine how much measuring you will need to do before ordering the laptop skin. Most websites will ask you for the model of your laptop and will send you a precut laptop skin that will be close to the size of your computer.
 Figure out whether your computer is a Mac or a PC. Mac sizing is fairly uniform so you can measure diagonally across the top of your laptop with a tape measure and find the correct value to enter. PC sizing varies fairly widely, so you may have to order a size that is slightly larger than your laptop (measured length and width) and then cut it to size.
 The laptop skin should be shipped directly to you.
 Do not include any protrusions such as hinges in your measurements. You will only want to cover the flat space on the top of the laptop with the skin.
 When doing this, be sure to capture the parts of the pattern or picture that are most important to you inside the rectangle.
 These parts should not be needed when you are applying the laptop skin to your laptop.
 After cutting away the excess, you should be left with just the right amount of laptop skin to cover your laptop.

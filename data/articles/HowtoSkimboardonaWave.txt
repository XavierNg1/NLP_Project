 Foamies are designed for riding waves, lighter, but cost more. Woodies are wooden fiberglass boards which are predominantly made for sand skimming, but if you cannot get a foamie, they will suffice.;
, You want a beach where the waves break close to shore and has a steep bank down near the water.
 Stand about ten feet away from the water and be prepared to throw down your board.
 Do not flat out sprint because you will fall off when you get on the board if you are a beginner.
 Don't throw it away from you, throw it down so you will run on to it in stride. Run onto it with your back leg first, then your front foot. Do not "jump" onto the board because it will break the surface tension of the water, slow you down, and cause you to sink faster. Keep all of your weight on your back leg so you glide into the water, instead of plowing through it.
 If it has not started to break yet you have three options. Option one is to hit the wave straight on a perform and aerial trick. Option two is to perform a wrap or a barrel wrap. Option three is to turn to the left or right (depending on which way the wave is breaking) and come back to shore.

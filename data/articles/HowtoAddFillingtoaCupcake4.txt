 Preheat the oven to the temperature specified on your recipe. For most recipes, this will be around 350°F (177°C), but yours may be different. Next, insert cupcake liners into your cupcake pan.


This method is recommended for chocolate and jam fillings. It is not recommended for frosting, pudding, or cream fillings.
 You can make the cupcake batter from scratch, or you can use a boxed mix. Follow the directions on the recipe closely.
 You can do this using an ice cream scoop, a sauce ladle, or a tablespoon. Save the rest of the batter for later., Jam or jelly would work the best for this. You can also try melted chocolate. Whipped cream or frosting are not recommended, however, because they will melt.This amount is for standard-sized cupcakes. If you are making mini cupcakes, try ½ teaspoon instead.
 Add enough batter until they are about two-thirds to three-quarters of the way full. Do not over-fill the liners, or the cupcakes will overflow., Most cupcakes will be ready in about 20 minutes, but your recipe may be different. Read the directions, and bake the cupcakes according to that.
 Allow them to cool in the pan for about 5 minutes first, then take them out of the pan. Allow them to finish cooling on a wire rack before frosting them. You can frost the cupcakes with buttercream frosting, chocolate ganache, or glace icing.


Do not frost the cupcakes while they are still warm, or the frosting will melt.

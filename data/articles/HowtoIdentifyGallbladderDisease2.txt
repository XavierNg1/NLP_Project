 A few of the earlier symptoms of gallbladder disease include gas, burping, belching, heartburn, feeling bloated, constipation or indigestion. These signs can be easy to miss or diagnosed or dismissed as a less serious problem, but early intervention can be key.


These symptoms indicate that food is not digesting properly, a common occurrence with gallbladder disease.
There can also be "twinges" or pain that feels like gas or cramps in the mid-section.
 These symptoms may include persistent nausea, queasiness, constant fatigue and vomiting., Gallbladder problems can often manifest as pain in the upper abdomen that often (but not always) radiates to your right shoulder. This pain can either be constant or it can come and go, depending on the cause of the specific gallbladder problem.This pain may be worse after a meal that is high in fat., However, if these develop suddenly and don’t go away in a few days, they could be signs of an underlying problem, such as gallbladder malfunction.
 One of the clearest signs of a gallbladder problem is stools that are light or chalky in color stools.Lighter, loose stools may be the result of insufficient bile. You may also have darker than usual urine with no change in water consumption.


Some people experience diarrhea that may last up to three months or more and may have up to ten bowel movements per day.
 These generally occur with more advanced stages of gallbladder disease.Again, these are symptoms that are common with other diseases, but if you’ve had stomach problems and other indicators of gallbladder disease, a fever could be a bad sign that the disease is progressing.

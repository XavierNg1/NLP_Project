 Have an established routine and stick to it. Eat breakfast every morning to insure a great start to your day!;
, Make sure your bedroom is tidy, and you have a clean, distraction-free homework environment.
 Planners are crucial to be organized. Most schools give students a planner at the beginning of the school year. Not only should you use your planner to schedule assignment due dates, also schedule extracurricular activities, play-dates, family get-togethers, etc. Make sure you check your planner daily to take note to any up coming activities.
 There is a reason for homework. A student who does their homework assignments is always better off in class then the student who doesn't.
 You never know when your teacher might throw in a pop quiz. Act as if there is a quiz every day.

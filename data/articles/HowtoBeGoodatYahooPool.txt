 You will notice that if you click somewhere on that ball, the dot in the middle moved to where you clicked on the ball. You will notice that the shot you execute will act differently (depending on where you clicked). This is emulating the spin of the ball, which is very important to learn.;
, If you click on the bottom, this will make the cue ball spin backwards which is called "backspin". If you click on the right or left side of the ball, it will cause the ball to spin on the rail; where it spins depends on what side you shot, for example left: rolls left... Right: rolls right... etc.
 This is the power bar. Power is just as important as the English ball. Learning the power of shots is simply just practicing and experimenting. The way to do this is to go to a training table, and try all levels of power. Be sure to try different angles, and even set up some difficult positions with the balls at the training table.

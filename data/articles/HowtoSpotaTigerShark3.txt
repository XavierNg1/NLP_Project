 Take measures to avoid being attacked. As far as shark attacks on people, tiger sharks rank only behind the great white shark in frequency of attacks. And unlike the great white, tiger sharks don’t swim away after biting a human.However, tiger shark attacks are rare. For example, in Hawaii, there is only an average of one shark attack per year (and it’s not always a tiger shark).Get out of the water as soon as you spot a dorsal fin.


Be aware of your surroundings. Because tiger sharks will eat anything, make sure you aren’t swimming near small sea creatures or in lagoon-like areas of tropical water.
In the U.S., shark attacks are most frequent in the Daytona Beach area, along the Atlantic Coast.It is believed that most of these attacks are by blacktip and Blacknose sharks.There are only 111 recorded unprovoked tiger shark attacks worldwide in the last 400 years. Only 31 were fatal., Humans haven’t left tiger sharks alone. They are in fact considered big game. They are hunted for their skin, fins, meat, and livers, which contain high levels of vitamin A. However, they are considered a “near threatened” species.They take a long time to repopulate, so overfishing of tiger sharks will eventually lead to their extinction.
 It is rare, but you may be able to find an aquarium with a tiger shark. The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, took on a female tiger shark in 2009. Most aquariums are new to caring for tiger sharks, so they have to be very cautious.

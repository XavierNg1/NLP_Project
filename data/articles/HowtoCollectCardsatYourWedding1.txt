 If you choose to collect cards using a card box, make sure it is secure. Choose a card box that has a lock. The card box should have a single slit in the top. It should remain locked throughout your wedding festivities. Give the key to a family member or friend you trust, and arrange for this person to place the card box in a secure location after the event., If you are creating a box to collect cards at your wedding, consider matching it to your wedding theme. For example, if your theme echoes a royal British wedding, consider using a quaint British letter box. Or, if your wedding has a whimsical forest theme, decorate your card box with moss and tree branches.For example, try using a wedding-themed pi√±ata as a card collection box.
 Adding photographs to your card collection box is a great way to personalize what could otherwise be a bland, run of the mill secure white card box. You can place photos of you and your spouse on or around the box to add some personal flair.

 Make a text description available, as well as a redundant text link for any image maps.You also must include functional text to identify any information provided by a script.
Images, applets, plug-ins, and other embedded media with content or information also must have equivalent alternative text, such as by using the "alt" or "longdesc" attribute, or in element content.Any alternative text should be clear and succinct. To be Section 508 compliant, you should avoid writing alternative text that is too long and verbose, or so vague that the user can't tell what the image might be that the text is describing.For example, "Picture of the sun setting over Lake Michigan, with reflections shimmering on the surface of the lake and a sky awash with blues, pinks, yellows, and reds," while certainly descriptive, is too verbose. "Sunset over Lake Michigan" would suffice in that context.
Your "alt" text shouldn't repeat other text already on the page.Complex graphs and charts also should be accompanied by alternative text.If you have an image within a link or a button that has functionality, your alternative text also should describe that function.Screen readers often alter the tone or inflection of the reading voice based on the HTML tags, so keep this in mind when you are choosing layout elements., If you have video files or live audio broadcasts, these must have synchronized captions.Captioning may be either open (always visible) or closed (user can turn captions on or off).Videos also must have an audio description track for the visually impaired.Audio tracks without video must have transcripts for the hearing impaired.If you include audio or video content on your website, consider using standalone or pop-out media players instead of embedded media, as these players are more accessible., If your web page requires a plug-in or other application, you must display a link to a page where users can download it for full functionality.


All applets, scripts, and plug-ins and the content they provide must be accessible to assistive technologies. If they cannot be made accessible, you must include some alternative means of accessing the same content.Scripting should be made accessible by providing functional text that can be read using assistive technology. Your website does not meet Section 508 standards if it contains scripts that only work with a mouse.Include a link to a disability-accessible page where any plug-in can be downloaded, and where users can download a separate media player., If you use animation to convey information, you must display the same information in at least one other non-animated way that can be chosen by the user.Any images or elements that identify specific controls, functions, or programming elements should be consistent throughout the website.Minimizing graphics and images also can decrease reading time for disabled users. Keep in mind that if your users can't see the elements, they must wait for their screen reader to read through before they can make a selection from a menu., Section 508 requires easily identifiable row and column headers for data tables.Column and row headers in data tables must be appropriately identified.
Associate cells in data tables with the appropriate headers using "scope" or "id/headers" attributes.Tables created only for layout purposes don't need headers for rows or columns.

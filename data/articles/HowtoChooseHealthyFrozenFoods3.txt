 Frozen protein such as fish, which is high in omega-3 fatty acids is another healthy option for frozen meal planning. For example, you can buy fish that was frozen immediately after it was caught. This allows the fish to maintain its nutritional value and flavour.Frozen fish that has been fried or breaded is less healthy than fresh frozen fish.
Choose frozen fish that has a low mercury content. For example, choose salmon or tilapia.
 The frozen food aisle in a grocery store also contains a number of frozen dessert options. Frozen desserts can contain a few healthy options. For example, avoid selecting a large tub of ice cream that contains a lot of added sugars. Instead, look for low calorie frozen yogurts. You can also find popsicles made with real fruit or dairy-free sorbet.Look for single-serving desserts rather than big cartons of ice cream. Look for products with about 100 calories per serving, like small ice cream sandwiches or fruit popsicles.
 Frozen pizzas are a popular meal option and come in a wide variety of flavors. They also vary in health content. When you are shopping for a frozen pizza, look for a one with a thin, whole grain crust. You should avoid pizzas that contain extra cheese and always pay attention to the serving size on the food label when you are shopping.For example, a pizza that may look like a single serving may actually contain multiple servings.

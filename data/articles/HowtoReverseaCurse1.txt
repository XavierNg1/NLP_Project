 Unlike a physical attack, a curse is believed to be a psychic attack on a particular person. Negative energy is used to cause harm. If you know of someone who envies or dislikes you, or if you’ve angered someone recently, it’s possible that you might be a victim of a curse.


Have you been threatened directly by someone? Do you suspect the person might dabble in witchcraft?
Some people think there are many different kinds of curses in magic, but they consider all of them to have one thing in common – malicious intent.;
, In order to possibly reverse a curse, you need to know what signs to look for. Are you not sleeping well? When you do sleep, are you plagued by unusual nightmares? Have you recently found yourself in dangerous situations or narrowly avoiding a serious injury? Have plants and shrubbery around your home sickened and died? Has your pet been acting strange or ill? Are you experiencing any kind of sudden insect infestation? Have you experienced an inexplicable illness that you aren't recovering from?If you are dealing with three or more of these issues, a curse might be to blame.
You will probably have a gut feeling that something is very wrong.
 If you are only dealing with one or two of these signs, you probably aren’t being psychically attacked. If you haven’t angered someone recently, or if you can’t think of anyone who might be jealous of you or bear you some kind of ill will, consider the possibility that you aren’t cursed. Sometimes accidents happen and everyone experiences a run of bad luck now and then.Look for a reasonable explanation for these occurrences.
Attempt to address the symptoms you’re experiencing in normal ways.
Knowing that someone dislikes you isn’t reason enough to think you might be cursed.

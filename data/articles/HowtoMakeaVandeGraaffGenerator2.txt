 The axles of the rollers sit in notches or holes drilled in the tube, allowing the rollers to move freely.


One roller should be made of metal and one of polyethylene. When the generator is assembled, the metal roller will be inside the sphere and the polyethelene roller will be inside the base.
 The loop will hold the rollers in place.


Take care not to allow any oil from your hands to get on the dialectric material, or the generator may not function.
If you use rubber for the belt, make sure it isn't black, since this indicates that carbon is present in the rubber. Carbon will not allow electrons to be pulled from the belt, and the generator won't function.

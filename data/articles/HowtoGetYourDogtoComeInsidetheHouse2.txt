 You want your dog to be happy to come inside. To do this, you need to give positive reinforcement when they come inside. Give praise, pets, or a treat to let them know that they have done well. This also helps them see inside the house as something good and happy instead of scary or punishing.For example, when the dog enters the house, pet them and tell them, “Good dog!” in a happy voice.
 Your dog may not want to come inside the house if they do not feel comfortable there. You want to make sure that your dog has a place to sleep, toys, and things to do. Feed them inside, spend time with them, and make them part of your family. This will encourage them to want to be inside and think of it as a happy place.You should also make the house a comfortable temperature, make sure there aren’t loud noises that would scare the dog, and give your dog somewhere for them to go if there is too much noise or activity in a room.
 Don’t just always put your dog outside and leave them alone. Instead, spend some time with your dog when they are outside. Walk with them, chase them around the yard, play games with them, or play with toys. If your dog runs off, give them a treat and praise when they return to you.This helps your dog bond with you and want to be around you. Your dog will start to associate being called with getting a treat.

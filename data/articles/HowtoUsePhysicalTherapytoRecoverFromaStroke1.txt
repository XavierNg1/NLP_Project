 Your physical therapist will tell you specifically which exercises you should be focusing on. They will take notes from your doctor and create an individualized plan. Always consult your physical therapist before adding new exercises and stretches to your regimen., You do not want to begin your physical therapy too soon. Most doctors will have you starting between 24 and 48 hours after the stroke.You can ask your doctor when you will be able to begin.
 Sit up if you are able. This will help to remind your weakened muscles how to move. You can support your body by placing a foam wedge near the small of your back.If you are ready, you can, with assistance, try moving from your bed to your chair. Do not try this when you are alone.
 Passive movements are exercises where your therapist moves your limbs for you. You may be paralyzed after your stroke, or you may otherwise have difficulty moving. By guiding you through the movements, your physical therapist is helping you regain joint mobility.A common passive movement is arm rotation. Your therapist will gently move your arm in a circular motion.
Your physical therapist may also ask you to lie down so that they can stretch and bend your legs for you.
You should ask your therapist to teach family members or caretakers to help you with these passive movements so that they can help you even when you are discharged.
 If your arm was paralyzed by the stroke, wearing a sling on the healthy arm will force you to use the weak arm. This will strengthen the arm over time. Ask your physical therapist to fit you with a sling.

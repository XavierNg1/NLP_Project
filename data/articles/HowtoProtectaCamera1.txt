, Your basic camera setup should be contained in your bag, as well as extra batteries, lenses and other gear you will need.
 Multiple compartments can adapt to different conditions.
 Does it support your camera-toting style? Bags made of rip-stop nylon, canvas or leather are good if youâ€™re going to be hard on your camera bag.

 A top flap gives extra protection from bad weather conditions especially if you take photos outside.

 Although your beef cubes don't all need to have the same uniformity, it helps to try to be consistent. When cutting the beef chuck, remove any excess fat dangling from the outside of the cubes of meat.









What if you don't have beef chuck? Rump, bottom round, or topside cuts will all do. What you want to avoid is getting pre-cut beef "for stewing" at the grocery store or market.You'll end up paying more and getting a lower quality meat.;
, In batches, transfer the beef cubes into a medium bowl containing the flour. Work the beef cubes into the flour so that each cube has a thin layer of flour coating its outside. This will give the beef a nice nutty flavor and great texture. It will also help establish a tasty "fond" on the bottom of your cooking pot.








A fond is a sticky dark glaze that coats the bottom of the pan. It contributes to the rich, caramelized flavor that separates a merely good stew from a great one.
 First add 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil and the butter. Then, sear the beef in batches. Leave the beef on one side for 3 to 5 minutes, until it has developed great color and easily comes off the pan. Move it over to its side and brown on all sides.









When a batch is done, remove beef with a slotted spoon and add the next batch. Continue cooking in the same manner as directed above, until all beef has been adequately browned.

Do not clean the bowl after cooking the beef. You'll notice that your fond has started to develop. This fond will give your dish more of a full flavor, so don't make the mistake of removing it.

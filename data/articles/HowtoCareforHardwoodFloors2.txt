 Regular cleaning is the most effective thing you can do to keep your hardwood floors looking great and damage-free. Create a cleaning routine and stick to it. For best results, dust every day with a micro-fiber cloth. Vacuum biweekly with a soft-bristled floor-brush attachment. Damp-mop once per month with a hardwood floor cleaner.
 These finishes seal and protect the wood underneath and give your floor a glossy shine. Normal wear and tear will eventually leave visible scratches and make the surface dull. Polishing periodically with a buffing pad can renew and refresh its appearance by restoring shine, buffing away microscopic scratches and evening out the floor’s surface.


Check the manufacturer's recommendations for polishing products and follow the instructions exactly.
Never use wax on a floor with a urethane or other glossy finish.
 Use protective window coverings, such as curtains and blinds, to block UV rays and protect the wood from excessive heat. If left uncovered and exposed to direct sunlight, most wood types will gradually begin to age and fade. Rearrange rugs and furniture regularly so the wood’s appearance will age evenly.
 When routine cleaning no longer restores the floor’s shine, it's time to recoat the surface. How often you need to do this depends on the amount of foot traffic you have in your home. Unless you’ve done it before, you will probably need to contact a professional to refinish your floor’s surface.If your floor surface has deep scratches, visible gouges, discoloration and other significant damage, consider sanding your floor and then refinishing it. Unless you have experience, contact a professional for this.
You might have difficulty re-sanding a pre-finished floor. Many new pre-finished floors only have a small core of wood and can only be sanded once.

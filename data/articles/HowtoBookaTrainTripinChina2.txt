 There are two types of third-party travel companies: those aiming at local markets within China (such as Qunar and 114piaowu) and those that provide international services (such as Ctrip and China Highlights). For most international travelers, it might be much easier to take advantage of the latter ones. Search through searching engines in order to visit your chosen company's website.
 Since different travel companies have different booking procedures, this article will not cover detailed instructions. Simply go to your chosen website and follow its instructions (in the English version if you want) to book your train trip. Standard procedures include:


Create a login or an account in the website (optional for some companies).
Search for your train based on your travel plans.
Fill out passenger's information which normally includes name, gender, valid ID number, birthday and contact information.
Pay through a variety of payment options. One of the best things about booking through third party travel companies is that international payment methods such as Visa or MasterCard are accepted.

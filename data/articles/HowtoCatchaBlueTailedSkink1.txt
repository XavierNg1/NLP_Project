 Catching a blue tailed skink with your hands is very difficult, as skinks are quite fast and quickly shed their tails. If you have no other options or like a challenge, then you can try to catch one this way.


If you have trouble luring the skink out of its hiding place, then it will be difficult to use your hands. Try using a trap instead.;
, Any unscented, sturdy container will be fine for a temporary home. You can add local leaves and grasses, along with food and water. Blue-tailed skinks will eat spiders and other insects, but the easiest food to acquire is from crickets.


Although it is not recommended, you should do research on the most suitable home for this skink if you are preparing a permanent home. It may help to talk to employees at a local vivarium, which can be found online on in the yellow pages.
If you plan to keep the skink permanently, check the laws and permits for your area first.
 If you know where the skink lives stays around often, then move towards that area. If you can find a hole where the lizard comes out from, that is even better.
 Blue-tailed skinks are attracted to light. Set up a light and some bait (either crickets or meal worms) near the area where you think the skink is located., You do not want to scare it too early, so get yourself close to it slowly and without abrupt movements. You should come towards it from behind (or above, if possible) so that it is less likely to see you.
 Use your hand to quickly capture the lizard from above or behind. Make sure you try to catch it on its body, rather than its tail. If you try to catch the tail, it is very likely that the tail will simply fall off and the skink will escape.


Be careful not to squeeze too hard, or else you could injure the skink.
Keep your fingers away from the skinkâ€™s mouth. Although skinks are not poisonous, it can still hurt when they bite!

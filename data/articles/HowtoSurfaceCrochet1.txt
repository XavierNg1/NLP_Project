 Slide the tip of the hook into the spot where your surface design needs to start.


Insert the hook from the front of your work to the back of it.;
, Attach the yarn to the tip of the hook using a slip knot.


This slipknot must lie behind your work.
Note that you can skip the slipknot step, but using a slipknot adds security to the beginning stitch, so it is highly recommended.
 Bring the hook back through to the front of your work. The loop of the slipknot should be at the front of the work.


Both the tail and working side of the yarn should still be behind the work.
 Poke the tip of the hook into the next stitch, space, or row.


The right spot will depend on your design. If your design runs with the original stitches, you will need to insert the hook into the next stitch or space of the same row. If your design runs against your original stitches, you will need to insert the hook into the corresponding stitch or space of the adjacent row.
 Wrap the yarn around the tip of your hook from behind your work.
 Bring the hook and yarn-over back through to the front of your work, drawing up a loop in the process.


There should be two loops on your hook when you finish this step.
 Use the hooked portion of the hook to drag the top loop through the bottom loop.


Doing this should leave you with only one loop on your hook.
This completes one surface slip stitch.
 Make additional slip stitches across the original work as needed to complete the desired design.


Note that surface slip stitches can be used to create single line designs, parallel lines, and free-form shapes., When you reach the end of your design, cut the yarn from behind the work, leaving a tail roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook, still working along the back of the piece, to secure your surface slip stitches.


Weave the loose tail in along the back of your work.
This step completes the process and removes the last loop from your hook.

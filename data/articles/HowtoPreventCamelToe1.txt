Camel toe is caused by clothing that doesn’t fit properly.

Too-small swimming suit bottoms are especially prone to camel toe. Choose the right fit.;
, Camel toe can be a problem with stretchier fabrics, such as yoga pants that some people wear to work out.


Buy clothing, especially when choosing workout clothing, that has built in lining at the crotch. The extra layer is designed to reduce embarrassing problems like camel toe. Stay away from 100-percent Spandex clothing.Avoid linen and polyester fabrics, especially if it's warm out. These types of fabrics are more likely to cause camel toe.
 Black or darker fabrics are more likely to hide what some people call “crotch cleavage.”


The worst possible fabric for camel toe would be a thinner, unsupported polyester or yoga pant in a light color.
The problem with white or light beige fabrics, especially if they are non tailored yoga or otherwise stretchy pants, is that they leave almost nothing to the imagination.
 Choose thicker leggings that are matte enough so that you can’t see your underwear through them.


Whatever you do, don’t wear tights as leggings. They will be so see-through that you will have more problems than camel toe.Wear a long shirt or sweater over the leggings. No one really wants to look at your crotch area in leggings anyway. Try a tunic.

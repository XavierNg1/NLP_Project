Decide what breed of chicken you want. Choose a breed that is suitable for your lifestyle. When choosing the best starter breed it's best to go for a bantam breed as they are a small breed that are cheap, easy and requires less space and food than standard chickens.;
, Make sure that the cage is in a warm place (preferably indoors) and out of reach of predators.

Clean the cage daily and provide a bowl full of sand to prevent mites.
 Whilst you only need to feed your chick a little amount per day, it needs a constant fresh supply of water to keep it hydrated.
 Chick feed has smaller grains than normal chicken feed and gives a balanced diet which is required for your chick.
, Provide the cage with a run so your chicken can scratch about freely in the grass/dirt and get access to sunlight.

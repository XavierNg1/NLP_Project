 Get loosened up, excited, and ready for acting. You can also try tensing up every muscle in your body for 15 seconds. Don't forget your eyes, jaws, or toes. Then stop- this should leave you relaxed.
 Put your arms up, and stretch them as high as they will go. Like you're reaching for something, and you've almost got it.
 Go as low as you can, and try to touch your toes. Remain in that position for about five seconds.
 How you play, is to get you, and at least five other people, and sit in a circle. Now, you pick a player to start, the first player says three things. Two real, and one fake. Once they state their answers, the troupe is to guess which fact is the fake one. Then, you move on to the next player, and he does the same thing, and so on.


The trick is to act like all three are true, and have them get "stumped".

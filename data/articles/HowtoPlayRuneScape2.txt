 The next part is pretty self explanatory -- a bunch of instructions will appear on screen. They will tell you how to talk to Explorer Jack, go to your task list and pick some coins up off the ground. You should finish all of the introductory tasks on your task list if you have never played before, just to figure out how the game works. If you need help at any time during this process, click the task and then click the "hints" tab.

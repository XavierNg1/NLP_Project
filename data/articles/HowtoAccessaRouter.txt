 Each router's page will differ slightly, but you can usually find the following information on every router's page:


Settings - View your router's settings, from the password and the current connection strength to the type of security your connection uses.

SSID - Your network's name. This is the name that you and others see when connecting to the Wi-Fi.

Connected Devices - View a list of any devices connected to your network, as well as recently connected devices.

Parental Controls - Review your router's parental settings, such as time limits for devices or blocked sites.
 Editing the "SSID" field will change the name of the wireless network. Keep in mind that doing this will cause any connected devices to lose the connection, and you'll have to reconnect them to the newly-named network.

You'll usually have to open your router's Settings page to do this.

If you change the password, use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid basing your password on personal information (e.g., your date of birth).
 You will use this the next time you access the router. The default name and password for your router is very unsecure, as anyone that is connected to your network can easily enter the settings and compromise the security of your network.

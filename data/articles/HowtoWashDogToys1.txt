 Use a toothbrush to brush away any dirt, leaves, grass, or food particles. Getting the big pieces off is the first step before you try to disinfect the toy of any microbes or smaller bacteria., Fill the sink with hot water and add a squirt of liquid dish soap. Hold each toy under the running water and scrub it with a sponge or by hand. Be sure to wash away any food that may be stuck in stuff-able chew toys, and rub out grass stains, dirt stains and other noticeable imperfections.


You can also soak the dog toys in one part water and one part white vinegar if you are uncomfortable with the idea of your dog ingesting soap.It’s not a good idea to wash items like dog bones or pig ears that dogs eat.
 Lay them on a towel to air dry.
 Place the toys on the top rack of the dishwasher, and run the machine on a hot cycle, without any detergent.This method will use very hot water and strong water pressure to ensure the toys are sterilized. Allow soft and stuffed toys to air dry after the dishwasher cycle is complete.
 Washing dog toys frequently and keeping them germ-free is a good way to keep them in good shape. You don’t need to clean the toy every day or even every week, but a few times a month you should repeat this process. The dog toys will stay in better condition and your animal will be able to enjoy them for longer.

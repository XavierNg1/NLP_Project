 Right click (with the process explained in Method 1 above) the start button on your Windows taskbar. If the taskbar doesn't have a start button to get you to the Start screen, tap the far left-very bottom corner and hold there instead (you may have Windows 8 instead of Windows 8.1, and have chosen not to upgrade/update the device).
 If you've changed the Task manager to display all the different processes through the "More details" button recently), you may need to temporarily hide this by tapping "Fewer details" from the left corner and opening that later to make this process as less cumbersome as possible.



Single tap the app you'd like to close and tap "End task".
Right-click the app you'd like to close and click "End task" from the dialog box that displays.
 Expand the Task manager to the expanded-"More details" view, and look for comparative processes that may have opened without your knowledge. Look under "Background processes". But be careful, as closing some processes is harmful to your tablet/computer. If you don't understand what processes it was holding onto in the background, it's best to completely turn off or restart the computer (not just place it in Sleep mode, in hopes that that will do, but that won't) to avoid these things after following through with this process later.

 Eggs cook quickly, so it is best to select and cut up all of your ingredients prior to cooking. First gather the number of eggs you want to cook; most omelettes have 2-4. Next chop your filling into bite-sized pieces and shred some cheese.


Some common omelette additions include onions, ham, bell peppers, green onions, spinach, sausage, olives, diced tomatoes, carrots and mushrooms. Use any or all of the ingredients, in a combination of your choice.






You can use cheddar cheese, swiss cheese, goat cheese, feta or any other type you like.

, Crack the eggs one at a time into a bowl. After breaking the eggs, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly to prevent salmonella poisoning.
 You can either use a fork or wire whisk to beat the eggs. At this stage you can add salt, pepper, and other herbs and spices to the eggs as well.
 Heat some butter in the skillet over medium heat. Pour on the eggs, spreading them evenly with a spatula. Adding a splash of milk or water will help make the eggs a tad fluffy.
 While the eggs are firm on the bottom, but still slightly runny on top, sprinkle all of the fillings except for the cheese over the eggs. Continue cooking the omelette until the eggs bubble on top.
 Use a spatula to gently flip the omelette to the other side. Keep cooking for another minute or two, until the omelette is no longer runny.
 Sprinkle the cheese into the center of the omelette, then use the spatula to gently fold the omelette in half over the cheese. Roll your omelette onto a plate.

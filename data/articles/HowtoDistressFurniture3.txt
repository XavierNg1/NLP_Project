 Use a small chisel or nail and hammer to knock a few indentations here and there––don't overdo this or it will look bad; the addition of dents and chips also risks splitting the particleboard. If there are already scratches on the furniture, that's good, they'll enhance the character of the furniture piece.
 Sand over the laminate lightly.


Only sand gently and briefly over each portion of the furniture. There is a risk of the particleboard underneath shredding if you sand too deeply.
Wear a mask and safety goggles to protect your respiratory system and eyes while sanding.
 Dispose of responsibly.
 Do this in a well-ventilated, covered area. (Note: This step cannot be skipped; the primer serves as the agent that keeps the new paint stuck to the piece of furniture.)


Follow the spray can directions. This usually includes a good shake before starting. Don't spray too closely or you'll get splatter––unless, of course, that's the distressed look you're after!
Spray several times to coat well, each time spraying thinly.
Allow for drying time between coats.
 Sand off any paint drips that have accumulated. In general, accumulated paint does not add to the distressed look but simply appears sloppy. However, that's up to you.
 Usually non-wood paint works best but experiment and see––the primer will help many paint types stay in place.


Paint two layers for a complete finish.
 This part is tricky. You can't over-sand in case you shred the particle board. Use the 80 grit sanding paper again and lightly sand "patches" here and there to lighten the paint in partial spots on the furniture.
 A paste finishing wax or varnish will complete the distressing job. Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer.

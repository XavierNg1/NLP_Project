 One common mistake is confusing units of length (feet or meters) with units of area (square feet or square meters). These are different units, and have different conversion formulas. If you're ever confused about which one to use, remember this:


Length uses "one dimensional" units because it only has one measurement: put the ruler down once and you're done.
Area uses "two dimensional" units because you need to measure twice. For instance, a square has both length and width, and you need to multiply them together to find the area.
 If you have a length measurement in feet, you can only convert it to meters. (You cannot convert it to a square meter, which is a unit of area.) To convert between feet and meters, multiply the measurement in feet by 0.305.


For example, a snake that is 2 feet long is (2 ft) x (0.305 m / ft) = 0.61 meters long.
 To convert the other way around, multiply the length in meters by 3.28:


A 4 meter tall wall is (4 m) x (3.28 ft / m) = 13.12 ft. high.
 There aren't separate length and area conversions just to confuse you. Just as you multiply two length measurements to find the area of a square, you can multiply by the length conversion twice to turn it into an area conversion.Walk through it with this example:


Let's say you want to convert one square meter into square feet. You've forgotten this area conversion, but you remember the one for length: 1 meter = 0.305 feet.
Draw a square and label the length and width 1 meter each.
Since 1 meter = 0.305 ft, you can cross out both meter measurements and write "0.305 ft" instead.
To find the area of this square, multiply the length and width: 0.305 ft x 0.305 ft = 0.093 ft2.
Notice that this is the same as the area conversion: 1 square meter = 0.093 square feet.

 Preheat your grill and brush the rack clean. Spray the rack with cooking oil.









Clean your grill after preheating it and just before you start to cook. The heated grease and food remains should scrape right off., Use a paper towel or cloth to gently brush any dirt from your mushrooms. If you'd like, you can also give the mushrooms a quick rinse in cool water, but you don't have to.
 Remove the brown gills from the undersides of mushroom caps using a spoon, and discard gills. Remove stems; discard.
 Combine 1/2 teaspoon oil, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons soy sauce in a small bowl; brush over both sides of mushroom caps.
 Combine 2/3 cup chopped tomato, 1/2 cup shredded cheese, 1/2 teaspoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh or 1/8 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 crushed garlic clove in a small bowl.
 Place the mushroom caps, stem sides down, on grill rack coated with cooking spray, and grill for 5 minutes on each side or until soft.









Grill the mushrooms stem sides down first, so that when they're turned they'll be in the right position to be filled.
 Using metal tongs, gently flip your mushrooms over so the cap side is down. Spoon 1/4 cup tomato mixture into each mushroom cap. Cover and grill 3 minutes or until cheese is melted. Sprinkle with parsley.


Since the garlic doesnâ€™t really have time to cook, the mushrooms will have a strong garlic flavor. If you prefer, you can use less garlic or none at all.
If you want to plan ahead, remove the gills and stems from the mushrooms and combine the filling, then cover and chill until ready to grill.

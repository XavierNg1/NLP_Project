 Turn the watch over until the back of the watch face can be seen. The setting crown should be located on this back face.


Note that you may see two circles on the back of the watch. The smaller circle should be the setting crown. The larger circle will be the power cell and should not be handled during this procedure.
 Use your fingernail to lift the crown up and activate the setting mechanism.


You will need to keep your fingernail underneath the crown throughout the entire process. Do not release it yet.
Bulova models with a back crown usually have a sweep-style second hand. A sweep second hand will not stop once the crown has been lifted; instead, it will continue rotating recording the number of seconds that pass in real time.
 Turn the lifted crown in either direction until the hour and minute hands on the front of the watch face show the correct time.


For this style of Bulova watch, it doesn't matter whether you turn the hands clockwise or counter-clockwise.
You do not need to worry about fine-tuning the minute hand, either, since it should not jump ahead when you release the crown.
 After moving the watch hands to the correct positions, simply let go of the crown. It should click back into place, thereby setting the watch.


On some models, the crown may not click back into place automatically. In that case, gently push the crown into the back of the watch with your fingertip. The crown should click into place without any resistance.
After you complete this step, the watch should be set.

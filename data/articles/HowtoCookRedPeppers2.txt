 One of the easiest and most common ways to do this is in the oven. Roasted peppers are used in lots of different types of cuisine, so this is an important skill to learn. To roast peppers in the oven, you will need the following supplies and ingredients:Red bell peppers
A paper bag
A towel
A baking sheet
Aluminum foil
Oven

, Roasting peppers requires a high temperature. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Lay your peppers on the aluminum foil.
The peppers should be on their sides, with the stems pointing to the right.
 Allow the peppers to roast in the oven.


Allow the peppers to roast for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven.
Use tongs to turn the peppers over, 1/2 a turn.
Return the peppers to the oven and roast 20 minutes more.
 The skin should be charred and soft. The skins will be black in spots, and the peppers will be collapsed.
If the peppers don't look ready, roast them for another few minutes.
When they are done remove the baking sheet from the oven.
 You will need to do this so the skins come off easily. The skins will be mostly charred so you will need to remove them before you use them in a dish or eat them.Put the peppers in your paper bag.
Roll the top of the bag to seal it.
Allow the peppers to steam for 15 minutes before taking them out of the bag.
 You will need to do this before using them or eating them. This process can be slightly messy.Slice each pepper vertically and lay the pepper open so it becomes one long piece.
Pull the stem from the top of the pepper. This will come away easily with a clump of seeds.
Use a towel to wipe away any remaining seeds.
Flip the pepper over, skin side up. Peel off the charred skin. It should come away easily.
Some resources will tell you to run each pepper under cold water to remove the skin. This will allow the skin to come away very easily, but you will lose some flavor in this process.

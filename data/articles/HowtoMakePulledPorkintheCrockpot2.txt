 Place all of the spices in a small bowl and stir until combined.
 On a clean surface, sprinkle the spice mix evenly over the pork and massage into the meat with your fingers. Use a double layer of plastic wrap to firmly cover the meat. Leave it to sit in the refrigerator for as little as three hours, or as long as three days. The longer you leave the meat, the more flavor it will develop.
 Pour 1/4 cup of water over the meat, then add the liquid smoke, if using. Set the crockpot to a low heat and cook the pork for 8-10 hours, until the meat is tender enough to shred with a fork.
 Place the roast of pork on a cutting board. Then, using two forks, shred the meat, discarding any fat, bones or skin.
 Return the shredded meat to the crockpot and stir in a cup of barbecue sauce. Continue to cook on low for 30-60 minutes, until hot.
 Serve the pulled pork with hamburger buns or rolls, additional barbecue sauce and some homemade coleslaw.

 You won't need something that thumps so hard it rattles the windows, and has such good treble that it screams at the top of its lungs if you have a bookshelf setup in mind. For you speakers, use something small, no bigger than 4 inches (10.2Â cm).
 Only have one speaker in each box.
 If you want to, you can skip this step. A subwoofer isn't necessary for a personal stereo. If you do choose to get one, however, try a 6 inch, or maybe even an 8 inch. Try something from BOSS, Alpine, or Sony.
 Put it against a wall, in the center of it specifically.

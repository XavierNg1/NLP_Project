 You may want to buy a GPS collar if you engage in outdoor activities frequently. For example, if you bring your dog camping, hiking, or to the beach with you frequently, the likelihood that your dog will get lost or wander off increases significantly. Consider buying a GPS collar if this applies to you and your dog.
 If you live in a space or area where your dog is limited, like an apartment, this can cause your dog to want to escape, or wander away from your area. Or, if your dog is an inside dog, it could accidentally escape and become lost if someone leaves the door open. Consider getting a GPS collar for your dog if this applies to you., Breeds that are prone to escape or run away are Labrador retrievers, Jack Russell terriers, German shepherds, spaniel breeds, Staffordshire bull terriers, border collies, boxers, pugs, poodles, and Chihuahuas. Consider getting a GPS collar for your dog if you have one of these breeds, and if your dog has tried to escape or run-off at least once.If your dog is one of these breeds, but is well-trained, then a GPS collar might not be necessary.

 If you are walking or trotting, let cantering and galloping horses travel on the outside track, closest to the fence. However, if they are jumping in the center of the arena, you should probably remain on the outside track if you are walking., If you are facing another rider head-on, you should pass such that your left shoulder is closest to their left shoulder. In other words, if you see an oncoming rider, go to your right side of that person.Someone may override this rule in the ring by calling, “Rail!” Be aware of this possibility and always keep an eye on your surroundings.
 If you need to pass a horse that’s travelling more slowly than you are, pass the horse on the inside. In other words, do not go between the fence and the other horse. Go to the left of the slower horse, closer to the middle of the ring. Be sure to communicate with the rider you’re passing by saying “On your left” or something similar, so that she knows where you are.
 Many horses could get spooked or upset if you yell at your horse, smack your horse loudly with the whip, or give wild hand gestures in an effort to get your horse to move. Be quiet and respectful when giving commands to your horse. Do not yell or make loud noises., Always be aware of your surroundings. If another rider falls off their horse, dismount immediately and hold your horse, trying to keep him calm. Know where the first aid kit is., You should be at least one horse length (but preferably two) away from any other horse at all times when you’re in the arena. Other horses can become upset if you pass too close to them. Horses can also kick pretty far out to the side and behind them. Keep a safe distance away from other horses while you’re in the arena., This applies especially in situations where you might be jumping or turning unexpectedly. If you are going to jump over a cross-rail in the arena, yell, “Red crossrail!” Be specific, loud, and clear. You can also say, “On your inside!” to a rider you’re passing.

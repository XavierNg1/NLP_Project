 Exercises can help slow or even halt the progression of your bunion, preventing the need to eventually get surgery.Try the following exercises every day, especially after removing your shoes:


Stretch your big toe. Use your fingers to pull your big toe into proper alignment with the rest of your toes.
Stretch the rest of your toes. Simply point them straight ahead for 10 seconds, then curl them under for 10 seconds. Repeat several times.
Flex your toes. Press your toes against the floor or a wall until they are bent back. Hold them for 10 seconds, then release. Repeat several times.
Grip with your toes. Practice picking up an article of clothing or a towel with your toes, dropping it, then picking it up again.;
, If you catch your bunion in the early stages, a bunion pad purchased at any pharmacy or drugstore may help to alleviate pain and direct your toe back to the proper direction. Shoe inserts may also help to realign your toes when you are wearing shoes.
 Your toes may adapt to the normal position after being taped for a week or two. Ask your doctor if you need assistance with this process.
 Exercising your feet and toes is well and good, but the intense pain bunions cause should also be addressed. Ease sore feet using the following methods:


Soak your feet in warm water.Prepare a bowl with warm water and allow your feet to soak for twenty minutes. The warmth will sooth your joints and temporarily alleviate the pain.
Try an ice pack. For particularly bad flare-ups, ice packs are a good choice. Fill a plastic bag with ice and wrap it in a thin towel. Apply the ice pack in twenty-minute increments several times a day.
Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, to relieve the pain.

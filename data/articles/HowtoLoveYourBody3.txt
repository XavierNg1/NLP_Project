 Although it may be scary and intimidating, ask your friends and loved ones what they think your best qualities are. This will help boost your confidence and remind you that your body has given you so many gifts. You will most likely be surprised at the wonderful things they see in you that you often miss. Here is a way you can ask:Start off by giving your friend or loved one a great compliment, and then ask, "What do you think is my best quality?"

, People develop the attitude and behaviors of the people who surround them. If you keep positive influences in your life, you will adopt those attitudes which will help you love yourself, inside and out. Look for people who are optimistic, work hard toward their goals, and respect themselves.
 Think about all of the people either directly in your life, or those who have accomplished amazing things that you admire. Those individuals are most likely renowned and respected for their accomplishments outside of their bodies. Use this to help you remember that your body does not stand in the way of your life or happiness. Your body can help you pursue all of your dreams and desires.


Think about your family members, close friends, or someone you have never met but always admired, and make a list of their best qualities. Then, ask yourself if their self-image or body made the list, or kept them from achieving their accomplishments.

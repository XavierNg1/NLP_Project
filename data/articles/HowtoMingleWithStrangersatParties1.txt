 Select a party-goer and approach them. Tell them who you are. You might, for instance, say, “Hi, I’m Mike,” then shake hands with them. Ensure your handshake is neither too limp nor too hard., If you’re attending an office party, you might say, “I work in accounting.” If you’re attending a party with a friend, you could say, “I came with my friend Maven and I don’t know anyone else here.”, You don’t always have to mingle with strangers at parties alone. If you are attending the party as a guest, rely on the person you are attending with to introduce you to others. For instance, when you and your escort arrive at the party and they start mingling with people they know, they should say, "Allow me to introduce my friend, Reginald."

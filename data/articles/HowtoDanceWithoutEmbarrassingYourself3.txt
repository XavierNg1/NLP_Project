 To get over your dancing jitters, practice your moves by yourself in a space that is free of any judgement. This way you will be able to fully commit to your movements and will begin to gain confidence in your dancing abilities. Make sure to always practice dancing with music playing.


Close yourself in your bedroom and clear a space so that you can dance freely without bumping into anything.
If you are worried about someone walking in while you are practicing, choose a time when you are home alone.
 You donâ€™t want your movement to be restricted by a tight skirt or pants. You are also likely to work yourself into a sweat, so avoid clothing that will leave you feeling hot or constrained. Instead, choose comfortable and flowing clothing that will not impact your ability to let loose., Dancing in front of a mirror allows you to see how you look while dancing. You may feel embarrassed to dance, but after watching yourself in a mirror realize that you are not as bad as you expected. Alternatively, you may find that some of your movements look awkward and you can work on improving that aspect of your dancing.Using a mirror will allow you to pinpoint the area that needs to be improved in order to give you more confidence on the dance floor.
Use a full length mirror so that you can see your entire body.
Perform a variety of moves so that you can get an idea of what looks good.
 Once you have learned and practiced some basic dance moves and you are comfortable moving to the beat, you can play music and just experiment with different movements. Have fun and be yourself.

 Dragonese is the language that dragons use to speak to one another, so if you can learn to speak it too you'll be able to communicate with your dragon more easily. Here are some helpful words to get you started:



Hello: Howdidothere

Please: Pishyu

Thank you: Thankee

No: Nee-ah

Yes: Yessee/Ta/Yow

Delicious: Scrumlush

Disgusting: Doubly yuck-yuck

, Now that you have some basic vocabulary, you can start learning some command words and phrases that will help you to train your dragon.



Fly: Flip-flap

Sit: Parka di botti

Eat: Much-munch

Fire: Flicka-flame

Catch: Catcha

Scream: Yowlyshreekers

Sleep: Zip di peepers

Start: Gogo

That way: Vazza
And if you want to say don't do any of theses things, all you need to do is add the word "Na". For example, if you wanted to say "don't scream" in Dragonese, you would say "na yowlyshreekers"., Once you start to communicate with your dragon more and more, you will need to learn some useful everyday phrases to help you deal with your naughty dragon, such as the following:



Please do not poop in the house, thank you: Nee-ah crappa inna di hoosus, pishyu.

My mother doesn't like it when you bite her on the bottom: Mi mama no likeit yum-yum on di bum.

Would you be so kind as to spit out my friend, please? Pishyu keendlee gobba oot mi freeundlee?

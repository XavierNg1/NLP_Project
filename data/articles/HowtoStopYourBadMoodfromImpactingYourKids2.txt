 Talk to your kids about the stress and anxiety you are feeling. Let them know it doesn’t have anything to do with them. The way you explain your feelings will have to depend on your children’s ages.


One example of what to say to your children is, “Mommy is having a bad day, and because of that, I may not be as happy as I usually am. It’s not because of you, and I love you very much.” If your kids are older, you can explain in more detail, but the most important thing is to let them know your anxiety and anger isn’t directed towards them., If you act out on your children, or can’t seem to snap out of it, apologize to your children. Telling them you are sorry makes them feel better, and can prevent you from feeling guilt. Along with your apology, reassure them that it has nothing to do with them.


For instance, you could say, “I’m sorry. I am stressed out and upset because I have a lot going on right now. I’m not upset with you and I love you very much.”, Although it may sound counter-intuitive, especially if your children are the cause of your mood, spending time doing something fun with your kids could get rid of your negative mindset. First, however, explain to them why you are upset and what they can do differently. Then, go do something fun to get rid of the negative feelings everyone may be feeling.

 Anything that’s a little shorter than a pencil and not too wide should work. As long as it’s clean and sturdy, just about any material can be repurposed as a pencil holder. Take a look around for an empty, unused container such as a:


Coffee can
Mason jar
Tin can
Large yogurt cup
Pasta jar
Raisin canister;
, The sky’s the limit when it comes to decorating your container. Gather glue, paint, glitter, colorful paper, and any other supplies you have lying around and let your imagination go wild. Try things like:Painting the outside of your mason jar, coffee can, or other container.
Wrapping the container with washi tape or even decorative duct tape.
Brushing Mod Podge on the outside of the container, then wrapping it in decorative paper, ribbon, or yarn.
 If you want to give your pencil holder an entirely new look, you can cover it in a material that will completely cover the container. Look items that are slightly taller than your container. Apply hot glue to the outside of your container, then set them in place vertically around it. Good choices include:Twigs
Pencils
Popsicle sticks

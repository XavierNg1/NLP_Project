 Visit http://developer.skype.com/skype-uris to understand and create the way of mobile, web, and desktop apps initiating your Skype calls and chats. You can embed a particular HTML line using the format of Skype URI.



You can also visit this “Skype URI tutorial: Webpages” page at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn745883.
 Type your Skype username in the place of “User name” to link your Skype account. Now type “Call” or “Chat” to indicate how people will contact you via Skype.


For example:

<a href="skype:username?call">Call</a>
<a href="skype:username?chat">Chat</a>



, To paste the URI, first enable your web page’s HTML page editor then select the location for the URI and paste it there.
 Click on the “Save” button to activate the Skype URI on your web page.

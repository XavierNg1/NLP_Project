 You will need several different hard liquors (not liqueurs) for this recipe: silver tequila, vodka, gin, light rum, and pure grain alcohol. You only need a half ounce, or 15 ml, of each liquor to make this recipe for two shots.


Typically this version of the shot is not chilled. However, if you want it cold, fill the cocktail shaker halfway with ice.
For the pure grain alcohol, a popular and easy-to-find brand is Everclear®.
Most variations of the liquid cocaine shot include Jagermeister or a flavored schnapps, making this "hard" version unique.
This shot is VERY potent. DO NOT drive home if you drink this shot!

, Pour the half ounces of silver tequila, vodka, gin, light rum, and pure grain alcohol over the ice (if desired).
 While these liquors are in the shaker with the optional ice, shake it vigorously for a few seconds. This will thoroughly combine the liquors before consuming.
 Pour this drink from the cocktail shaker into two shot glasses, straining out the ice. Each person should drink the shot all at once.


If you don’t want to chill this shot, skip the cocktail shaker and pour each ½ ounce directly into the shot glass.
You really do want to drink this shot all at once. This is a very strong shot, so taking your time makes it progressively more difficult to swallow (unless you are accustomed to drinking these types of liquor).

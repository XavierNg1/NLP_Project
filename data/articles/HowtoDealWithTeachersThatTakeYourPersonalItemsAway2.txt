 Read through your school’s student handbook if you’re curious about what you’re allowed to bring to have at school. Knowing the rules will also help you deal with a teacher that has threatened to take something away from you.


Stated most simply: the easiest way to avoid having a teacher take your things away is to avoid breaking the rules that may cause them to do so!

, In the event a teacher may have done or threatened something without your breaking any rules, point out that you haven’t broken any rules. This will only work if you know the rules.Alternatively, if you broke a minor rule that does not warrant they take your item, you can calmly point this out and say something like, “I’m sorry for the distraction, I’ll put this away right now and it won’t be an issue again.”
If you refuse to give up a possession, know that your teacher cannot forcibly take anything from you. However, refusal to turn in an item with which you were breaking a rule may lead to further punishment down the line.
 You must obey the rules when you’re at school. A teacher must also enforce the school’s rules. However, if a teacher ever does anything that you believe they may not be allowed to do, tell someone right away.Your teacher’s actions must also follow the school’s rules, and must be based on safety and education.
A teacher can never use force against you or another student.
A teacher cannot break any of your possessions.
If a school official does not respond to your claims, ask to call a parent or guardian immediately.
If the school does not allow you to make a call, tell an adult you trust – whether another teacher or a parent or guardian – everything that occurred as soon as possible.
Talk to an older sibling or an adult family member if you’re unsure about how something that happened and don’t know whether you should tell others.

 The book will get wet, so it won't be useful afterward. If you don't have a spare book, check out the thrift store copies.;
, Cut out the middle of the book's pages to make a hollow space. Cut a rectangle shape, as shown in the images.
 Cut out a piece of foam or layers of cardboard to fit the area cut out of the book. Fit this item to the empty area in the book (not needed unless book is or will be completely soaked through).
 Clamp the pages down with a portable clamp, hand clamp, or potato chip clip.
 Submerge half the book in melted wax or glue for 15 seconds or more.


Take care to avoid applying too much melted wax or glue. This can make the book heavy and it won't float. A thin layer is sufficient.
 Set the non-dipped half of the book down on a dry, clean surface, and let dry.
 Submerge the other half of the book, and let dry.
 It should sit atop the water, buoyant and flat.


If it does not float, too much glue has been applied (see above).
 You can now use the item to trick a friend or to be a prop in your next online video hit.

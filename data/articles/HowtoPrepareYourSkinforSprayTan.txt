This is perhaps one of the most important first steps when it comes to preparing your skin for a spray tan. Dry, rough patches of skin tend to attract and hold more color than skin which is smooth and soft. Failing to exfoliate before spray tanning can result, therefore, in blotchy patches of dye on your elbows, knees, and other rough areas.
Use a loofah or other type of exfoliating tool to scrub your entire body. A body scrub with sea salt or other exfoliating products also provides the optimum results.;

While excessive body hair will not impair the ability of the spray tan to stick to your skin, shaving soon after receiving a spray tan can be detrimental. In fact, shaving soon after this procedure often results in the color flaking off from your skin. As spray tans can be quite expensive, most individuals who receive them want to ensure their longevity.
Avoid lotions, creams, deodorant, or other personal hygiene items that could interfere with the spray tan adhering to the skin.
Many women and men enjoy applying lotion or moisturizer to their face and body to ensure soft, supple skin. To ensure the best results during a spray tan, refrain from using skin lotions and moisturizers until after having the spray tan done as these lotions often block the spray tan from sticking to your skin. The same applies to products like antiperspirant, deodorant, make-up, perfume, or powder as they too can block the adherence of the spray tan to your skin, resulting in blotchy coloration.



The spray tanning solution is likely to remain damp for awhile after you exit the tanning booth. While some individuals would prefer to remain in the nude until the solution dries completely, this is not an option for all. To prevent the solution from rubbing off onto your clothing, bring a selection of T-shirts and pants which are as loose as possible. In addition, as some brands of spray tan can stain clothing, consider bringing clothing which is black or another dark color.

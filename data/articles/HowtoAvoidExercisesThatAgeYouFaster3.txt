 When you strength train, use weights that are heavy enough to create some resistance, but not so heavy that you can barely lift them.


Choose a weight that you can safely control and lift.
You should try to do six to eight reps with the weight because this will cause less wear and tear on your joints. The last few reps should be a bit difficult, but not impossible or unsafe.
 After workouts, make sure you give your body and muscles plenty of time to recover. As you get older, it takes longer for muscles to recover after a workout.If you are still sore, tired, and feel achy, you should rest another day before working out again.
Remember to leave at least one day per week for rest.
 Everyone is strapped for time. Maybe you only have 20 minutes to work out or you make it to class late. However, that is not a reason to skip your warm up. Skipping a warm up may cause your body harm. You should warm up and cool down before and after every workout.Failure to warm up can lead to injury to cold or unprepared muscles.
Skipping the warm up might also cause your bodyâ€™s recovery process to slow down.
You should do five to 10 minutes of light cardio or lifting to warm up before each workout.

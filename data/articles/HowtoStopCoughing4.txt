 Heat about 200 ml (1 cup) of full cream milk.


Add one flat tablespoon (15 grams) honey and about one good teaspoon (5 grams) of butter or margarine. Stir once initially.
 This forms a yellow layer on the top.


The yellow layer is fine--don't feel the need to stir it up again.
 Allow to slightly cool before giving to children.
 Make sure you drink the yellow part, too.
 It should stop or lessen significantly within an hour of drinking this mixture.


This coats the throat, numbing it. Note that the cold or flu (the cause of the cough) will not go away.
 A cold body is more prone to illness.


And if you have dry coughs, drink lots of water!

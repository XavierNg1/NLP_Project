 You'll need a hoop that is big enough for your fish to easily swim through. For smaller fish, using a larger hoop earring or bracelet could work as a hoop. If you want a larger hoop, you can typically make one out of pipe cleaner.


Make sure to wash the hoop so that it doesn't bring any harmful bacteria or substances into your fish tank.
Attach your hoop to a strong or pole if you're uncomfortable putting your hand in your fish tank.
Start with a larger hoop to make it easier for your fish to swim through.
 Your hoop should be perpendicular to the side of the aquarium and near the glass, as this will make it easier for you to direct your fish to swim through it. Your fish may be interested in the hoop right away, or it will simply ignore the hoop.
 Teaching your fish to follow your finger will come in handy for this trick. Simply move your finger across the glass of the fish tank so that your fish follows it. Run your finger along the glass where the hoop is, and your fish should swim right through it. This may take a couple tries, but your fish should start to catch on.
 This will help teach your fish that swimming through hoops will result in being fed. Practice this trick with your fish daily so that it becomes a regular trick.


Once your fish has mastered swimming through large hoops, decrease the size of the hoop to make the trick more challenging.
Begin adding additional hoops for your fish to swim through for a more impressive trick.For more detailed instructions and tips on how how to teach your fish to swim through hoops, check out Teach Your Betta Fish to Swim Through a Hoop.

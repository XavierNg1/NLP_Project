 Mix 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of salt into 1/2 cup (125 ml) of white vinegar, stirring until combined. Add enough flour to form a paste.
 Focus on areas covered with tarnish, since the paste is designed to remove tarnish and not to remove ordinary, everyday dirt. Let rest for 10 minutes.
 Plug your sink drain and run tap water over the jewelry. Make sure that all traces of the paste are removed.
 If necessary, allow the jewelry to air dry to remove moisture from interior crevices.

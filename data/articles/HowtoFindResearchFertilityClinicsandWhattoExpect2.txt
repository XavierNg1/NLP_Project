 When you decide to become parents with fertility treatment, there are many complicated issues to consider besides choosing a fertility clinic. You can hope to be an informed patient by asking questions of the clinic staff who are there to help you.
 This may include personal information, financial information, and a complete medical history for both sides of the family.
 As with any medical procedure, you and your partner are required to give consent to the treatment procedure prior to the treatment and in writing. The clinic staff might ask you to fill out forms that are a legal requirement to protect you and your child as well as the the egg donation clinic in case a problem arises in the future.
 Usually fertility treatment procedures involve additional tests besides those already carried out by your general practitioner. There may be several tests carried out for each partner before a treatment plan can be formulated and actually begin.


For women, typical testing includes:

laparoscopic
ultrasound
hormone profiling
follicle tracking
hysteroscopy
additional specialized tests (if indicated)


For men, the usual standards are a semen analysis and sperm antibody test, though other tests may be needed.
There will likely be screenings of each individual which may include:

HIV 1&2
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis C
Malaria and other medical conditions called out when examining their medical histories.


Fertility clinics will usually be equipped to conduct most tests that are required to profile the candidates for fertility treatment.

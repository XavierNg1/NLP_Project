 You won’t know if he wants you after the break up if you are not communicating. Wait until the tensions and emotions have leveled out. You can begin talking to him many different ways.Call, text, or reach out to him on social media.
Start the conversation by saying, “Hey! It’s been awhile since we have talked. What is new in your life?”

, After you have been talking for a while suggest that you meet for coffee or lunch. Keep these meetings brief at first. Your goal is to reminisce on good times that you had together and leave him with feeling like he wants to see you more. As time progresses, you can start to introduce lengthier dates.You should make your interest in getting back together clear in person.
Say something like, “I have been thinking about our separation a lot lately. I really miss our relationship and think that we might be able to make it work again.”

, Since you have already reflected on your role in the breakup, you will have a good understanding of anything that you did to contribute to the decline of your relationship. Own up to your mistakes and apologize for them.Make yourself a little vulnerable. Say, “I’m sorry for not truly listening to you when you were trying to talk to me about our relationship.”

, Be sure that you understand what you want out of a relationship now and in the future, then listen to what he wants. Communicate those desires clearly if you start to talk about getting back together. If you do end up getting back together, you want your boyfriend to have a clear picture of your needs so that you are both on the same page. Additionally, you need to make sure that you can meet his needs., If he makes it clear that he is not interested in talking or being friendly, respect that. Acting desperate and needy is not attractive to most men. Give him more time to sort through his feelings about your separation.

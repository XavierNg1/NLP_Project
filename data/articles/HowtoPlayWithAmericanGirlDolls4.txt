 If you don't have time to go to the real mall, get all of your American Girl clothing and set it out on boxes and have your dolls buy stuff.


Create a mall scene from shoe boxes, or similar boxes. Improvise and use other toys to be stock in the shops at the mall. Include a place to sit down and chat, eat and people watch.
 Do the doll's hair and makeup. Try different hairstyles or add a pretty ribbon or clip to their hair. If you have a curly haired doll, put her hair into pigtails or a ponytail to stop her hair from catching on things.


Only use AG doll makeup. Do not use real makeup on the doll or this can ruin it permanently. Get the Beauty Care Package from the American Girl Store.
Don't use real nail polish on the doll; it's very unlikely you'll be able to get it off again.
Use only AG doll hair brushes. This will keep their hair in good shape.
If you play hair salon, keep water (or any liquid) well away from her eyes.

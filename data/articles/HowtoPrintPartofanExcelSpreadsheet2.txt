 Double-click the worksheet or go to “File > Open” in Excel.
 Click and hold the first cell in the range and drag the cursor until you've highlighted all the cells that you want to print.
 This tab is located in the top menu bar, a few options to the right of the “File” menu. Here you can access a number of settings to format your spreadsheet. Among these options is “Print Area”.
 Press “Print Area” and select “Set Print Area” from the dropdown. The highlighted cells will be designated to the print area. This area will be saved for future printing and you can continue to work.


The “Orientation” button switches between landscape and portrait orientation.
The “Margins” button adjusts the margins on a printed page.
“Scale to Fit” chooses how many pages you want to fit your printed content into.
You can clear, overwrite or add to the print area from the same dropdown menu.
 The menu is in the top left corner of your screen and brings up “Print Settings”.
 In the dropdown menu under the printer device, make sure “Print Active Sheet(s)” is selected and that the “Ignore Print Area” checkbox is NOT selected.


Note that “Print the selection” means that any newly highlighted selection overrides your designated print area.
 The button is located at the top of the menu, and the page will print with your print area and page layout adjustments.

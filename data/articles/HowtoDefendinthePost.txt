 Defenders can get away with a lot of contact in the post.;
, If you are playing street basketball, there is no three second rule, but there are also no off the ball fouls and most street players think it is okay to push the offensive player out of the key.
 In other words, do not stand between your opponent and the basket when he does not have the ball. This way he cannot back you down or give you a bump on the entry pass.
 Most offensive players have no idea how to make a good entry pass, so make them pay. You have to want the ball. If you see a weak or inaccurate pass, go for it. One other move is placing your arm between your opponents arm and torso, only one arm though to deflect the pass.
 Try to make him pass or go under the backboard and out of bounds.
 This makes it look like you are just holding your position and not really bumping him. If you get caught bumping him hard, you will get called for a foul. If he hits you hard enough, flopping can draw a charge or pushing foul. (impeding progress).
 Plant your feet and stand straight up with both hands up. Make it obvious to the official that you are in a legal defensive position. A good note is to keep your palms facing up. That way there is no possible way for you to be called for a foul.
 If you're in a league, foul him and calmly tell the ref to watch for it. If you're on the street, foul him hard. You can't call hooking, but you can let him know what you think of it.
 He's under the basket now, so he has to go straight up with the ball. He's also quite vulnerable since he's facing you now. The most effective defense against the drop step is a blocker from the weak side because usually the offensive player doesn't notice the help coming. Another option could be to get him to drop too low under the basket, you do run the risk of a pushing foul.

 Once you've chosen your desired flavour, place the Kool-Aid into the freezer for an hour or until frozen.
 Thaw out the Kool Aid for about 20-30 minutes, or until it forms a slushy-like consistency. Keep checking on the Kool Aid in the process of thawing.
 This will break up any chunks, to create the perfect slushy.
 You can keep the straw to drink, if you'd like. Grab a spoon to eat directly from the pouch, or tip the slushy into a bowl.
 This is great for hot days in the summer especially when you're looking for a quick way to cool down.

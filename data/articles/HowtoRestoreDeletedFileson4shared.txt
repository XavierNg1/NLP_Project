 Go to and press Enter. You’ll be taken to 4shared’s home page.;
, Click on the “Log In” button found at the upper right side of the page. Input your email address and password you use for 4shared then click the “Log In” button to proceed.
 4shared’s landing page is your main folder directory for your 4shared files. You can find all your folders and files stored in your 4shared account here.
 The link to the Recycle Bin folder is found on the left panel. It’s right under the folders under My 4shared. Click on it.
 The list of deleted files and folders will be displayed. You can see the filenames, sizes, and modification dates. Scroll through the list.
 Identify which files and folders you want to restore. Tick on the tick boxes beside the names to select them. They will be highlighted.
 Do this by clicking the “Restore” button on the header toolbar after selecting the files and/or folders.


If you’re just recovering a single file or folder, you can just click on the name instead of the “Restore” button on the header toolbar. No need to tick its tick box.
 A confirmation message will appear. Click the “Restore” button once again, and the selected files will be restored to their original locations within your 4shared folders.
 Go back to My 4shared by clicking on its link from the left panel. Navigate through your folders. You will be able to see the previously deleted files and folders restored to their original folders.


If you’ve restored a whole folder, all the contents that went with it when you deleted it will also be recovered.

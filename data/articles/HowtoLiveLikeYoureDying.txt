 Everybody has something they want to do with their lives before they pass on. Create a list of daring and exciting things that you'd like to do.;
, Spend time with family and friends, and basically have the time of your life.
 Forgive them or apologize. If you and a friend have a fight, Don't stay mad at them. You never know if they won't be there the next day. You have to treat them with respect and whatever fight you had, forget about it.
 Life is basically a huge party. Enjoy it and don't let anything bring you down.
 Just seeing their faces can brighten up your day, and they're the people who love you the most. Spend time with them!!

, Everybody has not done at least one thing that is extra ordinary. Go Zip-Lining or Jump out of an airplane. Be a little bit more daring.
 When you laugh, it brightens up your day. Nothing is better then a good laugh.
 You never know, Someone can be down one day and just saying "Hello," Can brighten it up. You might have even made a new friend.

 Beagles come in different colors, with the two most common being tri-color (black, white and brown) and lemon (tan and white). A beagle’s coat is primarily white with varying combinations of brown, black, tan, and red. However, the coat may include other colors and patterns if the dog is not a purebred beagle., Like other dogs in the hound family, beagles have large, floppy ears that usually end below their faces. These distinctive ears tend to be wide and cover much of the dog’s head. If the dog has pointy ears that sit on the top of their head, it is not a beagle or, at the least, not a purebred beagle., Beagles have a medium-sized tail that stands up above their back. In addition, their tale has a distinctive a white tip, which is an indication of a purebred beagle, even if it is just a few hairs. English hunters bred the white tip to help them recognize their dogs as they moved through tall grasses looking for game., Beagles are lean and compact dogs breed for hunting small game. They measure between 13 to 16 inches (33 to 41 centimeters) at the shoulder. In addition to their small stature, beagles tend to be trim dogs, with a healthy dog weighing between 20 and 25 pounds (9 to 11 kg).

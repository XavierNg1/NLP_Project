 A halo braid is essentially a braid that creates a loop from the bottom of your head, around your front hairline, to the other side of your head. To begin this fun look, you'll want to part your hair from your hairline down the center to the nape of your neck. Then, separate the two sides of the part., Start at the nape of your neck on the left side, and french braid upwards (which is an inverted braid), around your hairline, next to your ear, using all of your hair on the left side of your head., You'll continue to french braid along your hair line, reaching the hairline at the front of your head, and then french braiding along the right side of your head until you have reached the nape of your neck. Then, braid the rest of your hair into a regular braid and secure with an elastic., Taking the braid you just finished, loop it around your head and secure a few parts of the braid to the halo braid on your head. Then, tuck the end of your braid into the halo braid, making sure the ends and elastic aren't showing, and secure with a bobby pin, creating a full halo.

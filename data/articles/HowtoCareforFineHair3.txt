 Regular haircuts are especially important to those with fine hair because their hair is more prone to breakage and split ends. At minimum try to get a haircut every three months. Ideally, aim for a small trim every six to eight weeks weeks., If you have long hair, ask your hairdresser to give you a haircut with layers. Layering your hair makes it appear fuller and more voluminous. For women, short hairstyles like bobs are also very flattering for fine hair types because they make your hair less weighed down and flat. Ask your hairstylist what style would work best for you., If you have long hair, sleep with your hair in a bun or ponytail. All the tossing and turning that you do during the night can cause your hair to get tangled. Untangling your hair in the morning is not only a pain, but it can also damage fine and brittle strands. Before going to bed, brush your hair and put it up to save yourself the headache of untangling stubborn knots., Even if you sleep with your hair up, you may still wake up to find knots in your hair. One solution to this is buying satin pillowcases. Hair glides more easily against satin than it does against cotton, creating less friction and reducing the chance of knots.

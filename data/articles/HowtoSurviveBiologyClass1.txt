 In order to do your best in your biology class you will need to do all the reading you are assigned. This reading will expose you to new concepts, key ideas, and allow you to start asking questions and further your knowledge in regards to the subject of biology. Schedule time each day for reading the course's material.
Take notes as you read or highlight areas you feel are important.
Don't put the reading off till the last minute.;
, As you study, you will be exposed to a great deal of new information. The amount of information that you come across during your class can feel overwhelming at times. To avoid becoming overwhelmed focus on the big ideas and key concepts of the course.Getting a broad view of key concepts can help you recall more detailed information later.
 Although the idea of a perfect study space may vary from person to person, there are some areas that are more conducive to studying than others. When you are looking for or creating a good study area make sure it includes some of the following aspects:Try to avoid any noisy environments.
Remove any distractions from your study environment.
Having some light music playing in the background can help you retain information.
Avoid having the TV on or wearing headphones during a study session.
 Before you get too far into your biology class it can be helpful to discover what your learning style is. A learning style is a sensory method of acquiring information and everyone has one that they tend to learn best with. Once you know which style you learn best with you can focus your notes and study material into a way that fits that style.


Visual learners retain information best by video, written word or graphical representations.
Auditory learners can learn best from spoken word and instruction and can benefit from listening to light music while studying.
Kinesthetic learners would prefer a demonstration rather than an explanation and do well in group learning or study.

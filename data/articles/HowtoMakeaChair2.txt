 You'll need 5 yards (4.6Â m) of fabric (assuming the bolts are 45" wide) for this project, preferably something strong but soft. You'll also need filling for the bean bag. You can buy filling at many furniture stores or you can make your own from cut up foam or mattress filling. Then you'll need a sewing machine, thread, scissors, and a measuring tape. Paper or cardboard to make a pattern also helps.
 Make a pattern on paper or cardboard. You're going to be making twelve rounded triangles with a height of 30" and a base of 20". On a large piece of paper or cardboard, first mark a straight line that is 20" long. Then, find the halfway point and measure 30" from that point. Check that your line is perfectly perpendicular using math or a protractor. Hand draw a soft curve from the 30" point to one end of the 20" line. Get it to the shape you want and then fold along the center line and cut it out, following the curve you created.
 You should be able to get two of these triangles onto each yard of your fabric with a little room to spare (again, you will need 12 triangles). If you can, leave a half inch seam allowance around all of the edges. Cut out the fabric when you're ready. Remember: measure twice, cut once.
 Sew two triangles together along the bottom 20" side, with the right sides facing. Do this until you have six canoe-shaped panels. Then three of the panels together along the long sides so that a single piece of fabric is formed. Repeat this for the remaining three panels.
 Take these two pieces of fabric, pin them right sides together, and then sew all the way around, leaving a 6" gap to turn and fill the beanbag chair.
 Turn the fabric by pushing it through the hole, so that it is no longer inside out. You can now fill the bag by pouring your desired filling into the hole.


Do not overstuff the bag....it needs to be comfy!

, Use a whip stitch to close the hole. Enjoy your new beanbag chair.

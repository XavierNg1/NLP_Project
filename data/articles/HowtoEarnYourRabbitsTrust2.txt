 Once your rabbit is comfortable with you scratching their head, you can begin to pet their back as well. Limit your petting to head scratches and back rubs until the rabbit lies down beside you. They may even hop right alongside you and lie down with their back against your arm. Allow them to dictate the amount of physical contact they are comfortable with., Aside from edible treats, you have other options to help get your rabbit to warm up to you. Offer a stick to chew on or mineral chews designed specifically for rabbits. Rabbits enjoy chewing on things, and they must do so frequently to maintain the health of their teeth.Opt for apple, willow, aspen, and pine branches. Untreated pine lumber can also be used to build a hay basket. Your rabbit can then safely chew on the basket that stores its food!
Never give your rabbit apricot or peach tree branches.
 Even once your rabbit is comfortable around you and will come out to greet you, they may be startled by your hand movements. If this seems to be the case, lie on your stomach with your hands at your sides or on your back. The rabbit may approach your face. Hum softly and lowly, to mimic friendly rabbit communication. Your rabbit may even rub their nose and cheeks against your own., Until a child is willing to sit calmly and quietly around a rabbit, it may be best to keep them away from one another. Definitely do not allow a child to hold a rabbit until the rabbit goes to the child on its own accord. Even then, make sure the child knows that rabbits are fragile, and prone to skittishness.Understand that most rabbits do not like to be held or handled for more than a few moments.

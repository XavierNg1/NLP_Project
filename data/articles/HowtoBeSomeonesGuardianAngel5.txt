 You can still be a “guardian angel” for an individual (or individuals) that you don’t see often through showing love and kindness. All of these things can make a positive difference in someone’s day-to-day life. Try something like:


Smile or hold the door open for someone.
Say something optimistic to a person who seems down.
 If someone that you don’t know seems to be having a difficult time physically or emotionally, kindly offer to help.The kindness of can mean a lot to a person in a difficult situation.


If you see someone in a crowded location who is struggling to carry their bags or possessions, offer to help them carry something.
If you see someone walking in adverse weather conditions, stop your car and offer to give them a lift (if you feel safe doing so).
If you see someone upset or crying in public, ask them, “Is everything alright?” and offer them a tissue.
Always treat people with courtesy, and don’t presume that they will want your help. If you offer your assistance and someone declines, do not press the issue.
 Rather than approaching random acts of kindness as an incidental, unplanned activity, make it a part of your daily (or weekly) routine. You don’t have to go out of your way to do this; simply show kindness to those in your life or who you meet.Talk to your co-workers and compliment them when they do a job well.
Once a week, buy groceries for someone who needs the financial help, like a student or single parent.

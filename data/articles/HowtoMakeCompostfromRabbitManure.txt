  Garden stores often sell pre-made compost bins, which are nice because there is no pre-assembly needed.  However, you can make a free one with pallets, or use other materials.  It is best to have a light bin so that you can lift it up and scoop out the dirt when it is finished composting.  If it is too heavy, you will have to scoop the dirt out of it, which is difficult labor.  The container must be at least 3'x3'x3'.;
,  Simply use a tray under his or her hutch or cage, then bring the tray out to the compost bin.
,  This helps get air to the bacteria that make the decomposing happen.
  Spread it over your garden or mix it in with the original soil.

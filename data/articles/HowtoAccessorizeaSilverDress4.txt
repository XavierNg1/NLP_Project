Try a silver sandal with thin straps, an open toe, and a narrow stiletto heel to create a very feminine look. Gold-tone accents can provide some contrast without taking away from the elegance of the look.






Black heels do not need to be as delicate as silver heels when matched with a silver dress, but you should still avoid shoes with a chunky platform heel.






Colored shoes can look tacky if done incorrectly. Choose a deep blue-tone if going with a solid color shoe. Otherwise, pick out a silver, black, or gunmetal heel with colored stones or other accents.
 Flats are a casual style of shoe, and most will not work well with a silver dress, which is naturally formal. Some metallic flats or shiny patent leather flats are dressy enough, however, to match with simple matte silver dresses.

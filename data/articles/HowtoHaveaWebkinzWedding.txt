 Check to see if it's a girl and a boy so you don't need to start over with the marriage.;
, Try to make it a girl Lil' Kinz, but if you don't have one, you can make it a bigger Webkinz.
 If it's your backyard or your family room, set it up with couches or chairs, flooring, wallpaper, and fancy rugs. If it's an outdoor wedding, line up the garden neatly and make it beautiful!

, It can be any of your friends online at the time. Make it super fancy and make one of your Webkinz pets escort them in. If it's somebody who you just met playing a game or in the clubhouse, they may be confused. Try to invite people you know in real life and tell them before hand, but if you can't, then try to stick with your Webkinz as the guests.
 A wedding wouldn't be good if they're wearing nothing or in pajamas. Buy the groom a tuxedo from the W shop, and the bride a dress or fancy shirt and skirt.
 Have them sit on the couches or chairs and wait. Whatever you do, don't have the bride and groom together. The groom can stand in the designated room or in a room closer to it but the bride and groom can NOT be in the same room!

, Make the groom stand at one end, and let the flower girl enter. Now, have the bride come in the room and stand next to the groom. Make them fake kiss and start the reception.
 Make it a time for you and your guests to interact.
 Tell all your guests to go home or make your Webkinz stay away, and take the bride and groom into a private, cozy room. Have them sit and watch TV in chairs or on a couch, or have them just sit. Unfortunately, they can't sleep together or talk, so pretend they're talking!

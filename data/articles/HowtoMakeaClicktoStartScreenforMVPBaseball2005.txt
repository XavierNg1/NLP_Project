 This is highly recommended to be a large image, preferably 600+, however, 550 won't make much difference. However, the bigger the better. My image just happens to be huge, but i use smaller ones (but not too small) all the time. So, right click the image and click "Save as...".

,, Set the lowest resolution to a resolution of 800+. I use 1200 most of the time. Click on scale.

 If you don't need your current CTS, skip this step. Click File > Extract, and navigate to a folder where you will store the CTS. Rename the file, save it, compress it, and it's stored.
 "Import an existing internal file into the current open image". Then, click browse and find the image we made in gimp. Click next, and then finished.
 You should see your new CTS. Then, click on the 58bd.fsh, and click on File > extract, and rename it accordingly and save it to your CTS folder. Click Yes when asked to compress it, and click Save again.
, Now run the program and you're new CTS will appear.

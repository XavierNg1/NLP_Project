 DIY ornaments by using acrylic cut-outs or making your own cut outs from cardboard and covering them in washi tape. For these ornaments, you will need:Acrylic cut-outs or cardboard to make your own cut-outs
Washi tape in different colors and patterns
Scissors
Ribbon or string for hanging

, If you decide to make your own cut-outs, use thick paper such as cardstock to trace templates for the shapes you want for your ornaments. Trace the templates onto cardboard, and use scissors or an exacto knife to cut out the shape for your ornaments.


Use the template repeatedly to ensure you get consistent shapes for your ornaments
Your cut-outs can be as large or as small as you want. If you intend to use them on your tree, though, remember to make them small enough to fit comfortably between the tree branches.
 Decorate your cut outs with the washi tape. The design is up to you. You can cover up the whole cut out and make patterns with your tape, or you can add some tape in strategic places on your cardboard cut-outs for a shabby chic look. The choice is yours.Cut out individual components of a pattern from your tape to help you make more elaborate designs. For example, if you have washi tape with snowflakes on it, cut out individual flakes to customize your design.
 Once you have decorated your cut-outs to your liking, punch a hole in the top and run ribbon or string through so that you can hang your ornament. If you cannot punch through an acrylic cut-out, hot glue a loop of ribbon or string onto the back of your shape.Be aware that your cardboard cut-outs may not stand up well to water or atmospheric moisture, so hang them indoors and away from the kitchen to get the most out of them.

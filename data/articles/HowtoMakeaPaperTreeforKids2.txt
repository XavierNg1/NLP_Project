 Using crunched up brown paper bags, tape the bags to a wall into the shape of a tree trunk and branches. You can make it as big or as little as you want! You might need an adult to help you if you want the tree to be really big. Let an adult stand on a ladder to reach the top branches.
 Next, make leaves for the tree. You can trace your hand onto colored construction paper and then cut it out. Think about what colors would be good to show what season it is. What colors are the leaves in Fall? In Spring? Make lots of leaves for the tree!

, Tape the leaves to the branches or to the wall next to the branches. Get an adult's help reaching the higher parts of the tree.
 You can add other decorations to the tree too! Try cutting out birds and squirrels to go in the tree, or flowers to grow below the tree.

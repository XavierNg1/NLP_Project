, Make sure it's not something very strong because that could give her a headache. You never know. It's better to be safe, than sorry. Also put a mini deodorant and a small cheap, but nice smelling body splash. Be careful that your friend doesn't take offence and assume you have a low opinion of her standard of personal hygiene.
 She might be having a bad day because it's that time of the month. Put 2 tampons, 2 pads, and 3 panty liners. You never know what they prefer. Some girls only use pads, some only use tampons so just put everything in there.
 If they don't like plain water, then they can have some lemonade. If they do like water, then they don't have to drink it.

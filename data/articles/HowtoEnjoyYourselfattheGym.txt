 If you are overweight, you may not be quite ready for short shorts or tight sleeveless tops, but that's OK. If you pick something that fits your body nicely - instead of wearing huge sweatpants and a huge t-shirt - you'll feel better about yourself and you'll want to work out more.;
, If you're a woman, don't do your makeup like you're going to be on the red carpet! Sure, a little eyeliner or mascara is OK - but if you're going to put on foundation, lipstick, blush, etc. - rethink the reasons why you're really going.
 It's always more fun with a friend. However, if you don't know anybody, don't feel intimidated. There may be a group of guys or girls that you always see together- don't feel left out. Just enjoy yourself and don't worry about being popular.
 Don't lounge on the machines if you're not using them. This is an awful habit and is disrespectful to people who may be wanting to use them.
, Make a playlist on your mp3 player of your favorite songs that really want to make you dance and move around. Don't put slow music that puts you to sleep on it. An ipod shuffle 2nd generation is good because it is small.

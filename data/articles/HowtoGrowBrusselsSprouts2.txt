 Keep them well watered throughout the growing season to prevent the ground from drying out. Reduce the amount of water a couple of weeks before harvest; allow the ground to dry between watering.


Ensure to water the crop adequately during the growing season as the plants require water for growth and sprout development. However, Brussels sprouts need a large amount of water but do not like standing water. That being said, lighter soils will require more frequent waterings than heavier soils.
 Stop fertilizing when you cut back on watering at the end of the growing season.


In addition, removing the growing tip of the plant about a month before the harvesting date will result in greater yields as the plant will divert energy from leaf growth into developing the Brussels sprouts.
 This feeds the plants and provides a barrier for weeds. Brussels sprouts have a very shallow root system, so avoid disturbing the soil around them.


Weed the area carefully by hand if needed. Aphids and cabbage worms are common pests that will affect the sprouts. Maintaining the soil PH at 6.5 or above will help prevent certain diseases such as club root (a soil borne fungus).

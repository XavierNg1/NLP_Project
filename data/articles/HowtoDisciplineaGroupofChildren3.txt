 Know what your rules are, and stick to them. Don’t change your standards arbitrarily. If you aren’t consistent with your discipline, you’ll send the message that good behavior isn’t important all the time.Sometimes you might need to change your rules or make an exception. When this happens, give your group a clear explanation of what’s happening and why. Otherwise, the kids may be confused.
 Children learn more from your behavior than they do from your words. Show your group how you want them to act by using good manners, treating others with kindness, and being patient. In addition, be cordial and positive when interacting with other teachers and administrators to model appropriate behavior.For instance, always say please and thank you, whether you’re interacting with children or adults.
 When a child acts up, don’t lose your temper with them, even if you’re frustrated. Speak in a low voice, and use calm movements. By keeping your cool, you’re modeling good conflict resolution skills while letting the child know you’re in control of the situation.Losing your temper might get kids to behave temporarily, but it also sends the message that you aren’t really in charge.
If you need to, pause and take a deep breath to compose yourself before dealing with a misbehaving child.

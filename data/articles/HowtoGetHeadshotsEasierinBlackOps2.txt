 Try only putting the gun you use first.;
, Use lightweight for the first perk. For the second perk, use coldblooded. And, for the third perk, use extreme conditioning. The reason you should use these is because, if you see a guy running, you can use extreme conditioning to sprint longer and lightweight to move faster. Use coldblooded because if the enemy is using target finder or a dragonfire, VTOL warship, lodestar, etc. You won't be detected easily.
 Use the reflex sight with the blue dot reticle and the fast mags. It's easier to aim at the head with the reticle and faster to reload.
 The gametype you need to play is hardcore domination. This is because it usually only takes 1 to 2 shots to the head in hardcore and because you can stay near the b-flag and get easy kills.
 People will call you a camper, but at least you're getting challenges done.

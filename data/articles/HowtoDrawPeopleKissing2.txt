 Draw two oval shapes for the forehead outlines.
, Always remember that whenever you draw two people kissing on profile angles or side views, the outline sketches for the characters’ heads looks like a heart shape.
 Add curved four vertical lines and a horizontal line for each of the character’s head. The vertical lines are the outlines for the eyebrows, eyes, nose and mouth. The horizontal line is the outline for the ears. Since this is side view, the horizontal line is the outline for the ears. If it is frontal view of the face, the horizontal line becomes the outline for the nose.
 Always begin drawing kissing people on the forehead through the nose. This is the fundamental of drawing people kissing. It is easier starting that way.
,,,,,, You can add effect on the color. Since this view shows a closer look on the characters, you can add blush on their cheeks.

 This is a very high and bright sounding D-chord, and isn't used too often unless you're playing all of your chords that far down the neck. Still, knowing how to form this chord is a lot of fun, and can give your songs a breath of fresh air when thrown in for a normal D.


This chord is melodically identical to those before it, just at a different "octave."

, This is simply an E-form barre chord, meaning you form an E-major chord with your pinky, ring, and middle finger, then barre two frets up with the index. The result is the same shape as a normal E chord, just with barred notes instead of open notes.
 This note is an A. The first note, the one on the 10th fret, 6th string, is a D.
 This is another D.
 This note is an F#, and is needed for a full D chord.
 This chord uses every single string on the guitar, though you can stick just to the top ones for a thicker, slightly deeper chord.

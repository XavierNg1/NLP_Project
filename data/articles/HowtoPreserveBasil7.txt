 Keep them apart and don't lay them over one another.
 This will stop them from blowing off and protects them from dust. Cheesecloth is light enough not to interfere with the air circulation.
 Choose a place that is away from people traffic and pets and that is warm, dry and dark. It should also be well ventilated.
 This will take anywhere from 4 to 14 days, depending on the time of year and your local humidity.
 After the leaves feel crisp when you touch them, place them single layer on a baking sheet. Place in an oven set to 100ºF/38ºC and leave the door open slightly. Heat for about 10 minutes. This will complete the drying process.
 Then place in an airtight storage jar. Label with the date and name. For the first week or so after adding to the jar, check for moisture. If you see any, remove and dry again in the oven. If you don't do this, the basil leaves will turn moldy.


Ensure that the leaves are completely cooled before adding them to the jar. Any warmth will transfer to moisture.
 Use within one year of drying.

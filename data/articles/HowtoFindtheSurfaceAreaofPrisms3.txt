 After solving for area, you may already know the length of every side of the shape at the end of your prism. If not, solve using one of the following methods:


If the matching ends are triangles, solve for all sides by using the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem is A^2 + B^2 = C^2: A and B are the base and height of a right triangle and C is the hypotenuse, which is simply the side opposite the right angle.


If you have been given A and B, use the formula C^2 = A^2 + B^2. Multiply A by itself, multiply B by itself, and add the two numbers together; this gives you C^2. To then solve for C, simply find the square root of this sum.







If you have been given C and B: use the formula A^2 = C^2 – B^2. Multiply C by itself, multiply B by itself, and subtract the second result from the first; this gives you A^2. To then solve for A, simply find the square root of this sum.







If you have been given C and A: use the formula B^2 = C^2 – A^2. Multiply C by itself, multiply A by itself, and subtract the second result from the first; this gives you B^2. To then solve for B, simply find the square root of this sum.









If the matching ends are circles, find the circumference. The formula for circumference is C = D x pi: C is circumference and D is diameter. If you have the radius, simply multiply this by 2 to find the diameter.







If the matching ends are another polygon, break the shape down into triangles and/or squares as before and find the outside edges by solving for these shapes individually. Use the shape guides above if necessary.
 You can then use them to determine the area of the sides of the parallelogram.

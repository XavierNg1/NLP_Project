 Go to thrift shops or secondhand stores to look for a good, basic dress. If it's not perfect, you can always cut it to the desired length or style. The fringe will cover up any imperfections!


Knee length is best. This allows for flapper dancing. Flappers have to dance!
Try to make the tunic spaghetti-strapped or sleeveless. It can be short sleeved if you prefer, but do not get long sleeves.;
, Make sure to buy enough to wrap all the way around your dress -- not just the front.


Drape and pin your first row of fringe to the top of your dress. Measure the distance between where you want your second row of fringe to start all the way down to where you want the second-to-last row of fringe to end. Take that amount and divide it by how many rows you have left to sew on. This ensures that all the rows will be evenly spaced.
 For the top row, turn the dress inside out. That'll make it a lot easier. It'll also be much, much easier if you use a sewing machine.


Try on your dress. If anything isn't hanging right, go back and adjust. Even though it will take more time, you'll be grateful you did.

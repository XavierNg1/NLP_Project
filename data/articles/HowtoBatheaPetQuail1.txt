 You should only ever bathe an animal if they need to be bathed. Constant cleaning is unhealthy and dangerous for any kind of pet. Their immunity levels can lower and certain chemicals in shampoos and soaps can irritate and dry their skin.


If your quail desperately needs to be washed, or if advised by an avian vet, you can decide that it is necessary to bathe your bird.;
, It's good to be knowledgeable on what can go wrong when you decide to clean your quail. Your bird's immunity levels lower when soaked with water, making them more prone to illnesses such as a cold, and they could also accidentally inhale the water. Soaps and shampoos can also irritate and dry out your quail's skin and get rid of the important oils on their feathers.


This is why you shouldn't randomly decide your quail needs a bath when they actually don't. If your quail seems smelly to you, there's usually nothing to be concerned about and it's a poor reason to bathe your bird.
 Is it dirt or gum? If it is a tougher substance that won't easily come off, you will need to seek a vet for help. Coarse scrubbing in an attempt to get it off will harm your quail's feathers.
 You should never attempt to bathe a quail that is weak or ill. If you attempt to bathe an already unhealthy quail, you will put them in a life-threatening position. You need to seek veterinary care to help your quail get better.

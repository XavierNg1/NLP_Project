While your initial slip stitch is adjustable, the final ring will not be, so it is important that you make as tight and as closed a loop as possible by making tight, even stitches.
Use this as an alternative if you have difficulty creating the magic ring.
 Crochet two chain stitches.
, To close this round and start the remainder of your pattern, make a slip stitch into the first stitch of your ring, and proceed to the next round.


Note that this ring is not adjustable like the magic ring is, but it will still give you the crocheted round you need for your pattern, and you may find it easier to create.

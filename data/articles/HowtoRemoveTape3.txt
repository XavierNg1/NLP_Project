 If you're using medical tape to keep gauze or other protective wrapping on your body, it helps to gently wet the edges of the tape to make it easier to remove. The water will help dampen the tape and make it easier for it to come off. Then, slowly pick at the tape while it's in the water until it eventually peels off.









Don't soak a serious wound in water to help get the tape off. It's usually important to keep wounds as dry as possible as you're trying to heal them, making it important that you only use a small amount of water to help ease off medical tape.
 Gradual pulling makes it a lot more painful. Instead, dab it gently with water and pull it off as quickly as possible. One second of quick pain is better than ten seconds of wincing and whimpering while you carefully rip it. Plus, the soapy water should help to soften it and remove it much more quickly.
 Carefully lift up a small piece of the tape, dabbing a cotton ball in a little Vaseline, then wiping a little under the lifted piece of tape to help soften the adhesive. Slowly lift up more of the tape using the cotton bud and more vaseline. Continue doing until all the tape is removed.
 Medical tape will often leave some gunk stuck to your skin and your hairs, and the best way to remove it is by rubbing it vigorously with warm soapy water. Stay clear of the wound, if there is one, or leave the wound covered while you clean up the area affected by the tape.

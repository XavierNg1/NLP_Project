 Long considered an enemy of good health, chicken skin just got a retrial and experts agree that, now and again, chicken skin is a-okay to enjoy.


If you keep the chicken skin, it will give your wings a crispy, buttery outside.
Removing the skin will allow the meat to soak up more of your marinade.;
, You can soak it in a marinade, coat it with a batter or create a crust.
 Teriyaki, ginger-garlic, tandoori and honey-orange are great marinade choices.









Soak your chicken for two hours at least, so that the meat absorbs the flavors.










Options for batter recipes include milk and flour batter, egg batter, and buttermilk batter.
Roll the chicken in the batter.
Some recipes suggest soaking the chicken in the batter for two hours. This is a good suggestion for flavorful buttermilk batters.










You can create a crust with flour, bread crumbs or crushed crackers.
Roll the chicken in your crust mix.
For an extra crispy crust, coat the chicken with milk or beaten eggs before you roll it in your crust mix.

If you have a thermometer, it should be about 350˚–375˚ Fahrenheit, or 175˚–190˚ Centigrade (Celsius).
This is about equivalent to the “Medium” to “Medium High” settings on your stovetop.
 Do not drop the wings into the oil as this may cause it to spatter. You can fry about five wings at a time.
 Gently turn the chicken so that all sides are fried. You can also ladle oil over the sides of chicken that are exposed to the surface.
, Gently shake the chicken over your pan to remove excess oil.
 The napkin will absorb any excess oil so that your wings aren’t too greasy.

 Trilostane is the treatment of choice for pituitary-dependent canine Cushing’s disease. It is given by mouth either once or twice daily to block adrenal cortisol production.If your vet prescribes twice-daily trilostane, you will give the drug once every 8 to 12 hours with food.Although trilostane is more expensive than mitotane, it has fewer side effects and is easier to manage.As with mitotane, your dog’s symptoms will improve with trilostane treatment.
 Trilostane commonly causes vomiting and diarrhea.Other side effects are weakness and loss of appetite. Contact your vet if you notice these symptoms in your dog. Fortunately, these side effects become more mild, or go away completely, with time or dose adjustment., Close monitoring is also required for trilostane. Your vet will perform periodic ACTH stimulation tests to determine how well trilostane is working.As your dog continues to improve, your vet will gradually decrease the trilostane dose.

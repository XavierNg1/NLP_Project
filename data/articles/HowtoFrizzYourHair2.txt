 Wash your hair to remove excess oil, dirt and buildup. Your clean hair will take better to a new style. Condition it to keep it soft and healthy.


Pantene and Tresemme have a heat shield shampoo/conditioner that you can use to protect against any heat damage that may result from styling your hair with a straightener.
Shampoo at the roots of your hair and condition starting at the midsection of your hair down to the tips of your hair.
 Use your thermal protection spray, and blow dry your hair so that it is mostly straight and completely dry. You do not need to worry about styling your hair at this point. You are simply drying it before you style it.


If you do not blow dry your hair, you can towel dry your hair, and let it air dry. Give yourself more time for the whole hair styling process if you air dry your hair. Also, do not sleep on your hair before you style it.
 Apply the mousse after you have blow or air dried your hair in preparation for styling. This will help your hair hold the style without making it stiff.


Use a tennis ball sized amount of mousse if you have short hair and a soft-ball sized amount if you have long or thick hair. Light hold mousse can be used on all hair types.

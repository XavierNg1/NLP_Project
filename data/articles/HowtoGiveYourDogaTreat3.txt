 Giving your dog too many treats a day can lead to weight gain and obesity-related health issues. Check labels so you know how many calories one treat contains, and ask your dog’s vet what its daily caloric intake should be.For example, suppose your 20 pound dog should ingest 700 calories a day and you have treats that are each 100 calories. You should break the treats in smaller pieces and try to offer a daily total that’s about a third less than one full treat.
Table scraps can skyrocket your dog’s treat calories and add lots of unnecessary fat and sugar to its diet, so limit its consumption of scraps from your plate.
 Carrots, broccoli, and green beans can be excellent, healthy treat options. These fresh veggies are low in calories and high in fiber, and most dogs enjoy them as treats.Consider dipping veggies in a bit of peanut butter for a higher value treat.
 Cooked bones, particularly cooked chicken bones, can splinter when your dog chews on them. These small shards present a choking hazard and can damage the throat or intestines.If you want to offer your dog bones, choose marrow bones cut to at least two inches in length to prevent choking. Freezing them beforehand will make them harder. They’ll be more appealing that way and will also clean your dog’s teeth.
 Supervise your dog when you offer it a new treat or a hard chew treat, like bones or rawhides. Look out for small, splintered pieces that might present a choking or digestion hazard.When offering a new kind of food or treat, look for allergic reactions, like itching, rashes, vomiting, or diarrhea. Your dog’s vet can offer an allergy elimination test if it exhibits any of these symptoms.

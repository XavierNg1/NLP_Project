 If you want water that glows in different colors (instead of the yellow that is produced by almost all other methods), buy paint in different shades. Try blue, red, and yellow, which you can mix up to create more shades.


Glow-in-the-dark paints will glow without the presence of a blacklight--they can be charged by exposure to regular light. The fluorescent paints will only respond to the UV rays from a blacklight.
Look for paints that are designed for kids and are 100% non-toxic.
 Using clear glasses or bottles will allow your glowing fluid to be bright and visible.


Using hot water will dilute the paint faster, so you will see faster results.
 There's not a precise measurement for the paint--just add a little and, if you need more, mix in another few drops. Stir the paint vigorously until it mixes into the water., If you are using glow-in-the-dark paint, check the instructions on how to "charge" them so they glow. Usually you need to expose the paint to sunlight for several minutes before it will glow. The fluorescent paints will only glow if you have a blacklight.


Have fun painting with these colors, mixing water to create new shades, or doing other crafts.

 It may seem tempting to try to create an enormous farm right away, but have patience. It is better to start slow than to lose all your money right off the bat.;
, Each crop takes a certain amount of time to grow (i.e. 2 hours, 4 hours, 1 day, etc.). Once that crop has grown, you have the same amount of time that it took to grow to harvest it. If you don't harvest in time, your crops will wither and die.
 Start off by adding a few more plots of land (you can do this by clicking on the "Plow" option.) Adding more land will cost you a small amount.
 Once you get a certain amount of experience points, you level up. Leveling up usually will give you a small amount of money, and sometimes some more experience points.
 Animals and trees will provide you with extra money and experience points. They also can come in handy once you have progressed further into the game.
 There are many ribbons you can earn on Farmville from having many neighbors, or owning many animals. Once you earn a ribbon, you get coins and the ability to share your rewards with your friends. You can get ribbons until you get the blue ribbon for each type.

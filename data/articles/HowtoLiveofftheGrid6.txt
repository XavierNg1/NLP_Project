 Living off the grid doesn’t mean you need to be hundreds of miles from civilization. You could choose to move to a plot of land that is isolated and rural but still within easy reach of stores, hospitals, and family.On the other hand, you could live in a totally self-sufficient home or trailer far from anyone else.The distance you choose to remove yourself to depends only on your preferences and personality.
Travel to a number of different locations before selecting the site of your off-the-grid homestead., Living off the grid typically means dramatically reducing your level of interaction and communication with the outside world. However, the degree to which you choose to do this varies depending on your own personality and desires. For example, you could choose to get rid of your phone, computer, and radio altogether. Alternately, you might keep your radio, but ditch your phone and computer.There is no right or wrong way to decide how to limit your level of communication.
 When living off the grid, all you energy, food, and water use should be carefully monitored and maintained. The more of these precious resources you use, the more reliance you will have on others. Easy ways to reduce waste include:Keeping your showers short and don’t water your lawn.
Unplugging appliances when they’re not in use.
Turning off the lights when exiting a room.
Learning to love leftovers. Start a compost pile so you can get some use out of unused food.

 Sony has released this patch to disable the cloaking mechanism on files that are not associated with its own internal DRM-related files. This will ensure that newer viruses released in the future utilizing this exploit will not be able to hide on your system. There has been some concern about this patch doing more than just removing the cloaking mechanism. However, this option is required to fully and safely remove any viruses that utilize cloaking technology.;
, If the uninstaller is used, further steps are not necessary.
 If you use Norton, update Norton Anti-Virus with the latest definitions, using the included LiveUpdate software. Using Symantec's Removal Tool, scan your computer using the tool. This tool will remove any instances of specific viruses found, regardless of the cloaking technology in use by Sony's DRM. If any virus threats are found, they will be removed. You will be notified if no threats are found.
 If nothing is found, then you've eliminated the known threats. Otherwise, if other threats are found, download the appropriate removal tool from Symantec's website for that particular virus.

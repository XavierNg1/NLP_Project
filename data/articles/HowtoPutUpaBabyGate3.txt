 These gates are ideal for wider spaces that require a wall-to-wall configuration. Accurate measurement is extremely important; these gates have multiple panels that combine to create a single enclosure with a versatile fit, but you need to know exactly how big your space is.


Once you’ve measured, check to make sure the space is too big for a pressure fit or hardware mounted gate. The special gates are generally just as secure, but they cost more and have more pieces, so if it’s possible to use another kind, that’s usually your best bet.
 Gates made for wide and irregular areas come in a variety of sizes and styles. Choose one that fits your measurements properly and matches the style of your home.


For maximum safety, check to make sure that the baby gate you purchase is certified by your local children’s product safety organization. In the United States, for example, check for certification from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (the JPMA).
 Before you install the gate, read the manual and make sure you follow the manufacturer’s specific directions. The details of the installation procedure may vary slightly from one brand to another.
 Make sure your measurements align with the length of the gate you’ve purchased, then install the hardware mounting system. If you mount the system to a wall, be sure that you drill and screw it onto a beam – not a hollow part of the wall. This will ensure that your gate stays securely attached.
 Make sure your mounting system is flush on the wall and does not move when you pull on it, then install the panels according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Angle the panels appropriately to form a wide enclosure.


Most gates will allow for only three panels to be placed straight. Check your manual to be sure.

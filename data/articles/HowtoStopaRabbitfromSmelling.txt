 A healthy rabbit should not smell as, unlike most pets, rabbits are naturally odorless animals. If he/she does smell, you are either not taking care of it properly or he/she is ill.;
, Use a cat litter such as Yesterday's News. Do not use clumping litters or wood shavings as these can cause serious health problems for rabbits. Note: Your rabbit must be spayed or neutered! An unfixed rabbit will not use its litter box well and rabbits must be fixed to avoid serious health risks such as cancer.
 Replace all bedding.
, A clean, healthy rabbit will never smell, and any odor is a sign of a potentially serious medical condition. Remember to only use a rabbit-savvy vet that has experience with rabbits. Ask your local rabbit shelter for a recommendation if you need to find one.
 Use your hands to wet clean any matted fur. You might need another person to help you hold the rabbit. A "butt bath" should only be used for medical purposes and only if necessary. Otherwise absolutely do not bathe your rabbit! Rabbits are not meant to get wet and bathing can cause serious health problems such as hypothermia. Putting a rabbit in water can also cause it to go into shock and have a heart attack.
 Today's pet rabbits are very different from the wild rabbits they descended from and cannot survive outside; keeping a rabbit outdoors will cut its lifespan in half on average. Outdoor cages are also harder to clean and put your rabbit at risk for many diseases.

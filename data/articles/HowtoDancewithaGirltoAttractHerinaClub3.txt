 Yes its a clich√© but truth. Mind creates the environment around you. Its subliminal and not completely understood, but you would have noticed it that when you are feeling confident and exhilarated from deep inside, this is seen in your actions and this is also reflected in the feedback from people around you, this also makes you look attractive. Good things happen to you when you are feeling good from the inside. In the same way when you are feeling anxious and fear, you get more related thoughts and same is seen in the environment around you. To snap out of irrational and anxious state of mind, push yourself without wasting time. Just Jump.
 The balance is, "I want to dance with you but I am fine without you." This is important, as girls are attracted to guys who are not needy.
 The girl in your arms is your priority. Make her feel special, genuinely, because she is. She agreed to dance with you and allowed you to come so close to her, Right?

, The most important thing is to have fun. Thinking and nonsense thoughts are only going to make it worse. You gave your mind any room to think and this is going to destroy your game. Ask yourself, What's the worst that can happen? She will say no. That's it, bottom line. Remember If you are not having fun you are not doing it right.
 Women like a guy who is dominant as since ancient times men are the one who lead women. Women like to be lead. Keep the fact in mind that in even-though women are seen as leaders, entrepreneurs, politicians etc and are totally equal as Men(status wise and intelligence) but in some some aspects they like to be treated as women because of the biological factors and evolution. If you are not being dominant enough you are, more likely, going to lose her.
 Yes, its normal. Who would feel like home after coming to a club or party?.

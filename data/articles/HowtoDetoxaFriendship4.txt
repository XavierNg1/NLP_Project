 If you have parted ways with a toxic friend but you are still in his or her daily circles for work or social reasons, there's no need to do the cold stonewalling act. Keep communicating in a friendly, caring way that still maintains your distance. Say "hello" when you see your former friend - it doesn't have to be more than this - but at least keep greetings civil and ongoing. Acknowledging your former friend's worth as a human being still matters. This can be a delicate balance as you do not want to convey the idea that you are still friends.
 If anyone tries to draw you on, this simply say "Yes, we were friends once but it didn't work out. She's still a good person, we're just not suited as friends now."

, Whenever your paths cross, if all else fails you, at least smile. If your friend doesn't reciprocate, don't worry - just keep doing this and other people will notice who is the person with the chip on their shoulder.
 If you are in a situation where you still need to talk to one another, stick to simple things and excuse yourself as soon as it is polite to do so. If you need to talk through things to do with work and find yourself disagreeing, keep it civil, professional, and stick to the facts.
 Your real friends are a source of support and re-energizing. Rely on them for improving your outlook on friendship!

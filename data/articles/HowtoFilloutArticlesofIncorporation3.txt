 At least one incorporator needs to sign the Articles of Incorporation. In some states, if you have multiple incorporators, you will need to get all of them to sign and represent their addresses., In some states, you are directed to file the Articles of Incorporation in person. In other states, you may file by mail, fax, or even online. Check with your secretary of state’s office to make sure you file correctly.
 Find out from the Secretary of State’s office what form of payment is acceptable. Make sure that you have the full payment, in the proper form, when you submit your paperwork for filing.
 Although the filing with the Secretary of State will become the official source for any conflicts that may arise in the future with your new corporation, you should keep a copy of the papers that you file. Especially if there is a problem with the initial filing, you won’t want to have to complete the process over again.

 If you are unsure about when to switch from a kitten to an adult formula or otherwise change your cat’s diet, you should talk to your veterinarian. They should be able to tell you when to switch, as well as whether you should expect your cat to gain or lose weight during the transition process., Most cats will stop growing at around one-year old, although some breeds will take a little longer to reach adult size. If your cat has stopped growing, you can switch from kitten to adult food.For instance, the Maine Coon reaches adult size at around 18 months.
During the transition, you should watch their weight and health. If they look under or overweight, adjust their portion sizes accordingly., If your cat is getting overweight, you should transition them to a weight control formula. Consult your veterinarian about an appropriate weight control formula.If your cat is more than twenty-percent above their normal body weight, they are considered obese.Typically, a ten pound cat needs between 180 and 200 calories per day.Fifty five percent of cats in the United States are overweight., If your cat recently became a senior, you should transition them from their adult food to a senior cat food. A senior cat food should have more fiber, fewer calories and more highly digestible protein.If your cat recently turned nine or ten, they are considered senior and can be transitioned to the new food.Factors to consider when choosing a senior food include fat absorption, digestibility, joint and mobility issues, kidney considerations, weight loss and gain.Ingredients to look for in a senior cat food include beet pulp, glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, L-Carnitine, vitamin E and good quality protein., You can get specialized cat foods for health conditions, such as sensitive skin, urinary tract problems, and stomach issues. Ask your veterinarian if there is a cat food that will help with your cat’s specific health problems.

 Skyshards are new to the Elderscrolls universe. These shards, when collected, will give you a bonus skill point to spend. You'll have to start by searching the world for them. Keep an ear out, as well as an eye. They make a ringing sound and shine very brightly, so they're easy to spot from a distance.
 Once you see a Skyshard, activate it by clicking on it in order to harness its power. Don't worry if you see someone else at the site: one person absorbing a Skyshard does not stop another from doing the same.
 Once you have a set of 3, you get a point to spend. Keep track of how many you currently have by checking your Skills and Abilities Menu.

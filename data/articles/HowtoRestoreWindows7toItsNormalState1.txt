 Safe Mode is the best place to start to fix your computer when it is malfunctioning. This mode can be used to combat certain types of viruses, as well as a diagnosis tool if you are unsure of why the computer is not functioning. If the computer boots and functions in Safe Mode, then you know that the problem is with a program, driver or other file, rather than with the computer itself., Reboot in Safe Mode from the Shutdown menu, if accessible.
 If the Shutdown menu is inaccessible, you can restart the computer and repeatedly press F8 while it is loading. This should give you access to the Boot Menu.
 Press the down key to access the Safe Mode option and hit enter.
 Once the program starts, you can begin attempting to fix your computer. There are a number of different methods you can try to which you use will largely depend on what kind of problem you are having.

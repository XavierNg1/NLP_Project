 You are allotted only five lives maximum at a time. The number of remaining lives is displayed on the upper-left side of the game’s main screen. A countdown timer from 30 minutes is displayed beside it that gives you an idea of how much time is left before another life is added.;
, It takes 30 minutes to replenish one life. If you’ve already consumed all your five lives in one go, you have to wait at least 30 minutes to get back one life. Better yet, leave the game alone for at least two and a half hours to get a full set of five lives.
 Candy Crush can be integrated with your Facebook account. It’s not needed to play it, but it will make the whole playing experience easier and better. If you’re running out of lives and would like to keep playing, you can ask a Facebook friend who plays the game as well. Giving a friend a life to a friend is free.


Tap the lives area of the screen with the heart to get more lives. A window will appear with the remaining time until a next life is generated. Below it is the “Ask friends” banner with the Facebook logo.
Tap on this banner to ask some Facebook friends for lives.
Tap the “Ask friends” button on the next window, and your list of friends will be displayed. Simply tap the plus sign beside each one to request lives. A friend can only give a life to you once a day, so make it count.
Tap the Send button once done to send the requests.
 A little quid pro quo can extend your playing time. Every now and then, give lives to your friends. They may remember you when it’s their turn to give away lives. You’d be surprised how many do give back.
 This one’s a cheat and can mess up your device’s clock. However, if you must, you must. Go to your device’s clock settings and turn the time to something in the future, or at least two and a half hours ahead. Once done, launch Candy Crush.


The game will be tricked into thinking that time has passed and you deserve the complete replenished set of five lives.
Don’t forget to turn back your clock to the correct time.

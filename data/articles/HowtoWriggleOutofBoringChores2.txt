 If your parents make you go to an event or store that you don’t want to go to, make sure it’s obvious that you aren’t having a good time. Don’t make an effort to talk to anyone or add to conversations if someone is talking to you. Make sure you don’t smile, as this cues you’re enjoying yourself and will encourage people to talk to you., Making a mess of whatever your parents ask you to do will make it less likely they ask you again the next time. If you make a mess that takes more time to clean up than it would have for your parents to have just done the chore themselves, they probably won’t ask you to do it again the next time it comes up.


Aren’t sure what chores are good for this? If you have to wash the dishes, splash water all over the place and don’t bother wiping it up. Leave food scraps in the sink. Knock over the recycling bin when you take it out and “forget” to put all the bottles and cans back inside.
 For some chores, not finishing the job is just as bad as not doing it at all. Someone, most likely your parents, will have to do all the work you did over as well as the last step you didn’t finish. If this is something that happens consistently, your parents will think twice before asking you to do it again.


This won’t work for every chore. Raking the leaves is a good one to try this with. “Forget” to put them in the bag and eventually the wind will blow them back all over the yard. Your parents will probably just sigh and go fix it themselves. Clearing the table is another chore this might work for.

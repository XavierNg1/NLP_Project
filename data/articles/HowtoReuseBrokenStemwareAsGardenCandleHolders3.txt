 Avoid anywhere near flammable items; greenery should be okay but don't have the flame close to anything that might burn (or use battery tea lights).


Choose locations that you feel assured will not be disturbed by children or animals. If you are entertaining, you won’t be able to completely monitor the area at all times.
If the soil is too loose or shallow, the glass candle holder may not be held well in that area. Check first.
 Gently push the glass stem into the dirt and hold it in place. Remove your hand and make sure the glass is well supported in the dirt.
 Don’t forget to blow out the candles or turn off the battery operated candles when you're finished in the area.

 Do this by moving the decimal point two spaces to the left, or dividing them by 100. For example, 20% and 80% would be 0.2 and 0.8 as decimals.
 To do this, move the decimal point the number of spaces it would take to make the number whole, then divide as usual. In the example given above, 0.2/0.8 would give you a quotient of 0.25, since 2 divided by 8 equals 0.25.
 Then add a percent (%) sign so others know that the number is being compared to 100.
 For instance, if you had 80%, and 25%, you would get the fractional values of 80/100 and 25/100.
 In the example given above, 80/100 would simplify to 4/5, and 25/100 would simplify to 1/4.
 To do this, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second one (flip the second fraction over). In the example given above, you would multiply 4/5 by 4/1 (or 4) to get 16/5.
 If you're simplifying an improper fraction, it's best to convert it to a decimal rather than a mixed number, as converting a mixed number to percentage takes more work.
 In the example given above, you would multiply 16/5 (or 3.2) by 100 to get 320%.

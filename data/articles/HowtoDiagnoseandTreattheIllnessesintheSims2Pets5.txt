 On the examination table do the same thing you did to diagnose the broken bone/limb except this time when you take the x-ray picture it'll say the pet has a lodged item inside it., But keep it for 3 days if you...(see no.2 FLU section),, Turn the wheel on the left-hand side round anti-clockwise until it won't turn any longer. Then turn the wheel on the right-hand side. This will move the gripper on the top screen to the left. Keep turning it clock-wise until the gripper is positioned directly above the lodged item. Then push the red button. The lodged item will be removed and you'll be able to keep it!

 Round and princess cut diamonds are among the most common and most inexpensive shapes. Stick with one of these shapes if you need to save money or do not know your partner's preference. Otherwise, you may also consider an emerald, oval, pear, marquise, radiant, heart, asscher, or cushion shape.



Most traditional engagement bands are made of yellow gold. Itâ€™s better to choose yellow gold for a vintage-style or classic look. White gold suits clean, modern look. White gold engagement rings will need to be dipped in rhodium every 2-3 years in order to maintain the luster.
White gold has a silver-like appearance, but this appearance wears off over time and may need replacing later on.
Platinum is the most expensive option and may not be affordable if you are on a tight budget.



Setting refers to the way the diamond sits on the band.
The most common setting is prong, but others include bar, tension, bezel, channel, flush, cluster, and invisible.
Prong settings may often be the least expensive option, but look at a variety of different options before settling. Many others may also fall within your price range.
 Some settings may even have diamonds all around the band. Just remember that the more diamonds a band has, the more expensive it will be. Stick with the traditional, timeless solitaire setting to save on cost.
 Some people may actually prefer a high-quality colored gemstone such as a sapphire, emerald, or ruby. Do not, however, try to pass off cubic zirconia or other gemstone as a diamond.

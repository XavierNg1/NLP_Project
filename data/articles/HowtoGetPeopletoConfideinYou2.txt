 People tend to confide in those they spend a lot of time around. They feel more comfortable in their presence. They will also be more certain of your honesty. If you want them to trust you with their secrets, you should prove that you are willing to be there no matter what.
 Sometimes, friends need friends on short notice. If your friend calls, try to answer it right away. Promptly respond to their text messages if they are having a problem. If they are upset, offer to come over and talk. While you cannot always be available, you can demonstrate that you are always willing to help them.


If they call you and you think something is wrong, you may not be able to talk to them right away. You can, however, send a text or email saying, “Hey, I got your call. I am unavailable right now. Is everything ok?” This lets them know that you are concerned about them, even if you were unable to take their call.
 People may not confide their deepest secrets in you right away, but by assisting them with small problems, you can slowly build your way up to the big stuff. Perhaps they are struggling with homework, or maybe they need a ride to the doctor’s office. Little favors can help build trust and reinforce your friendship., In most cases, if you try to force someone to tell you something, they will become more defensive. While you can encourage someone to confide in you with gentle and supportive statements, you should not insist that they tell you something.


If someone has experienced a nasty breakup don't call them and say, "You've got to tell me what happened exactly! Please!" Respect their feelings and say, "I heard what happened, and I'm very sorry. Do you want to talk about it?"
If you think that there is something seriously wrong with your friend, intervene.

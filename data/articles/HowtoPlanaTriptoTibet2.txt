 The principal documents that you'll need are the TTB permit, or Tibet Entry Permit (the Tibet Tourism Bureau gives these documents) and the PSB Permit or Aliens' Travel Permit (given by the Public Security Bureau or local police). Note that you cannot travel by yourself; you must have an organized trip booked in advance by a tour group. A licensed tour guide is required to be with you., It is obligatory for all foreigners traveling to Tibet, and allows you to see the capital Lhasa, Namtso Lake, Shigatse, and the Potala Palace. Apply at least 20 days in advance., This is needed for tourism to most areas out of Lhasa, but you can only obtain it after arrival in Tibet., You will need this if heading to sensitive or military areas.

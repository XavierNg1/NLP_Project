 If you feel a breeze coming on down below and circumstances allow, get into a position where you can bend over or crouch down. In these positions the bowels are less obstructed, which means you can let loose without worrying as much about waking the neighbors. Doing this will not mitigate the smell if there are discerning noses around, however.This method may be a lifesaver to those who work physical jobs or often partake in activities where they can move around freely, especially if you have the added advantage of being outside.
 When you're in a crowded room or roaring movie theater this won't be much of an issue. But if you're in the quiet living room of your in-laws' home, you may need a sonic diversion. Coughing, exclaiming loudly and dropping objects are all time-tested openings for stealth cheese-cutting, but you're free to get as creative as you please: work the toot into a well-timed bout of laughter, or wait until someone opens a bag of chips.Don't be too obvious about the cover noise you're generating. Act natural. And, of course, if the problem gets to be too much for you to handle at an important social event, you may have to just bite the bullet and let it go.
 The softer and more plush a seating surface is, the more it will act as soundproofing for your down-under disruptions. Pick an office or conference chair that can withstand the brunt of your blasts, and opt for the worn old sofa over the swanky leather recliner whenever possible. As long as you're careful, you should be able to expel as much flatulence as you need without ever having to get up.Avoid hard surfaces, such as park benches or wooden chairs, or "reflective" surfaces, like leather and hard rubber, when you're gassy. The acoustics of these materials tend to amplify the vibrations of impactful sounds, and if your antagonist fart happens to be too powerful, it will be like advertising.

 Open the Photoshop software from your system tray menu or Programs menu. After the interface is opened, go to “File” available at the top left corner. Click on it to get a drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, select “Open.” This will open a file explorer. Use this to navigate through your files and folders until you find the image you want to straighten.


Click the image once you find it, and then click “Open”, located at the bottom right of the dialog box.
 After opening the image, select Crop tool from the left vertical toolbar. Its the box icon with corner handles on it, also known as the Crop marquee.
 The mouse pointer will change into a crop marquee. You will now need to create a marquee over the area that you will crop. To do this, drag the crop marquee cursor over the area you will crop; the marquee will appear as a dotted line surrounding the area you want to crop.
 Now move the mouse to the corner of the marquee, and bring it to the outside of the screen. The mouse cursor will change into a curved double-pointed arrow. This arrow enables you to rotate the marquee. Rotate the marquee in a way that it changes its alignment along a horizontal line of the image, like a horizon, fence, or shelf. After aligning, reposition the edges to the desired crop area.
 Once you are sure that your crop area is looking good, press Enter on your keyboard to crop. A dialog box will appear confirming the crop; click “Crop” to straighten the image.

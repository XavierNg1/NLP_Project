, The more you convince yourself and believe it, the more effective it will be!

, Attempting to control your breathing will help lessen the degree of intensity you experience during your panic attack. Take slow, deep breaths, as they are the most effective way to avoid loss of control.


Coping with a panic attack is possible if you are able to get a grip on how rapidly you are breathing.
 Shoulder rolls also help relieve tension in your arms and upper back. This will help tend to the root cause of the panic attack, preventing future ones as well.
 Don't let the attack force you to do things you normally wouldn't do. Close your eyes, breathe slowly and deeply, and tell yourself, "I will not let this control me." Repeat this to yourself firmly until you feel the attack subside. Not only will this help strengthen you physically and inwardly, but it will also bring assurance to you when you know you have things under control.


Even if you feel that you have no control, telling yourself that you do and believing it will help a lot. Do not let the panic attack take over you.

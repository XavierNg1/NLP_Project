 You can build a battery from acidic fruit to give your phone a temporary charge. Note that you’ll still need the charger cable, though a power block and electrical outfit won’t be necessary. Note: this has the potential to damage your device, so only proceed if you are ready to accept any possible risks. You will need:About a dozen acidic fruits, such as citrus, apples, or pears.
A copper screw or penny for each piece of fruit. If you are using pennies after 1982, they will need to be sanded to expose the copper.A zinc (galvanized) nail for each fruit.
Insulated copper wire.
Rubber gloves. Wear these at all times to prevent getting shocked.
 Make sure you leave a bit of the nail exposed so you can connect the wire to it.
 Insert the copper piece near the zinc nail, but do not let them touch or the battery will short. If you are using citrus fruit, try to get both objects into the same segment of fruit.
 Insert the objects into the rest of the fruit. Take care to ensure that none of the metal pieces touch each other when inserting them.
 Use the copper wire to connect each fruit into a circuit. Connect a wire from the copper piece of one fruit to the zinc of another. Connect the copper piece on the second fruit to the zinc of the third, and so on.
 Cut the large end of the charging cable off to expose the wires inside the cable. Connect the power wires to the end of the fruit chain.
 Each piece of fruit should be producing about half a volt, which should add up to the five volts you need to charge the device.As the zinc dissolves in the fruit, it releases zinc ions, which releases energy. The zinc ions also reduce copper ions, which releases more energy. When combined in a circuit, they release enough energy to charge the device.

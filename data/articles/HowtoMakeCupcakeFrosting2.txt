 Place them in a medium bowl and use a mixer to cream the butter, cream cheese and sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, about two minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl every once in a while to make sure everything gets mixed in., Add the vanilla to the bowl and mix it in thoroughly with your electric mixer. Taste the frosting and add a little more vanilla if you'd like.
 This will help you achieve the right light, fluffy, spreadable texture you want for your cupcake frosting. Keep beating until the frosting is slightly stiff.


If the frosting seems too thick, add a tablespoon of heavy cream and keep beating.
If it seems too runny, add another 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and keep beating.
 Cream cheese is classically paired with red velvet, chocolate or spice cupcakes. You can spread it on with a knife or pipe it on in swirls, and it will hold its shape until you're ready to eat the cupcakes.


Make sure you wait until the cupcakes are completely cool before you frost them; otherwise, the frosting will melt and slide off.
Store extra frosting in the refrigerator for up to three days.

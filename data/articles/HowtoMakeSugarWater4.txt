 This will give you a richer flavor. It will also give the drink a golden tint; because of this, it is better to use the brown sugar water for rum-based drinks instead of clear drinks.You can also use honey instead of sugar for a sweet, golden syrup., Substitute part of the water in your recipe for some rosewater. Be sure to use pure, edible rosewater; some rosewater types are for cosmetic purposes only and not meant to be consumed., Do not use confectioner's or powdered sugar. Simply pour one part castor sugar and one part water into a bottle, close the bottle, and shake it for a few minutes until the sugar dissolves. The fine grains of castor sugar make it easier to dissolve in water, so you don't need to cook it., Once the sugar has dissolved, add the herbs of your choice, and take the pot off the stove. Let the herbs sit in the sugar water for an hour, then pour the sugar water into a new container through a strainer. Discard the herbs and store the flavored syrup in the refrigerator. Some great herbs include:Fresh basil, mint, rosemary, and thyme leaves
Fresh or dried lavender flowers
Pieces of fresh fruit or berries
Lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit zest
Vanilla bean pods or cinnamon sticks
Peeled and grated ginger root

 Often, having fast reflexes is not enough. During a fight, you can become punch drunk or tired and lose your faculties. Thus, you must study your opponent in the beginning of the fight and learn his tells. When is he going to throw a punch? What punch is it going to be? Don't make too many assumptions because there is a chance that he is trying to get you into habits that will set you up for a knockout punch.;
, Make sure that you only move enough to dodge the punch. Don't move too much or too little.
 This amateur mistake is very predictable and can lead to a quick knockout. instead adjust your feet slightly to match where your head is or bob and weave into a new position--anywhere but where your head started will do.
 This makes you impossible to hit after slipping. This rule should be followed loosely when it comes to jabs. Your opponent may do one of the following to throw you off:


Throw a jab a little to the left, hoping he can catch you being predictable
Throw or feint one jab and throw another quick one hoping that you don't have any room left on the outside or that you won't recover quickly enough.

 Children are often small in stature; as a result, they are sometimes literally in the dog’s face. Kids are full of energy, moving abruptly and often erupting in high-pitched noises that can startle and unnerve your new dog. They also might not realize that a dog’s growl or stiff back might indicate the dog wants the child to back off, and a kid’s lack of responsiveness to a dog’s body language can be read as threatening by the dog., Before you introduce your dog to kids, the dog should master basic commands such as sit, stay, and down. Your dog will need to know these commands so that you can control them as they interact with children. If you are having trouble teaching your new dog basic commands, you should consider obedience training before allowing your dog to interact with kids., Regular veterinary checkups and vaccination schedules should be part of every dog owner’s routine. It is extremely important that your dog is up to date on all of their vaccinations prior to being around children. Call your vet and make sure your dog is properly vaccinated before you introduce them to kids., While interactions between children and dogs can be wonderful for both parties, they can also quickly escalate into an undesirable, or even dangerous situation. If your dog bites or harms a child, you are responsible. Knowing this will help you understand the importance of preparing your new dog to interact with kids.

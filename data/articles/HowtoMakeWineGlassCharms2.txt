 You can find these in the jewelry findings section of your local craft store or bead shop. The type that you specifically need look like a split ring. One of the ends of the wire is normal, while the other end is flattened and has a hole punched through it.Alternatively, you can also use the type of earring hoop or earring wire that has a looped end (instead of a flattened/punched end)., You can use one big bead or a bunch of smaller beads. You can also do a combination of both, with a big bead in the middle, and some smaller beads to either side of it. Slip however many beads you want onto the wire, but leave about Â¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) so that you can turn the wire.
 Use a pair of needle nose pliers to pull open a jump ring. Pull the ends of the ring past each other instead of away from each other. Slip the jump ring through the loop part of your charm, then close the jump ring. Slide the jump ring onto the earring hoop.


You can use the charm by itself or with some small beads to either side of it.
If the ends of the jump ring aren't flush with each other, pinch the jump until the ends touch.
Some charms may already have a jump ring attached. If you have a charm like this, simply slip it onto the earring hoop.
 Pinch the end of your wire with a pair of needle nose pliers. Bend the tip of the wire upwards at a 90 degree angle., In order to close the charm, place the turned end of the wire under the flattened end. Push the wire through the punched hole. If it doesn't hold, carefully pull the charm at the sides. This will create more tension., Simply lift the flat end of the charm up and away, then slide the ring onto the stem of your wine glass. Push the flat end of the charm back onto the bent end to close it.

 In order to download apps from the App Store, you will need to either be connected to a wireless network or your cellular data plan. See this guide for details on connecting your iPad to a network.;
, You will need to have an Apple ID linked with your iPad in order to download apps from the App Store. You can check by opening the Settings app and selecting "iTunes & App Store". You should see your Apple ID at the top of the menu. If not, log in or create a new Apple ID.
 Locate the App Store icon on your iPad's home screen and tap on it to launch the App Store. You will be taken to the App Store main page.
 Use the search bar if you want to find a specific application, or browse in the top apps if you need suggestions. Once you've found an app you like, tap on it to open the download page.
 When you've selected an app, you will be shown a description and some screenshots. You can also read reviews from other users. Use this information to determine if the app is what you need.
 If the app costs money, there will be a button indicating the price. If the app is free, the button will say "Free". Tap the price to confirm the purchase with the credit card associated with your Apple ID (or any gift card balance that you've redeemed). Once you've purchased the app, or tapped the "Free" button, the button will change to an "Install" button.
 Tap the "Install" button. The app will begin downloading to your iPad. You can monitor the progress by looking at the loading circle. Some apps are very large and can take a significant amount of time to download and install.
 If you are still on the application's App Store page, you can tap the "Open" button that appears after the app has finished installing. Otherwise, the app will appear on your Home screen after it has finished installing, and can be opened from there.

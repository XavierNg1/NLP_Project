 Take semi-frozen steak and cut it thinly. Fry up onions and peppers and remove when ready, about 5 minutes. Start to cook the steak, chopping thoroughly with a sharp spatula when almost cooked. Mix your onions and peppers with your chopped steak.
 You have two options here about how to heat up your roll and/or cheez wiz:


Option 1: Toast your hoagie roll and then smother the hot bread with cheez wiz. This will give the bread a nice crispiness, but the cheez wiz won't stay hot as long.
Option 2: Warm your cheez wiz in the microwave. Pick up melted cheese with a spatula and deposit on the roll.

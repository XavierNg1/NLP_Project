 Nuts can come whole, with or without shell or in pieces. They can also come roasted, with or without flavors and/or with salt added. By knowing the forms and checking the nutrition labels, you should be able to choose the best for you.


Whole nuts are good for snacking on plain. They tend to stay fresh longer as well. Nuts without the shell are more convenient for eating on the go.
Pieces are usually better for cooking. The smaller pieces help reduce cooking time and save you the trouble of having to remove the shell.
Roasted nuts are roasted to bring out natural flavors and come without the shell. Roasted nuts generally contain salt and seasoning, so check the label for sodium content.



Purchase nuts in bulk if you plan on eating them everyday, plan on sharing them or cooking with them. This is the most cost effective option. They should be stored in a sealed container and in a cool dark place for the longest shelf life. Usually, nuts only last about three weeks when stored properly.
Purchase nuts packaged, such as in a canister if you plan on consuming them within three weeks and are not sharing. These are packed for freshness and in a small enough amount that you will be able to consume them all before they go rancid.
Purchase portion controlled packs if you are worried about over eating. Portion controlled packs are good for ensuring you only eat what you need. They also stay fresh for longer amounts of time because each pack is opened and consumed in entirety.

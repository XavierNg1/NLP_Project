 In some places, you may request gallstones from the department of surgery or the department of pathology of hospitals.;
,,, Record the weight. This will be important to estimate how much solvent to use.
, Stir gently. The solution will have a dirty-yellow to brown appearance from the bile pigment bilirubin.
 Apply a gentle vacuum in the receptor container to facilitate filtration. Rinse the cooking container with a small amount of hot 2-butanone and transfer that rinse to the funnel. The cholesterol will be completely dissolved in the 2-butanone solvent, while insoluble impurities (mostly composed of bilirubin, a metabolite of hemoglobin, that gives the gallstones a brown color) will be filtered out during this extraction process.


If the filtrate remains highly coloured, add activated charcoal and re-filter.
, The cholesterol is very soluble 2-butanone, less soluble in methanol, and insoluble in water. Adding the water as a precipitant into the solution will help saturate the solution with cholesterol for crystallization. Methanol is needed to bridge the solvents, as 2-butanone and water are not very miscible with each other, and methanol is miscible with both water and 2-butanone.
 Wrap cotton padding or toweling around the hot container for insulation to allow slow cooling, then let it cool undisturbed to room temperature.
, The yield is large colorless crystalline plates and needles of cholesterol, about 75% of starting crushed gallstones. Save the filtrate. If greater yield is desired, you can obtain a second crop of less purity by boiling the filtrate, adding water drop by drop, and repeating the crystallization process.

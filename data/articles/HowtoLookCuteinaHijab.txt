 First of all, the proper way to wear a Hijab is the way your style is and that it covers all of your hair.;
, Remember that you wear hijab not because of trends. You should also wear clothes that could cover your aurat properly. And never wear tight clothes like leggings.


Maybe, a white long-sleeved shirt under your favorite short sleeved shirt.



Silk Hijabs are very cool too, and they come in cool funky patterns to match your style.
It's okay if you wear funky clothes.
You shouldn't care if people make fun of you. If they do, you have to stay away from them. It is OK if they are joking but if you think your being intimidated, tell a teacher or counselor.
Your friends will still like you, and if they don't, they aren't real friends.
If you're going to a school where your old friends don't go and only your Muslim friends go, don't worry, guaranteed, you will make new friends.

 Pour a little more flour than you need for your recipe into a flour sifter and sift it thoroughly over a bowl. Sifting flour aerates it, resulting in lighter baked goods. This might sound like a great thing to do for every recipe, but you should only sift flour if the recipe calls for doing so. For certain cakes and pastries, a denser final product is actually preferred.


If you don't have a flour sifter, you can sift flour just by stirring it. Pour it into a bowl and use a whisk to briskly stir it until it's light and fluffy., Use a spoon to measure the flour into a cup thatâ€™s the exact right size. Avoided using a larger measuring cup than you need, since it's harder to get an accurate measurement this way.
 Run the back of a knife or another straightedge across the rim of the measuring cup, letting the excess flour fall back into the container. You may now use your perfectly measured flour in your recipe.

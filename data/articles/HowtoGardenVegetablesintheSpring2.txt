 ‘Planting out’ means moving your indoor potted plants to outdoor vegetable beds. The process involves transferring pot grown seedlings, or ones grown indoors or under glass, to the outside garden or vegetable plot. You can start planting out vegetables in early spring but it’s usually better to wait until later springtime when the frosts have passed.


Your plants will be slower to grow in the cooler temperatures so there’s little benefit in putting them out earlier in the season.
 If you’ve sown vegetables indoors, give them some time to adjust to life outdoors by ‘hardening off’. This process lets your plants acclimatize to the moving air, different humidity, and temperatures of the outside world. When you simply place these types of plants outdoors without going through the hardening off process, their development can be detrimentally affected. To harden plants off:


Move plants sown inside your home to a cooler space such as an unheated greenhouse. You can leave your plants outside during the day but bring them in at night.
 You can make your life much easier—and your plant’s life more pleasant—when you plant your vegetables when the soil is easy to work with. Avoid gardening if the ground is still cold and hard.

 When making an important decision, it is best to think about the facts surrounding your decision, such as why and when. This will give you an opportunity to ensure that you are making the right choice. Ask yourself the following questions:


Why do I want to leave the team?
When do I want to leave the team? For instance, will you wait until the end of the season or leave immediately., Grab a sheet of paper and pen or use an electronic notepad to list your answers to the questions below. This will help you to gain confidence in your decision.How will leaving the team positively impact me? (list all of the pros)
How will leaving the team negatively impact me? (list all of the cons)

, Beyond the pros and cons identified, ask yourself whether or not leaving the team could negatively or positively affect your future (such as your college career).


If you are leaving to try another sport or to focus on schoolwork, you should feel confident about leaving because it will be beneficial to your future.
If you are leaving because there is a difficult situation that you have not been able to handle, you may consider staying and getting assistance with resolving the problem.
 If you are having a hard time making a final decision, you can speak with an adult whose opinion you trust in order to hear another perspective. They may have ideas or thoughts that you have not considered.
 Will you have a new coach, team, and replacement activity that will provide similar or more benefits than those gained in the sport that you are leaving? It may not be a good idea to leave the sport and then have nothing else to do in your free time, or to leave the sport and spend your idle time sitting on the couch or playing video games.


Your replacement activity should be of greater benefit to you in the short-term or long-term.

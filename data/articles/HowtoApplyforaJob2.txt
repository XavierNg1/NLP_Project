 Employers and recruiters often scour the internet looking for you, and any negativity they see can push you to the back of the pack.
 Clothes that make you feel good and confident can influence the way you carry yourself in an interview.
 Plan to arrive at interviews 10-15 minutes ahead of time to allow for any traffic or public transportation issues. This will also give you a few minutes to compose yourself and review any notes you have brought with you.
 Being positive and speaking about the job in a knowledgeable way shows you did your research, and that can win you big points.
 Ask you interviewer if it's ok that you take notes. Your notebook can double as a cheat-sheet where you list accomplishments and highlight stories that demonstrate your abilities.
 Following up with a thank you note after an interview demonstrates good manners, and leaves a lasting impression. Try to make the note substantive and mention what you were able to take away from the interview.

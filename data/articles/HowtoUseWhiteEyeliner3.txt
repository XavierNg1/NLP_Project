 Place your middle or ring finger directly beneath your eye. Gently tug down on the skin there, revealing the rim of the lower lid.


This step is especially helpful if this is the first time you've applied eyeliner to the lower waterline. If you're familiar with this practice and can see the rim of the lower lid without tugging it down, you can skip this step.
 Carefully trace over the lower waterline/rim using white eyeliner. Make sure the line of white extends from corner to corner.


Coloring the inner waterline with white liner can minimize redness, which may make you look more alert and less tired. Maximize the effect by extending the white liner into the naturally dark inner corner of your eye, as well.
Since this technique widens the eye, you may wish to avoid it if you have naturally large or predominant eyes. Apply white liner to the waterline under these circumstances could actually make your eyes seem washed out.

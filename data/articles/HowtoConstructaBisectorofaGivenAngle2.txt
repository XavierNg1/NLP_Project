 Open the compass to any width, and place the point of the compass at the angleâ€™s vertex. Swing the compass so that the pencil draws an arc that crosses both rays of the angle.For example, you might have angle BAC. Place the compass tip on point A. Swing the compass so that it draws an arc intersecting ray AB at point D, and ray AC at point E.
 Move the compass so that the point sits on the location where the first arc intersects the first ray. Swing the compass, drawing an arc inside of the angle.For example, place the compass tip on point D and draw an arc inside the angle.
 Without changing the width of the compass, move the point to the location where the first arc intersects the second ray. Swing the compass, drawing an interior arc that intersects the first interior arc you drew.For example, place the compass tip on point E and draw an arc intersecting the first interior arc. Label the point of their intersection point F.
 Use a straightedge to ensure that the line is accurate. This line bisects the angle.For example, use a straightedge to draw a line connecting points F and A.

 When you get into a discussion or argument, stand up for yourself, but don’t try to tear other ideas down in the process. You don’t have to “win” every time you disagree with someone. Hear the other person out, and then politely explain why you disagree with them.Say something like, “I see where you’re coming from, but I still see it this way because…”
A lot of minor disagreements aren’t worth getting worked up about. Save your energy by agreeing to disagree.
 There’s no right way to accomplish most things in life, so don’t expect people to do things exactly like you. If your method works for you, and their method works for them, neither of you is wrong or better than the other.

For instance, it doesn’t really matter if you and your spouse clean the kitchen differently, as long as the end result is a clean kitchen.
 Most people overestimate their own abilities and talents. This can lead to feeling like you’re better than other people, even though it’s just an illusion much of the time. Be aware of your biases, and be honest with yourself about your bad qualities as well as your good ones., Self-righteous people often try to bring others around to their way of thinking, but this won’t work. No one should feel pressured to give up their own ideas and quirks for the sake of fitting somebody else’s preferences. Live out your ideals proudly yourself, and accept other people the way they are.For instance, if you’re passionate about the environment and your family isn’t, don’t nag them to become more like you. Instead, focus on what you can do yourself, such as volunteering for community clean-ups.

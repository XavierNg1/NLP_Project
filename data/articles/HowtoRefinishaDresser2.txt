 This might be the backyard if the weather is good, the garage floor or a hobby room with plenty of ventilation and tarps on the floor.
 Place them on the ground singly (don't layer them), so that they can be attended to individually.
 In conjunction with the method specified for the old surface your dresser has on it (see articles suggested above), proceed to sanding off the surface. Even if you've used paint stripper, a hot-air gun, etc. to remove most of the old surface, sanding is still essential for removing any leftover stubborn or awkward spots, as well as smoothing the surface in readiness for the refinish. In general, the following things will apply to the sanding process:


If removing the old surface completely by sanding: Sanding a dresser will take a decent amount of time. You may need to set aside several days or slots in a row to complete this part. Start with a lower level of sanding grit, such as 150 grit, then work your way up to 200 to 300, depending on the surface. Each grade will do remove different parts of the surface, so don't skip the gradual changes in sanding grit levels.
While an electric sander is usually fine for large areas of the dresser, you'll still need to use a sanding block wrapped with sandpaper for tighter and harder-to-reach areas, such as corners or scorch marks, and more delicate surfaces, such as around decorative elements.
Stubborn areas of old finish may need special attention with a tool such as a razor blade, chisel, steel wool or similar, to lift off stuck or tough portions. Use with care. If you were removing the surface with paint stripper or a hot-air gun, all loose and blobbed paint and varnish should be removed first.

 The first step in using your microscope is turning on the light. You must be sure that the microscope is plugged in and turned on. A light will appear from below the stage of the microscope.The stage is the flat, plate-like surface on the microscope. It holds the slides that you will be observing.;
, Adjust the nosepiece so that the lowest magnification is in place. This might say 4X or 10X depending on the type of microscope that you are using. It is very important to start with the lowest magnification first in order to achieve the best focus on a microscope.The nosepiece is the rotating portion of the microscope above the stage. It will have three or four objective lenses attached to it.
The objective lenses are the magnifiers that are attached to the nosepiece. They will be labeled with their magnification level, which is typically 4X, 10X, 40X, and 100X. They will also be color coded for your convenience.
 You will place the slide below the objective on the stage of the microscope. Be sure to center the object you want to magnify directly under the objective. Use the stage clips to hold the slide in place.Be sure that the slide is about ¼” away from the objective. To adjust the distance, move the stage up or down.

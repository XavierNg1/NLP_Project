 Your greyhound is used to sleeping and eating in a crate already. A crate is a familiar housing that allows your greyhound to have personal space in your home. You can get a plastic crate (e.g. airline crate or Vari-Kennel) or a metal/wire crate.Airline crates are less expensive and are good for traveling. They also offer better protection in case your greyhound has an accident.
A metal crate is more expensive, but is a better option if you plan to wean your greyhound off of the crate. The metal crate will allow your dog to see what is happening in the house and allows your greyhound to become acclimated to the new environment more quickly.
Folding metal crates are available and can be more convenient if you will not use the crate all of the time.;
, You can either buy a bed or make a bed for your greyhound. If you purchase a bed, look for a bed that is washable and at least 34" x 44" if rectangular or 50" if round. If you make a bed, placing an old, thick comforter on the floor will be fine.You can place a thick piece of foam rubber under the comforter to make the bed extra comfortable.
If your greyhound will rest in multiple rooms, you will need to have comforter in each room.
A well-padded bed is absolutely necessary because greyhounds are very thin.
 Use baby or dog gates to create safe areas for your dog when you are not at home. Stairs should be blocked using gates because greyhounds are not used to climbing stairs. Also keep tops on any garbage containers and remove them from this safe space. This area can be used to keep your dog safe until he is housebroken.Choose a safe area that does not have glass doors or windows. Your greyhound does not understand glass and may try to go through the glass.
Kitchen counters and dining room tables are at the nose level of your greyhound. Remove food from these areas until your greyhound understands boundaries.

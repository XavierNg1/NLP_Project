There are several types of birth controls that only contain progestin - mini pills, hormonal injections, IUDs and a birth control implant. You should consult your doctor to decide which of these methods are best for your body before deciding which one to use.
The birth control injection and the IUDs or implants provide more long-term birth control, with the IUD and implant lasting up to 5 years. It may be a good idea to give the mini pills a try before committing to a long-term method.
 Most women do not experience any problems with their milk supply if they begin using the contraceptives around this time. Some believe that this type of birth control can actually cause the volume of milk to increase in comparison to the non-hormonal methods. However, it is still important to use caution when beginning any type of contraception while nursing and to pay attention to the amount of milk that you are producing once you begin using the contraception.
 Contraceptives containing estrogen have been shown to reduce your breast milkâ€™s quality and quantity. These types of combination contraceptives should only be used six months after you have given birth if you are nursing and also once your baby has begun to eat solid foods. Types of combination contraceptives are the vaginal ring, the pill, the patch and the injection.


It is important to understand that most contraceptives containing estrogen are not recommended to new mothers who are breastfeeding. If you feel that this is definitely the best type of birth control for you, you may want to consider not breastfeed or to discuss your options further with your doctor.
 This pill should be a last resort whether you are breastfeeding or not. However, if you do find yourself in this emergency type of situation and are breastfeeding, make sure to ask for the progestin only morning after pill, as there is also a type that contains both estrogen and progestin.

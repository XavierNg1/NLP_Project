;
, Generally, it will have one (or more) main sections with corresponding titles (headings). Each main section will have subsections (again, with corresponding titles, also known as subheadings) that go into greater detail. (If you are starting your document from scratch, preparing an outline of headings and subheadings is an excellent way to organize your thoughts!)

, In MS Word, click on the Format menu and select Styles and Formatting; most versions of Word will use a similar command. In lieu of the task pane, you might also use the Styles toolbar; it is a drop-down field in most Word configurations that displays "Normal" by default. In OpenOffice.org click Format then Styles and Formatting (or press F11)

, In the title(s) of your main section(s), place the mouse cursor and select "Heading 1" from the Styles toolbar or task pane. Notice that the paragraph is converted to a large, bold typeface.
 Notice that the Heading 2 copy is not quite as large or bold as the Heading 1 copy.
 Unless you are writing detailed technical, scientific or legal documents, you will probably not need to go farther than "Heading 3". (As a practical matter, few people can follow a discussion that uses more than four or five levels of headings. If your document needs more than four levels of headings, consider breaking the document up into multiple documents.)

, Instead, use the Styles toolbar or task pane and apply the styles "List Bullet" and/or "List Number". You can avoid having to insert bullet characters or numbers that way, and the software will usually even retain and update your numbering as you edit your copy.
 This is a clean, tight document that will go through most automated document converters and come out looking as good as when it went in.

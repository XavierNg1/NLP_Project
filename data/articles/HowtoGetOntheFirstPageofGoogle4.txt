 Keywords is Google's most powerful tool for website owners. It is a tool found within Google's AdSense website. For free, you're allowed to search and find what people are looking for most. For example, for your winery, search the term winery (applying any filters you think matter). Click on the Keyword ideas tab and it will tell you how often people are searching your term, what the competition is like, and suggest some alternatives that are also frequently searched. Look for the most popular keywords that are relevant to you and use them!

, Google Trends tells you specifically how interest changes in a topic over time. Search your term and look at the charts for months when you can expect a peak. Smart website owners will be able to guess why there's an increase and find a way to meet that need and set themselves apart.
 Businesses listed in Google Maps are displayed first when a user enters a regional search phrase. It's easy to add a listing; simply login to the Google account and fill out the online forms.

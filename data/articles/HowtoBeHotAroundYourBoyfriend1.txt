 While it sounds like the least glamorous advice possible, getting sufficient sleep is an important part of looking beautiful. While it's recommended you should get at least 7 hours a night, many try to slip by with far less than that. If you want to look and act your best, make sure to get enough rest.Your skin will dry and age faster if you don't.


It's also a good idea to try to fall asleep at the same time each night. Try to be awake for as much daylight as possible.
Your mood and energy will also be affected by the amount that you sleep. It should come as obvious that you won't be acting with the same charm if you're trying to fight off sleep.;
, If you want to look your best, it should be a no-brainer that you'll want to keep up with the absolute basics. Brushing your teeth at least twice a day, bathing or showering regularly, trimming toe and fingernails, and brushing your hair are just some of the things you should be keeping an eye on regularly.Even without any type of cosmetics, you can look very beautiful so long as you look healthy and well-maintained.
 Although wrinkles on their own aren't necessarily a bad thing, signs of aging may have an impact on your confidence.


It may be a good idea to buy a specific moisturizer for your eyes as well. Eye moisturizers use a more delicate material to adjust for the gentle skin around eyes.
 Regular exercise tightens up your skin and is an essential part of keeping your body in healthy order. Cardio exercise like running will help put you in a great mood throughout the rest of the day. Don't be afraid of working some muscle training into your workouts as well. Some women feel against it because they think it's too masculine. Muscle training is a great way to get fit for both genders however, and you'll look all the better once you commit to a regimen.

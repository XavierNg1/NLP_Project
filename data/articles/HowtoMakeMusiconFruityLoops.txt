 Do this by bragging the tempo in the middle of the program (at the top) up or down. It can be slow if you're making a sexy love-making beat or it can be fast if you're making a head banging gangster rap beat.;
, Search through the sounds to the left, as there are so many to choose from. Find the right ones and drag them to the correct spots.
 You can right click on an instrument to make it automatically play 2, 4, or 8 times in the pattern. Click in the pattern to make your beat how you want it.
Â Just click anywhere to the right to add it. Line them up together.
 Just click the + beside "pattern 1". Then go look for other sounds!! If you think you know of something you want to add, go to the top of the sounds and "search" for it. It may be there!!

, To make music just right click on a sample and hit PIANO ROLL. This way you can change what that sample is doing.
 Line them up how you want them.
 Go to FILE, EXPORT, and export as a wave. Sometimes the sounds get altered when you save as an MP3. You can always convert it afterwards with a website. And there you have it! That is the simple way to make a beat! Good job! Next stop... the Grammys?

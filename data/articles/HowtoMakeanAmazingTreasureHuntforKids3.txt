 There is a big difference in getting a kid ready for an indoor hunt and an outdoor romp around the woods. Since only you know the clues and destinations on the hunt, be sure to let people know what to wear.


Make sure you account for the weather as well, especially if you're outside. If it rains, can you still hold the hunt?, The general idea is that the first clue leads in some way to another location, which has a clue leading to another location, and so on until they reach the treasure. But the first clue is usually delivered in a dramatic fashion, kicking things off with a bang:


Presenting the clue in a cool box or wrapping, like a "wax sealed" envelope, a mini treasure box, rolled up in a bottle, etc.
Presenting the clue to everyone at once, like with a banner, sign, or by announcing it out loud.
Running a game or challenge, such as a pie eating contest, egg race, etc. When they finish the challenge, they get the first clue., While some challenge is good, and you don't have to help every time, kids will get quickly frustrated if they stall out on a clue. Have a couple of "back-up" clues in your brain to point kids in the right direction if you see them getting worried.


Let the kids know at the beginning where to find you or other parents. Make sure you tell a few other chaperones where the clues are located so that they can help as well., The last thing the kids will be thinking off as they dig for clues is hydration and sun block. So keep it on hand for them, or leave a few water bottles and block at some of the clues, allowing them to refuel on the go.


A couple boxes of granola bars are a great, on-the-go snack. You can pass them out at the beginning or give them out halfway through.
 Smaller children shouldn't be out on their own unless you can keep eyes on them at all times. The buddy system, where each kid has at least one partner to work with, will help them get through the hunt faster and much safer.

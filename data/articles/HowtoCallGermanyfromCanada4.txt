 "VOIP" stands for "voice over internet protocol," which just means your call is connected through the internet rather than through a land line. To be able to use this technology, you need a broadband internet connection. You can call regular landlines from VOIP phones, though it does depend on which service you use., Two of the major players in VOIP are Skype and Vonage.


Skype is free to use computer-to-computer. However, you must pay if you are calling a land line or a mobile number. Skype offers per-minute pricing or per-month packages for a certain number of minutes. They also have unlimited plans.Vonage has unlimited plans for calling worldwide, or slightly cheaper plans that have a per-month price and a per-minute price for other countries., Just as with land lines, you dial the exit code ("011"), the country code ("49"), and the number.If you are dialing from your computer with Skype, it can help you find the country codes you need.
To dial computer-to-computer, you need the other person's email address to add him or her as your contact. Then you can click on the person's name and call him or her as needed. You need a microphone and headphones for this to work well. You can also video chat if you have a webcam.
 If you are paying by the minute, pay attention to how long you are on the phone, so you don't spend too much.

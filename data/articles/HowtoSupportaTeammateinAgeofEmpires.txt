 There aren't many players who request resources because you should be able to get them by yourself. But sometimes they need your help because they get attacked by two enemies at the same time or if they could kill somebody but just need some resources to make the final move. Give them the requested resources when:


You don't need them to defend yourself






You see a reason in giving them resources






They could help you out with something






You have an overflow of the requested resource and really don't need it.

, If your teammate gets attacked it is always good to send some troops. It's very important that you think about your own safety. Some good players make fake-attacks where they send a small troop to one enemy so all the troops move there, so they can force all their strength on the other opponent and destroy him because he has no defense anymore. So always ask yourself: Am I safe when I send those troops there?

, Don't think about it; just send them there. When you wait too long, it's already too late and you never know if the enemies attack again after their troops got defeated. Try to attack the enemies' troops from behind so they have to fight on two fronts. Mostly the cannons stand at the back, so you can easily destroy them from behind. While your troops are fighting, build new units to bring them in or to prepare for a counterattack.
 When both enemies attacked, go for a counterattack. Try to hold the pressure and communicate with your teammate. When both attack at the same spot it is never as effective as when you attack from different directions.

 If you have a yard where your outdoor cat lives, you should provide as much as shade as possible. The best way to do this is to give the cat plenty of green plants that they can hide away from the sun in. The cat will naturally rest in the shade if they become too hot or sunny.Avoid planting azaleas, lilies, yew trees, aloe, wisteria, elderberry bushes, or nightshade. These could poison your cat if eaten.If the outdoor cat wears a collar, you should make sure it is a breakaway collar so that it does not catch and strangle the cat on the plants.
 Outdoor cat shelters are great in the summer for protecting the cat from harmful UV rays, and they can also keep the cat warm in winter. These shelters can be bought premade online or at a petstore. You may also consider building one yourself.


Make sure that the shelter is well-ventilated so that the cat can breathe in summer time. You may want to choose one with mesh or wire sides so that plenty of air gets in. This is important because the cat can overheat in summer time if it is too hot inside the shelter.
For a simple, cost effective design, you can cut a cat-sized door out of a plastic storage bin. Keep the lid on to protect the cat from the sun, and remove the lid if you need to clean the shelter., If your cat lives both inside and outside, you may want to keep them out of the sun during the brightest parts of the day. This is usually between 10 AM and 4 PM. This will protect them from sunburn while making sure that they do not get heatstroke.You may still let them outside in the early morning or evening.
 On a bright day, direct sunlight is not the only risk they face. Surfaces covered in asphalt or concrete can quickly heat up, burning your catâ€™s paws and skin. If you live in area with large spaces of asphalt, concrete, or sidewalk, you may consider covering an area with a blanket, plant, wooden pallet, or dirt. This will allow the cat to lay outside without burning their skin from the hot ground.

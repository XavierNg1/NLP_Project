 You have two options and MIT shows no preference for either one. Take the test with which you are the most comfortable.


The SAT or the ACT and 2 SAT subject tests: one in math and one in science.
The TOEFL as well as 2 SAT subject tests: one in math and one in science.

The second is recommended for students with lower English-speaking skills. MIT offers no ESL courses; therefore, a TOEFL score of 600+ and 100+ is recommended for the Paper Based Test and the Internet Based Test, respectively. For students residing in countries that do not offer the SAT or ACT, you will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will not be penalized.

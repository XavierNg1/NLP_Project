 You'll need knowledge of unicorn anatomy and history before you pretend to be one.;
, Are you a modern unicorn with the body of a horse and one horn? Or are you a traditional unicorn, with the tail of a lion and the hooves of a goat?

,, You'll need them to buy an animal (unless you already have it).
 Deer and llamas make good traditional unicorns, since they're slender with taller legs. Horses make good modern unicorns. If you're going for comedy, use a rhino (people sometimes say "Unicorns are real; they're just fat and grey and we call them rhinos"). Or for a really big unicorn, use an elephant. If you want a really small unicorn, buy a pet Pony, give it a horn, and go to the Pets Only Party.
 You can either buy one in the Horses Only Party, wait for it to return to the shop, or trade for one. Most are members only but there is one for nonmembers called the Icicle Horn. If you're going for traditional, the Icicle Horn is the best choice; ancient Greeks believed a ruby at the base of the unicorn's horn powered its magic, and the snow at the bottom of the Icicle Horn could be a substitute for that.

 For ringlets, you'll need the smallest rollers you can find. If your set comes with only larger rollers, see if you can borrow more small rollers from a friend, or buy an extra package from the store. Plug in the roller set and let it heat while you get your hair ready to make ringlets.
 While your hair is dry, spray it all over with a liberal amount of hairspray. This will keep the curls tight as they form over the hot rollers.
 Dividing your hair into three sections will make it easier to create ringlets. Make a middle section with two side sections. Use a comb to create a part on either side of your hair and separate the sections, then keep them apart using large hair clips.
 To create ringlets, roll your hair up vertically, rather than horizontally. Gather a small section of hair from just above your forehead. Hold the hot roller at the tips of your hair and roll down to the top of your head, so that the roller points from front to back instead of side to side. Repeat with the next section of hair and work your way all the way down to the neck. Create as many vertical rows of rollers as necessary to roll up all of your hair.
 Roll your hair in vertical rows extending from the top of your head, behind your ears and down to your neck. Roll up all of the hair on one side, then repeat on the other side. All of your hair should now be rolled up in vertical rows.
 Use extra-hold hairspray to spray your hair all over. Keep the rollers in until they are completely cool, about 20 minutes.
 Carefully remove the pins that hold the rollers in place and let your curls fall away. As you undo the rollers, you'll see that your hair has curled into tight, shiny ringlets. Simply scrunch some gel or a bit more hairspray into your hair with your fingers. Don't brush your hair, or the ringlets will fall apart.

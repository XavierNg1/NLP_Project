 if there are fewer than three authors. For both the first and subsequent in-text citations, both the authors should be listed out as (Dalton & Wade, 1989). The usage of et al. should be avoided because et al. always refers to plural authors, and (Dalton, et al., 1989) would indicate two authors aside from Dalton., on the subsequent citations for three, four, or five authors. Any time you have more than two authors, the potential for using et al. with in-text citation is there. As such, the first citation should spell out all their names, and any subsequent citation can include et al. after the first author. First citation – (Balboa, Creed, & Drago, 1985)
Subsequent citations – (Balboa et al., 1985)

, to all citations of works with six or more authors. Listing six or more authors is cumbersome, even for the initial reference. As such, using et al. allows the shortening of such references universally. For instance, authors Highway, Choozoo, Jones, Fragetti, Profile, and Johanson would be cited in-text as follows: First citation – (Highway et al., 1986)
Subsequent citations – (Highway et al., 1986)

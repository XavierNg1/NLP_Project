 Many sighted children learn and express multiple signs before speaking. If your child is struggling to communicate, signing can help them communicate what they want. It can help facilitate language skills and connect sign to spoken word.For blind children, sign can help with body awareness. It can also help teach your child that gestures and body language are a part of communication.
 You don’t need to teach your child proper sign language. Your baby has tiny hands and is still learning fine motor coordination. If the sign is difficult, find a way to simplify it. If your child modifies a sign, let them do it their way.If your child is trying to sign something, pay close attention as they may not sign it exactly.
Praise when they start to sign on their own, even if it’s an approximation.
 Your child will likely not start using or understanding the signs at first. Make sure you repeat the spoken word and the sign each time your child comes in contact with an object and use lots of repetition. Each time your baby comes in contact with the item, say and sign the word for them.When signing an item for your child, make the sign for them and repeat it. Repetition will help reinforce the connection between a sign and an object.
 When choosing what signs to teach your child, think about what is important and meaningful to them. You want your child to sign what their wants or needs are. Don’t focus on teaching manners (like “please” and “thank you”) at first, just focus on helping your child express their needs and feelings.For example, if you child loves crackers, teach them the sign for cracker. If your child loves their toy ball, teach the sign for ball.
You can also teach simple signs like “more” or “all done.”

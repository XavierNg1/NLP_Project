 You need to get to a pretty tall spot, and look around for the Nether Quartz Ore. Then go to it and use your pickaxe to mine it; each ore should drop 1 Nether Quartz (more if your pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune).
 4 Nether Quartz pieces put in a square in the crafting table give you 1 Block of Quartz, a whitish block. Quartz Blocks are only used for decoration; they have no unique characteristics.


A way to search for Nether Quartz Ore is to create a corridor inside the Netherrack. Every set amount of blocks, create smaller channels of 4-5 blocks to the sides of the main corridor. This exposes you to the most amount of blocks, increasing your chances of find Nether Quartz Ore.

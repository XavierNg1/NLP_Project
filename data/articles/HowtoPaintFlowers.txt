, Use short, light strokes and make the pieces of grass go in different directions so it looks more realistic. Use regular green and add light green if you'd like to get the 'highlighted' look or dark green strokes for shadow and texture.
 Using a darker shade of green, paint curved lines of medium thickness among the grass. These lines will become your flowers' stems, so make as many lines as you want flowers. The height of the lines should be quite a bit taller than the grass.









The thickness of the stem should be slightly thicker than the grass.
Add leaves or thorns to the stems to make the flowers look more realistic.
 Using whatever color you prefer, create a circle/oval about 1/2 inch above the tip of the flower stem. Leave room above the tip of the stem so that you can add petals.
 What color do you want your flower/s to be? You can mix colors, or just paint single color petals. Pick out the colors you want to use or mix colors to create new ones. Then, determine what shape you want the petals of the flowers to be. You may want to sketch the shape before you pain them. Connect the petals to the center of the flower. Connect the tip of the stem to somewhere in between two petals beneath the center.










Another optional step is to use a light blue colored oil pastel and lightly shade in a sky, then blend. Add a sun if you'd like.

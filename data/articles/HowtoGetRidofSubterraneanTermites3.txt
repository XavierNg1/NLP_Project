 If the problem is severe, and immediate attention is necessary, you can look into fumigation options for termite control. Fumigation has the advantage of being able to treat every part of your home and its structure in one go. It is normally only recommended if multiple colonies are found in a single structure., Fumigation is not something that you can carry out yourself. It involves your house being covered over with a giant tent, and fumigators pumping in gas which spreads throughout your home. It is supposed to seep into every crack and crevice in one treatment and kill off the termites that have taken up residence there.


A specialist will need to make specific plans for the particulars of your infestation.
 If your house is going to be fumigated, a pest control company will enter your home, and work for three to five days. Before they arrive you have to take precautions, including ensuring that all food is sealed well or removed from your home. The fumigators will take care of everything else and advise you how to be ready. You wonâ€™t be able to access the house until they are finished so you need to be prepared.There are two different types of poisons used to kill termites; one is a stomach poison, and the other a hormone which prevents termites to regrow a cuticle after moulting. The poisons have a two-fold benefit, since termites will eat the remains of their colony members.
Even post tenting and fumigation, a problem may flare up once more with termites; unfortunately, this procedure does not rid your home of termite eggs.

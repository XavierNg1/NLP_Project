 Despite your best efforts, your pets may continue urinating in your plants. Disciplining your pets will help them understand that urinating in your plants is unacceptable. To discipline your pets effectively, do so at the moment of the bad behavior. If you discipline after the fact, your pets will not know what they’re being punished for.If you don’t see your pets urinating in the plants, do not discipline them.
 If you see your cat urinating in your garden or in an indoor plant, use a spray bottle to squirt your cat with water.The sudden spray of water will startle your cat, but won’t physically harm it. After a few times of getting squirted with water, your cat will learn not urinate in your plants.


Use only one or two squirts of water.
Be aware that, if your cat’s outside on a hot day, it may enjoy the spritz of water., When your dog looks like it’s about to mark (lifting leg, sniffing around), interrupt it by saying ‘Oops!’ or some other firm word (no, stop). After you get your dog’s attention, give it a command, such as sit or lie down.Giving your dog a command will shift your dog’s focus to doing something that’s incompatible with urinating.
 Even if you’re frustrated with your pets urinating in your plants, do not yell at or physically abuse them. This is especially important if your dog is urinating in your plants because of emotional stress. Yelling at your dog would just make the stress worse, rather than stopping the bad behavior.Harsh punishment would make your pets fearful and wary of you.

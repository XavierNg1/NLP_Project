 Brass can be cleaned up easily with soap and water. Use hot water, and add some dish soap to the water. You can use a sink or a bucket. Let the brass soak in the solution for a few minutes, then gently scrub it with a microfiber cloth. Rinse when you're done.If the item is too big for a sink, try soaking it in a bathtub. You can also spray it on generously and let it sit for a few minutes. Spray on more if it looks like it's drying out too quickly.
 Tomato products have enough acid in them to help remove grime and tarnish from brass. Reach for items like tomato paste, ketchup, or tomato sauce. Rub it on the brass, and leave it for about an hour before rinsing and drying the brass.You can also try plain lemon juice., If you'd like, you can use a soft cloth to rub on mineral oil or linseed oil. This process will help keep tarnishing from forming on the brass. Only apply the oil once you've cleaned the brass.

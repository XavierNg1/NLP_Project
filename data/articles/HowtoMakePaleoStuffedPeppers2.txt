 Wash 6 large bell peppers and use a sharp knife to carefully cut the tops off of the bell peppers. Remove the cores and clean out the seeds in each pepper. You may want to rinse the insides of the bell peppers to completely remove the seeds. Set the peppers aside while you make the filling.You can use red, yellow, orange, or green peppers. You can also use a combination of these, if you like.
 Get out a large bowl and measure out your filling ingredients into it. You'll need to stir together 2 pounds (907 g) of ground sirloin, 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon of basil, 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper, 1 egg, 1/4 cup (28 g) of coconut flour, and 1 tablespoon of the spaghetti sauce.You could substitute ground turkey for the sirloin, if you prefer.
 Divide the sirloin filling between the pepper halves. You may need to use a spoon to stuff the filling down into each half. Place the stuffed peppers in a slow cooker and pour 1/4 cup (55 g) of the spaghetti sauce over each of them. Put the lid on the cooker and bake the peppers for 4 to 5 hours on HIGH or 6 to 8 hours on LOW.If you don't want to cook the peppers in a slow cooker, you can bake them in the oven. Cook them in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F (190 C) for about 40 minutes.

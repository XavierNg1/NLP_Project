 Lay the sheet of paper on top of it.


Ensure that one side of the duct tape sheet is as straight as it can be. Use this side as a guide and lay the paper on top of it. You're going to cut the edge that you want to be square by cutting along the edge of the paper.;
, Clamps can be used to hold duct tape to the paper.
, Use the edge that you just cut as the guide and move the clips there.
, This image shows a finished project with straighter edges than would have been accomplished freehand.

 Smaller varieties typically adapt to container growing better than standard-length varieties.


Look for "round" varieties that have a spherical shape. Options include Thumbelina, Parmex, and Parisienne.
Look for "Nantes" that have a tapered shape, but are shorter and wider than standard varieties. Options include Danvers Half Long, Chantenay Red Core, and Shin Kuroda.;
, Find one that is at least one foot (30.48 cm) deep or more. Carrots develop underground and the root system needs a lot of space to grow. The container should also have adequate drainage holes to prevent excess water from causing the carrots to rot.


The type of container does not matter much as long as it has enough depth. You can go with clay, plastic, or stone, and you can opt for a circular pot or a large rectangular planter.
 If you have a previously used container, wash it out with warm water and soap before planting your carrots. Bacteria and microscopic insect eggs often hide inside used containers and may hinder your yield if they infect your carrot plants.
 Both soil and soilless mixtures can work.


Try a mixture of red soil, decomposed compost, and sand mixed in equal portions for a soil-based media.
Consider coco peat, mixed with a small amount of perlite, for a soilless media.

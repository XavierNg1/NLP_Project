 The morning of a midday flight is not the time to start packing your luggage. Start preparing several days ahead or longer, to ensure you pack all that you will need and have time to buy or replace an item should you be missing something.


Most airports have small "general" stores or kiosks where you can buy commonly misplaced luggage items, though often at much higher prices than average. Still, this can be a reasonable solution should you forget an item you wanted to pack.
Adhere to all rules and restrictions about baggage. You do not want to get stuck paying airline baggage fees should your bags not comply with the rules.;
, An increasing number of airlines offer services where you can check in for your flight online, typically effective from 24 hours before your departure time. This method saves time at the airport, and you won't be as rushed.
 Make an effort to get to the airport on time, as you will have more time to get your tickets and everything you need to do ready to go. You should plan to be there no less than 2 hours before your scheduled flight. When you have everything ready for your flight, be patient, as there may be a long line heading into the plane.



When people start boarding, it is a good idea to hurry and get your bags checked and get on the plane. If you do not know where your plane is, how can you be ready to leave?

Various obstacles may affect your flight, including weather delays, mechanical problems, and many other problems may go wrong before you board. Be patient, and ready to board the plane.



The staff will most help you in telling you where your flight is, and what to do next, so it is always a good idea to listen to officials. Not only is this right, it is also expected and usually enforced.

 The zero multiplication facts are the easiest because every number multiplied by 0 always equals zero.


For example 0 x 1 = 0, 0 x 5 = 0, 0 x 8 = 0, etc.
 The one multiplication facts are easy to learn because when you multiply a number by 1, it is equal to that number. Remember, zero is the exception to this.


For example: 1 x 2 = 2, 1 x 4 = 4, 1 x 7 = 7, etc.
 When learning the multiplication facts for the number two, you may realize that the number being multiplied by 2 is simply added to itself. Instead of memorizing all of the numbers, just add the number to itself and you have learned the multiplication facts for the number two!For example 2 x 4 = 8, but 4 + 4 = 8.
The same goes for every other number, 2 x 3 = 6 (3 +3 =6), 2 x 5 = 10 (5 + 5 = 10), etc.
 The last digit of the product ends in either a 5 or a 0. The pattern starts with 5 and alternates with 0: 5, 0, 5, 0. For example: 5 x 1 = 5, 5 x 2 = 10, 5 x 3 = 15, 5 x 4 = 20, etc. There are two other tricks to help with the 5 facts as well: the product (1) is always half of 10 times that number and (2) is half the number times 10.For example: 5 x 4 = half of (10 x 4). 10 x 4 = 40, half of 40 is 20; 5 x 4 = 20.
Another example: 5 x 4 = (half of 4) x 10, half of 4 is 2, 2 x 10 = 20; 5 x 4 = 20.
 A helpful hint for the 6 multiplication facts is knowing the last digit of the product. This trick only works for even numbers. When you multiply 6 by an even number, the last digit of the product will be that number.For example: 6 x 2 = 12, 6 x 4 = 24, 6 x 6 = 36, 6 x 8 = 48, etc.
 A quick trick for learning the 9 table is to multiply the number by 10, then subtract that number from the product for the final answer.For example: 9 x 4. First multiply 4 x 10 = 40. Then subtract 4 from 40 to get 36. 9 x 4 = 36.
Another example: 9 x 8. 10 x 8 = 80, 80 – 8 = 72. 9 x 8 = 72.
Note the two numbers in the product will add up to 9! For 9 x 4 = 36, 3 + 6 = 9. For 9 x 8 = 72, 7 + 2 = 9. This works for numbers 2 – 9.
 When multiplying by 10, the product is equal to the number followed by a 0 at the end. Again, zero is the exception to this rule (0 x 10 = 0).For example 10 x 2 = 20, 10 x 7 = 70, 10 x 9 = 90, etc.
 The multiplication facts for 11 are pretty simple until you reach the number 10. Simply repeat the number you are multiplying by for the final answer. After 9, you need to memorize that 11 x 10 is 110, and 11 x 12 is 132.For example: 11 x 2 = 22, 11 x 3 = 33, 11 x 4 = 44, etc.

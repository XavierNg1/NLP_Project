,, Chop down some maple trees to keep your rating at 100%. You should get back a minimum of 1.2m but more than this if you can afford., The reason this is most effective is not only will the herbs give you mass amounts of high-tier herbs such as ranarr and avantoe, they also give you the seeds. With maples, the logs are just icing on the cake as what you are really looking for is the bird's nest. If you open them, you are looking for high levelled tree seeds like magic and yew. Even if you don't get lucky with the nests, crushing them makes them worth 8 thousand a piece due to their use in Saradomin's Brews.

Do something else to fill the day, because you only need to return once.

 Mix three parts water with one part liquid fabric softener inside a standard spray bottle.









Put the top on the bottle and shake vigorously to combine.
You need to use a combination of water and fabric softener. This technique will not work correctly if you only use plain water. Do not use detergent, however, since you will not be rinsing the detergent out.
 Douse the area you want to shrink using your diluted fabric softener. Make sure that the entire area is well-soaked.









The dry portions of your jeans will not be affected.
This method is especially helpful if the waistband has begun to stretch out. If this is the case, spray the solution on the waistband of your jeans, saturating the fabric completely around the entire band.
 Put your jeans through a standard drying cycle using the hottest heat setting possible.









The high heat should cause the fibers of the wet fabric to constrict.
Air drying the jeans will not have the same effect.
 If the area does not shrink as much as you would like, apply more of your fabric softener solution and dry it again.

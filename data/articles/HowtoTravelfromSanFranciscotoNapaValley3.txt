 A bevy of companies offer shuttle tours of Napa Valley. They usually depart early in the morning, cover wineries entrances and bring you back in the early evening. You can also find shuttles that do more activities than wine tasting, like hiking, sightseeing and theme parks.
 You can also book the shuttle while you are in San Francisco, but there may be limitations if you only book it a few days before.
 Enjoy the Napa Valley on a shuttle tour.

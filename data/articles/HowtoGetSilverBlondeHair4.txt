 These often smell a little funky, and the color can be scary at first, but purple shampoo and conditioner will help keep your hair that striking white color, without developing brassy tones. The concept is similar to when people with blotchy skin use green face powder to reduce the redness of their complexion; because purple is the opposite of yellow, it counteracts those unwanted hues, and keeps your hair looking silver.You can use these once or twice a week. Don’t overdo it – everyday use will give you too strong a hue.
 This will help keep your hair that pristine white color. Some toners are also purple, like shampoos and conditioners designed for bleached hairs. The application process will be different for different toners, so follow the instructions on the box.


Again, be sure not to overdo it. Touch up with toner every couple of weeks at most. More than that and your color might start to look drab and flat.
Consider having this done professionally the first time around if you have never done it before. Your stylist can teach you some tricks to make sure you are comfortable doing it on your own., Bleaching does an incredible amount of damage. It will need to be treated with extra care.


Only wash it a 3 or 4 times a week, and apply a hair mask every time you do.Blow dry and curl it as infrequently as possible, and use products designed to protect hair from heat when you do.
Use only sulfite-free products, to avoid damaging and yellowing your hair.Once or twice a month, apply liquid coconut oil to the ends of your hair, wrap it in a towel, and let it sit for a few hours.

 For this piece, choose a very eclectic mixture of your finest, most fun and funkiest buttons. This is a showpiece, to show off buttons in the same manner as a charm bracelet.
 On a flat surface, work out the order in which you'd like the buttons to be placed. It is important to do this now, so that you can switch buttons around and out until you're happy with how the bracelet looks.
 Sew a clasp finding onto the thread first. Tie a knot either side to keep it in place.
 It should sit firmly in place next to the clasp finding.
 Continue following the pattern you've arranged from the buttons.
 When you reach the end, be sure to leave enough thread in place for finishing with the other part of the clasp finding. Stitch it on and the bracelet is complete.
 Check that it is secure and push the buttons into place, as desired.

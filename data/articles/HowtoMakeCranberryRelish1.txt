 Wash one orange and peel it. Carefully use a sharp knife to cut the orange into eight pieces. If the orange has seeds, remove them and throw them away. You should also wash and dry 12 ounces (340 g) of fresh cranberries.You could substitute other citrus for the orange. Use lemon or grapefruit for a refreshing taste.;
, Put half of the cranberries and half of the orange pieces into a food processor or blender. Blitz the fruit until it's chopped as fine as you like. Scoop the chopped cranberries and oranges into a serving bowl. Process the rest of the cranberries and orange pieces and add them to the serving bowl.If your blender or food processor is large, you may be able to blend all of the fruit at once, instead of in batches.
 Stir in 3/4 cup (150 g) of granulated sugar and taste the cranberry relish. If you'd like a sweeter relish, add another 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar and taste the relish again. Continue tasting and adjusting the sugar until the relish is as sweet as you like it.At this point, you can stir in additional ingredients or refrigerate the relish until you're ready to serve it.

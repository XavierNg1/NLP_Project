 If the filter gets clogged with sediment, you can have trouble accelerating and might suspect your fuel pump has got a problem. To check it, remove filter from vehicle and drain excessive fuel from filter. Use a short piece of rubber hose on the filter inlet. Blow through the filter inlet, paying attention to the resistance, which should be minimal. Inspect the screen for debris and replace the filter if necessary by blowing through the outlet side of filter into a white rag or towel., Commonly available at most auto parts stores for $20-30, a pressure gauge is a good investment, useful on most makes and models of cars. If you don’t want to buy one, you can also often borrow one from machine shops or auto shops who have them to lend. The test only takes a few minutes.
 Locate your fuel pump test point, which is usually near the fuel injectors, and locate the point at which the pump hooks up with the filter injector rail. There should be a separation joint or a test port, where the pressure gauge attaches.


Different gauges may have slightly different instructions, and the location of the fuel pump varies from vehicle to vehicle, so consult your owner’s manual for more specific instructions., Let the engine warm up slightly, then check the pressure both at idle speed and at the rated speed listed in your pump specifications. If you don’t know the rated speed, just rev the engine and see how the pressure reacts. If you have a serious problem, the needle won’t go anywhere or goes down below specifications, meaning the fuel pump needs to be replaced.


The pressure should match the specifications listed in the repair manual, and should increase as you rev the engine. If it doesn’t, you need to replace your fuel pump and filter.

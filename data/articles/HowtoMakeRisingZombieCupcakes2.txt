 These cupcakes can be normal size or large, depending on how large you intend to make the hand decorations.
 Dust with cocoa for the "soil".
 Note that this step may need to be done before making the cupcakes and frosting them, depending on how much time the hands need to dry before adding to the cupcakes. In most cases, it can't hurt to make these at least a day ahead. To make:


Roll enough balls for the amount of cupcakes (for example, a dozen balls).
Press the end of each ball to flatten into a cylinder.
Flatten one end into a rounded shape.
Carve out the thumb, followed by the fingers on the flattened round part.
Mold the fingers and thumb to look realistic. Use a knife and toothpick as molding aids.
Use a toothpick to create the impression of a fingernail on each finger and thumb.
Most importantly, aim for the entire hand to be bent to look like a claw.
Continue until you've made all the remaining hands.
Allow to dry.
 Push a hand into each cupcake. Sprinkle with more cocoa if needed.


At this point, add any further embellishments needed, such as candy insects, red piping gel for blood, etc.

 Formatting your memory card will erase all of the data on it. Make sure that any pictures or other files that are currently stored on the card have been properly backed up to another location if you wish to save them.
 If you are using your memory card for a digital camera, it is always recommended that you format it in the camera itself instead of on your computer. This ensures that you get the most storage possible out of the card, as different cameras use slightly different formatting methods.


Your camera's documentation will have the exact steps you need to take to format your card, but these steps will generally work with most cameras.
You should format the card in the camera even if the card came pre-formatted.
 Use the dial or menu system on your phone to switch it to Playback mode. This is usually designated by the universal "Play" triangle.
 The structure of the menu will vary from camera to camera, but you are looking for a "Format" option. Refer to your documentation for detailed instructions.
 The formatting process will take a few moments, and all existing data on the card will be erased. Afterwards, the card will be ready to use with the camera.

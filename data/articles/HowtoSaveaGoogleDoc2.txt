 When someone shares a document with you, may not receive editing or ownership rights. In order to make changes to the document, you need to create a copy of it, which you will then own. Open the shared document via email or Google Drive.


This mode is called "View Only.", Select File > Make a copy > OK. The new copy will automatically open and save.


As you alter the document, these changes will automatically save.
If you were the original owner of the document, you will have the option to share the file with the original group., Once you have made a copy of the shared document, you are the owner of the file. Under the "Ownership" column in your Google Drive, you will see "Me." As the owner, you may retitle the document if you desire.

 Stationary sprinklers are placed in position and water is released through several tiny holes in the head of the sprinkler.

The water pressure with these sprinklers is lower than other types. This is what makes them suitable for smaller lawns.
The amount of area that is covered is related to the pattern and size of the holes in the head of the sprinkler.;

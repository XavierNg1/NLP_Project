 Each one should be smaller than the previous one.;
, One should be in the middle, and the others should be in three of the corners. Draw an anvil shape in the remaining corner.
 These are the seals. Remember to put the value of the bill in the corners as well!

 (This step isn't 100% necessary, but go ahead and vine it up if you are so inclined.)

 You're done!

 When you are printer, you will need to have the ability to deal well with clients and have the ability to market your printing products. Printers also need to feel comfortable around computer hardware, software and printing equipment.;
, Many printers will go to a 4-year university or attend a technical college in order to earn a bachelor’s or associate’s degree in graphic design. Other majors pursued by future printers include graphic arts and printing technologies.
 Before you attempt to search for a post-collegiate job, see if your school can offer assistance. Many colleges hold career fairs and other events to help you find a job as a printer.
 An apprenticeship allows you to work underneath a master printer in order to learn the trade. You will not likely get paid much and sometimes not at all, but it will help you garner experience in the printing industry. To find apprenticeships, scour newspapers and online classified ads.
 Some methods that may be employed by a printer include monotype, dry point and etching. The more methods you know how to employ, the larger your customer base will likely be.
 Most likely, you will have studied different printing programs during college. However, if you have not, you should take extra courses to learn the basics of popular software used for desktop publishing. These applications include Creative Suite, Quark, InDesign and PhotoShop. You can learn the programs through your apprenticeship or study them through online tutorials.
 Once you have completed your apprenticeship, you can branch out as an independent printer. You can possibly secure a position with the printer you have worked under, find a new printing company to work for or open your own printing company. Besides classifieds, you can look for printing job openings by joining a print industry union or organization.

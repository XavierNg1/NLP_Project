 If you have multiple birds, it is best to move a bird that isn’t feeling well into another cage in a different room. This helps reduce stress for your sick bird, and helps stop contagious diseases from spreading to your healthy birds., Sick birds need special care from a vet that focuses on treating birds, commonly called an avian vet. If you think your lovebird may be sick, call your local avian vet immediately to make an appointment.If you think your bird is critically sick, ask for recommendations for an animal hospital if your vet can’t see you immediately.
Ask the vet about what steps and precautions you should take with the bird for the time in between your call and your appointment.
 Stress can cause the onset or worsening of some diseases in birds. Reduce stress by keeping perches low, making sure food and water are easy to reach, minimizing handling, and allowing a quiet space for your bird to rest., Unless your bird is running a fever, supplemental heat is necessary as birds lose body heat rapidly when sick. Use a heat lamp to provide your bird with an environment around 80° to 85° F (26°-29° C).Natural sunlight is also important to help ward off vitamin D deficiencies. Place your bird in an area with access to natural light, or use full-spectrum lamps to provide the UVA and UVB rays they need., Help eliminate bacteria that can grow in dirty cages by removing old cage liner or paper and rinsing out food and water dishes with soap and hot water daily. Additionally, the cage and all toys, dishes, and accessories should be disinfected using a purpose-made birdcage disinfectant once a week.Remember to allow the disinfectant to dry completely before rinsing it away with hot water. The cage and equipment should then be allowed to dry again before returning your lovebird to its home.

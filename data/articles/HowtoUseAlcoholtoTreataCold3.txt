 Drinking alcohol to treat a cold cannot replace modern medicine or rest. Drinking too much alcohol can cause liver damage in the long run and can also make cold symptoms, such as congestion, sore throats, and coughing, much worse. These remedies are best used occasionally., Drinking too much alcohol can weaken your immune system, making it easier for you to get sick. When you are already sick, your immune system is weaker than normal. This means that drinking alcohol while sick may make it even more difficult for you to recover., When you are sick, you need to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids; this helps improve sore throats and congestion. Certain fluids, such as alcohol and caffeine, can dehydrate you instead, making things like congestion, sore throats, and coughing worse., Many medicines used to treat colds react negatively with alcohol. Combined with alcohol, they could cause dizziness, drowsiness, fainting, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Check the user instructions you got with your medicine before drinking, and check the warning label. Common cold-related medicines that should not be taken with alcohol include:aspirin
acetaminophen (Tylenol)
ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
naproxen (Aleve)
cough syrups (Robitussin Cough, Robitussin A-C)
azithromycin (Azomax, Zithromax), Asthma can be triggered in known asthmatic patients after catching the common cold. A study found that certain additives in alcohol can worsen this respiratory condition as well. Try other common cold treatment options that are alcohol-free in order to ensure your safety.

As an exception, pure ethanol may have some therapeutic effects in treating asthma.

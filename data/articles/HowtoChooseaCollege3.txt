 Consider the school’s overall reputation. If you’re going into a competitive field, you will want to go to a well-known school. If you have less ambitious goals, a small college may make more sense.
 You will need to take a hard look at the money you have available to you (via family, scholarships, grants, and loans) versus how much the school costs. Even with loans, more expensive schools may be out of the question.
 You should balance the cost of the school against your future income potential. If you choose a very expensive school and are paying mostly through loans, it may not be a very good idea to plan on becoming a professional artist (for example), as your future income will likely be minimal and sporadic.
 For example, business and accounting schools are accredited by the AACSB. Pharmacy schools use AACP. A college lacking accreditation may hurt your employability, chances of getting into graduate school, in addition to possibly having to take courses over if you decide to switch from an unaccredited school to an accredited one.

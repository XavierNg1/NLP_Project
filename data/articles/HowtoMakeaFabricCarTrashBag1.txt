 You may want to purchase extra fabric so you can make additional bags or to use in case you make an error during stitching or creating.


Cut two pieces of fabric to make your bag--front fabric 22" x 13" and lining fabric 22" x 12.5."






Cut one piece from the other fabric piece for your binding--22" x 3.5."






Create the bag handle from the same material you used for the bag (or you could purchase another style/pattern) that is 22" x 2.5."





;
, You can either hand sew your creation or use a sewing machine if you have one.
, You can pick this up at a local craft or fabric store.

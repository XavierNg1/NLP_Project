Examine the Control Scheme. Obviously, you must learn the controls before you can play. You should probably use the Default Control Scheme. However, you can change to other Control Schemes using the menu.

However, each of the control schemes come with their own advantages. For example, the Bumper Jumper scheme allows you to turn and jump/melee at the same time, etc., etc. Try learning to use more than one, and switch when you've got a better advantage with one over the other.

 There are several choices, such as:


Simply hang on the wall as it is
Frame it either using cardstock or a wooden frame, then hang or lean on a shelf
Take a photo and share it online (if it's not already digital)
Share online if digital; use photo and craft sites, as well as social media sites to let people know about your craft efforts
Consider ways of including the collage into other art or craft projects, such as varnishing it into a wardrobe panel, decoupaging it onto a wooden box or sewing a fabric one onto clothing.

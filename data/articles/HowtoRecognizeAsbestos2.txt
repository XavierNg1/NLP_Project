 Asbestos was molded into many different shapes and sizes to fill different needs. For example, sheets of asbestos were used to make up walls, and slats of asbestos were created to serve as roof tiles. Each mold has a different location that may be stamped with manufacturer’s information. This information sometimes discloses whether or not the material contains asbestos., Once you’ve identified the mold, look for any information that the manufacturer stamped or printed. If you find it, look for codes such as AC (contains asbestos) or NT (does not contain asbestos). Note that not all pieces will have this information., Some manufacturers used different codes at different times. If you can find any codes or markings on the material, try to look it up. Sometimes you can find the meaning of the code and determine asbestos content. Other times, information about the code is not made available.

 For the ultimate in nasty, zombie nails be sure you find the right color of pallid green to use as your base coat. Other polish considerations include red (for blood), black (for bruising and dirt), white, yellow and even purple.
 Consider using a uniform color such as green or yellow to achieve the full effect.
 Unlike the skull nails, zombie nails are messy and dirty, so your nail art should represent this. Consider painting splashes and splatters of red (blood) on some nails, creepy eyeballs and stitching on others.
 For example, cover your hand, exposing only one finger and go for the blood splattered look with red polish. Or use a dotting tool and a toothpick to create a bulging eye with blood oozing. Remember--there are no hard and fast rules on these nails, the grosser the better!

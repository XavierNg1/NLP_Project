 Use sandpaper, and do it by hand, as a hand sander won't be able to push the paper into the open grain. Hand sanders can also sand off too much grain and leave uneven surfaces.


Vacuum up the residue after going over the cabinets with the sandpaper. Any un-vacuumed or uncleaned residue will make its way into the final coat of paint â€” not a good thing.
Go over the vacuumed areas with a tack cloth, ensuring that all the residue has been wiped away. Unfold, and then crumble the tack cloth to grab more dust and residue.
 Priming is a very important step in painting cabinets, because raw wood may discolor or stain the paintwork if it has not been properly sealed. If you're priming on a tight-grained woods like maple or cherry, an oil- or shellac-based primer works fine. If you're priming on an open-grained wood like oak, you may need to use a thicker primer, such as brushing putty.


Start at the top of the cabinet and work your way down. Start off brushing against the grain and move back over the same spot, going with the grain.
Give the primer at least a day to dry.
Use a quality nylon-polyester brush to apply the primer. Understand that you may have to throw away your brush after each coat of primer, depending on the primer.
After the primer has dried, sand down any uneven surfaces using a random-orbit sander and 220-grit paper.
 Use vinyl spackle and a putty knife to fill any large holes, dents, dings, or scrapes. Go over open seams between wood with latex caulk, smoothing out the caulk with a dampened finger.
 If you've spackled any areas, or have had burn through on your primer, spot prime these areas with spray-on primer and let dry. Once the primer has dried, go over it with 280-grit paper, using a light motion. Vacuum and go over areas with tack cloth again.

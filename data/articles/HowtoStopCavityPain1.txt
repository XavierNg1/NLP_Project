 One way to get rid of cavity pain is to go to the dentist. Your dentist will do an exam and get x-rays of your teeth to see where any cavities or other tooth or gum problems are. Then, your dentist will suggest the best course of treatment for your cavity.The most common treatment for cavities is a filling. If the tooth is infected or abscessed, your dentist may prescribe antibiotics first to clear up any infection, which is important to avoid any further complications.;
, If your tooth or gum aches because of a cavity, taking over-the-counter pain relievers may help reduce the pain. You can take ibuprofen (Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin.Follow the dosage instructions on the label.
Make sure not to let aspirin dissolve on the tooth or gum. This may harm your mouth and teeth., You can try numbing gels around the area of the cavity to help stop the pain temporarily. Numbing gels contain benzocaine. You should spread the gel on your gums with either your finger or a cotton swab. Make sure you donâ€™t swallow the gel. Spit out the gel left in your mouth.Read and follow the instructions on the box or tube to know the amount of gel to apply and how often you should apply the gel.
Keep in mind that if your saliva flow increases after you have applied the gel, that is absolutely normal. Your tongue may also go numb for a while, so you may want to avoid talking for a while or you may bite your tongue accidentally.

 Scoop approximately 1 cup of cooked vegetables from the bowl and place them inside the blender or food processor. Puree the vegetables in batches, adding a little water as necessary to achieve a smooth texture.For best results, try not to puree more than 1 cup of softened vegetables at a time.
Scrape the puree out of your food processor or blender and put it into a separate container. Store the puree for later use or use it in a recipe according to the instructions.
 A food mill is a large metal perforated bowl fitted with a blade. As you crank the handle, the softened vegetables are smashed and pushed through a strainer and come out in pureed form.You don’t have to peel the vegetables for this method since the food mill will naturally separate the flesh from the skin. You’ll have a chance later on in the process to discard the skins and seeds.


Place a large bowl on your countertop. You will need this bowl to catch the puree as it comes out of the food mill.
Place 1 cup of softened vegetables into the mill.
Turn the handle in a clockwise direction with your dominant hand as you hold onto the contraption with your non-dominant hand. The pureed vegetable flesh will be pushed through the strainer into your bowl.
 An immersion blender, or hand-held blender, can be used to puree the vegetables right in the bowl or the pot you cooked them in if you add a little water. Place the immersion blender into your bowl of vegetables so that the blade is about 1” beneath the top layer of vegetables. Turn the blender on and guide the blender through the vegetable pieces in a circular motion. Continue blending until all of the pieces are pureed.


If you raise the blade above the level of the vegetables, then the blade will spatter vegetable pieces and make a mess. Turn the blender off while it is still beneath the surface of the puree to prevent spattering.
When the blade has stopped spinning, lift it out of the puree and set it aside.

, This will open your Snapchat Home screen.
 This button is in the upper-right corner of your Home screen. It will open your Settings menu.
 This option will be at the bottom of the MY ACCOUNT section on your Settings menu.
 The switch will turn green. All of your Stories will now automatically save to your Memories collection.


If your Save To... option under SAVING is set to Camera Roll Only, you won't see the Auto-Save Stories switch on the menu. You have to change it to Memories or Memories & Camera Roll.

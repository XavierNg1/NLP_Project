 Using a soft-leaded pencil and slate write down commonly occurring questions or observations before you enter the water. This way you can simply point to them underwater and receive nonverbal responses.;
, The slate should refer to things like elapsed time, air supply, directions, etc. You can also list common fish you are likely to encounter while on the journey.
 This will be important and potentially useful in case of emergency.

 Muslims pray at specific times of day and you will need to learn and observe these times. You can look them up, ask your imam, or get a handy app or program for your mobile device or computer.
 You will need to face Mecca when you pray. This is an important part of prayer for Muslims. You will need to look up what the proper direction is for the area in which you live. Alternatively, you can get an app or program for your phone or computer which will act as a compass and point you in the right direction no matter where you are.
 There are specific ways that Muslims are supposed to sit, stand, bow, and move their hands and bodies during prayer. These can be rather complicated and you may need to do some research. You can also learn by watching fellow Muslims, either out and about or at your local mosque.
 Begin your prayer in the proper way. Muslim prayer is much more specific and rigid than Christian prayer. The standard opening is to call "Allah - Wa - Akbar" and then recite the Isteftah Dua and Surah Al- Fatiha.
 Recite the Surahs appropriate to the time of day or that are being recited by your fellows nearby. If you are alone, you can recite whatever Surahs you believe are appropriate.
 The rakats, or cycles of prayer, are standardized and a different number of cycles is prescribed for each time of day. Know what is the appropriate number and try to perform at least that many.
 End your prayers in the normal way by turning your head to the right and saying, "As Salam Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu'." The angel who records your good deeds is to this side. Then, turn your head to the left and say, "As Salam Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu'." The angel who records your wrongful deeds is to this side. Now your prayers are over.

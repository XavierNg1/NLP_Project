 But if you do wear makeup and want to do it differently for formal, try a slightly more dramatic make up look than you normally wear.


Apply a luminous foundation, and use concealer to hide any red spots or blemishes that you might have.
Sweep some blush on your cheekbones, and wear clear lipgloss or a light nude lipstick.

Apply black eyeliner to your upper lash line, and use a shimmery neutral eye shadow across your eyelid.
Apply several coats of mascara to lift your lashes and make your eyes look large.



Try wearing your hair in loose, beachy waves.You can leave it tousled around your face or pull half of it back.
Add accessories. Accessories like headbands or flower crowns can be a great way to achieve formal style with minimal effort.
 Wearing your hair up to your eight grade formal will keep it out of your face while you dance. It’s also the ideal way to create an intricate hair style.


Wear your hair in a simple bun or French braid, or experiment with combining braids and updos.
If you don’t want to do your hair yourself, ask a friend or go to have it done at a salon. If you get your hair done, make sure to allow plenty of time before the dance is scheduled to begin.

 Fold it in half the other way, then unfold it. Fold it diagonally, then unfold it. Fold along the other diagonal, then unfold it.
 Take the edge points of the half-fold and bring them together, so that the diagonals become the edges and the paper becomes a triangle. Press it so that it lies flat in this shape.
 With the open section closest to you, take one of the four bottom corners and fold it up to the top point.
, Take the corner that you folded up to the first point and bend it down to tuck it into the pocket formed by the smaller triangle. Flatten.
 They should look like mirror images.
 You will need to flip the paper to do the other two.
 Fold the top and bottom points towards the center on one side and then back to the center on the other side.
 Spread open the paper so that it forms an X.
 Blow a quick puff of air into the hole to blow up the paper like a balloon. This will form the cube. Pinch and fold into the preferred shape and enjoy!

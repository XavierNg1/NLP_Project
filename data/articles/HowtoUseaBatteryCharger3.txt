 Over time, dirt, grime, or corrosion may have degraded the connections of your charger's charging plates or clamps. If you notice a white film, rust, or other signs of dirtiness, you may want to clean the connections with a manual recommended cleaning product.


Consumer battery charger connections can sometimes be cleaned with alcohol, but you should consult your manual to prevent accidental damage to your charger.
Car battery chargers can be cleaned with a solution of baking soda and water., Sometimes a battery will sit in its charging slot slightly askew, which can prevent your battery from charging. Make sure the positive and negative ends of your battery are completely connected to your charger connectors.
 Some chargers, especially the high amperage charger you may use on your car, can draw too much current and blow an electrical fuse. This can even happen in outlets equipped with a wall fuse. Check your fuse box or wall fuse to make sure your charger is receiving power, and reset any blown fuses.
 Charging a battery isn't a perfectly efficient process. Some electricity will be lost during the exchange of energy between your charger and battery. Due to this fact, you will have to put 120% - 140% of the full capacity of your battery back into it. A slower charge will result in greater efficiency, less potential for damage caused by over-charging, and better performance.

 Don’t let one problematic relationship blind you to the fact that you have plenty going on in your life and have a lot to look forward to. Instead, try to think about the good things the future has in store for you.


Think about where you’ll be in 1, 5, or 10 years. Does she really figure into your life plans?
Consider other girls you know and may be interested in dating. That should give you motivation to try to avoid her., Without confidence, you’ll likely get involved with people who aren’t good for you. There are several things you can do to build your confidence:


Ask prior romantic partners about your positive attributes.
Avoid scrutinizing yourself and focusing on your negative qualities.
Tell yourself that you are an awesome person and should be valued and loved., The easiest way to avoid a girl that doesn't love you is to look around for those that may truly value you. By getting out into the world and meeting a lot of people, you’ll set yourself up for positive and healthy relationships. Try to truly take in the compliments you receive from others, and try to build those positive relationships.


Look for people who share your interests.
Don’t view one or two dates as a commitment. Play the field a little and try to date a lot of people. The more people you meet, the more likely you are to find someone that will share your feelings.
Get to know people in your friend group.

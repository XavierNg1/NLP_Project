-The app store is a light blue icon with an encircled "A" made of paint brushes on it; you can usually find it on the home screen, or you can swipe down from the middle of your iPad's screen and type "App Store" into the search bar to find it.
 This will take you to the app update page.
 Although most apps can function well without the micro-updates that publishers put out, you should try to keep your apps up to date as often as possible for best results.

 The act of rolling your eyes is pretty simple, once you figure out how to do it. To start: look up as high as you can without moving your head. In other words, bring your gaze to the apex of your eye sockets, or stare up into your forehead. Now, take the time to swing your gaze in an arc from one side of your eyes to the other, all the way around. Someone looking at you will see your pupils "roll" over the top of your eyes, so that the whites of your eyes are showing., If you roll your pupils high enough, your eyes will appear pure white. Keep your gaze firmly fixed at the upper inside of your eye sockets. Roll your eyes further and further back into your head until you can swivel them no more.

Take a picture of yourself to confirm that you've rolled your eyes in the way that you intended. Alternately, ask a friend to watch you do it and offer feedback. You won't be able to use a mirror to watch yourself.
 The eye roll is an expression that humans use to convey a feeling of displeasure to other humans.You're doing it for an audience, not for yourself â€“ so it is important to know your audience. Sometimes, you might roll your eyes at someone to show them that you are annoyed with them, that you don't believe them, or that you aren't interested in what they're saying.Other times, you may roll your eyes at Person A behind the back of Person B in order to tell Person A that you're frustrated with Person B. Be careful: if Person B notices, he or she might not be amused.


If you're rolling your eyes at a group of people, you might be genuinely trying to express your frustration, and you might just be looking for a laugh. If you're going for dramatic effect, you'll want to exaggerate the eye roll as much as possible so that it's more noticeable.
If you only want one person to "receive" the eye roll, try locking eyes with them first. Once you have been looking into each other's eyes for a brief instant, roll your eyes and make sure that they see it.

 For large areas, rent or buy a lawn spreader or a mechanical seeder, which shoots grass seed evenly across the lawn. For small areas, spread grass seeds by hand.


Use the amount of seed recommended by the lawn care expert at your home and garden store. It is important to use the correct amount of grass seeds to ensure your lawn grows evenly.
Do not overseed your lawn. Do not use up extra seed by spreading it over the lawn. Overseeded areas will grow thin, unhealthy grass, because seedlings will compete for limited nutrients.
 Newly planted seeds need to be protected from the elements until they take root. A thin layer of topsoil will help, but it's best to use a loose layer of mulch to help retain moisture.You can distribute this by hand or with a cage roller.


Yellow grain straw is a popular choice, since it's cheap and easily broken up by the mower once your lawn is established. Avoid hay, which has too many seeds, and fresh pine straw, which slows grass growth. (Aged pine straw is fine.)Other forms of mulch will also work, but apply dense materials such as compost or sawdust in layers no thicker than Â¼" (6 mm)., Set your garden hose head to the "mist" setting and lightly water the seeds until it is thoroughly damp. For a larger lawn, run a sprinkler in the center of the area for a few minutes.


Don't use a powerful stream of water, or you will wash away the grass seeds.
Newly planted seeds should be watered lightly every other day until the grass sprouts., Protect the newly planted seeds from trampling for the first few weeks. Consider putting up a sign or using a string or flags to cordon the area. If pets and other animals run loose, consider putting a temporary fence to protect the lawn from harm.

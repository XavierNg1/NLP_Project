 Everybody's skin comes with its own special set of problems. Some is oily, some dry, some prone to blackheads, some to white. Your cleaning routine depends on your skin's particular symptoms.


Cleansers can be purchased at any drug or beauty supply store. Store bought cleansers typically combat specific symptoms. Find a cleanser that addresses your skin's needs, or find a few that work effectively together. Cleansers may come in the form of scrubs, toners, astringents or wipes.
Sensitive skin requires gentle cleansers, and should not be scrubbed. Scrubbing irritated skin will aggravate it even more and prevent healing.
If your skin is sensitive to certain cleansers or your acne is especially severe, you may want to see a dermatologist. They may prescribe you something, or suggest a couple cleansers that work well against your symptoms.
You can also clean your face with baking soda, by dissolving it in water and massaging it into your skin, then rinsing. This helps deep clean your pores, and is considerably cheaper than most facial cleansers.
 You should wash your face twice daily, in the morning and at night. Neglecting your cleaning routine will lead to build up in your pores.


Washing your face too frequently may dry it out. Make sure you implement moisturizing into your routine.
Be consistent with your cleanser. If you alternate between too many cleansers, all of which are trying to accomplish different things, your symptoms may in fact intensify.
Try implementing an electronic cleansing brush in your routine for intensive exfoliation. These are best suited for more resistant skin. If your skin is sensitive, try using a gentle setting so as not to irritate it even more.

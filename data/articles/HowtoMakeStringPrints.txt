, The string design can be as simple as rows or circles of string, or it can be more complex, such as the shape of a plant, animal or face. Draw the design on paper first, keeping in mind that each line you draw has to be transferable to the shape the string can take.


Designs could also be a word, name or even a symbol of your home, business or property.
, When gluing the string in place, wrap the sides of each length of string down onto the sides or base of the wooden block for secure attachment.
 Then, leave to dry.
 Dip the string side of the block into the paint.
 The string design should transfer onto the paper as a painted image. Repeat as often as needed for a recurring pattern or design. Ideas for using the block include:


Make a collage or painting
Make gift wrapping paper
Make stationery notes or paper
Mark envelopes with a special stamp
Greetings cards
Posters, etc.

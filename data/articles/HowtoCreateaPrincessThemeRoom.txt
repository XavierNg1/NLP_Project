, Bright colors are the best for your princess bedroom, such as pastel pink or white but you can always use a light baby blue or like Jasmine from Aladdin with a lovely blue. You can also choose to wallpaper your bedroom, which is sometimes easier than painting it. Try not to make your room tacky and toy-ish by adding Disney princesses or any thing like that.
 Ask your parents if you can go shopping and get a nice carpet (or more than one) but be careful it matches the overall color of the room.



The bed doesn't have to be anything fancy, although if your parent's will let you a nice white bed would look cute in your new bedroom, but make sure that what you have on it is cute. Also get a cute throw and some pillows.
 A chandelier is the perfect choice for a princess. Or a couple of cute lamps in colors to match your room such as pink, white, or baby blue.
 Something that would look perfect would be a canopy for over your princess bed. A cute dresser is a must, preferably white or bubble gum pink but then again you can always have in different choices, hey it's your room!

, You won't be able to see your cute princess accessories if your stuff is strewn all over your room!

, After all, it's your princess room.

 This is when big holidays are coming up and the park is super busy. You will have to work lots of hours and on holidays. The Disney company really looks for people who are on the clock 24/7. If that schedule doesn't work for you, maybe Disneyland isn't the right job to apply for.;
, Disneyland will keep your application on file for 6 months. The sooner you can work the more likely they will call you. Be patient.
 They say you can choose the same role for all slots if you only want to work that role, but Disneyland really likes how you can be open to different areas in the park like working attractions, food vendors, or merchandise sales. Disneyland is a big company so they can usually find a job suitable to your interests.Â 

, Filling out the application is easy. Just work history, hours you can work, pay rate you want, etc. Then there will be a 20-30 minute test to take. Don't be nervous. This test is a simple personality test. But, each question is timed, so make sure to go with your gut when answering!

, Disneyland employees belong to a union. You will have money taken out of your first paycheck to pay union dues. So make sure you're willing to let the union take some percentage of your paycheck.
 Lots of times the calendar dates will say full. Find one that will be open. Remember, lots of people apply to Disneyland. So expect more than 10 people to be at the day of your interview. Disneyland is too busy to take one person at a time. You really need to make yourself stand out from everybody else on that day, but generally, Disneyland does not do group interviews.

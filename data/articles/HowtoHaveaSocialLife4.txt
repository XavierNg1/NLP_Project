 It's simple, easy, and free. Start by adding your current friends and family members with Facebook. Try to make friends and start a conversation, but don't make others uncomfortable. If most people use something else, like Twitter or Myspace, use that instead.
 If you have parents that won't pay for it, convince them. Texting is a good way to talk make small talk with people. Many people love to text, but you might not, so make sure you know before you get into the habit of doing it.

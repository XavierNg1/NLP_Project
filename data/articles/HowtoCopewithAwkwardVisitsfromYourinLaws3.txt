 There will likely be points of tension between you and your in-laws. When this happens, make a conscious effort to decide whether it is worth holding your ground, or letting it slide. If the offense is not a big deal, don’t mention it. Your in-laws will leave and things will go back to normal soon.For example, letting the kids sit up late on a weekend and play board games with their grandparents is probably excusable.
 If you feel strongly that something needs addressed, you should address it. When your in-laws cross your boundaries, letting it slide will only make things worse. This gives the impression that your rules do not apply to your in-laws or in their presence.For example, if an in-law undermines your parenting, you need to address it immediately to avoid it happening again. You could say something like, “I make the rules for my children, and they will abide by them. That holds true when we have company, too.”
If your in-laws are around frequently, you might need to address things more often than if they only come around a time or two per year.
 Your spouse’s family likely did things differently than your own. Holidays, traditions, and day to day life might look very different for your in-laws. Allow them the space to be themselves and avoid putting the pressure on for them to conform to your way of life.Try to see things from their point-of-view. Just as you'd be upset if they forced you to change your holidays and traditions, it's unfair for you to be overly strict and try to force them to do things your way.

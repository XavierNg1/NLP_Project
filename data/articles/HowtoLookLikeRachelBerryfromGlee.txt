 Rachel is a brunette, but if you aren't naturally one, you shouldn't dye your hair if you don't want to. Her hair is flat at the top, but by all means not straight. It has curves and slight waves at the ends, and sometimes she will wear it in tight little pin curls. Any of these styles are easily established with a flat-iron or curling-iron.;
, As far as make-up goes, Rachel is known to wear natural makeup: foundation the color of her natural skin, light pink or tan eye-shadow, dark mascara, and light pink lip-gloss. Keep it natural like Rachel does - nothing bright or bold. Don't overdo the make-up! You don't want to look like you were just in an opera.
 Rachel is most commonly seen in white blouses, turtlenecks, or sweaters. (She's even known to wear an animal sweater with a matching plaid skirt!) The one thing that she would never wear is a t-shirt or a hooded sweatshirt. Rachel loves argyle vests and sweaters, too.
 Rachel Berry almost never wears jeans. That isn't to say that a denim mini skirt is out of the question, though, if styled correctly. She always wears skirts! Most of her skirts are just above the knee, or at it. She loves pleated skirts, although she has been known to wear a A-line once in a while. Also, plaid is your new best friend. Rachel Berry has at least a dozen different plaid skirts!

, Another staple of Rachel's is dresses. Because her style is so girly, she's often seen wearing a classy yet casual dress. Keep it conservative - the dresses should end just above the knee and the necklines shouldn't be too low.
 Rachel Berry loves knee-socks and loafers. She also is known to rock a cute head-band once in a while, often in argyle. She loves colored tights, too! As far as jewellery goes, Rachel wear simple, classic earrings and necklaces with small charms on them. She wears little purses to the side, usually colorful, to make it really pop.

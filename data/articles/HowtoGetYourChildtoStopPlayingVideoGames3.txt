 Video games are only one way that children can entertain themselves. There are a lot of things they can do, especially if they are not allowed ot fall back on video games. Encourage your child to pursue other interests, and if they can’t think of anything, suggest a few for them.Don’t be afraid to say no to your child when they want to play video games because “there’s nothing to do.”
For example, your child can play with other toys, put on plays, make music or movies, read, play outside, engage in something creative like drawing, writing, or crafts, or play board or card games.
 Gaming is a solitary activity. You can encourage your child to participate in group activities they will enjoy. Brainstorm together and let them choose activities they will enjoy instead of choosing one for them.You can try youth groups at your religious institution. Local Y Clubs, community arts centers, and libraries also offer youth programs.
Look into local arts programs for theater, music, painting, and drawing. You can also look for programs for computers, building, or other hands-on activities.
Recreational sports can be fun for some kids, though you should never force children to do sports who do not want to do them.
 Excessive playing of video games has been linked to conditions like childhood obesity because video games are sedentary activities. To get your child more active, encourage your child to choose a physical activity they enjoy. It’s important to let your child choose what they do. Encourage them to try new activities if they don’t have any favorites.Your child may enjoy bike riding, skateboarding, dance, martial arts, recreational sports, swimming, and playing games outside.

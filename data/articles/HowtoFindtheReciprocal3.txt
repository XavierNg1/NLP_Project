 You might recognize some common decimal numbers that can easily be turned into fractions. For instance, 0.5 = 1/2, and 0.25 = 1/4. Once in fraction form, just flip the fraction to find the reciprocal.


For instance, the reciprocal of 0.5 is 2/1 = 2.
 If you can't change it to a fraction, calculate the reciprocal of that number as a division problem: 1 ÷ (the decimal). You can use a calculator to solve this, or continue on to the next step to solve it by hand.


For example, you can find the reciprocal of 0.4 by calculating 1 ÷ 0.4.
 The first step to dividing decimals is to move the decimal point until all the numbers involved are whole numbers. As long as you move the decimal point the same number of spaces for both numbers, you'll get the correct answer.


For example, you can take 1 ÷ 0.4 and rewrite it as 10 ÷ 4. In this case, you've moved each decimal place one space to the right, which is the same as multiplying each number by ten.
 Use long division techniques to calculate the reciprocal. If you calculate it for 10 ÷ 4, you'll get the answer 2.5, the reciprocal of 0.4.

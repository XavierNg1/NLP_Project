 Start preparing your fire by setting a long piece of kindling in the dirt at a 30 degree angle in your fire pit. Next, gather your tinder material into a bundle, and place it beneath the lean-to kindling.While kindling usually consists of thin sticks, you can use a small or medium-size log as the lean-to.
Make sure that the end of the kindling that you place in the ground is pointing into the wind.
 Once the lean-to and tinder are ready, start placing additional pieces of kindling in your fire set-up. Choose smaller pieces of kindling than the stick serving as the lean-to, and set them against the tinder bundle and lean-to.As you lay the kindling around the lean-to and tinder, you’ll create a tent-like shape.
Once you have a first layer of kindling arranged around the lean-to and tinder, find larger pieces and place a second layer on top.
 After you’re finished building the lean-to structure, it’s time to light the fire. Use matches or a lighter to ignite the tinder. As it starts to burn, the kindling will eventually catch fire too, and create larger flames., Once the kindling starts to burn, you can add more pieces to feed the fire. If it isn’t as large as you’d like, you can throw some firewood on the fire to help it grow. Start with one piece, and only add more when you’re sure that the fire hasn’t grown large enough.A lean-to fire is good for cooking because it doesn’t burn too long but remains steady while it is lit.

 You can search for these in local ads newspapers, or look it up on the Internet by typing "taekwondo clubs/academies in (name of your city)";
, You'll need its exact location (some clubs have several facilities on a few different addresses, so choose the one closest to you), the time when training sessions are held, the monthly membership price, whether or not there are discounts or free try-out periods (many clubs have these, it gives you a chance to train there a month or two for free and see if you're really up for it) and whether or not there are any requirements. If the club/academy has a web page, be sure to check it out.
 Watch the way the teacher/sensei works with his/her disciples, if he/she has any specific demands. Talk to the students during breaks, ask for their opinions on the club, the sensei, and the way they work.
 If it is, sign in and get to work. Mind that taekwondo is hard, and the first few months of training will be tough for you. Also keep in mind that the free try-out periods are oftentimes a mere shade of what training in that club/academy is really like.

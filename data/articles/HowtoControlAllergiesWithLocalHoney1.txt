 Favor honey made by bees who, in their travels, collect traces of pollen found in your area.Choose raw honey over processed, since processed honey is less likely to contain pollen after being heated, pasteurized, and filtered.If there are no bee farms in your immediate area, sample raw honey from elsewhere.


Visit local farmers markets or natural food stores to find locally sourced honey.Alternately, search online for the nearest bee farm.If you shop outside your area and know exactly which pollen triggers your allergies, research the farm’s location to make sure the same type of plant grows there.
If you don’t know which pollen you’re allergic to, search for the bee farm that is nearest to home to better ensure a similar environment to your own.;
, Strengthen your body’s tolerance to allergens by ingesting a little bit of honey each day. Condition yourself with a limited intake of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of honey per day. Avoid taking more than this, since you may end up ingesting more pollen than your body can handle at present.Either consume a tablespoon by itself, or apply the honey directly to other foods, like toast.Do not use your daily dose to cook or bake. Heat may destroy the pollen in the honey, thus rendering it ineffective.
Adding honey to a hot beverage, such as tea, should be fine, since the beverage’s temperature is unlikely to be high enough to destroy the pollen.
 Expect your body to require some time to strengthen its tolerance against allergens. Do not wait for the pollen season to start before beginning your treatment. Begin as early as possible so your body has the most amount of time to adjust to daily exposure.

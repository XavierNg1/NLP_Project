, Even if it's new, you have no idea how long it sat gathering dust (or worse) at a store. Also, you'll want to clean thoroughly to remove any ink residues if your shredder performed its intended function in the past. However, an unused shredder is preferable. See Warnings below.
 You'll want room to work with your pasta. To do so, disable the receptacle sensor so the machine still functions. You can do this with duct tape. To do so, use a lubricant such as 10-40 or liquid bleach. If you have a shredder that is supported by the receptacle, you'll need to prop it up with something else (e.g. thick books, soup cans, etc.).
 As the mechanism churns, coat it with nonstick cooking oil (see Warning).
 Your sheet of dough should be no wider than the paper feed and no thicker than a stack of paper you'd put through the shredder. The length is up to you.
 Do this as they come out, so they don't pile up and stick to themselves.

 Display artwork in an area that is proportional size-wise to the art piece, and that is relevant to the art's purpose. For example, if you want a large statue to be the focal point of a room, then you should place it in an area that is visible from the room's entry points and be careful not to overcrowd the piece with the room's architecture.
 Randomize the arrangement height and width-wise, so as to create visual interest. Assemble objects in a way that makes sense logically, such as grouping 3 Indian artifacts or arranging a row of ceramic pottery.
 There are many places you may choose to display freestanding art, including pedestals, tabletops, shelves, fireplace mantels, the floor, display boxes, easels and cabinets.
 Overhead spot lighting, unidirectional track lighting and ambient lighting are good choices for highlighting art pieces in a space.



For large sculptures place them in the centre of a room allowing observers to move around it. If the sculpture is made of material that is weather resistant like bronze then you could consider placing it in the garden.
Smaller works should be displayed at eye level and hence a pedestal is advisable.
When deciding lighting for the sculpture, play around with the lights and see which effect suits you best. The play of light and shadows over a sculpture greatly enhances the way it appears. Experiment with direct overhead light or a side light source for a dramatic effect.

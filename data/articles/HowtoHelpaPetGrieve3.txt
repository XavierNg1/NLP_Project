 If you and your pet are mourning the loss of another animal, one way to help heal is to bring home a new friend. Wait until you feel emotionally prepared, though. If you do not feel like you are in a place to properly love or care for a new pet, wait until you feel you can best provide for it.Only you know when you are ready for a new pet. Allow yourself enough time so that you feel excited to welcome a new life into your home, rather than simply feeling like you need to fill a void.
 Make sure your pet is ready for a new companion by allowing your animal and any potential new pet to meet before you commit. This can point out an behavioral problems that either pet may have,as well as give you a sense of how comfortable your current pet is with a new pet.If you are working with an animal shelter, many require pets to meet prior to adoption. Let the shelter know that you have a pet already, and that you would like to schedule a meeting between your pets to see how they get along.
If you are working with a reputable, ethical breeder, ask them about setting up a meeting between your pet and the new animal prior to pick up day.
 A new pet, especially a young one such as a puppy or kitten, is going to require a great amount of attention to train and introduce to the home. Make sure to schedule time to play with and care for your current pet.Try to make sure you have some time each day dedicated just to your grieving pet. Take time to participate in an activity such as making physical contact or playing that your pet enjoys without the company of the new pet.
Be sure to also schedule time for your grieving pet and your new pet to interact. They may or may not be welcoming to one another at first, but you should encourage a positive relationship by walking them together or setting up times to play with both of them at the same time.

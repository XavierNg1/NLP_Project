 Organic fertilizers do not include harsh chemicals or pollutants, and they should be labeled as Certified Organic. Look for organic formulas rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK), with a higher phosphorus (P) number for root and flower growth.
 Amend the soil, based on a soil test from your garden. A soil test will indicate what nutrients your soil is lacking and also will keep you from adding unnecessary nutrients to the soil.


Use bone meal if your soil lacks phosphorus. Bone meal is a natural material rich in phosphorus. It is ideal for container plants but also can be added to the garden to help build strong root systems in plants.
Use blood meal if your soil lacks nitrogen. Blood meal is ideal for flowers. It is high in nitrogen, so should be used sparingly.
Consider fish meal, seaweed, bat guano, alfalfa meal, earthworm castings and manure as organic fertilizers ideal for boosting nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

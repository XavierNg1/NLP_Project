 Sudden life changes may disrupt your child’s mental or emotional health. Loss of a loved one, a recent move, episodes of bullying, or a parent’s divorce can negatively impact a child’s functioning. Think back to determine if any recent life changes are affecting them.Any of these experiences take some adjusting, but if your child doesn't seem to be eating, sleeping or functioning as normal after several weeks, they may not be coping well.
 If your child is generally happy and energetic and recently seems down in the dumps, overly tired or blue, they may benefit from talking to a therapist. Take note whether a shift in mood or energy happens suddenly or as a result of certain stimuli. Closely monitoring these changes can help a therapist better understand how to help your child., Children who are struggling may pull away from friends and family. If you’re your child seems to no longer want to play with or hang out with friends or siblings, pay close attention. Social isolation or withdrawal may signal an underlying problem.You might ask your child about this change by saying, “Honey, I noticed you never go outside to play with your friends anymore. Do you want to talk about that?”

, If your generally healthy child constantly whines about stomach aches, headaches, or other physical symptoms, keep track of their complaints. Unless they have an undiagnosed medical condition, these issues should be resolved by a visit to the doctor, rest, or over-the-counter meds. If nothing seems to ease these problems, the root of these physical complaints may lie in your child’s emotional functioning., You may not want to admit it, but your child’s current functioning may be taking a toll on your household. If you and your spouse are disagreeing about how to parent, or if siblings often complain that everything revolves around one child, you may need to seek professional help. Letting the problem go unaddressed may lead to irreparable damage in your home life.

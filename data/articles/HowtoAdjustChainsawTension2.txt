 There is no top or bottom to most chainsaw bars, but one side will often start to wear out and chip. If this is the case, put the bar in a vice and careful file down any jagged, high edges so that the side is even again.
 The chain pulls forward, meaning the chain on top of the bar moves away from your body. The saw blades will point obviously in one direction, with the teeth all pointing the same way. They should point forwards., Put the blade on the bar so that the saw teeth on top of the blade push away from you. Make sure that they fit snugly.
 Pull the chain around and lock it into the sprocket that powers the chainsaw (a large, round, spin-able part with grooves to lock into the chain). Then attach the bar snugly to the motor of the chainsaw according to your specific manufacturer's instructions.
 You want the bar on and chainsaw re-assembled before making your tension adjustments.
 Throughout the next few steps, use your free hand to slightly lift the nose of the bar up. The rest of the chainsaw should rest on a clean, flat surface.
 This screw is often found perpendicular to the direction of the chain. It will move a small pin that catches the chain, making it slightly shorter or longer to add or subtract tension. Check your owner's manual if unable to locate the screw, though it should be easy.


Sometimes the adjustment screw is located between the mounting studs. It could also be on the outside of the chainsaw, on the covering., If the blade doesn't move smoothly all the way around, lightly loosen the adjustment screw so that it can slide with ease. You want the blade on snugly, covering the whole bar, but not so snug that it can't move and cut easily.


A "perfect" middle ground to shoot for is 1.25mm of space between the chain and the bar, on the bottom half.

 While practicing mindfulness meditation, practitioners are urged to observe their thoughts, acknowledge their feelings, and then allow them to pass. They are not supposed to judge or fixate on their thoughts. Practitioners are now applying this meditation technique to their work on the computer. This requires you to disengage from work and take a moment to observe and acknowledge the letters, spaces, images, and thoughts displayed on the screen., Pause from your work for a brief mindfulness meditation session. Slide your chair back, close your eyes, and or slow your breathing. Ask yourself the following questions and take a mental note of your responses:


”What do I feel in this moment?”
”What am I thinking about in this moment?”
”How am I present in this moment?”
”How am I not present in this moment?”, Once you are aware of your own thoughts and feelings, turn your attention to the computer screen. The goal of this exercise is to use the computer to transport yourself into a state of calmness, relaxation, and mindfulness that will then carry over to the rest of your workday. As you practice:


Take note of the letters in a word, the sentences in a paragraph, and the thoughts they are conveying.
Acknowledge the icons on your desktop, the empty spaces on an open web page, and the cursor in the corner of your screen.
If your mind wanders, return your attention to the screen.
Gradually regain your awareness and return to work feeling refreshed and refocused.

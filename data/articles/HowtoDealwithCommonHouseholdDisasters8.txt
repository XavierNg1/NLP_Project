 Once should be enough for you to see the water level rising.
 If it’s a child’s toy or your cell phone, you’ll need to go in there with your hands.
, If you can’t remove the block within a few minutes– call a plumber. You've probably already thought of it, but you’ll want to grab some gloves and line the area around your toilet with newspapers or old towels.This really helps with cleanup if there is an overflow (and the gloves will help you with that nasty feeling you get when you have to stick your hand in the toilet).

 Put your right hand on the ground on the left side of your body with your left leg outstretched. Bend your right knee. Bend your left elbow, tucking it in at your hip.









Start to put all of your weight onto your hands and tilt your body on top of the platform you created with your two arms. Place the side of your head lightly on the ground so that it holds no weight.
Lift up your legs and hold. This is the baby freeze position with one leg outstretched and the other bent.
 Get into a basic handstand and first try bending your knees behind your back to get comfortable with the feeling. Once you feel steady, stand back up and this time jump into the handstand with momentum, landing only on one hand.









Swing your free hand behind your back as you simultaneously bend your knees like you did to practice.
Tap your toes with your free hand and return to a crouching position.
 Get into the baby freeze position, but instead of hugging your elbow into your hip, place your bent elbow behind your back and rest it on your hip bone.









If you are using your right elbow, place your left hand on your hip and your left foot at a 90 degree angle on the ground so that your hips are square and pointing upward.
Lift your right leg and rest your right ankle on top of your left knee, like you would to cross your legs in a chair.

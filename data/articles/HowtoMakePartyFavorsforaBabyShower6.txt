 In this silly shower game, different types of candy bars are melted and placed into diapers. Each diaper is then numbered, and guests have to guess which candy bars are inside each numbered diaper. The winner of the game typically receives a bag of the candy bars that were used in the game.
 Writing down wishes for a baby at a shower helps people to pass on the wisdom that theyâ€™ve learned and to dedicate it to nurturing a new life. The host usually provides the wish cards, and guests complete them. Then, the cards can either be collected and given to the mother or read out loud and shared along with a parenting story. Guests and the mother-to-be often find this activity to be emotionally moving, so set out plenty of facial tissue.

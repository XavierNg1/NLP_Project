 While you're waiting for your brows to grow, you can draw them in quite effectively using a brow pencil. Choose a pencil that matches your brow color or is a shade lighter. Make short, thin strokes in the same direction as your hair growth.


When using a brow pencil, subtle strokes are better than thick ones. Don't go overboard trying to give yourself the popular bushy look; stick with filling in the gaps for now.
For a bolder nighttime look, go a shade dark than your brow color.
 Brow powder is formulated to stick to your existing brow hairs and make them look fuller and more filled in. It's a good way to add some heft to your brows if your hair tends to be sparse. Choose a shade that matches your brow color and use a brush to apply it in the direction of your hair growth.
 When your hairs first start to grow back, they may have the appearance of stubble. Resist the impulse to pluck and use a little concealer there instead. Go for a chemical-free concealer so that you won't risk impeding your hair growth.
 Do this for at least one month, and have patience. If you want your eyebrows to instantly look thicker and better for an occasion, you could apply Vaseline.

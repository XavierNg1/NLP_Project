 If you consistently respond with your true feelings, you will teach others how to treat you correctly. Over time people will learn and adapt to your behavior and will put you in less high-pressure situations. Others may not even realize they are walking all over you if you don’t express yourself.
Manipulative people will seek you out if they need something because they know you will not confront them. Once they learn you will not be used, they will stop.
Your responses do not have to be dramatic. Simply respond in the same way you would like someone to respond to you if they deny helping you.
 If you agree to do what your user asks of you, lay out your limitations right away. This way you will not be burdened and your user will be satisfied. Both parties win.


This could be something like, if your peer needs help with their homework, give a time limit.
If your co-worker asks you for help on a project, take the smallest task because you have your own work you need to do.
 Whenever someone asks you for something you are uncomfortable with, it’s totally acceptable to say that you'll need to think about it. This gives you time to consider if you actually want to help.


If the person needs an immediate answer, say "No". You can always go back and say "Yes" if you realized you're okay with helping out. But if you immediately say "Yes" you are automatically committing to the situation.
 "No" can be a scary word because it is confrontational, but "No" can make you feel powerful. It shows others that you and your time is valuable.


Using "No" doesn’t have to be aggressive, because it’s just honesty. You’re not being offensive, you’re just articulating that you have other things you need to take care of.

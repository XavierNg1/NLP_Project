 Plain white vinegar is extremely acidic, which gives it antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antiseptic properties. Not only can it kill mold and mildew, it can also help loosen and lift other debris from your carpet. To make a cleaning solution, mix 2 cups (1/2 a liter) of warm water with a tablespoon of white vinegar and a teaspoon of baking soda in a spray bottle.Shake the mixture thoroughly and apply liberally to your carpet. Make more as needed.
Note that the room will smell strongly of vinegar until the mixture dries.
Once the mixture has dried, vacuum the room completely.
 Mix 4 tablespoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide with a tablespoon of dye-free mild soap, such as Dr. Bronner’s. Blend them into roughly 1.5 quarts (about 1.5 liters) of hot water. This mixture is ideal for home carpet cleaning machines.Find 3% hydrogen peroxide at a pharmacy or grocery store.
Hydrogen peroxide risks lightening the color of darker carpets. As long as you keep the percentage of hydrogen peroxide below 3%, however, this risk is minimal.
 Use white vinegar and hydrogen peroxide together for extra cleaning power. Blend a quarter cup of white vinegar with a tablespoon each of hydrogen peroxide and mild dye-free soap in a spray bottle. Fill the rest of the bottle with warm water., Especially when using hydrogen peroxide to clean your carpets, test your cleaning solution to ensure that you won’t accidentally cause discoloration. Simply wet a towel with your cleaning solution and rub it on the carpet in the corner of the closet, for instance.Let it sit for a few minutes, blot with a dry towel, and wait 24 hours. If no fading or other discoloration occurs, your mixture is likely safe to use on the rest of the carpet.

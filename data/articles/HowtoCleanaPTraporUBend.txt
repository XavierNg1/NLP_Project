 You will need a bucket because U-shaped pipes usually retain a small amount of water, and need to be emptied.


Place the bucket under the U pipe.;
, Unfasten the holders holding the U pipe.


Usually you can twist it by hand. If it is shaped of a bolt, you may need a wrench. If it is too difficult to open by hand, use a plumbing wrench to help you.
There are usually 2 or 3 fasteners.
 Water may drip out of the pipe.


Do not forget there is water retained inside the pipe. Tip it to empty it

, Remove hair if there is any.
 Usually some remnants from waste water is left. This can include calcium, mold, or scum. Use a flex brush to remove gunky waste.
 Using a plumbing snake, insert the snake into the drain hole in the sink. Pull out obstructions.


It may take a couple of attempts to snake a hairball out.
 Place the pipe back in place.


Remember that the long side faces the sink drain.
 Make sure to fasten tight.
 Do this by turning on the sink to check if drainage is okay.


Keep the sink on for 15 seconds.
If it leaks, make sure it is fastened right. Is the fastener loose? If that is not the case, you may need plumbing tape. You can purchase plumbing tape at a local hardware store. Use the tape as a gasket.
 Empty the bucket out in a drain. Put back the tools.

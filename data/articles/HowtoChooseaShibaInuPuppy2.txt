 A good breeder will allow you to see all puppies and dogs at any time. They should be happy to have you look round, and indeed be proud of their facilities. They should also have a return policy â€” a breeder who won't let you to return a puppy for any reason isn't taking responsibility for the animals they breed. A responsible breeder also won't breed an excessive amount of litters in a year's time.

Rule out a breeder who can't provide you with health check information on his puppies.

Weight: the puppy should be rounded with baby fat over the ribcage

Hearing: clap your hands behind the puppies head to make sure it reacts and turns toward the sound
Vision: roll a ball slowly near the puppy (within its field of vision) to make sure it notices the movement
Legs: observe the puppy's walking and running for signs of limping, stiffness, or soreness

 A little heat is normal when batteries are recharging or working, but excessive heat can be a sign that they are dying. Notice if the battery starts to heat up significantly more than normal, or compare your suspicious battery to a newer one to see if there is a significant difference in heat.;
, Sometimes when the rechargeable batteries start depleting, the internal cell ruptures and starts leaking. A small bulge will be the first visible sign of this starting. To check if the battery is bloated, place it on flat surface. If it wobbles or does not lie down properly, that could mean it's depleting.


Using bloated batteries is riskier as they might explode on being charged.
 A fully charged phone battery should provide at least 20 hrs of battery life on standby mode and minimum 7 hrs on usage, while laptop batteries usually have a life of around 2.5 - 3 hrs on usage and several days of shelf life. If your battery lasts for a significantly shorter period of time, or if you've noticed a decrease in the battery life during the time that you've had your device, this could be a sign that the battery is wearing down.
 Sometimes when the unitâ€™s capacity is deteriorated it still as fully charged, after only charging very little. When you use it, it shows the battery as depleting very fast. Sometimes, the battery may shut down, powering off the device, while you are using heavy applications or on a call for a long time. This generally appears with excessive heating of the battery.


If when you switch the phone back on, you find that the battery is not hot and there is still power left, then phone is faulty but your battery should be fine.
 See if the terminals and electric panels on the battery appear to be rusted. No matter how small the area is, show it to a specialist. Visible corrosion means that there is some internal problem and it is time to change the battery. Continuing with the corrosive battery may end up destroying the phone.

 Draw different floors on different pieces of paper. (E.x. If your bedroom is on the top floor, but your kitchen is on the ground floor, draw them on separate pieces of paper).;
, Use arrows for movement. Draw circles around objectives, and use X's for hiding places.
, For example, If you are crouched behind a corner, keep a coin on hand that you can set it down so you can say "I'm looking for my quarter." Keep it simple.
, If your clothes are not even close, avoid bright colors and things that will stand out (E.x. Don't wear black if your walls are white).
, Avoid wood floors.
 That is where stairs are the least creaky. Same thing with wood floors. Stick to the wall.
, For example, if you have to hide in a bedroom with a messy bed, hide under the covers and STAY FLAT.
 Try to get the mission back on course.

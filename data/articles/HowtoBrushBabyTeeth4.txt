 If molars have appeared it is definitely time to swap the gauze for a toothbrush. Look for a very soft bristle brush with 3 or less rows of bristles. By the age of 1 year baby should be brushing with a toothbrush.
 You are trying to get baby accustomed to the brushing technique. Incorporating toothpaste at this stage can make baby more resistant to the attempts. Use only warm water.
 Be sure to supervise.


Start by encouraging baby to hold on to the toothbrush handle while you brush his teeth.
After he is comfortable with that, you can begin letting him brush his own teeth. You will want to go back and do the brushing again after he is finished.
 Gradually work your way up to more frequent brushings until he allows you to brush his teeth after each meal.
 Follow with a gentle up and down motion to both the inside and the outside of the teeth. Be sure to include the tongue in the brushing process.

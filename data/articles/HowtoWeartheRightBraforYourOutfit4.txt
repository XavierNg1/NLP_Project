 Thicker shoulder straps provide better support, which is essential for women with especially large busts. If you have a smaller bust size, however, thinner straps may provide enough support.
 The right push-up bra can work beneath a wide variety of tops, ranging from ordinary t-shirts to fancier blouses. Look for one that creates a smooth, natural silhouette, though, or else you may end up looking disproportionate or obviously fake.
 A bra with light padding can look natural and give your bust a few added inches. Too much padding can look obvious, however and will not flatter your figure well.

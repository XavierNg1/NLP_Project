 Use a baking sheet or a stone cutting board to hold the paper while you heat it. You won’t be using an open flame, but heat guns can reach very high temperatures so it’s important to still take safety precautions., The more lemon juice you dab on, the greater the burn effect you’ll get later, so use as little or as much as you want. You can use the side of a lemon or lime slice to rub it in, or just squirt some of the juice onto the paper and use your finger to distribute it., Heat guns are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased at most craft or hardware stores. Always hold it at a 45-degree angle about 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) away from the edge of the paper.Since you’ll be blowing hot air at the paper, you may want to put on an oven mitt and hold down the opposite side of the paper with one hand.
 The longer you heat one spot, the darker it will become. This process will not be as instantaneous as using an open flame, so be patient. Try moving the heat gun a little closer if you’re not getting the effect you want.

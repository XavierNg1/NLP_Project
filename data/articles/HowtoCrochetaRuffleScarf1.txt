 Take your sashay yarn and unfurl it so that it looks like a wide flat piece of ribbon. Then, find the loops at the top of the yarn. These will look like small rectangular spaces large enough to easily put your hook through. Count five of these loops and then fold youâ€™re your yarn., With the folded over piece of yarn behind your working yarn, insert your hook through the first loop.For these first few stitches, you will be working through the folded over yarn as well, so you will really be going through two loops.
 After getting the first two loops on your hook, skip over the next loop and then insert the hook through the one after that (make sure to get the front and back loop) and chain one.Repeat this four times.
To chain with sashay yarn, insert the hook through a loop and then through another. Then, pull the second loop through the first loop on your hook., After you finish four stitches, turn your work and then begin working single crochet stitches into the loops. Do your first single crochet stitch in the first chain stitch in your row.Single crochet every other stitch to the end of your row.
To single crochet with sashay yarn, insert the crochet hook into the first stitch and then through a loop on your working yarn. Pull the loop through the first stitch. Then, insert the hook through another loop in your working yarn and pull through both of the other loops on your hook.Continue to turn and single crochet across every row until your scarf is the desired length. You can make a ruffle scarf with just one ball of sashay yarn, but you may make it longer if you prefer.
 Once you reach the end of the scarf, cut the yarn, leaving a 6-inch (15.25-cm) tail.


Tuck this tail end in between the nearest two ruffles. Use a sewing needle and thread to tack the end in place, securing it and preventing the scarf from unraveling.
This completes your ruffle scarf.

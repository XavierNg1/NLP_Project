 Beef jerky is one of the most popular types of jerky. Start with a lean cut of meat, like flank steak or top round, and dehydrate fine strips of the beef in a dehydrator or oven.
 You can add different seasonings and marinades to your strips of beef in order to create more flavorful beef jerky.



Spice things up. You can make a spicier version of beef jerky by adding a little capsicum sauce.

Try teriyaki beef jerky. Soy sauce, brown sugar, paprika, and red pepper combine to form Asian-inspired flavors.

Prepare South African beef jerky. Also referred to as biltong, South African beef jerky is prepared with sea salt, white pepper, malt vinegar, white vinegar, and raw brown sugar.
 Venison, or deer meat, is another popular meat to use for jerky. It goes well with seasonings like onion powder, black pepper, garlic powder, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.
 While traditional jerky is prepared in strip form, you can also use the dehydrating method to prepare beef jerky in sticks.
 If you do not have a meat dehydrator, you could also dehydrate the jerky in a conventional oven or in a saucepan.

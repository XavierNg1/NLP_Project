 Our brains are spontaneous, and can think up anything at random times, so always have some paper at hand to jot down some ideas, for example, in your desk at school, or at work, even at home!;
, For warrior cats, it could be about ShadowClan and Tigerstar raging a battle against ThunderClan, or something, but your story MUST have some kind of structure to it, for you to be able to build off of it.
 Build off of your main story line, and let your brain do the work! It's like your thoughts flowing out of your pencil while you write practically! So just relax, and imagine that you are one of the cats there, how do they feel, hear, smell even. Describe the characters, and their personality for a great story!

, For example, "Blackclaw's face was twisted in rage, and he spat out a mouthful of scarlet blood." Or, "The dark red sunset shone on me like an angry cat, wild and untamed." It helps the reader to imagine what you are trying to say, and paints a picture in their head.
 Every one of us has different ways about expressing how they feel about warrior cats. Some like the cats to be rude and selfish, others like them to be pleasant and sweet. It's your decision!

 Make it a habit to give a treat to your cat for attendance.Please note: This method is probably the simplest option described in this article, but like the others derives from the “clicker training” technique.
, Practice so that you can use the clicker and provide the treat in concert., Don’t expect to be able to practice for more than five-to-ten minutes at a time, however, and quite possibly less.If your cat is quickly disinterested, try again in a few hours. Try training right before mealtime, when the cat will be eager for treats.
 Stop providing treats for weak or misdirected paw movements., “Click + treat” whenever the cat touches your hand with its paw.Reward contact by only one paw, however, either the cat’s right or left front paw. Teach it to use the same paw every time.
 Do this only when your cat consistently touches your empty hand.Your ultimate goal is to make the cue for a "high five" become the presentation of your palm to the cat. Practice by opening your hand quickly in front of the cat, then sharply pulling it away once contact is made (or if no contact is made). This should be a quick and small movement.
 You can even fist bump!

 When everything is taken care of, it is time to relax. Once the baby is born, you most likely won’t have a whole lot of time for yourself for awhile. Because of this, you should take some time to pamper yourself now.This could be something as simple as indulging in an activity that you love but haven’t had time to do, like going out to dinner or to a movie, or even just reading a book in bed.
 Pampering yourself could also include going on a mini vacation where you do not have to be concerned with the many activities that your daily life usually entails. This mini vacation could be a weekend away with your significant other, or simply a day at the spa.


Getting a full body massage can help ease muscle or joint strain related to carrying the extra weight of the baby or sleeping in awkward positions.
Most pregnant women can barely see their feet, let alone take care of them, so a pedicure may be a great way to pamper yourself.
 After wearing maternity clothes for so many months, you might also enjoy going shopping for some new clothes or shoes. Although you won’t be able to try them on while you are pregnant, you can always save the receipt and exchange them if they don’t fit right after the baby is born.


If shopping for yourself isn’t your cup of tea, you can also go shopping for you baby.
 Along with pampering yourself physically, you may also want to pamper yourself emotionally. Spend some quality time with your partner and any other children you may have.


Not only will this make you feel relaxed, it will also remind your loved ones that they are very important to you.

 This is the easiest treatment, but it risks killing the whole tree or surrounding plants. Flush either product down your toilet bowl (never into a sink or shower) in ½ lb (¼ kg) increments or less, until you've added 2 lb (0.9 kg). Avoid running water into the pipe for 8–12 hours so the salt has time to kill the roots.Follow all safety information on the label.Both chemicals can cause major damage to aquatic life. Their use may be regulated by your state or country, especially near water treatment plants.
 Foaming herbicides expand to fill the pipe and take some time to break down, making them the best option for sewage line root removal. Contact herbicides kill the roots quickly, while systemic herbicides can take a couple weeks but may kill the whole tree. Different foam consistencies are appropriate for different sizes of pipe, so read the label before buying.








Some herbicides are toxic to fish or other wildlife. The label should describe the environmental impact, and may include information on how to minimize it.
For best results, hire a professional plumber to apply metam-sodium. This is a corrosive chemical that requires training and safety equipment to use.
 If roots have clogged a pipe completely, they will block the flow of chemical treatments.Hire a plumber instead to clear the pipe with a Roto Rooter or similar mechanical tool. This also has the advantage of avoiding environmental impacts from herbicide.
 Unless you're willing to repeat this treatment regularly, the cleared pipe will need structural repairs to prevent root regrowth. Installing a lining inside your pipe requires less digging and disruption, but a complete pipe replacement is often cheaper.








You may also need to remove or relocate any large trees near the pipe, or the roots will keep growing into the sewer pipe.

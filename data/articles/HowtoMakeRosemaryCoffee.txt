 The best way to add flavor to coffee is by making a simple syrup or infusion and adding it to your finished cup. To make a rosemary infusion, you will only need a few sprigs of fresh rosemary and some water. If you enjoy your coffee sweetened, you can add sugar to the infusion to make a syrup.;
, The basis for a simple syrup is equal parts water and sugar heated until dissolved.


Begin by adding 1 cup (240 ml) each of water and granulated sugar to a saucepan. Begin heating the mixture and stirring it gently.
When all of the sugar has dissolved, the mixture is ready for the rosemary to be infused. The syrup does not need to be boiled down to a thicker consistency.
If you do not want your rosemary coffee to be sweetened, leave out the sugar. Simply begin heating 1 cup (240 ml) of water in the saucepan.
 At this point, place 3 to 5 sprigs of fresh rosemary into the water, submerging them completely.
 Heat the mixture until it just begins to boil, but do not allow it to remain at a rolling boil for long. This can cause the rosemary flavor to become bitter and astringent.
 Once the infusion begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and allow it to gently simmer for about 10 minutes. Stir the infusion occasionally.
 After 10 minutes of simmering, remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to sit. Let the rosemary infuse for about 15 to 30 minutes as the mixture cools. After this time, you can remove the rosemary sprigs and place the infusion in a jar for storage in the refrigerator.
 The rosemary mixture can be added to either hot or iced coffee, brewed using any method. Prepare your cup of coffee as usual, and then add the rosemary infusion by the teaspoon (5 ml) until it suits your taste.

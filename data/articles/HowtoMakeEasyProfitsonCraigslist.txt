 Such as electronics. Those things are usually relatively pretty popular and can possibly hold the most chances of you earning big bucks.;
, Look through items carefully to see what's currently selling.
 Preferably something you can actually afford to spend.
 Electronics, books, computers, and others.
 Like if an item was a laptop for $250, if the person is willing to haggle, consider trying to buy it for $200.
, Some people might sell you useless junk item or the item doesn't function as well as it was described, so ask to test the item out is recommended.
 Doing so will help you reassure your buyers that the product is well maintained and clean.
 For example, if the item was originally for $250 and you knocked the price down to $200, then start from $275 and start from there. And try NOT to sell the item lower than $30 for how much you had spent it for or it might be worth the trip unless if that was the best you could do with it.
 Because doing so will help you attract more buyers, rather then no pictures available.
 Quite often, someone might post an item that could be used to make a quick $5 or more. Items that could be sold for some money are like usable TVs, books or something that you could use to fix up if you are a bit of a handyman.

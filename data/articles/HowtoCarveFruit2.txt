 Cut a medium or large cucumber a third of the way from the end, or a small cucumber in half. The exact size is not too important, but the piece you are about to carve should include both an end and a cut surface.


Keep the remaining portions around, as successfully creating a flower for the first time often takes more than one attempt.
 Take a sharp, stainless steel paring knife and place it against the edge of the cut end. Slice off about 1/8 of the circumference of the cucumber, just barely beneath the green skin. Move the knife slowly under the skin, to within 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of the end. Remove the knife, leaving the strip of skin attached to the end.If the strip breaks, you can still continue to use the same cucumber piece as practice.
 Repeat this process until all of the green skin has been formed into strips, or "outer petals" of the flower.
 Once again, use your paring knife to create thin strips starting from the cut edge of the cucumber. This time, you will be forming "inner petals" of the flower, from the hard, white portion of the cucumber.


This may be more difficult than the peel, as you need to create strips thin enough to bend, but thick enough that they won't break. Go slowly, and take a break if your eyes or hands feel strained.
 Carefully scrape the seeds and pulp out of the center of the cucumber using your knife. If there is still white flesh not turned into strips, you may remove this as well.
 Use the knife or a pair of scissors to trim the end of each "petal" into a triangular point. Try to cut each triangle to the same length for a more attractive, symmetrical effect.
 Mimic the pollen center of a flower by cutting a small disc from a carrot, and inserting it at the base between the strips. Other colorful, edible options include a small berry, a circle of tomato peel, or even an actual flower. Small, edible flowers that may look attractive in this position include dandelion buds, clover, or English daisies.

Unfortunately, when you are sick, those enzymes are slowed down, which means that dairy may pass through your stomach undigested, causing you to feel even more sick.Image:Prevent Dehydration from Diarrhea or Vomiting Step 9.jpg|center]]

Wait at least a week until after your illness has cleared up before you begin to consume dairy products again.
 Carrot soup can help to rehydrate you while also supplying your body with sodium, chloride, sulphur, magnesium, and pectin. To make carrot soup:


Boil several large carrots and blend them together. Add these blended carrots to a pot and simmer them on low. Add salt for taste.
For sick infants, boil water and add eight teaspoons of sugar with a pinch of salt. Feed this amount to your child in small doses.
 When you have diarrhea or begin to vomit, it is important to keep your potassium levels up. Certain fruits have high concentrations of potassium, including:


Mangoes, pawpaw, coconuts, oranges, strawberries, grapes, and pineapples. Lentils also have high levels of potassium.
 While you most likely wonâ€™t feel like drinking alcohol anyway, it is important to avoid drinking it when you have diarrhea or have been vomiting. Alcohol contains toxins that can actually dehydrate you, which is the opposite effect that you want to have when dealing with an illness. Caffeinated sodas and coffee can make your dehydration worse by taking more water out of your body.

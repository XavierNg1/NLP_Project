 Brush your hair back very tight, and then tie it into a ponytail with a scrunchie/hair tie.
 Take a piece of hair from your ponytail, wrap it around the scrunchie/hair tie, and then pin it down to secure it.
 For extra volume, scrunch your ponytail with a scrunching product. For a more sleek look, you could also straighten it or brush it.

 This will be your house. You can downsize it if you want if your stuffed animal is small, but if it is larger, you'll need a larger box!;
, Mahogany and white for bricks, whatever color for siding, dark brown for wood, whatever materials for a house and the comprehending color(s).
 You can do a glass door in blue and white, brown, black, gray, etc. Wood doors are the same, but don't use blue. Folding doors? Whatever color you want! Make sure the other side is the same color as the front!

, When you are doing this, think "What will my stuffed animal be?" as this helps you think of what colors and themes to use. Is your pet a girl or a boy? What's their favorite color? What is your pet's pet breed? These are good questions to ask yourself when you are designing the inside.
 Cut windows. These will let in light for your seemingly dark and forbidding house.
, If you want wood furniture, ask a friend who is good with wood, unless you are good with wood yourself. Clay furniture will take up a lot of time, but it's worth it.
 Your pet will thank you for this, as wood and clay are uncomfortable to sit on and sleep on.
 This is also a good time to think of your pet's personality. Is your new stuffed animal playful? Shy? Caring?

, These spots will be your hot spots. You'll be glad you did this later.
 Stuffed animals don't like walking around with no clothes on! Think of pajamas, everyday clothes, fancy clothes, a bathing suit, etc.
 Having fun with your new stuffed animal is the most important thing after you get your animal.

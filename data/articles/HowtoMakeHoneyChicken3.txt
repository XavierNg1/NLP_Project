 While you wait for it to warm up, line an oven-safe baking dish with foil and spray with cooking spray or brush with oil.


The original recipe recommends using two layers of foil â€” the sauce used for the chicken can be hard to get off of the pan if it bakes in., Mix together honey, both kinds of oil, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and pepper in a small bowl. Stir well to combine.
 You can put the thighs on the foil-lined pan and pour the sauce over them or pour the sauce into a sturdy plastic bag with the chicken and turn the bag to coat. Either way, make sure the chicken gets an even coating of sauce before arranging the pieces in the pan.


Once the pieces are well-coated, arrange them in the pan with an inch or two of space between each piece. Pour the extra sauce over the chicken.
 Check on the chicken after about 20 minutes or so. If it appears to be quite black already, cover the meat with another layer of tin foil and return it to the oven. This should help keep it moist and slow the searing process that blackens the chicken's surface.
 When the chicken is done all the way through, remove it from the oven and let it sit for five to ten minutes. Serve and enjoy!


If you wish, you can save the leftover liquid from the cooking pan and use it as a sauce for your meal. This is an especially good choice if you are eating your chicken with rice or another neutral side dish.
 The soy flavor used in this dish is surprisingly versatile, so you can pair it with a lot of different flavors. Here are just a few ideas from Asian cuisine that might naturally accompany it well:


White rice
Spring rolls
Shrimp soup

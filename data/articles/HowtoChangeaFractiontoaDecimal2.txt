 The numerator is always divided by the denominator in a fraction. With that is mind, you can convert any fraction into a decimal with a calculator. Any calculator will work to change fractions into decimals.


More advanced scientific and graphic calculators have a fraction button on them. They can change fractions as well as add, subtract, multiply, and divide them by other fractions., To figure out a fraction as a decimal with a calculator, you need to divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, you have the fraction 8/15. Hit the number 8 key on your calculator. Hit the รท symbol. Then hit the 1 and then the 5 to make 15. Then hit =.One of the benefits of using a calculator is that you can do much harder fractions in much less time than by hand. For example, you need to change 9/17 into a decimal. Instead of having to write out each section of the division, you can just punch it into your calculator. You get an answer of 0.52941, though it does keep going.
 Once you solve 8/15 on the calculator, the answer you see is: "0.5333333333333." This is another case where you have a repeating decimal. You would write it as 0.53 with a line over the 3 to show that it repeats.


With a calculator, you can choose where to cut off your decimal much easier. For example, with 9/17, the numbers continued on after the 5 places written down. When you choose where to stop, always look at the number behind that number. You use that number to round up the last number in your decimal if necessary. Since the next number for 0.52941 is a 1, it stays that way it is. If it was a 5 or higher, the decimal would have rounded to 0.52942.

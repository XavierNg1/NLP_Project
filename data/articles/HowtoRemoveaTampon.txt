 Tampons can be worn safely for up to 8 hours and then must be changed. Leaving a tampon in any longer puts you at a higher risk for infection for Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), a rare but potentially deadly infection.If you try to change your tampon after 8 hours and it still has a lot of absorbency or only has a little blood on it, try switching to a lower absorbency tampon. Always wear the tampon with the lowest possible absorbency for your flow.;

Unless it's been 8 hours (in which case you should try the peeing trick to ease its removal), leave the tampon in another hour or two and then check it.If you remove the tampon after 4-8 hours and there is very little blood, you may want to switch to a lower absorbency tampon or use panty liners instead., Some companies claim their tampons are safe to flush, but it's generally not a good idea.Tampons will eventually break down, but not quickly enough that they won't expand and clog your pipes, destroy your septic tank, and cause a lot of (expensive!) plumbing problems.

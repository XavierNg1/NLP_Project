 Most cement additives are non-flammable and non-hazardous in normal use but sensible precautions should be taken when using them in much the same way as when using cement which is an alkaline product.


Avoid skin contact as much as possible. If contact does occur or if liquid is accidentally splashed in the eyes wash out thoroughly in clean water. You should wash anyway after using cement and additives, before eating or allowing hand to mouth contact.
Should any liquid be swallowed, seek medical advice immediately

, All additives should be stored in a frost free place within the temperature range 5° - 30° C.

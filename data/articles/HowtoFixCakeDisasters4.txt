 A bump in a cake is usually caused by an oven that is too hot. Double check the temperature next time you bake a cake.


It can also be caused by too much mixture in too small a pan. This is usually the case where the cake develops a crack. Try to match the cake mixture to a bigger pan. Some pans cause bumps or cracking due to their shape, such as ring and loaf pans.

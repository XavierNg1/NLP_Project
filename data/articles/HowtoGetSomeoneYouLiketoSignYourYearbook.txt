 If you blush a lot, try to calm down. Treat your crush like you would any member of the opposite gender that you are not attracted to. Simply ask them like you would ask any friend to sign your yearbook.;
, Start at the end and work down, but do not skip your crush when you get to them! They might even ask you!

, When they say yes, hand your yearbook to them and a writing utensil if they don't have one. Ask or wait to be asked to sign their yearbook. Smile and act casual, like you would with a close friend.
 If you suddenly stop right after you get their sign, that will look pretty obvious.

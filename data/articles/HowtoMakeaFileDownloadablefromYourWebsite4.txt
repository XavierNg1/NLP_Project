 If you use Wix to create and manage your site, log into the Wix website and load your webpage in the site editor.
 You can create links from text on your page or from images.
 The process varies a little for text and images:


Text - Click the Link button in the Text Settings window. The button looks like a chainlink. This will open the link menu.
Image - Select "A link open" from the "When image is clicked" menu in the Image Settings window. Click "Add a link" in the "What does the link do?" section. This will open the link menu.
 This will allow you to upload various document files.
 This will open the file uploader.
 You can only upload DOC, PDF, PPT, XLS, and ODT (and their subformats) files. This means you're essentially limited to uploading documents. File sizes are limited to 15 MB.
 Once you've uploaded the file, your link is ready to go. Click the "Publish" button in the upper-right corner to save your changes and push them to the live site.

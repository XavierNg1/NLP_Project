 Round up a few people to help you out- three is a good number. Assign one "filler" (someone to rapidly put cups on the table and fill them with water) and two "passers" (people to pass out water to the runners).;
, Each cup should be filled about halfway.
 Take one cup in each hand and stretch your arms out so passing runners can take the cups. Grip it loosely at the bottom so they are easy to grab.
 After the first group clears, more and more runners will be passing your way. The filler should keep the cups coming, and the passers should be running back and forth as quickly as they can, so all runners get water.
 There are always a few people who are too bashful to snatch the water out of your hands. If anyone looks thirsty (panting, red-faced, etc.) but hasn't taken water, offer them a cup. If they refuse, that's fine, but if they accept, you know you've done something good.
 A simple "you're welcome" to a runner's "thank you" is fine." Remember, though, that most of these people can hardly breathe, let alone talk. Expect some people to ignore you completely, and others to grab the water and not say a word.
 It's going to happen when you have people racing by and snatching water out of your hand. Don't worry about a spill. Watch out certain people, though, who will slap your hand and cause the water to fly into your face. Most likely, they are crabby from all of that running and looking for a laugh. Besides- it's just water!

, Tell the runners that they're doing a terrific job. Splash water on people if they ask (or if they look like they need it.) Throw some water on your friends. It's all for a good cause!

 Place ½ cup (107 g) of shea butter in a small saucepan, and heat on the stove on medium-low until it melts completely, which should take approximately 10 minutes. Next, stir in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of sweet almond oil until it’s completely blended, and remove the pan from the heat.Stir the shea butter periodically as it’s melting to ensure that it heats evenly.
You can substitute another nourishing oil for the almond oil. Jojoba, avocado, and apricot oils are all good options.
 Pour the shea butter mixture into a freezer-safe bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set the bowl in the freezer to cool the mixture so it hardens slightly, which should take 15 to 20 minutes.While you want the mixture to solidify slightly, avoid freezing it. Don’t keep it in the freezer for more than 20 minutes.
 Once the shea butter mixture appears solid, remove it from the freezer. Mix in 10 drops of lavender essential oil, 5 drops of rosemary essential oil, 3 drops of carrot seed essential oil, and 3 drops of tea tree essential oil. Use a whisk to to whip the mixture until it has a light, creamy consistency like whipped cream.You may find it easier to whip the lotion mixture using the whisk attachment on a stand mixer.
 When the lotion has reached the proper consistency, transfer it to a glass storage container with a lid. Keep the lotion at room temperature, and it should stay fresh for up to a year.The lotion can be used on your body and face.
It isn't necessary to store the lotion in the refrigerator, but doing so can help prolong its life for several months.

 There are thousands of companies that sell leads but not every company is the right one for your business. When you are searching for a lead generation lead company, find out how they generate their leads.For example, many lists are obtained from magazine subscriptions. You want names of people that subscribe to magazines related to real estate. You will also be able to define income level, age, zip codes, gender, level of education, etc. for the type of names you want to purchase.
 Select a company that has been in business for at least 10 years, and has experience with mortgage-related clients. This will help ensure that you do not get scammed or receive poor mortgage leads. Interview at least three companies and read testimonials of past and current clients.
 After you have decided which company you want to go with, request a sample of the leads that they can generate for you before you sign a contract. This is the best way to determine the quality of the lead. A good lead will have all the contact information and additional information about the lead such as credit status, income level, age, etc.

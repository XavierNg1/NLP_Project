 Barrows is a high level mini-game that involves fighting 6 brothers and the looting the chest for a chance at their armor. You are going to want to be no less that 70 in each of your preferred skill. Magic would be the most effective as 4 of the 6 brothers are weak to an elemental magic, however melee and range are viable options as well. Take Plenty of food, and 3 or 4 prayer potions. Note that you require a shovel in Osrs, but not in RS3.;
, If you have completed the quest "In Aid of Myreque", you can use the shortcut underneath the bar in Canfis, otherwise you have to go through the swap and around the maze. Go just East of the Shades of Mort'ton minigame and you'll see 6 mounds, dig up one to go to the brother.
 Each of them have their special perks, however Dharok is the one to look out for. The lower health he has, the higher damage he has a potential to deal. Protect from melee or similar prayers are highly recomended, as he can one-hit you without prayer.
 In one of the brothers tomb's you will find that there is a tunnel leading to a crypt. Only enter this after all 5 of the other brothers are killed. Here you will have to go through a series of doors to get to the center, the final door requiring you to answer a puzzle. Once you have done that, go through the door.
 As you attempt to the final brother you did not fight originally will appear. Kill him and then loot the chest. You are looking to get one of their items, the most valuable include Guthan's armor and weapon and Karil's Crossbow.

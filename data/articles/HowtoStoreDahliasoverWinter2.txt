 When dry, place the tubers and stem into the crates and cover with a dry material. This dry material could include:


Sand.
Shredded newspaper.
Peat.
 Cover the plant and check every few weeks for signs of black or off-colored growth. This growth could indicate decay. A plant that is wilting and limpness is dehydrated.


If your plant is dehydrated, lightly mist the tubers with water until they are slightly moist.
If you find any decayed parts of the plant, remove these damaged parts to give the remainder of the plant a better chance for recovery.
 A few weeks before the last frost move the tubers to a new workstation. Divide any large tubers now to give the new cuts a better chance of resisting mildew, rot, and fungus.


Break the buds down until only one large bud remains in each section.
 Place each section of dahlia into a pot with fresh soil and fertilizer. Store the plant in a sheltered area out of direct sunlight. Once the leaves have formed and hardened off you can move the plant into direct sunlight or back to its original location before the winter.

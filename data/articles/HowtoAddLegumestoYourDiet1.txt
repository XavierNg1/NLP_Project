 Legumes make a great addition to any salad. You can simply add cooked black-eyed peas or lima beans to a delicious iceberg lettuce salad. Combine with some fresh-cut vegetables (like tomatoes, bell peppers, and cucumbers) and top it off with a vinaigrette or creamy salad dressing.You can also add lentils, peas, or edamame beans to a salad for extra flavor and protein.;
, Rather than slathering high-calorie mayonnaise on your sandwich, choose hummus instead. It’s very spreadable, and adds a delicious creamy texture to savory sandwiches. This is a great source of protein, and much healthier than using mayonnaise.You can also substitute hummus for other high-calorie options like guacamole, or as a pizza topping (instead of marinara sauce).

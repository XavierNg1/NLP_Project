 It’s important that you get a bikini wax from a practitioner you can trust. Ask friends and family if they have suggestions. You should also take time to read reviews of the establishment and practitioner online before booking your appointment., Your hair will need to be at least ¼ inch or 2/3 centimeter long for a bikini wax. If the hair is any shorter than this, the wax will not be able to grab onto the hair. If your hair is not long enough, the practitioner may send you home and have you reschedule the appointment., Gentle exfoliation can help loosen hair from its follicles, which may make the waxing process a little easier and possibly less painful. Try using a washcloth to gently exfoliate the area to be waxed. Make sure you do not rub too hard, or you can cause inflammation., It is important that you don’t show up for your bikini wax wearing tight bottoms, such as a pair of skinny jeans. After your wax you will want to put on loose-fitting bottoms, like a pair of linen pants or a dress. If you feel comfortable, you can forgo underwear after your treatment. If not, wear soft, comfortable panties.
 It is important that you are hydrated when you go in for your bikini wax. This can make the process a little less painful. Try drinking at least 64 ounces the day before and the day of your wax.

 Horses do not exist in the current version of Minecraft PE, although they may be added in a future update. Learn how using this guide to installing mods, if you've never tried it before. (Note that this can be difficult or impossible on some versions of iOS.) You can search for horse mods on your own, or look up the mods named "Horses" created by Argll or Bernard.Download mods at your own risk. They may contain viruses that infect your phone. The above examples have worked for some users, but this is not a guarantee that they are safe.
 If your horses are all-black or look like cows, you'll need to download a texture pack as well. Check the website where you downloaded the mod, and look for a link to a texture pack. Once downloaded, restart Minecraft to see your horses in full color.
 Because each mod is created by users, there is no standard way to tame horses. In some mods, you feed the horse wheat to tame it. In others, you might just interact with it using an empty hand. The creator usually posts these details somewhere on their website.

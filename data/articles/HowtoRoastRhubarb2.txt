 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Wash 1 pound (453 g) of rhubarb and trim off the ends. Slice the rhubarb into pieces that are 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. Spread the rhubarb in a large baking dish.The rhubarb should be in a single layer in the dish, so they bake evenly.
 Evenly pour 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar over the rhubarb in the dish. Zest 1 orange and scatter the zest over the sugared rhubarb. Lay 2 vanilla beans over the rhubarb.If you don't have vanilla beans, you can stir 1 to 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract into the roasted rhubarb after it's cooked.
 Cover the pan with aluminum foil or a lid and put the rhubarb in the preheated oven. Roast the rhubarb for 20 minutes. The rhubarb should be completely soft, but still hold their shape once they've finished cooking., Remove the pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Remove the foil or lid and carefully take out the vanilla beans. Serve the roasted rhubarb while it's warm or chill it before serving.You can store leftover roasted rhubarb in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

 You can use all one color, or different colors. This will be enough to make one tassel.If you can't find crepe paper streamers, use tissue paper instead. Cut the tissue paper into 18 by 2 inch (45.72 by 5.08 centimeters) rectangles.
 Place the strips one on top of each other in a stack. Then, fold all three in half at the same time. You'll end up with a thick, 9 inch (22.86 centimeters) long strip of crepe paper.
 Stop about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) away from the top fold. Try to keep the space between each slit the same.
 Keep the edges aligned. You should end up with something that looks like a giant pair of whiskers.
 Take your giant whiskers and start rolling the center un-cut part into a tight tube. This will make it easier to twist later.
 You are only twisting those 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) of un-cut paper. Keep twisting until you have a 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) long rope. Leave the tassels/whiskers un-twisted.
 This will help create a loop shape so that you can thread your tassel onto a piece of twine.
 Try to keep the tape as close to the pen or pencil as possible. Don't get any tape on the loose tassel bit.
 You can now slip your tassel onto a piece of twine. If your tassel slides around the string too much, you can simply tie the string around the top of the loop.
 You can make them all the same color, or even alternate colors. If you want, you can even use Mylar or metallic tissue paper to create some sparkle.,

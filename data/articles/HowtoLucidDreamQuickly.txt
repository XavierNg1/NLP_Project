 Lay down and relax your body. Let your thoughts go, and just relax. Have no worries. Forget the world, forget your body. Focus on your mind.;
, Well, stay laying down in your bed, and try to fall asleep. But, keep your mind conscious. It may take awhile, but be patient.
 You may feel a faint feeling of bouncing. Or, imagine that you are swimming in the ocean, a nice cool ocean, and the waves keep going over you. You may feel that when the waves come over you, you feel a wave of coolness. Use one of those two things.
 The visualization will get clearer. Make sure that you don't get too excited at this part, though. This will thrust you back into full-consciousness.
 If you chose the trampoline, you can control to jump so high into the sky that you can start flying. If you chose the ocean, you can dive underwater and explore the depths of the ocean with mermaids.
 Just move little by little. And don't get super excited either. That will wake you up. And finally when you can control you body, you can start to be able to add people into the dream, remove people, do things you aren't able to do in reality, and change the places that you are in.
 I've done it before many times using this method, and I think it is the most helpful. Good luck and have fun!

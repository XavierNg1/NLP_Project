 A home's centre is often the kitchen. In this day and age, it is often the case that the whole family gets to see each other for meals and so it is important that it smells great. The smell of baking bread is amazingly good. If you don't have the time to bake your own, buy some from the bakers. That way, you get a lovely smelling kitchen AND yummy food!;
, Flowers can make a whole room smell lovely-why not try growing them in your garden or even in a window-box? Then when spring/summer comes around, your house will smell gorgeously like flowers and the outdoors

, Houses will smell stuffy if there is no air. If it's a nice day, let the air in. Even have your door open if it's safe to do so. That way, you'll seem friendly and when you have guests in they will compliment you on your great smelling home

, The bathroom is a difficult one to get smelling good naturally. Try the previous step-opening a window to let the fresh air in, or try using bicarbonate of soda/vinegar to dispel any bad odours. If you have a bathroom extractor fan, obviously run that when someone is in the toilet

, Choose nice, natural good smelling products that complement each other For example, switch to beeswax polish which smells absolutely gorgeous-just rub it on in small,circular motions to release the smell and also to leave your unpolished wooden surfaces shining and healthy. Pair this with a natural lavender cleaning spray to evoke the smells of summer and a garden buzzing with busy bees

, Some examples could be changing bins regularly, doing any washing up that's left on the side, and clearing up small spills will help your house to smell lovely.

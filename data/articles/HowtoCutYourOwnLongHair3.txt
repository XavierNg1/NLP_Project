 This cut will give you a more angled haircut, and it is ideal if you want an inverted bob.


Keep in mind that this method will not remove much length from your hair, but cutting a lot of hair can result in heavy layering as well as significant weight removal from your hair, which may not make it ideal for fine or thin hair.
 Holding your hair firmly up above your head, cut into it with scissors.


You can determine where the shortest layer will fall by pinching a piece of hair from the front hairline where you want the shortest layer to fall. Pull it back to where you will twist. This can act as a guide for where to cut.
 Let your hair fall back down and run a comb through it.
 Pulling your hair up once more, twist it in the opposite direction.
 Holding your twisted hair up over your head again, move across the ends of it, snipping away any hairs that stick out.
 Let go of your hair and comb it out, styling it as you wish.

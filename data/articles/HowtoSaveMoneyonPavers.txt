 For example, do you want to design a space for entertaining, a quiet garden sanctuary, a pool deck, driveway or something completely unique?;
, This should be based on how you plan on using the area when your project is complete.
 Use stakes and twine to outline the border of your space. This will help you to stay on track when you start excavating.
 Multiply the length by the width to get your total square footage.
 Once you know the total square footage that you need, go online and look for discounts. If you visit a site with all in one pricing, like www.GoPavers.com, it will be easier to determine your total project cost. You can also visit liquidation stores in your neighborhood to see if they have left over pavers that contractors didn't need. These will often be discounted.
 You will need to buy or rent a tool to excavate the area, as it needs to be dug 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3Â cm).
 These two items are necessary for your installation project. You can buy them online and save or look for special offers at the hardware store.
 Take the cost of your pavers, price of the tools, and cost of the base and sealer then add it up for the total cost, if you are going to install them yourself.
 If you are going to hire a contractor make sure to get multiple bids. Angie's List is an excellent place to start because you can read reviews from other users and make sure you are hiring someone that can deliver the project on budget.
 Compare the quote you got on www.GoPavers.com with the price of doing it yourself, and your contractor bids. Select the one that is a combination of the cheapest and most reliable. A project done incorrectly will only cost you more in the long run.

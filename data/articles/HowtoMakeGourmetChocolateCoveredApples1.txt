 Choose varieties like Braeburn, Fuji, or Gala. You want an apple that's a decent size and sweet, but not too sweet. Wash your apples and twist the stems off. Push a Popsicle stick down into the core.


The apples will take to the coating better if they're cold. Put them in the fridge while you're preparing everything else.;
, Chunks about 1" (2.5 cm) are a good, basic size. You're more than welcome to use dark chocolate if that's what your taste buds prefer. And as far as toppings go, well, that ball's in your court entirely!


When it comes to add-ons, virtually anything works. Whatever it is, just make sure it's in fine pieces. Crush your Oreos and nuts, mash your Butterfingers and Reese's, and use mini M&Ms. Place your topping in a separate, wide-brimmed bowl.

An extra chocolate drizzle will score you points for presentation. When you melt the semisweet chocolate, melt an extra bowl of white chocolate (4 oz will do) to drizzle over the tops.
 Line it with parchment paper. Spray it with a light layer of cooking spray, if desired, to prevent the apples from sticking.

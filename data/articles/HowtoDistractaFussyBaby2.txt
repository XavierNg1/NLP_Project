 Being held by a familiar person may help the baby calm down and stop being fussy. Being held gives them a sense of comfort and familiarity which can lift their mood. Physical contact can be a powerful distraction and calming technique.You can hold your baby in your arms, in a baby sling, or in a carrier.
 Your baby may be fussy because they are hungry. Even if they are not hungry, they may feel comforted and calmed by breastfeeding. Hold your baby, sing to them, and let them breastfeed to see if that will distract and soothe them.If you donâ€™t breastfeed your child, you can try giving them a bottle or a pacifier.
 Your baby may be calmed and soothed by a gentle, repetitive rocking motion. Try sitting in a rocking chair or rocking your baby back and forth where you stand. You can also try swaying, swinging, or bouncing your baby. Try any repetitive, smooth motion.If none of that works, try going for a quick drive in the car.
 Babies find touch from familiar people soothing. You can distract your baby by massaging, stroking, or rubbing your baby. Rub their arms or legs, stroke their head, or rub their back in a gentle, calm circle.You might also try patting them in a constant, rhythmic way. Try this on their back or bottom.
Use long, smooth strokes when touching your baby. These have a better calming effect.
 Your baby feels comfort when they are surrounded by close, secure clothing. This is because it is like being in the womb, which was comforting and secure for them. To recreate this, you can swaddle your baby in a blanket.Make sure the arms are down by their sides.

 Truly listen to what the other person is saying. One way to physically show that you are listening is to stop doing anything else you are doing. Look the person in the eye. Let the person talk, and don't interrupt until he or she is done., One way to show you value another person is to give them the gift of your time. Watch a movie together, or cook dinner together. Go out for a special outing. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you are taking the time to enjoy each others' company., Everyone needs some kind of hobby or outlet, and it's often different for each member of a family. Ask questions about what's going on with your family members' hobbies on a regular basis, and show up for important events if you can, such as going to dance recitals or baseball games.
 If you notice another family member is upset, try to offer them comfort. One thing you can do is just listen to what's bothering them and try to help where you can.

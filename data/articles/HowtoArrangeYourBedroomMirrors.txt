 Ideally there should be two mirrors in a bedroom - a body-length mirror and a dressing table or smaller mirror that you can get close to with ease.
 Either the bedroom door or a wardrobe door will do fine, as long as you can stand in front of them closely and some distance away to view your garments in full. This mirror does not need to be elaborate or framed, as nobody but you will see it. Just a rectangle hung vertically with screws in each corner will suffice. If it lacks sufficient light, install a light near it if possible., Preferably this mirror should be near a window. This will allow you to see clearly as you apply makeup, use tweezers to pull out those stubborn facial hairs and arrange your hairstyle. Yes, a lot of us do this in the bathroom but the luxury of sitting down comfortably in front of a dressing table mirror is well worth it and a surprising number of bathrooms do not have sufficient natural light.

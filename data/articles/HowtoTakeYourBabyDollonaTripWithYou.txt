If your doll is a boy:

It depends how long you're going for. If it's a couple of days, you don't need as much. Write out a checklist that you can check while you throw things into the suitcase. You'll need his pajamas, if your going for more than a week take two or three pairs. Take a shirt for every second day, he can wear them a couple of times each. Pants! Pack three or four depending on how long you're going for. Take three pairs of shoes, some booties,and sneakers (if you have them) and a few pairs of socks. Diapers! If your doll is the kind that wets his nappies, you'll have to take two for everyday, if it isn't, just take a couple. Take maybe two jackets and a few snug suits.


For girls:

Girls can wear almost anything, take a few dresses, some cute outfits, diapers, two pairs of PJ's some shirts and skirts, tights, pants, shoes and socks. Add some sweet beanie hats in as well.
 A bottle, his/her pacifier, some toys, a snug blanket and maybe some books for her to read. If he/she eats that baby food stuff, also (if needed) bring medication. pack enough of that for her or him.
 Try to fit his/her bag into your suitcase so it won't take up any more room.

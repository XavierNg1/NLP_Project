 This will be your base for your coffee table so you want something not only reliable and sturdy but one with legs that compliment your style.

Head for the junkyard and try to find something you can recycle.



 


Consider a stool that either provides you with a sturdy, hard base or one that allows you to mount a piece of plywood or a shelf insert on top.
Examine the stool top to ensure you have enough room to place the magazine holders (all four) on top in a rotating, surrounding fashion.;
, If you cannot find this brand look for four magazine holders that will fit together around the stool seat and have a flat base and sides.
 This is not the kind of coffee table you will want your kids or niece and nephew rough-housing around and could easily break if only secured with liquid nails. However, if you have a rambunctious German Shepherd or a spouse that insists on putting his or her feet on the table, you may want to secure the top with both screws and liquid nails to re-enforce its strength.

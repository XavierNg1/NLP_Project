 Use a fertilizer designed for roses with a 5-10-5 or 4-8-4 ratio..


Spread 1/4 to 1/2 cup of fertilizer over the soil around the rose just before watering it.
 Give your plant another dose of fertilizer when the new flower buds appear and again at about the middle of summer.


Do not give Knock Out roses any fertilizer after the middle of summer as it will produce lots of new, lush stems that will not mature in time to withstand the cold winter weather.
Even in mild-winter climates, they should not be given fertilizer in late summer or fall so they can still have a bit of a dormant season to rest up for spring.
 If the Knock Out rose does not get enough fertilizer, it will grow slowly, bloom less and the leaves may become pale.


Too much fertilizer may cause the edges of the leaves to turn brown.



Cut out any stems that are growing across other stems as they will rub when the wind blows and damage each other.
After the rose is a few years old, trim each stem back by one-half to one-third their height. #Hold the pruning shear correctly. Make the pruning cuts at a 45-degree angle about 1/4-inch above a growth bud which is a small, raised area of plant tissue on the stem, usually right where a leaf with five leaflets is growing.
New stems will grow from the growth bud just below the pruning cut.
 Deadheading, the process of removing faded blooms, is not required with these roses. They will drop their blooms to the ground as they fade. Rake up and remove any trimmings after pruning the rose. The dead flowers should be raked up and removed every few weeks as well.


When left in the garden, dead flowers and trimmings provide an environment for bacterial and fungal infections.These rose shrubs are resistant to such diseases but other nearby plants may not be. The other plants will be less likely to contract these diseases and the garden will look nicer when it is cleaned up.

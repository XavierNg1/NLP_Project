Add the oil to your pan and allow it to become very hot. The oil should shimmer, but not quite begin to smoke.



While the pan is still very hot, add the cubed or cut protein being very careful not to splash hot oil. Using a silicone or wooden spoon or spatula, briskly move the protein around the pan until it is nearly cooked. During the last minute of cooking time add the onion, garlic and ginger and allow it to cook until aromatic. Constantly stir the contents of your pan.



Remove the protein from the wok or pan and place the pan back on the heat. When heated, add the vegetables and stir briskly until they are crisp tender. This could take 2 to 3 minutes depending on your vegetables of choice.



When the vegetables are crisp tender, add the cooked meat to the pan. Then pour in the slurry and allow the mixture to boil. Continue stirring until it boils and then season and serve. Do not overcook or your vegetables will become limp and your meat dry.

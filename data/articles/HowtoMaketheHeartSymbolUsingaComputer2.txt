 This will display various settings categories for your Mac computer.
 This will open your input settings.
 The box is labeled "Show viewers for keyboard, symbols, and emoji in the menu bar." This will add a new button to your menu bar at the top of the screen.
 You'll see a few options for different input viewers.
 A new window will appear with a bunch of different symbols.
 This will display all of the different emoji characters that are available, broken down into different categories.

 It will be inserted wherever your cursor currently is active.


There's another heart symbol in the "Pictographs" section. This is meant to be used as the playing card symbol.

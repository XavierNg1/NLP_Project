 One way to achieve the bohemian look in your home is to mix patterns. It’s okay that it doesn’t match. Choose patterns that you like and put them together with no care to having them match perfectly.You may want to choose a color base, like red or blue, and only choose patterns that have that base color.
Choosing different kinds of patterns may help reduce any clashing. Two mismatched florals may look worse than a floral placed next to a southwest pattern.;
, Another way to achieve the bohemian style is to have cotton alongside satin, faux fur, corduroy, and flannel. Try different textures on different items, or try mixing textures on the same item.

For example, you may have a cotton comforter, satin pillows, and a faux fur throw blanket. You may also use pillows and blankets made from satin, corduroy, faux fur, and cotton.
Choose chairs, sofas, and ottomans with different textured materials.
Consider mixing textures on rugs, wall tapestries, and curtains.
 One of the keys to bohemian decor is the color scheme. Bold, bright colors of any shade can complement a bohemian room. Common colors are rusted red, deep orange, gold, brown, electric blue, deep purples, and pinks.You can choose one base color, or a few complimentary colors to start with.
With bohemian decor, you can really choose any colors you want.

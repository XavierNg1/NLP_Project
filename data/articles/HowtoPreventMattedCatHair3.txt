 Many cats are hesitant to be brushed because they never became accustomed to being handled by humans. Slowly get your cat used to your touch by petting it for brief sessions every day.


If your cat responds negatively to your touch, then you need to find another time in the day to pet it. Even a cat that doesn't like to be petted may have a time in the day when it is more open to it.
 Brushing is the best method to avoid mats, so if your cat doesn't like being brushed you should try to get the cat used to it. Pet the cat until it is relaxed and hopefully purring. Let the cat sniff the comb and then gently pass the smooth side of the comb over the cat's coat, without putting the tines through your cat's fur. Swiftly follow the comb with your hand so the comb is almost indistinguishable from a stroke.


Repeat this a few times, give the cat a treat and end the session on a high. Repeat this daily, twice daily if possibly, building up the cat's tolerance of contact with comb and having its body touched in general.
This approach works best if the coat isn't tangled, since tangles equals tugging and soreness. Thus if the coat is already knotted consider getting the worst areas clipped away and then start getting the cat used to being brushed.
 If a cat hisses and spits, and yet you want to get rid of a stubborn knot before it causes a problem, consider scruffing the cat. To do this use your non-dominant hand to grasp the cat's scruff so that you can use your dominant hand to comb the cat through. This has a naturally subduing effect on the cat, as it's where the mother grips her kittens when carrying them.


Never lift the cat off the ground completely, as this could injure an adult cat. Simply grip the scruff to stop the cat running away.

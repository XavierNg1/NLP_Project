 Thicker paper, such as cardstock or an index card would work best for this, but you can use plain printer paper too. If you plan on painting several bobby pins the same color, consider separating them into small groups based on the color you will be painting them.


If you want to create a "color blocked" look, get some black bobby pins, and lay down strips of tape over them at various angles.;
, Don't worry if the nail polish looks see-though in places; you can always add another coat or two. You can paint either the flat side or the bumpy sideâ€”whichever one you plan on wearing on top!


The bobby pins don't have to be all one color. You could even paint stripes!
To create sparkly bobby pins, use either glitter nail polish, or shake some fine, scrapbooking glitter onto the nail polish instead., Some shades of nail polish only need one coat, while others may require up to three., This may not be necessary for regular nail polish, but if you added any glitter, it would be a good idea. If you'd like a twist, you can use glitter nail polish or a "matte" top coat instead.
 To prevent any chips or dents, wait for the nail polish to dry completely.


If you color blocked your bobby pins, carefully peel the tape off after the nail polish dries.
 You may notice bits of paper or excess nail polish sticking to the bobby pins. If this happens, simply scratch the paper/nail polish off with your fingernail.

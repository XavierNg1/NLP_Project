 If you try to freeze them while they're hot, the cupcakes will give off a steam that turns into condensation and may even cause the paper liners to peel off while they are freezing. The best way to cool cupcakes fully is to leave them on a wire rack for about an hour, until they're cool enough to touch and handle.


Wire racks are recommended over a plate or chopping board because the air can circulate more easily around the cupcakes.This prevents the cupcakes from getting soggy on the bottom while they are cooling.;
, After the cupcakes have cooled thoroughly, consider placing them in an airtight container to freeze. The container should be large enough to hold all the cupcakes you have and tall enough to prevent the cupcakes from squishing into each other.Ensure the container gives the cupcakes enough room to avoid the tops from getting sticky or touching the lid. The lid should also be able to snap tightly on top of the container.
 If you don't have a container on hand or would like another method of freezing cupcakes, you can use freezer bags. When placing the cupcakes in the airtight bag, create layers and stack the cupcakes with parchment paper to keep them from sticking to each other.

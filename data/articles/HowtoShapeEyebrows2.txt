 You may find that hairs are within your ideal shape, but are just too long. Use a pair of eyebrow trimmers to clean up your look.











Using a brow brush, brush the hairs upward.
Cut the hairs that extend beyond your natural hairline.
 If your brows are too light (or dark), fill them in with an eyebrow pencil. If you don't have an eyebrow pencil, substitute matte eyeshadow.











If your brows are fair, choose a pencil two shades darker than your hair. (If you have dark hair, go two shades lighter.)
Hold your skin taut at the temple, and line softly along the upper edge of your brow. Then, line along the bottom edge.
With feathery strokes, fill in between the two edges.Remember to blend!

, Brush the hairs how they naturally lie and apply gel to set the hairs in place.











Clear mascara can double as a brow gel.
This also prevents smudging, if filled in.
 Forming good habits will make your routine shorter, day by day.











By sticking to a specific contoured shape, spotting strays becomes easy.
Consistently pluck between the brows and at the edges. These hairs grow the fastest and take away from the natural shape of your brows.

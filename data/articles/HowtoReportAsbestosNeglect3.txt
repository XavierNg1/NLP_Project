 Most states have at least minimal regulations regarding the handling and disposal of asbestos within their jurisdiction, and some have more stringent regulations than even the Federal Government. Once you’ve made your report with the EPA, you can tip off the authorities in your state.


The EPA maintains a list of all the environmental regulatory bodies in each state or territory. You can access it at https://www.epa.gov/home/health-and-environmental-agencies-us-states-and-territories.
There are even a few large municipalities with their own asbestos regulations. For example, New York City’s asbestos regulations are more than eighty pages long. They regulate asbestos so stringently they have their own portal where you can report a violation, located at http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1093/asbestos-complaint.
 Most of the state environmental agencies have a link where you can report violations right on their home page, so it shouldn’t be too hard for you to find it.


Louisiana’s, for example, is on the left side in the middle of the page.
 Again, you’ll need to give the regulatory agency information about where you saw the asbestos, who was there, what type of activity was ongoing, and the general condition of the site.


Although it might seem redundant to file two reports, it’s a worth the extra time. That way, both regulatory entities will be aware of the problematic behavior, making it less likely an environmental miscreant slips through the cracks because an enforcement agency wasn’t aware of their record.

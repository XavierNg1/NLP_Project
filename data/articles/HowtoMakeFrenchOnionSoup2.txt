 Pour in the stock first, using a spatula to loosen the onions and garlic from the bottom of the pan and stir them into the stock. Pour in the wine and give it another stir.
 Add the bay leaf and thyme to the soup. Taste the soup and add salt and pepper. Cover the saucepan and let the soup simmer so the flavors meld for about half an hour.
 After the soup has simmered, remove the lid and taste it again. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Find the bay leaf and throw it away.

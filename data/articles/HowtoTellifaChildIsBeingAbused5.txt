 Babies and toddlers subjected to abuse can show signs of regression. They might go back to thumb sucking, wetting their pants or beds (even if they were already potty trained), and an obvious reversion of their ability to verbally communicate.
 Young children who are abused can suddenly develop fear for a specific location, like their daycare, fear for a specific person, or a specific look (women with long hair, men with beard, etc).
 Toddlers who are abused will have deviations in their usual sleep patterns and will wake up with nightmares more often. If you notice that your toddler, or a toddler you are caring for, is having a very difficult time sleeping, or she is having an increasing number of nightmares, these may be signs of abuse.

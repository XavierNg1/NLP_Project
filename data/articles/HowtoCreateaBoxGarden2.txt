 Fill with potting soil and plant seeds. Plant 2 or 3 seeds in each pot, and pinch off the weaker looking plants leaving only 1 per pot.
 Make sure they have drainage holes and place them in the garden area. Make any adjustments now. It's much easier to move an empty container than one filled with soil.

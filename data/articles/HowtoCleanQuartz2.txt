 Before trying harsh chemicals on your quartz, try the Waller solution method first because the chemicals in the solution are easier to obtain and are less harmful. You can buy the chemicals and mix them yourself or purchase Super Iron Out at a regular department store (such as Walmart).Put the quartz in the solution outside because the solution has a strong smell.
The solution only lasts for 24 hours.
Make the solution at home with: 8.4 grams of Sodium Bicarbonate, 17.4 grams of Sodium Dithionite, and 5.9 grams of Trisodium salt of Citric Acid (sodium citrate).
Make sure to wear eye goggles and gloves when using the Waller solution., If the Waller solution does not work, you can use oxalic acid to clean quartz. You should be very careful with it because it is toxic. Make sure to wear gloves, protective eye gear, and to not inhale the oxalic acid. Make sure to use the oxalic acid outside where there is ventilation. There are other chemicals you can use instead of oxalic acid to clean quartz, but they are more dangerous.


You can usually find oxalic acid for sale in hardware stores.
Use technical or industrial grade oxalic acid because it is less expensive than pure oxalic acid., Mix 1-1.5 pounds of oxalic acid with around five gallons of water. Mix the oxalic acid in a plastic or ceramic container because it attacks metals. Let your quartz soak in the oxalic acid solution overnight. After the the quartz is clean, rinse the quartz in clean water for a few hours.


Be extremely careful with oxalic acid.
Always where gloves and protective eye gear.
Work with the oxalic acid somewhere well ventilated., Do not throw oxalic acid down the drain. Neutralize your quartz with limestone chips. You can leave this neutralized solution around (somewhere safe) and add more oxalic acid to it later if you need it again. You can also let the solution evaporate.

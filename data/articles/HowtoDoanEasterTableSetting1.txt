 From the outset, plan to include enough items that suggest Easter to the guests. Typical Easter themed items include:

Baby animals: Bunnies, chicks and lambs. Possibly also foals, piglets and other baby animals but these are not as commonplace for Easter designs.






Eggs: Dyed, colored, real (brown, white, speckled, etc.), artificial eggs (plastic, foam, papier mache, etc.), cloth or fabric, lace, etc.






Nests: For the eggs and chicks to rest in.






Wreaths: Easter wreaths are now more popular, using featuring eggs and writing such as "Happy Easter" and perhaps baby animals.






Feathers: In displays, wreaths and as part of Easter crafts.






Spring elements: This includes flowers such as tulips and daffodils, pastel colors, spring blossom (real or artificial).






Easter trees: These are simple trees made from branches or blossom tranches that are then decorated with Easter decorations or foods.






Flowers: Use of flowers that are typical in spring is an excellent way to decorate an Easter table. You can use fresh or artificial flowers, whichever you have and like most; you can even mix and match. Foliage is also a useful addition, to add the sense of green that comes with spring.
 With a tablecloth, you can select a color that matches the Easter theme colors you're working with. With the table left bare, you will focus more on creating the color theme through the items added to the table.
 Add the colors of Easter to the table through the addition of the items in the colors of choice. Typical colors for Easter are pastel pink, pastel green, pastel purple, pastel yellow, pastel green and whites. Brighter colors, such as those representing tulips (pinks, reds and oranges), daffodils (yellows and golds) and other flowers are also acceptable.

 Brush them slightly in the direction they grow. You'll immediately see some long, unruly hairs that need to be plucked.
 Carefully pluck a hair at a time, shaping your brows according to the plan you made.









Pluck the hairs that are closer to your nose than the dots you drew over your inner brows.
Shape the arch areas by plucking a few hairs around the peaks to give them a more defined shape.
Pluck the hairs that fall closer to your temples than the dots you drew on the outside of your brows.
Pluck more hairs from the bottom of your brows to make them as thin or thick as you'd like.
 When you're shaping your brows, take it slow. Step back and look in the mirror every few minutes to check your progress. Make sure you don't pluck too much; eyebrow hairs can take 6 weeks to grow back, and sometimes they don't grow back at all.
 Comb your brows in the direction of their growth and apply a bit of brow gel (or hair gel) to hold them in place.

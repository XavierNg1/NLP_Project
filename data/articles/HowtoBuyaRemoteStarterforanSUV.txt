 These starters are less expensive and inexpensive to have installed.
Multiple-button car starters start your SUV and can lock and unlock doors. Some multiple-button starters are equipped to turn on window defrosters and seat warmers. These are more expensive than single-button starters and are more prone to technical problems, but provide a higher level of convenience.;

Mechanics recommend getting a remote automobile starter with a warranty that will last as long as you expect to own your SUV. Buy a car starter with a warranty package that protects against faulty installation or electrical malfunctions.



The specialists that sell you your starter are well-trained in the installation process. There will be an additional fee for installation, but you can be assured that the starter will be installed properly.



Remote starters vary in transmission range. Inexpensive single-button starters typically have a range of 100 (30 m), while more intricate starters can have a range of up to 1,000 feet (300 m). Consider where you typically park your SUV at home, work and when shopping to determine what range will work best for you.



A hood safety switch is an optional safety feature that can be installed with most remote car starters. It prevents the starter from starting your SUV when the vehicle's hood is up.
Many car specialists opt not to install the hood safety switch unless specifically requested. Be sure to ask about this feature when you're having your starter installed.



Starters with engine speed detection can read a car's engine RPMs, or revolutions per minute. This will allow your starter to detect if the SUV fails to start when prompted due to cold weather or engine malfunction. Starters with this feature can also turn your SUV off if it is detected that the engine is running too fast, preventing engine damage.

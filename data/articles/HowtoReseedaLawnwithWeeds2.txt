 Be sure to select a grass species that will naturally thrive in the environment present in your yard. Select a shade-tolerant species for a shady yard or a sun-loving species for a sunny yard.


If the lawn will be subjected a lot of traffic, select a species that can handle being tread on.
 Spread the grass seed using a drop or broadcast spreader, setting the seeding rate according to the grass species being planted. Spread the seed in even swaths in one direction, and then again in the other direction to insure even seeding.
 You should try to rake the soil so that the seeds are covered with roughly1/8-inches of soil. If you do not have a rake, you can also spread mulch over the soil.


If you choose to lay mulch down, you can use a peat spreader. Try to cover the seeds in roughly Â¼-inch of mulch or less.
 Go over the newly planted lawn with a lightweight lawn roller to insure good soil to seed contact. A lawn roller presses the seeds down into the ground so that they take root more easily.


If you do not have a lawn roller, you can rent from your local garden supply store.

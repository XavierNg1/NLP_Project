 Facebook users often add friends without much thought, meaning it's not unlikely that you share a mutual friend with this blocked user. If possible, explain your reason for needing to view the blocked profile and ask them to show it to you.;
, Keep in mind that you'll need to make the account substantially different than your own account if they've blocked your account.


If you're the one who blocked them, you have a bit more leniency in terms of creating the profile, but your new profile should still be different than your main one.
 If you're the one who blocked the person, you can temporarily unblock them to check on their profile.


You'll need to wait twenty-four hours before you can block them again.

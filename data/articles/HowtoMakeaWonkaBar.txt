 You could also melt the chocolate by other methods, but if microwaving just make sure that every 30 seconds you take it out and stir well, you don't want any lumps in the chocolate.
 You could add caramel or nuts for flavoring, just spread them out so they aren't too close, the last thing that you want is a lot of caramel on one side and hardly any on the other., You can test it by taking the bar out and dipping something GENTLY against it, if the chocolate is still liquid, let it solidify for longer., Again, the key word is to remove the bar from the mold GENTLY., "Text wrap" the wrapper (pun not intended) so that it fits your bar, you may need to try different sizes., You could also print it on normal A4 Paper if you're testing the wrapper size., Line up everything so that it looks authentic, look up photos of the wrapper you're using and try to match them., Well done. You now have a homemade Wonka bar!

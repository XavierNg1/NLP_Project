 Your Facebook profile will open to the News Feed page.


If you aren't already logged into Facebook, enter your email address (or phone number) and password and click Log In in the top right corner of the page.
 It's in the bottom right corner of the Facebook page.
 It's an option in the pop-up menu from the Settings gear.
 This option prevents any contacts from seeing your name in the "Active" category.


You can also click Turn off chat for all contacts except... to select a few contacts for whom you'll stay online, or you can click Turn off chat for only some contacts... to select specific contacts for whom you'll appear offline.
 Your chat bar will turn grey, and you will appear offline to anyone looking up your name in their chat bar. Your “Last Active” time will display as the time that you went offline. It will not change, even if you continue to use Messenger.

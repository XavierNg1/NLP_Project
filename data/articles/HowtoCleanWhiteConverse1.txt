You can clean shoelaces separately by letting them soak in a bucket or basin of warm, soapy water, but know that they may never be as bright as they once were. An alternative is to replace your old shoelaces with new ones.;
, Drench your Converse shoes in cold water. You can either rinse them under a running faucet or dunk them into a large bucket or basin of water.

Use cold water instead of warm water to prevent any stains from setting in or any colors from running and ruining more of the white canvas.
You can work over the sink for the entire process, or you could spread out a sheet of wax paper or plastic over your counter or floor and work on that. The process can get messy and the cleaning solution can affect your counter or floor, so you want to avoid letting any excess drip off and onto something it could damage.
 Combine enough baking soda and white vinegar in a glass or plastic bowl to form a foamy, thin paste.

Do not use a metal bowl or spoon. Metal can react negatively to the vinegar.
You could also use washing powder instead of baking soda or liquid laundry detergent instead of vinegar, depending on which you have on hand. The mixture may not fizz as much when made, but it will still be effective.The paste should be about two parts baking soda and three parts vinegar. Do not use red wine vinegar, however, as it stains. As a general rule, though, only use enough of each to form a paste-like consistency.
 Dip a clean toothbrush or nail brush into the homemade cleanser. Scrub the surface of the shoes all over with the same brush, cleaning all sides and focusing on any especially dirty areas.

Rinse again under cool water when done. This is not strictly necessary, but you can check on your progress and avoid getting baking soda or vinegar all into your washing machine.
 Place your white Converse shoes in the washing machine along with a little standard detergent. Run the machine on a full cycle using cold water.


Do not use a chlorinated bleach or detergent.
To help prevent your shoes from banging around too violently inside the washing machine, wrap them in a mesh or fabric laundry bag before throwing them in.
 Converse shoes must be allowed to air dry. To speed the process up and help further the whitening effect, place your shoes in a warm, sunny, and dry location to dry.


The dry warmth of the sun can help dry the shoes faster, and the light of the sun actually has a mild bleaching effect.
Do not use a dryer. Machine drying white Converse will result in the shoes losing their shape.

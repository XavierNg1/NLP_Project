 You can make a fun, colorful, and casual bracelet by lacing together buttons with fishing line. Buy regular, two-hole buttons in slightly varying sizes and colors, depending on your own personal style. You will also need a length of fishing line or elastic thread, doubled up to add strength.
 Thread the buttons together by going up through the right hole and then down through the left. Take the next button and thread the string down through the right hole and up through the left. The next button should be laced as the first. Continue in this way until the bracelet is long enough.


You can gauge the length either by measuring your wrist beforehand or by simply trying the bracelet on occasionally through the process.
 Add the clasp of your choice and youâ€™re done! This is a great bracelet to wear with your everyday clothing. It can add color to an outfit, as well as adding a little quirky, feminine charm.

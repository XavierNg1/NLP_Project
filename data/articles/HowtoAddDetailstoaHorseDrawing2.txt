 If the background makes it look windy draw the mane flowing sort of backwards in places. If the horse is rearing draw the mane flying back away from the neck(the mane shouldn't touch the neck only at the roots.) If the horse is bucking draw the mane what-ever way you like, just make sure its in the air.
  A standing horses' tail is your choice. A rearing horse will have the tail flowing on an angle like this-->      \          A bucking  horse will have the tail high in the air by the back legs, it will also have a curve in it.
 But some drafts such as the Gypsy Vanner have extremely long manes with thick layers.Normal riding horses manes can vary, chose the length/look you think fits.
 Feel free to add braids or other hair styles that look good, experiment with what braid look seems the best. (By braid look I mean that there are many braid styles for horses, like the jumpers and the special draft braids). Add in ribbons in the mane or tail if you think it goes with the scene. If the horse is at a fair in the drawing, add a bow on the tail.(Different coloured bows on tails can mean lots of things like: I kick, I bite, I'm for sale, I'm a stallion, mare, or a yearling, Etc.

 You'll receive a notice calling you to go to an Application Support Center for an appointment during which you'll be fingerprinted, have your picture taken, and have your signature taken. The center will use this information to do a background check. Eventually your biometrics will be used to process your green card.
 In some cases you might be called in for an interview with the USCIS office to answer questions about your application. If you receive a notice, make sure you attend the appointment. The notice should include the date, time and location of the interview.


In some cases your family member who filed your green card petition might be asked to come to the interview as well.
Bring your travel documents, passports, and all other relevant documents to the interview.
 The USCIS will review all of your paperwork, assess your interview if applicable, and make sure you meet all of the requirements to become a permanent resident. Once they make a decision, you'll receive a notice in the mail.


If your application was denied, you may be able to file an appeal.If your application is accepted, you'll receive further instructions about getting your green card, including information on when it needs to be renewed.

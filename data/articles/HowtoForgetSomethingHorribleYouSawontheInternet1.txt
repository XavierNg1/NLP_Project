 The idea behind thought substitution (sometimes called thought displacement) is that you have the ability to control what you think and how you react. You can intentionally forget bad memories by filling your mind with more positive things.Your brain has a limited focus, and you can only keep so many thoughts in your immediate sphere of awareness. Try to replace the negative memory by exposing your brain to something brighter. Watch a happy or inspirational video, lose yourself in a story, or just look at pictures of cute animals.;
, Thought substitution works best when there is some relation between the replaced thought and the "overwriting" thought. Thus: if you watched a horrifying video, find an inspirational video that grips your emotions just as powerfully. If you saw a nasty picture, look at images that make you smile. If you read something that triggered you, try reading a story that calms your mind., Browse lists of memes or photos of cute animals. Scroll through photos of something dear to you: good memories with friends and family, pictures of pets, pictures of places. Run a web image search for, say, "cute baby pandas" or "lazy sloths" to find the photos you need.
 Browse comedy videos on YouTube, or watch an episode of your favorite show. Look for videos of simple things: a baby laughing, an ecstatic puppy, or someone smiling. Find videos of peaceful things: the lull of the waves, the hum of a summer forest, or a panoramic mountaintop view.


Run a web search for the sort of videos that you want to find. Search for "happy videos" or "puppy playing" to find content to soothe your mind.
Check out YouTube Haiku or Vine for short but absorptive videos.

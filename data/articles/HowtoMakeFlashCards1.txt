 Have a well lit working area where you are away from distractions and have all equipment ready. You want to devote your entire attention to your flash cards. Some people enjoy having a television on in the background or have music playing. If this is you, feel free to enjoy your preferred auditory stimuli, just make sure that they don’t distract you from your task., This means that you should have your flash cards and textbook ready. Have a good pen, markers, highlighters, and whatever other writing implements you’d like to use.


At this stage, you’ll also need to decide what medium you want to use to make your flash cards. Will you choose paper and pen or will you create digital flash cards? Ultimately, it is a matter of preference. Studies have shown that most students retain information better if they have to write out the materials.Yet, the convenience of having your flash cards on your phone may outweigh other concerns.
 Identify salient information in your notes and text book. Distill them down into their key parts so that you can transfer them to your notecards — in a physical or a digital form. You can do this by highlighting your notes or the textbook. If you cannot write in your textbook, write on a separate sheet of paper or create a separate file in a word processor on your computer.


Eventually, you will develop a system of note-taking that will make flash cards easier to make. Some of the easiest ways of doing this are to highlight or underline key sections your teacher stresses. Some people use asterisks, dashes, or other symbols to set off important text from the rest of their notes.

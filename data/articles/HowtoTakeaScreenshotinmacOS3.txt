 The cross-hair will turn into a small camera. You can press Spacebar again to switch back to the reticle.
 The camera will highlight different windows blue as it moves over them. You can use keyboard commands such as Command+Tab to shift through your windows while still in this mode.
 The picture of the window you selected will be saved to the desktop by default just like the other screenshot methods.

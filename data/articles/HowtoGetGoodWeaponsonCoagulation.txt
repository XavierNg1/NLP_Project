 No matter where you spawn on the map, there will be excellent benefits.


If you spawn near the caves, run and grab a vehicle. If there are no vehicles, then run on top of the base and grab the sniper rifle.
If you spawn next the rocks, run and grab the rocket launcher in the middle of the map.
If you spawn in one of the bases, drop down and grab the banshee. If there are no banshees, grab the sniper rifle on top of the base.;
, Chances are you will get killed by more experienced players. Simply hang back and grab a simpler weapon, such as a shotgun or a plasma rifle. Add a couple of grenades to your inventory before going to hunt.
 They will respawn, and you can grab them.

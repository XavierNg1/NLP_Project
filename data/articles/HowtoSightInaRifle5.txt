 You will need to make sure that your rifle is completely immobile during the sighting process. You will need to be able to make adjustments to the sight without moving the rifle. This method will sight your rifle about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above the target at 100 yards (91.4 m).


This is a standard height for longer-distance shooting. At 200 and 300 yards, the bullet will drop towards the center of the target.
This method will not result in pin-point accuracy, but will be sufficient for deer-sized targets.
You can bore-sight before performing this method for increased accuracy and ease of sighting.
 Load a round into the rifle and place the center of the target in the center of the crosshairs. Fire a single shot without moving the rifle.


Squeeze with even pressure and continue squeezing after the shot is fired to prevent the gun from jumping.
Always follow strict safety guidelines when handling a live firearm. Never shoot when someone is downrange, and never point a loaded gun at another person.
 It is essential that the gun does not move during this process or the adjustments will be incorrect. Using the knobs on the scope, adjust it so that the crosshairs are directly over the bullet hole created by your first shot.


Most scopes move the crosshair in the opposite direction of the knob. For example, to move the crosshair down, you would twist the knob up.
You can make the bullet hole easier to see by placing a brightly-colored sticker over the hole on the target.
 Once the crosshair is lined up directly on the bullet hole, lower the crosshair so that it is pointing at a spot about half an inch below the bullet hole. This will make your gun shoot about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) above the target at 25 yards (22.9 m).


Being 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) above the target at 25 yards (22.9 m) generally translates to 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above at 100 yards (91.4 m), dead-on at 200 yards (182.9 m), and 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) below the target at 300 yards (274.3 m). This will vary based on the caliber, but is generally similar., Sight the rifle in the dead center of the bull’s-eye and carefully take the shot. Your bullet hole should be between 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above the bull’s-eye. At this point, the rifle is sighted


Avoid shooting during winds to keep your bullet from drifting left or right.

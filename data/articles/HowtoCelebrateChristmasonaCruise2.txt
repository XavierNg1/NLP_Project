 Many cruise lines put together a special and more formal Christmas dining event.
 Have some fun with Santa hats, jingle bell socks and perhaps a stocking for the door of your cabin.


Leave the decorating to the cruise ship. Most cruises will have artificial Christmas trees on board, as well as wreaths and other festive d√©cor. Packing your own tree and other items will take up space in both your luggage and your cabin.
 You might want to exchange gifts before you leave for your cruise.


Pack small items if you want to have something to open on Christmas. Gift cards, candy, jewelry, clothing and other small items are good things to exchange and will not take up a lot of room for you or the recipient.
 You might want to bring your own bottle of champagne or wine to celebrate the holiday. Some cruise lines will allow this and others will not.

 If you have an mp3 player capable of running apps, like an iPod Touch or a smartphone, then search the App Store or Play Store for the name of a music streaming app (some well-known examples include "Spotify", "Pandora", "iHeartRadio"). Press “Install” on the store page and press “Open” when the download is complete.


The apps listed above are free of charge with a large library of licensed popular music with possible paid upgrades if you want an ad-free experience.;
, Tap the button to “Sign Up” or “Create an Account” on the landing page.


Most require just an email address to register, and some allow you to connect a social media account (like Facebook) for even quicker registration.
 Searching for a specific song, artist or genre on Pandora or iHeartRadio will create a 'radio station' of similar music based on your search instead of taking you to directly to your search target. You can rate the music you hear to help tailor the station to your tastes.


Spotify allows you to search for specific songs to play but plays advertisements in between songs on free accounts.
A free account means you will not be able to download music, only stream it over the internet. However, a paid (premium) Spotify account will allow you to store songs to listen to "offline".Free users will occasionally hear ads in their music stream.

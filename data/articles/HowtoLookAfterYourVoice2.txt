 Quitting smoking is one of the most important factors in looking after your voice. The tar and heat inhaled while smoking cause your vocal cords to become inflamed, dry, and swollen. Smoking causes hoarseness and a deeper vocal pitch.Smoking cigarettes is the primary cause of throat cancer. If you are a smoker and your voice is becoming hoarse, you should make an appointment with an otolaryngologist to be sure you do not have throat cancer., To prevent your vocal cords and larynx from becoming dry, you will want to limit how much caffeine you consume. Caffeine dehydrates your body, including your vocal cords.Try substituting a caffeine-free tea or warm water with lemon and honey for coffee. This will give you the pleasantness of a warm drink without the caffeine.
 While alcohol in moderation isnâ€™t problematic for your vocal cords, excessive drinking can dry them out and cause voice changes over time. If you drink, try to limit your alcohol intake and avoid binge drinking. At least one day every week should be entirely free from alcohol.A moderate consumption of alcohol means up to one drink per day for women of all ages, and up to two drinks per day for men up to age 65. Men over age 65 should also limit their consumption to one drink per day., Eating spicy foods may cause stomach acid to move into the throat, which can cause heartburn or GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Spicy foods affect each person differently, so you can experiment to see which foods cause you to have heartburn and which ones have no effect. Those that cause heartburn are likely causing acid to move into the throat and esophagus and therefore should be avoided., Keeping your vocal cords hydrated is very important. Be sure to always drink when you are thirsty. Try carrying a water bottle around with you wherever you go to remind you to take sips throughout the day.,

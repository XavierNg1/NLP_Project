 If you've got a half empty magazine you might not be able to kill the enemy, only hurt them.;
, If you fire first you're more likely to get the kill before your teammate.
 Make sure you're in a position where you can get a good shot. Missing/spraying will only leave you with less ammo to kill, and that usually means your teammate will finish them off. Aiming for the head will get you a quicker kill which will also help.
 Sticking too close to your teammates by following them or keeping them in reaching distance means what they see, you'll see. Not only does this risk them stealing your kills you risk missing enemies that are in different areas.

 Crocheting a flat wide edge requires the same materials as normal crocheting. You will need:


Yarn in the color of your choice
Crochet hook. Make sure that the crochet hook is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. Check the yarn label to find the recommended hook size.
Scissors;
, Unless, your yarn is already connected to the project, you will need to tie the yarn to the edge of your project to hold it in place. Insert the free end of the yarn through one of the edge stitches and then tie a knot. You may even want to make a double knot to ensure that the yarn holds.


Another option is to make a slipknot and then slipstitch around one of the stitches to connect it.Loop the yarn around your index and ring finger twice and then pull the first loop through the second loop to make a slipknot. Slide this onto your hook and tighten it. Then, insert the hook into the stitch, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull it through the stitch and the slipknot.
 To make a simple flat edge around your project, you can single crochet all stitches. This will ensure that the edges will be flat and you can make the edge as wide as you like.


To single crochet, insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook to create a new loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops to complete a single crochet stitch., You can keep your edging simple with a single or double crochet stitch, or you can use a special stitch to add interest to your project. Some stitches you might consider for your edging include:


Popcorn stitch
Textured shell stitch
Box stitch
Cluster stitch

, The more rounds you do, the wider the edge will be. Keep crocheting until the border of your project has reached the desired width.


When you are finished, cut the end of your working yarn a few inches from the hook and tie off your last stitch to secure your work. Hide the tail by weaving it into the edge or by trimming it down.

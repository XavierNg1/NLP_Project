 There are many different options; all grains and legumes work well as sprouts. Alfalfa and clover are 2 of the most popular seeds for sprouting. Also popular are pumpkin, sunflower, almond and cabbage seeds. Taste and nutritional value are 2 things to consider when choosing a seed variety.;
, The best thing to use is a glass canning jar; pint or quart (half-liter or liter) jars work best. Any glass jar will do in a pinch, though, including empty pickle or jelly jars.
 Rinse the jar and then wipe it dry with a clean cloth.
 This will be used to drain water from the jar. In place of cheesecloth, you could substitute nylon stockings or fine wire mesh. Anything that will let water pass through but won't allow the seeds to pass through is sufficient.
 A few tablespoons (30 ml) or so worth of seeds is appropriate, although there is a wide margin for error. Adding too many seeds will generally result in some of them not receiving enough light to germinate.
 Place the cheesecloth square over the top of the jar, and then use the canning lid ring to secure it. If you are using a jelly or pickle jar, you can secure the cheesecloth tightly with a few rubber bands.
 The next morning, drain all the water from the jar by turning it upside-down over the sink and letting the water run through the cheesecloth.
 Immediately drain the water off (the seeds should be wet, not fully submerged). Shake the jar so that some of the seeds stick to the sides of the jar; this allows them to reap the maximum amount of sunlight. Place the jar in a sunny location, and continue this rinsing routine once or twice a day until the sprouts appear.
 Once the sprouts are 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, they are ready to be eaten. They can be enjoyed fresh in a salad or cooked in a stir-fry. Be sure to wash, rinse and dry your sprouting jars before using them again for sprouting. It is best to replace the cheesecloth every once in a while as you continue growing sprouts.

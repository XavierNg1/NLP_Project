 Stop by Starbucks and pick up one of the small, round-cornered cards set out on the counter. Sometimes they're located near the cash register, other times you'll find them on the cream-and-sugar station.


New cards are put out on Tuesdays. If you time it right, you might find this week's and last week's picks on display.
 The front of each card has the name of the song and the name and photo of the artist. On the back is a download code. To download your song, open iTunes, go to the iTunes Store, click on "Quick Links" and then choose "Redeem" and enter the code.
 If you're at Starbucks with you computer, connect to the shop's WiFi. Once you're connected, go to the Entertainment section of the page and download the "Pick of the Week" from the Starbucks site.

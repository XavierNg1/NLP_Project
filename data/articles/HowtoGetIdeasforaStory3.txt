 Many writers go for a theme of particularly gritty characters and situations.
 Think of characters for your story. Stories typically contain protagonists, antagonists. Some stories have a lot of perspectives, some only a few or one. Decide on what you want your characters to be. Don't cram too many personality traits into one person but don't invent a new character every couple of pages either. Remember to keep your characters "in-character". Would they really do that? Would anyone? What are the motivations behind what they say and their choices.
 When is the story set, where, why. How does it look, smell, feel. Does it feel different to different characters and why. Describe all the senses but be sparing. Too much detail can be more exhausting.
 See if you need to strengthen or eliminate the character or work them in somewhere else.
 Read back through your story and see what you still like, keep doing this. Don't be afraid to abandon an old concept which seemed good at the time but is weakening your story.

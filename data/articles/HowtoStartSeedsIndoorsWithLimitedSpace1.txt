 Put them in the refrigerator so that the seeds will be fooled into thinking that they went through a winter. Read the directions carefully as to what conditions will be best for the plants to get them started like moisture, temperature, quality of soil and depth to plant the seeds.


All seed packets have the year date on them, so don't buy last year's seeds because fewer will sprout. Fresh is best.
 If you don't have enough egg cartons, buy the compostable seed starter cups from your local garden supplier.

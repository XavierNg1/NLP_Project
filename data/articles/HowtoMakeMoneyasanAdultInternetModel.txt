 Depending on your personal style, your comments may be explicit or subtle. But never forget that this is a sex job and you're in the business of selling sexual fantasies. While it is ultimately up to you what you do during your paid performances, in order to get into a paid show you have to keep the chat room topic all about sex.;
, You want chatters to think that you aren’t there for the money but you’re just horny and you get off on being watched. You can put this in your bio or express this idea through comments you make to the group as a whole.
 Always be flirty and slightly evasive if someone is asking you directly if you’ll do something in a private show that you’re not comfortable doing rather than coming right out and saying no. “No” is a turn-off and will cause chatters to exit your room.
 Instead of badgering, pleading, or nagging chatters to take you into a private show, you should offer subtle or not-so-subtle incentives. For example, “I can’t wait to take my clothes off in private!” Or hold up toys that you want to use on yourself during a private show. And don’t forget to show off sexy outfits you’ll try on for your lucky private show customers, too.
 Frequently update your bio and pictures to keep yourself fresh and exciting to your regular customers in this safe sex work.
 Many internet model jobs allow you to write diary or blog entries. This is a good way to build up relationships with your regulars. You can put updates in there throughout the week about your real or virtual-persona life.
 As with many businesses, it’s all about creating personal relationships. If you quit this sex work prematurely, you won’t give yourself the time it takes to build a regular clientele which is the key to having the lifestyle you dream of.

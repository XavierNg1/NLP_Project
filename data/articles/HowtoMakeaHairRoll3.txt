 Use styling mouse, paying attention especially to the hair at the front of the head, framing the face. This is the hair you will be using to create the bangs roll, so you want it to receive a good portion of the mousse.
 Use a comb to make a part that from above looks like a U pointed towards your forehead, giving you a large section of hair right above the center of your forehead. Comb the hair forward so it is hanging in front of your face.
 Take the section of hair in front of your face and hold it straight up. Take a comb and backcomb the hair by combing softly from the ends down to the roots. This will give your hair more form and support, so that the hair roll will be easier to make.
 Take the section of hair in front of your face and roll it starting from the tips. Make sure to roll it down, not up. This will create the roll lower down so it will look like bangs.








Consider using a hair donut or a small amount of padding to give the roll extra support and more volume.
 Take several bobby pins and pin the hair roll in place. If you are using a hair donut or additional support for the style, pin these in place too, making sure that they are completely covered by the hair roll.
 You have unlimited options for how to style the rest of your hair. One classic way to style with rolled bangs is to make rolls on either side of the head using the front hair, and then letting down the hair in the back. However, you can also just do the bangs roll and leave your hair down for a 50â€™s Rockabilly vibe.
 After you have styled the rest of the hair, go over the roll softly with a brush to smooth down flyaways. Use a hard-hold hairspray and focus on the bangs roll, and any other rolls you may have put in your hair.

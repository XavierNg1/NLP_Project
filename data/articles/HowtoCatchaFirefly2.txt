 As long as you approach fireflies slowly, they should maintain a calm and graceful flying path â€“ this will make them fairly easy to catch. Once you are close enough to a firefly, calmly reach out with both hands, and try to cup the firefly between your hands. The outsides of your hands should be tightly cupped together when you catch the firefly, but leave enough space between your palms so that you do not crush it.This may take a few tries. Don't get annoyed or overwhelmed, just keep trying. Stay calm and relaxed.
 You can purchase nets at most home supply stores, or make your own out of a small netting. To catch fireflies with a net, simply flow the net around a firefly inhabited area until you catch one. Keep your movements slow and gentle so that you do not scare or harm the fireflies., Most people end up putting their caught fireflies into mason jars, so skip a step by catching your fireflies in a mason jar. Move slowly and calmly as you move your mason jar through the air to catch fireflies. Once a firefly has flown into the opening of your jar, place the lid on top to keep the firefly inside.

 Use #0000 steel wool or fine sandpaper (150-180 grit). If there’s a lot of paint to remove, start with a coarser sandpaper, like 80-120 grit or, in extreme cases, 40-60 grit.Do this very gently to remove only the paint.


Large areas can be sanded with power sanders, but be sure to wear a protective mask and safety glasses and read all product instructions carefully.
 Run a wet rag over the wood to wipe away sawdust and debris. Swap the cloth out for a fresh one if it becomes too dirty while you’re cleaning.
 Once it’s dry again, touch up the wood using the same finish or stain that was used on it before. If you don’t have any extra or don’t know what was used on it, try to match it as closely as possible with samples from your local hardware store.

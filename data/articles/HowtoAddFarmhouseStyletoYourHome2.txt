 The American farmhouse style is relaxed and functional, such as large functional dining room tables. This style also includes rustic, weathered shelves and soft, upholstered living room furniture. The colors are muted, including soft off-white, earth tones and a few accents., You should shop around for some old furniture at garage sales, antique stores and online. Look for items that are less expensive and then finish them yourself. If you find something rustic and a little banged up, you can just sand it down and then paint it white or off white to create a piece of Farmhouse style furniture., Look for furniture that is painted white or off white, such as white chairs, tables and cabinets. Try to find wooden furniture, as opposed to metallic or plastic furniture that is painted white. You should look for items that are white and have a bit of a rustic look, as though they were painted quite a long time ago and the wind and dust wore down the paint., Consider whether you own any furniture that could be refurbished in the Farmhouse style. If you have any really nice items that are stained or otherwise donâ€™t fit the style, you should avoid ruining them just for the sake of consistency with your overall style. However, if you have a few pieces that are less expensive and might look good painted in soft, light tones, you may as well go for it. If you are not handy with paint, ask a local handyman or carpenter to refinish the pieces for you in Farmhouse style.

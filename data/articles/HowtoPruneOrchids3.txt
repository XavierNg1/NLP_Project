 Only prune your orchid once the flowers wither and die. The spike attached to the blooms should begin to yellow, as well.
 You should see the vertical spike emerging from a wide, green section of plant material, known as the bud sheath. When you shine a light at the back of this sheath, you should be able to see the lower part of the spike.


Note that a bud sheath will either be green or papery brown. Color is not necessarily an indication of sheath health, though.
The bud sheath protects immature buds as they bloom and will not die off even when the flowers and spike are dying.
Make sure that the sheath is an old one. Ideally, you should see flowers or spikes visible. If you cannot see any from the top of the sheath, squeeze the sheath gently to make sure that there are no fresh, healthy buds inside.
 Trace the sheath down the stem, toward the pseudobulb. The sheath and its spike originate at the top of this pseudobulb, usually protected by one or two leaves.


Note that the pseudobulb is a portion of the stem that emerges directly above the ground. It is wider than the rest of the stem and looks somewhat bulb-shaped.
 Hold the upper part of the sheath and spike steady with your non-dominant hand. Use a sharp cutting tool to cut through both the sheath and the spike, positioning the cut as close to the base of the protective leaves as possible.


Do not cut through the leaves or the pseudobulb.

 The virus that causes warts can be passed from person to person if the warts are touched or picked at. Leave the warts on your hands alone and avoid picking or scratching at the warts.You should also never share the emery board or pumice stone that you used to file down your warts with someone else. Only use the emery board or pumice stone on your warts and nowhere else on your body to avoid spreading the virus.
 If possible, avoid biting your fingernails. Broken skin, such as skin that has been bitten or chewed, is more susceptible to the development of warts.You should also avoid brushing, clipping or shaving any areas that have warts as this can irritate the warts and spread the virus.
Keep your nails and hands clean. Always wash your hands well after touching your warts or any shared surfaces, such as exercise equipment at the gym or the handle on a bus.
 Reduce your risk of developing warts or passing them on to others by always wearing plastic flip flops in the change rooms and the public areas of public pools or showers..If you have warts and are planning to go swimming in a public pool, put a waterproof plaster over the warts to prevent the spread of infection.

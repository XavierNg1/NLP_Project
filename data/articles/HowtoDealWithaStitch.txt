 Sit down and try to remain calm.;
, If you try to focus on controlling your breathing, it will help you to relax and possibly ease the muscle pain.
 Begin by breathing in and out slowly. One way of helping you do this is to breathe in and out on your count. Counting silently, breathe in for 2 and then out for 2, gradually increase the count to 4 and then 6 if possible until your breathing has slowed down and the pain has eased.
 If you do not want to sit down, you may bend over a little, then press relatively hard on the area of pain. Stand back up in a regular position, and repeat. It will hurt to push on the area of pain, but it eventually makes the pain go away.
 Breathing deeply while taking small sips of water will relieve the pain.

 Pull each claw down and away from the body to remove it. Twist at the base of each claw, so you're left with two lobster "arms" with claws attached.


Eat the arm meat. Use a lobster fork to dig out the meat from the arms. There's not much, but it's worth digging it out.
Remove the thumb off the claws, breaking the claws at the joint. You'll see meat inside the thumb section. Use your lobster fork or pick to take it out.
Use the lobster cracker to crack the larger part of the claws then use the lobster fork to remove it. The claw meat may be hefty enough to cut into smaller pieces using a knife.
Discard pieces of shell and cartilage in the dish provided.
 It is easy to simply suck the meat out of the legs. Some people don't bother as a lobster has skinnier legs than a size zero model and considerably more of them.
 Crack the tail open and using your fork or pick, remove the meat from the tail in one piece. Twist the "flippers" from the tail and pull out the small morsels of meat inside. Find and discard the large black vein in the tail meat as this is the bowel and not highly prized.
 Pull the shell of the main body open, and pick out any pieces of white meat that you can find.
 This is the lobster's liver, avoided by some but loved by diehard lobster fans. It's a gray substance found in the body of the lobster among the innards., If you have a female lobster, you may see red eggs, or roe, inside the body. These are edible, but not the most delicious part of the lobster.

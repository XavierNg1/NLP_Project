, Farkas will assign you a random location from a collection of dungeons located across Skyrim. You will be required to kill the leader at the location.

Possible types of locations include: Bandit camps, Draugr Crypt, Warlock Lair, Vampire Lair, Spriggan Grove, Hagraven Nest, Giant Camp, Forsworn Camp, or a Falmer Hive., The leader will be tougher compared to any of the other enemies. Expect a tough fight and make sure to bring health potions. The leader can be found within the assigned location.

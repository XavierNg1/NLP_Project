 Remove debris/crumbs from counters. Squeeze/pour juice directly on debris-free counter and rub. You can either use the half of the squeezed lemon as a scrubber or the microfiber cloth. For stains, leave the lemon juice on the counter--the citric acid will erode the stains. Wipe clean with warm water.
 Pour/squeeze lemon directly onto a cutting board and rub well. If the board is stained, leave the lemon juice on the stain and allow it to sit until the stain is gone.
 Pour/squeeze lemon juice into the stained Tupperware dish and then add baking soda. Use a small brush to work lemon and baking soda into the stain and allow the lemon to sit. If the stain is bad, allow it to sit overnight before rinsing with warm water.

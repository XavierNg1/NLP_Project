, A regular hand juicer should get you about 2 tablespoons of juice from one lemon. If you find you're not getting enough juice, try rolling the lemon firmly on a hard surface to break up the tissue and release more juice, or microwave it for 10 seconds to warm it up.
 In a small saucepan, combine the zest, juice, sugar, and butter, and bring up to barely simmering (small bubbles occasionally rising to the surface) over low heat.
 Cook until the sugar dissolves, and add the ginger.
 When combined, add them to the saucepan, making absolutely sure the heat is low and that your mixture isn't boiling, or your eggs will curdle.
 Continue stirring about 10 minutes, until the mixture thickens.
 Pour into small glass jars, custard cups, or small bowls, and store in the refrigerator.
 Spread your delicious, home made lemon curd on toast, waffles, or scones, add it to mini pie shells, or just eat it with a spoon.

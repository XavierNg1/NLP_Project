 If you are going to make one game or a bunch of games, this list will show you how to make all games listed in the introduction.
 Most carnivals have a giant wheel with numbers. People tend to place a quarter on a number and spin a wheel, if the wheel lands on their number, they get all the quarters placed on the numbers. To make money on this game, ask for people to pay $1 and give them a quarter to place on a number. Start by taking a piece of paper and divide it up with the amount of numbers on the wheel, Keep it simple! Just use the wheel from the game of life or make a flat wheel and spin a pencil in the middle., Take a bulletin board and tack balloons onto it. Use darts or sharp pencils to throw at the balloons. Make a line on the ground of where people have to stand to throw the darts., Simply buy rubber ducks from the dollar store and, with a Sharpie, mark numbers on the bottom, 1 for a small prize, 2 for a medium and 3 for a large. Only make a couple medium and one large. Grab a large bowl or container and fill it with one inch of water. Too much water will allow the ducks sink!, Place three paper cups on top of each other like a pyramid. Use a water gun or a Nerf gun to shoot the cups down in one shot.
 At most carnivals, promoters use oval hoops to make it more difficult to get the ball through the hoop. You don't need to do this. Just use a regular net and make the rule, the shot has to go in and be shot underhand!

, You can spend $800 on a real one or be "creative." Use a target and a chair, have a person hit the target and their reward is to pour a bucket of water on the person in the chair!,,

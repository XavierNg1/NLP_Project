 Your crush may make a point of touching your shoulder a lot, or of giving you big hugs. He/she may also touch a lot of other people in this way. Some people are simply more outwardly affectionate than others, and it can be hard to tell when these people are genuinely attracted to someone. Be careful how much you read into the actions of a very flirtatious person.


Be aware that he/she is not only attracted to you. Even if this person has a crush on you, there's a good chance that he/she encounters other attractive people. Don't be discouraged just because there's a bit of competition!
Eventually, you might be able to distinguish this person's "attraction" behavior from the way that he/she acts around platonic friends. It may not be what you expect. Some people even clam up and get uncharacteristically shy around those whom they like!

, If someone is attracted to you, you should feel the general warmth of this person's attention on you. Perhaps he/she talks about sensual things or sensitive things; perhaps he/she is always asking you how you're doing. It can be a hard thing to intellectualize – sometimes, you may find that you can feel a palpable energy between yourself and another person.
 This is no exact science, and attraction usually won't be clear from just one behavior. Use your best judgment. If you caught someone staring at you from across the room, once, then that could mean almost anything. However, if you interact with this person often, and he/she laughs at your jokes, mirrors your gestures, makes a point to touch you and be near you – you might begin to reasonably assume that he/she is attracted to you.


Ask a friend, if you aren't sure. If a friend of yours has seen the two of you together, he/she might be able to give an outsider's perspective on whether the person is attracted to you. Make sure not to ask a mutual friend that might spill the beans!

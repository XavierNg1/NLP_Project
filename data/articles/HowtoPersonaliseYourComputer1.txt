 Themes are packages of icons, wallpapers, fonts, screensavers, and sounds that make up the Windows user interface. You can change the entire theme at once to dramatically change the way your computer looks and feels.


Most installations of Windows only come with one or two themes installed, but many more can be downloaded from the internet.;
, Open your Personalization tool in the Control Panel. For Windows 7 and 8, the theme selection window takes up the majority of the Personalization tool. You can browse through the installed themes and pick one that you’d like. If you want to search online for more, click the “Get more themes online…” link.


For Windows Vista, theme selection is a bit less user-friendly. In the Personalization menu, click the Theme link. This will open the Theme menu, where you can select installed themes from a drop-down box. In order to add more themes, you will need to manually search for them and download them to your computer. They use the file extension “.theme”.

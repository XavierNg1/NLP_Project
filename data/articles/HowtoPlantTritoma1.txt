 Whether you plant in a container or a garden, make sure that your tritoma have access to full sunlight for at least eight hours every day once they’ve sprouted. Before that period it is best if you give the early seedlings a bit of shade, so that they don’t burn off., Tritoma is native to an area with rocky and rough soil and it still retains some of those characteristics. Water your plants regularly, but make sure that the extra moisture drains away and doesn’t just sit on the surface. If the roots are continually saturated then they may rot off at the base., Purchase a simple dip test at your local gardening center. After you see the results you will know if you need to make any modifications to the quality of the soil. Tritoma does best in a soil pH that falls between 6.0-7.0., If you’ve purchased seeds from a local garden store or online dealer, then they will likely require a bit of extra care before planting. Place the seeds in an airtight container within the refrigerator for six weeks before planting.When you are ready to plant, take the seeds out of the refrigerator and place them directly in the ground.

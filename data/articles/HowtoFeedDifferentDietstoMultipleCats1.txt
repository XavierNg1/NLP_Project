 If you’re used to free-feeding your cats out of one large bowl, you’ll need to transition to scheduled feedings and use individual bowls. Your cats won’t care about the color coded bowls, but they’ll help you keep track of which kind of food to feed each cat.Make sure each cat also has its own water bowl, especially if you’re feeding them in separate rooms.
You can also write a cat’s name on each bowl in permanent marker.;
, If you feed your cats in the kitchen, keep a list with feeding information on the refrigerator. Write each cat’s name, its food variety, and its bowl’s color if you’re using a color coded system.Matching the right food with each cat will probably become second nature, but you should take your time and develop a system to avoid confusion. Mix-ups can be dangerous, especially if one cat has a prescription or therapeutic diet.
 It’s best to feed your cats in shifts when you start getting them used to individualized diets. Keep all but one of your cats out of the feeding room, then set out the appropriate food for one cat. Give it 20 minutes to eat, then when it’s done, move on to the next cats one at a time.You can also keep your cats in separate rooms with closed doors and feed them at the same time.
 As your cats get used to their individual diets, you can try feeding them in the same room at the same time. Fill each bowl with the appropriate food and set them in opposite sides of the room.The farther apart you set the bowls, the more comfortable your cats will be, since cats like some privacy during mealtime. You’ll also have an easier time keeping one cat from getting into another’s food.
 Keep an eye on your cats while they eat, especially if you feed them in the same room at the same time. You’ll need to make sure none of them try to get into another’s food. It’s also important to make sure they’re not refusing to eat.Contact the vet if any of your cats refuses to eat or experiences vomiting or diarrhea in reaction to its new diet.

 Measure your appliances, along with clearances for doors, electrical outlets, plumbing and ventilation hookups and any other connections before shopping for a new appliance.;
, Expensive models have more deluxe features. For example, when purchasing appliances on a budget, you may be able to afford an ice-maker and water dispenser or you may choose the self-cleaning feature on an oven.
 Read brochures and operating manuals of appliance models you identified online or in consumer magazines. Operating manuals give instructions on appliance use, care and maintenance.
, Consider buying appliances that have earned the ENERGY STAR designation by the U.S. government, or other energy-efficiency labels granted by other governments, as these appliances are the most energy efficient. If an appliance uses more energy, it will cost you more in utility bills.


Consider the two price stickers on an appliance: the purchase price sticker and the operating costs sticker. Use these stickers to compare appliances and calculate which appliance will cost more in the long term.
 Consider how long a warranty lasts when making a final decision to buy.
 Inquire whether there is a cost to remove the old appliance. Calculate these costs when making your final decision.
 See if there are scratches, dents or missing parts, such as refrigerator drawers or oven racks. If you opt to install the appliance yourself, set it up right away and turn the appliance on. Notify the salesperson of any malfunctions.

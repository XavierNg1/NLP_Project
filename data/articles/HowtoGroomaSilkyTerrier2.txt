 Some dogs are terrified of the bath. Fortunately, you can help create positive bath associations, by performing a few simply actions.Place your dog in the tub without water. You may want to do this several times in the days leading up to a bath.
Bathe your dog in minimal water. Avoid pouring water over their head until they are comfortable.
Give them a treat each time you bathe them!

, Dogs enjoy being bathed in nice warm water. Fill a tub with water (not too hot and not too cold). You will want to the water to come up no higher than your dog’s belly.
 Squeeze a quarter-sized dollop of dog shampoo into your hands, and work it into a lather. Apply the shampoo to your dog, beginning with the back of the neck, and working your way down the torso and legs. Wash your dog’s head last.Look for a shampoo formula specifically for silky terriers or longhaired dogs.
If your dog tends to move around in the bath, ask a friend to help you to keep them calm.
 Using either a detachable shower head, or cup, gently pour water over your dogs back. Use your hand to help move the soap down off your dog’s body as the water passes. Repeat this until the water runs clear, then move on to your dog’s head.Be extra careful not to get shampoo in your dog’s ears or eyes.
Try to tilt your dog’s head back.
 After the bath, dry your dog with a fluffy towel. If your silky terrier doesn’t mind the noise, you can speed up the drying process by using a hairdryer on the lowest setting.

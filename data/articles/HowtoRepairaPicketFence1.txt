Drill holes into two opposite corners of the gate’s frame, such as the bottom left corner and the top right corner. The space between the holes should match the openings at the end of the turnbuckle’s threaded rods.
Screw the threaded rods of the turnbuckle onto the frame using the pre-drilled holes.
Thread each rod into one end of the turnbuckle. Make sure that the slot for the screwdriver is facing you and not the gate.
Insert the screwdriver into the slot and turn it until the gate frame is square.;

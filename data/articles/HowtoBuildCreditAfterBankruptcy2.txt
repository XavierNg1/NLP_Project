 Create a budget that delineates all of your monthly expenses. Figure out how much money you have left over to put towards debt payments each month. Only charge what you can afford to pay each month.


For example, suppose after paying for your rent, utilities, transportation, food and other necessary expenses each month, you have $80 left over. Don’t charge more than $80 per month on your credit card so that you can afford to pay the credit card bill each month., This shows future lenders that they can depend on you to pay back what you borrow. As a rule of thumb, you should spend no more than one-third of your income on debt. This includes mortgages, credit cards, student loans and car loans. Monitor your spending each month to make sure you are no spending more than you can afford., Your credit score is based in large part on your ability to pay your bills on time. This shows lenders that you are responsible and dependable. Make a commitment to never miss a payment. Consider setting up automatic payments that can be deducted from your bank account every month on the due date. This way you will never make a late payment or miss a payment., If you have to carry a balance on your credit card, pay at least the minimum amount due each month. Make all of your payments on time. Keep your balance below 25 percent of your total credit limit. Part of your credit score is based on the percentage of available credit you are using. Make a plan to pay down your balance as quickly as possible., Check your credit report at least once per year. Look for accounts you don’t recognize, loans that have been paid off but are still reported as “open,” and mistakes in your personal information. Contact the credit reporting agencies to report any inaccurate information or suspicious activity.You are entitled to receive one free credit report per year from annualcreditreport.com.

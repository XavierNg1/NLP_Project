 Multiplayer games like Wind Rider and Fruit Slinger with one other person are fun, but the ones like Falling Phantoms and Best Dressed may be even more fun. So, go on. Play Best Dressed, Falling Phantoms, Splash n' Dash, Temple of trivia, and Jamma Derby.
 Go around Jamma, and look for games to play with your pet. Some of these games are really fun, like snake. So go have fun with your little pet friend!

, Adventures are really fun to begin with. If you have gone on every adventure, then do them again on hard mode. Return of the Phantoms on hard gets you rares, and there is an Arctic Wolves only gate. Search for Greely on hard, this gets you Phantom armor. The Forgotten dessert is fun, no matter how many times you play it, because you can get so many different prizes and you can keep trying to get all of the gems. Bubble trouble is fun because right now it's the only water adventure and you can keep on doing it to get more underwater treasure. All Adventures get you items, so try them all!

, Go to the Art Studio in Coral Cannons, and make some art. Submit it to AJ HQ and other jammers can see it.

The German Mark (banknotes and coins) is indefinitely exchangeable for the Euro at the fixed rate of 1.95 German Mark = 1 Euro, and thus coins of the German Mark are as good an investment as the Euro. Especially look for 5 Mark coins, as these represent 2.55 Euro, currently around $3.80 USD as of 2009.
 You'd be surprised how often they come up by mistake in such bins. Some coins, such as Canadian nickels before 1981, are made of 99% nickel. Depending on the size of these coins and the price of the coins in the bin, these may be a great deal on nickel bullion too.
 However, pre-1982 US Cents are the easiest way to hoard cheap copper bullion. In general, avoid buying copper bullion from these bins unless they have already been pre-sorted, as you can generally get a better deal with similar effort sorting US cents.
 As a first step you can separate magnetic from non-magnetic coins. Among the magnetic coins, you will want to look for pure nickel coins.
 If you are looking to travel soon, you may wish to buy any of the currency you can at below prevailing rates. If you are looking to invest in the currencies involved, try to only buy coins exchanging for at least $0.50 USD each, to avoid bulk and transporting costs.

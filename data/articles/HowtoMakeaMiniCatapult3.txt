 Gather the items you need before you try to construct your catapult.


A styrofoam or paper bowl.
Popsicle Sticks
Plastic Spoon
Marshmallows
Tape
Scissors

, Cut a small slit on opposite sides of the bowl. Slide a popsicle stick all the way through the bowl. The popsicle stick will help anchor the arm of your catapult and provide leverage.
 Turn the bowl upside down and cut a small slit in the bottom of the bowl. Cut the slit about one inch to the side of the popsicle stick that is running through the bowl.
 Angle the stick so that the end that is inside bowl goes under the stick that runs through the bowl.
 Reinforce the cuts you made in the bowl with tape. Secure the popsicle sticks to the bowl with the tape.
 Tape a plastic spoon to the end of the popsicle stick coming out of the bottom of the bowl.
 Place a marshmallow in the end of the spoon. Hold the bowl down on the table. Pull the popsicle stick back and let it snap forward. Watch your marshmallow fly!

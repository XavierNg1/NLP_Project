You should also use a mild cleanser like Jergens Mild or Purpose rather than laundry detergent, which has chemicals that could affect the dye in the Flyknit fabric., Using a sponge, microfiber cloth, or washcloth, gently scrub the dirty parts of your shoes. Don’t use too much liquid; you don’t want to get your shoes any wetter than you have to. Rinse the soap off the sponge, microfiber cloth, or washcloth with warm water, and use it to wipe the soap off your shoes.
 Leave your shoes out to air dry in a well-ventilated room. You can put them in a sunny spot to speed up the process a bit, or use a blow dryer on the cold setting, but never put them in a dryer.








You can stuff your shoes with paper towels to help them keep their shape, but bear in mind that they will take longer to dry without any airflow.
Putting a tumble dryer fabric sheet in each shoe can help them dry faster, and freshen them up a bit.

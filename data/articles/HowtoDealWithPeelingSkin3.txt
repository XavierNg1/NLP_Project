 Maybe your peeling skin is just the result of a bad sunburn. However, there are various disorders that can also cause peeling skin, so it’s a good idea to see a doctor if you’re not sure what’s causing it.Some conditions that can cause peeling skin are allergic reactions, staph and fungal infections, immune system disorders, genetic diseases, and cancer or cancer treatment. Sunburn also causes peeling skin, and if it’s mild, it will probably be treatable without calling the doctor. If it’s more severe or you have any doubt about what’s causing the peeling, it’s really a good idea to check with a doctor.
 If your skin is peeling, it can be tempting to scratch at it or peel pieces of it off. Don’t! It will make it worse.


You could cause an infection if you peel the skin away. It’s hard not to do, but remember it will make things worse.
You could carefully cut away the dead skin with a pair of small scissors, though, applying antibacterial ointment to it afterwards (like Neosporin).
 If your skin is peeling, it means that your skin has sustained damage. It’s a much better idea to protect your skin in the first place.


Wear sunscreen on a daily basis. Not only will this stop your skin from peeling and getting sunburned, but it will also lower the amount of wrinkles you get as you age.Put on more sunscreen every time you leave the water. A lot of people forget to do this, and it can result in sunburn that eventually will peel.
Don’t forget to apply sunburn all over your body, including to places on your body that some people forget, such as behind your ears.

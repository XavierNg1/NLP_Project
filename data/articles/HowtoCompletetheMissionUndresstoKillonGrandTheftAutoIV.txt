 He is the "D" on your minimap (if you don't know how to get to his house, set it as your waypoint and drive there).;
, You are going to want a pistol, shotgun (depending on your playing style), grenades, a SMG, and a sniper rifle. For the vehicle, any semi-heavy vehicle will work fine.
 Find the back door of the club, and park your car against it.
 Be sure to enter the club with your bare hands, as security will start to beat you if you have a weapon. You will have to find the locations of the managers before continuing on. The first position is given away by 2 guys talking by the entrance to the club.
 The last manger is in the private room in the back (by the back door which you should have parked your car by!)

, Very quickly, take out the pistol and shoot the manager in the office(guy closest to the door). Try to kill the security officer who immediately attacks you. Once he is dead, the whole club erupts into chaos.
 The manager getting a strip dance in the back now freaks out because of the gun shots, and will try to escape through the back door. If he is unable to open the back door, he will run towards the front door (where you should somewhat nearby) and you can shoot him with whatever you want (pistol to save ammo for more missions, shotgun for the easy kill, and SMG cause why not?).
 This is the only manager left, and he is the one by the stage. He will stay right in his spot the WHOLE time and will never move. Shoot him with the weapon of your choice.
 After you complete the mission, you will get 6250 dollars, and unlock the next mission.

 These are usually new quality stories selected by mods to get a little extra attention., If what the mods pick doesn't interest you, look through stories that have recently surged in views and likes., Groups tend to have specific types of stories contained in them.,, If nothing satisfying can be found there, go up to the search bar that says 'Tags' next to it.,, This is the character you're searching for a story about. All of the stories will be tagged with them. Or, you could select a category instead (such as 'Tragedy' or 'Comedy')., Then sit down and enjoy it!

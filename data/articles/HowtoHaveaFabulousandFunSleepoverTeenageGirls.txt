 You want to invite people who you know well and that you can relax with. Too many people make it crazy, but not enough make it boring! The ideal number would be between 3 and 7 (not including yourself).;
, Buy things like facials, nail polish, make-up, etc. You don't have to spend a lot of money, you could even go to the dollar store.
 Chips, cookies, brownies, ice cream, popcorn, pretzels, etc. are great party foods!

, Choose one large (or relatively large) room that you can all sleep in. You don't want to sleep somewhere with really hard floors (such as tile or concrete)! Push the furniture to the side of the room if you want more space in the room. You can put things up like banners or balloons to get the party feel. You can also have music playing on your stereo. You could even have disco lights just to make it fun!

, Pizza or Chinese food is good, or even Italian. It's totally up to you! You could also make food at home.
, You could sit around your table, or on the floor.
 You can have a spa and do facials, manicures, pedicures, make-up, etc. Girls love spas! You can also play games such as 'Truth or Dare'. You could even make up your own games! Video games such as 'Guitar Hero' and 'American Idol' are also a good idea.
 Chick flicks and romantic comedies are best for girls this age. But you can also throw in the odd comedy or action movie!

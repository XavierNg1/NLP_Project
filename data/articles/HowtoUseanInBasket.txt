 Think about your home d√©cor, the location of the in basket, and what you will use it for. An in basket can be used to collect small items and clutter as well as paper, so plan accordingly and choose a basket that is deep enough to hold everything. Baskets can be made of wicker or natural materials, fabric, leather or paper. Look around your home first to see if you have something you can use. A cheap, shallow in basket can be made from a box lid, covered with gift wrap or other decorative paper.;
, Put items into the basket. They don't need to be processed or worked on at this point, just throw them in the basket. However, if you know some items are trash they can be thrown away to save time later.
 Depending on how much stuff you have to process, this could be daily, weekly or biweekly. Be sure to allow enough time to process everything. The goal of the in basket is to move things out of it, not use it for permanent storage.
 Your goals are to not touch papers too often and not spend a lot of time going through the basket. If it can be processed quickly, do so. If items in the basket are part of a larger project or something that is going to take some time, schedule a time to work on them.
 You may need to create files or a household binder to hold papers that need to be kept permanently or will not be used in the short term.
 It should be near a recycling bin so that trash can quickly be moved out.
 Show children and other family members the basket and tell them what its purpose is. Show them how to put mail, school papers, and other clutter in the basket. Go through the steps until it becomes routine.
 If items in the in basket require work from others, make sure it gets done and doesn't just get lost in another pile of clutter.

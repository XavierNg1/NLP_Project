 You can cut the pineapple in any way you like, really. First, cut off the tops and bottoms with a sharp knife, and then shave off the skins and cut out the core. You can dice the pineapple, cut it into large circles, or cut it into smaller squares. You can even use a handy-dandy pineapple corer if you want to get fancy., Either one will do. Make sure the sheet is large enough to hold all of the pineapple chunks -- if not, then you may have to use two sheets., Make sure they don't touch or else they will freeze together.
 You can do this for less time if the pieces of pineapple become completely frozen earlier.
 You can use a zip-seal bag, Tupperware, or any other storage container that has a seal. Make sure you get all of the air out of the bag first so that the pineapple chunks don't suffer from freezer burn. You should label the bag with the date so you know when it is still safe to eat it -- frozen pineapple can last in your fridge for up to six months., Just place the frozen pineapple in the blender, follow the recipe for the drink or smoothie, and enjoy. Remember to use a bit less ice, since the frozen pineapple will add some extra icy flavor to the beverage., Just take it out of the freezer and take a bite into the tasty, frozen fruit. Frozen fruit is delicious, and you can try the same trick with blueberries, raspberries, or any other fruit. It'll have an extra icy flavor that will make it taste even more delicious -- a little bit like ice cream.
 If you want to eat the pineapple raw but don't want it to be frozen, just place it in the refrigerator and thaw it overnight. Then take it out of the refrigerator and enjoy it on its own or drizzle it with a bit of lemon juice first. You can also add it to any fruit salad of your choice.

 The angle should be slightly less than 90 degrees (70 is fine) to help you transition to sleeping fully upright. You can attain this angle by placing a board against the wall and stabilizing it or with a foam wedge (like those used in yoga or to raise the angle of your bed). The angle should be almost upright to get the closest to actually sleeping upright., When beginning to sleep upright, padding can ease the transition. This can be as simple as pillows and blankets. You can also use an extra-thick yoga mat and a pillow., You can use additional cushions or other back aids for this purpose. You need lower back support to sleep upright comfortably. It defeats the purpose of sleeping upright (to sleep with good posture) to avoid back support (until you can sleep upright without any support)., A J-pillow or a neck pillow will help your neck stay upright when you’re first learning to sleep upright. Without proper neck support you may find yourself dealing with severe neck pain when you wake up or a crick in your neck. Just make sure to keep your neck from slouching or leaning too much to one side., More important than trying out a new position is making sure you’re getting enough rest. There are severe long-term health risks associated with not getting enough quality sleep. If sleeping upright just doesn’t seem to work after a few days, go back to your previous method of sleeping., Although sleeping upright can be a rewarding experience for some, there are some risks involved, especially if you sleep for a long time with your legs bent. DVT is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. It is the formation of a blood clot in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually the legs. Sitting still for long periods of time is a risk factor for DVT. You can prevent a DVT by stretching legs and shifting positions every few hours.

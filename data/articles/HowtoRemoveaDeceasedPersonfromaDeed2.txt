 If the decedent left a will, naming one or more beneficiaries of the property, the beneficiaries are the new owners. If the decedent died intestate (without leaving a will), check your state’s intestate inheritance statuteto determine to whom the property passes.


In most common law states, property passes through the state’s intestacy laws to the decedent’s spouse and heirs. The amount of the estate awarded to each heir and any surviving spouse is specific to the state’s intestacy laws.
In a community property state, a surviving spouse (if applicable) is typically entitled to half of the community property, which is defined as all property that was acquired during the marriage.
 If the new owner to the decedent’s property is found in the decedent’s will, the will must be probated in order for the property ownership to change.The will should be filed with the probate court and the executor of the estate will commence with the probate process.


For example, if Jill was the sole owner of her house, and left her house to her friend Mary after she died, the executor of Jill’s estate would submit Jill’s entire estate (including her house), to probate.
 When probate is concluded, the judge will typically order that “clear title” is transferred to the beneficiaries under the will. Then, the order is recorded just like a deed would be.


While clear title is usually issued at the time the estate is closed, in some states, such as California, you can petition the court to order that the title should be recorded in your name before probate closes, if you can provide evidence that you are entitled to the property.

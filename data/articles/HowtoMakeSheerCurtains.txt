How full your curtains are is a matter of taste. The average fullness is calculated by taking the total length of the curtain rod (sized to fit your window) and multiplying that number by 1.5. You can multiply by 2 for fuller curtains.
 This gives you the size of each of the 2 curtain panels you need.

Again, this is a matter of taste. Two panels are normal, but, if you want more, just divide the total width by the number of panels you want to hang.
You need to add 2 inches (5 cm) for each panel to the width of the curtain panels for seams and finishing.


Add the length plus 4 inches (10 cm) plus the circumference of the curtain rod.


Take your measurements with you so you know how much material to purchase.
Be aware that material on bolts comes in 2 widths - 45 inches (1.125 m) and 60 inches (1.5 m). Home decorating fabric is mostly found in just the 60-inch (1.5 m) size.
Convert your measurements into yards (meters), since raw material is sold by the yard (meter). To do this, divide your total width and length by 36 (100 for metric).

Be aware that sheer material can be hard to cut. Make sure your scissors are sharp and you will want to stabilize the material on each side of the cut line with something heavy such as a book.


Fold over 1/8 inch (3 mm) and press with a warm iron. Fold the remaining 7/8 inches (2.2 cm) and press and then stitch it to make a 1-inch (2.5 cm)side seam on each side of each panel.


Fold over 1 inch (2.5 cm) and press. Fold over 2 inches (5 cm) more and press and then stitch the seam for a hem. This will leave you with the circumference of the curtain rod, plus 1 inch (2.5 cm) for top sleeve and seam allowance.


Fold over 1/8 inches (3mm) and press. Fold over 7/8 inches (2.2 cm) plus the circumference of the curtain rod, press and sew the curtain sleeve seam.

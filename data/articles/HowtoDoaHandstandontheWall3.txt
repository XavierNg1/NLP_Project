 If you've never done a handstand before, you need to work your way up to the routine. Do not attempt a full handstand right away. Spend a few weeks practicing headstands and forming 90 degree angles against the wall. This will get you used to the feeling of being upside down. It will also help you build the muscles necessary to do a full handstand.


You might also want to strengthen your arms. Try lifting weights or doing push ups a couple of times a week to build up your muscles.
 You should not be practicing handstands without a mat underneath you. In the event you do lose your balance and fall, a mat can help prevent injury. It may be a good idea to practice in a gym at first. There should be mats in place.
 You should not start off doing handstands completely alone. A friend can help hold your legs to help you find your balance. He or she can also help catch you in the event you lose your balance. When you first start doing handstands, do so with the assistance of a friend.

 In many cases, a puppy will stop urinating when greeted once it has enough time to mature. Try to be patient. Do your best to apply proper training methods, such as those detailed in the previous methods.In the meantime, it's a good idea to let your puppy greet you and others outside, or on a pee pad or other protected surface, so that its urination will require less cleanup.
 If you adopted your puppy from a shelter, it is possible that they have experienced trauma in the past. Sometimes unwanted urination behaviors can be due to past abuse, or poor living conditions (such as being born into a puppy mill) prior to your ownership of the dog. Habits learned during such trauma can take a long time to unlearn, and require that you be extra patient and attentive. Ask your dog shelter for details regarding your dog's past. Such information is often kept on file by the shelter.
You should consider taking your puppy to a professional trainer, if you suspect they have been abused.
 If your puppy's urination problems persists for longer than a couple months, your vet may wish to test your puppy to determine if some medical condition is contributing to the problem. They will also be able to suggest training classes, medications, and supplements which may help., If your puppy hasn't grown out of its urinating behaviors, or if the behaviors are particularly extreme (such as urination whenever the dog is spoken to or interacted with at all), it may be time to consult a professional. In such cases, professional dog training can provide you with the tools you need to correct the behavior.


Not only will professional training help curb your puppy's problematic peeing, it will also help them learn obedience and all-around good behavior, and will help you bond with your dog.
Talk to your vet for recommendations, or use the internet or yellow pages to find local dog trainers.

What's a collaboration without people? Decide on how many members you want. You can have 2,3,4,5,6,7 or even more.With 7 people everyone will have a day and do their video on that day! Hold auditions to make sure people who want to be in the collaboration get to be.
 Try to think of fun, creative themes so nobody gets bored.


Make sure everyone is participating and nobody quits on the channel. If you are discouraged because of few subscribers, remember, everyone starts from somewhere!

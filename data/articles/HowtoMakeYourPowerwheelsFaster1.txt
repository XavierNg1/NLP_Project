 Flip your car upside down and remove the wheels to access the black motor hardware. Remove the motor by loosening the screws using the proper screwdriver, and wiggling the cylinder-shaped motor until it comes free., Ensure that the new motor that you have chosen is the correct size for your Power Wheels. Remove the brushless motor from your secondary car. It will be cylinder shaped and you may need to remove some hardware to expose the motor.


Wipe the motor clean with a dry rag to remove any buildup of dirt., You may be able to salvage the spade off of the Power Wheels motor by heating it gently and applying some pressure with a flathead screwdriver.If you can’t remove it, purchase an inexpensive spade from your local hardware store rather than potentially ruining the already-connected spade and the actual motor itself.
 Gently push the motor in spade-end first.Using your screwdriver, put the screws back into the hardware to hold the battery in place.


The brushless motor may need some twisting and turning until it is solidly inserted so be patient and don’t try to force it.
 Carefully unwrap the wires from the original motor and re-attach them to the brushless motor following the same connecting points. At this point, a new battery could also be inserted if desired.


Disconnect the battery to avoid getting shocked.
 Your car should be compatible with the remote from the brushless motor. Keep the car upside down as you test to be cautious, as the speed will be greatly increased.

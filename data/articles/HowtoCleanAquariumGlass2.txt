 If you want to get rid of algae without having to do any of the hard work yourself, consider introducing species of fish, snails, and crustaceans that eat algae. The right species for you will depend on whether you have a freshwater or saltwater aquarium, the size of your tank, and the other species that you already have, so be sure to research them before you bring them home. You don't want to end up with a fish that is too large for your tank or is aggressive with your other fish. Popular algae-eaters include:Bristlenose plecostomus
Amano shrimp
Siamese algae eaters
Twig catfish
Otocinclus
Rosy barbs
Flag fish

The less of these resources there are available for algae, the less algae you will have.Plants also add beauty to your aquarium and they give your fish a place to hide, so they are beneficial in many ways.When choosing plants for your aquarium, be sure to consider what conditions they thrive in. For example, some plants need more light than others and different plants flourish at different temperatures., If fish, snails, and plants just aren't doing a good enough job of eliminating algae for you, you can get an automatic aquarium glass cleaner to do the job for you. Just place the cleaner on the inside of your glass, turn it on, and walk away.This is a pricey option, at over $200. Automatic aquarium glass cleaners are available at aquarium stores and online.
The automatic cleaner comes with a rechargeable battery and a replaceable scrubbing pad.
The automatic cleaner cannot turn corners, so you will need to reposition it if you need it to clean more than one side of the tank.

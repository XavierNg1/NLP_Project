, This doesn't mean that you shouldn't wear blue eyeshadow all the time if your eyes are blue. Just try not to do it very often. You want your makeup to make your eye color "pop". Using the identical colors can draw attention away from your eye color.
 Greens, golds, blues, and various purple shades work nicely with the browns.
 Violet and plum shades are especially good for green eyes. Grey is a great colour as well.
 Try on some silvers/golds/grays as well.

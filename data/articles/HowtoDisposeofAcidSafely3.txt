 Most strong acids will degrade glass and metal, but will not react with plastics.There are many different types of plastics so make sure you obtain the correct container for your acid. The acid should already be stored in such a container, but make sure it is not completely full to prevent spills.
 Heavy metals such as cadmium, zinc, copper, mercury, and lead are toxic and cannot be added to the water system.Other inorganic compounds that are toxic and/or corrosive also cannot go down the drain.


If you have different containers of the same acid with different compounds dissolved in it, keep them in separate containers as they must be disposed of separately.
 If you are at a university or work in a laboratory, there will be a department that will properly dispose of your hazardous waste for you. If this is not an option you can contact a local organization to help you with the disposal process.

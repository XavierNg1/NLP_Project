 Ask yourself these questions: Is it a small pot in the patio? A raised bed in the backyard? A garden in an extremely humid or cold place? Is it in the shade or the hot sun? These questions will benefit your choice.;
, Do you want giant tomatoes to show off? Do you want a large or small harvest? Do you want to use them in sandwiches, salads, salsas, or sauces? Do you want an old-fashioned, classic taste?

, One tomato plant needs at least one square foot of area, but depending on its type and growth rate, may stretch even further.
 (Try Home Depot, Ace Hardware, or even Walmart.) You may even want to research online for the final decision.
 You may be surprised at how well they do in your pot and how sweet they taste in salads and off the vine.






For an old-fashioned, classic taste, try heirlooms such as Brandywine, Black Krum, or more. These have a delicious taste and do well in almost anything, but can be more susceptible to disease than hybrids. These do best in a larger area.






For giant kinds, try Big Boy and/or Beefsteak. These kinds take up a lot of space and if you want them to be big, you should prune some of the tomatoes off it so it focuses on making them bigger, not making more. These kinds can attempt to overgrow your garden, so be aware! They taste best in sandwiches and sometimes salads.
 (Ace Hardware, Walmart, Home Depot) Then, pick out plants or a seed packet that fits your expectations. Finally, buy some pots, fertilizer and soil.
 The area should get at least six hours of sunlight each day. Your transplants should fruit in one or two months, seeds in three or four months.

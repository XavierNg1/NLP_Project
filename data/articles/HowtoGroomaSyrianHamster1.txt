 Hamsters are tiny creatures, so a small brush is all you really need. You can look for one at pet supply stores. However, a soft bristle toothbrush or paintbrush, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size, will also work well., The fur length of hamsters can vary. Some Syrian hamsters can have very long fur, however, making it difficult to groom them with a brush. If yours has long hair, you can use a small pet comb (such as a cat flea comb) instead., Some hamsters love being brushed, others are more reluctant to be groomed in this way. It is a good idea to have some treats available when attempting to brush your hamster, especially if it is a new pet. Offering it plenty of treats before, during, and after brushing will encourage it to form positive associations with being groomed., Gently pick up your hamster and set it in your lap. Pet it and offer it treats. Do not start brushing until it seems calm., Move the brush or comb lightly down the hamster’s belly back. Always work in the direction that your pet’s fur grows in. This will make the process more comfortable for the hamster., If you encounter knots or tangles in your hamster’s fur, do not force your way through them, or tug at them. Instead, gently brush through them a little at a time until they are cleared., Brush your hamster any time it appears to have tangles or dirt in its fur. Otherwise, groom your pet about once a week. Some hamsters, especially long haired Syrians, may need brushing twice a week. This will prevent matting., If your hamster is prone to frequent matting or tangling, or refuses to be brushed, you may need to shorten its fur. Carefully use a pair of cosmetic scissors to trim its fur to about 1 inch in length. Work cautiously so that you don’t cut the hamster. If you feel anxious about trimming the fur, see a vet or professional pet groomer for help.

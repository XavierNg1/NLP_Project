 Mix the Everclear, watermelon schnapps, and the bottle of strawberry schnapps together in a large bowl, continuing to stir until they're thoroughly combined., Cut the watermelon in half and then cut the insides into small chunks that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) large or so.
 The more it soaks, the more alcohol it will absorb.
 Take the containers of strawberry lemonade mix and combine them with the amount of water that you're directed to use on the package.
 Once you've soaked the fruit and made the lemonade mixture, pour the mixture into the vodka and watermelon mixture and stir it thoroughly to combine the ingredients together.
 Use a large ladle to serve the jungle juice in clear plastic cups or Solo cups. Do not just dip each cup into the punch -- make sure to use something to pour the juice into the cups to keep things sanitary. You can even garnish each glass with a slice of lemon if you're feeling fancy.


If you like this recipe, you can try cutting off just the top of one of the sides of the watermelon and serving the ingredients from the melon, next time.

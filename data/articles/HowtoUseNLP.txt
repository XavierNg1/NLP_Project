 Picture yourself on the large black and white theater screen engaged in a neutral activity, such as drinking soda or talking to a loved one.
 This is to solidify that you are simply an audience member watching yourself playing a role in a black and white movie., Stay as detached as possible and watch yourself go through the fearful state. There may be other people in the picture. For example, if you are afraid of public speaking, you may see an audience reacting to your speech., For example, picture yourself finishing the speech and experience the audience acknowledging the end of the speech through their applause or the next presenter approaching the podium., After your movie has ended, imagine yourself walking in the park or by the ocean for about a minute., Enter the theater screen during the final scene of your personal movie in which the particular event is now over and everything is calm., You are now in the movie and can see bright colors, hear sounds and smell the scent of the room., Rewind the experience of the movie you just viewed. For example, you will hear the applause of the audience, watch yourself give the closing statements, hear the middle of your speech, the introduction and arrive back at the beginning. Do all of this within a few short seconds., Determine if you still feel fearful now that you have watched and felt yourself going through the experience without negative consequences., To lessen the impact of the anxiety, repeat the NLP activity each day until you feel desensitized to the event or particular fear., Self-administered reprogramming is usually only effective for minor fears and anxieties. Consult a trained NLP practitioner or other qualified professional for serious phobias that cause anxiety-induced physical reactions.

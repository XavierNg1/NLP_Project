 Many times children fail to plan ahead and manage their time. Students must plan how to complete the courses in the available time given, while properly dividing the time between subjects.
 These could include:

“My roommate didn't set the alarm clock and I was not given enough time to get read.”

My school bag got stolen several days ago and I lost all my notes."


"I thought our teacher would not ask any questions from the last two chapters."

, Remember, an exam covers the entire content of a course, not merely selected areas of your course., Many times, children listen to music or turn on the TV while studying. It distracts the child from focusing on the material. Eating too much food while studying can distract children. and consume too much time. Although sitting on a bed may be comfortable, a bed can also lull a child to sleep instead of keeping them focused. Many children like group studying, but ensure that it doesn't morph into a gossip session. A bad environment, such as an uncomfortable chair, desk, temperature, can also result in an unproductive study session., Most children are nervous or afraid of taking an exam, although this affects some worse than others. For some children, it is enough just to think "examination" and their body reacts with symptoms of anxiety: rapid heartbeat, perspiration, and stomach aches.

Don't let your child push himself too hard. Because of stress and fear, children can forget the material they have studied during an exam, despite the fact that they have prepared well.

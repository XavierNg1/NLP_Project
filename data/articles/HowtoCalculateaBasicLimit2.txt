 Remember that any constant over an infinity in the denominator is equal to zero.
 Remember ∞/∞ is not an acceptable answer.


In this certain situation, putting an ∞ in for "x" would result in the answer being ∞/∞, which is not acceptable.
Therefore, the variable "x" was divided out of both the numerator and the denominator, which left the equation above.
It is then OK to plug in the infinity sign into the variable, which would result in 1 + 0 in the numerator, and 3 + 0 in the denominator, giving us a real answer of 1/3.
 Both methods should always yield the same value.

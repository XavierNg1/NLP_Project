 You can purchase a metal or crystal singing bowl online. You can also visit your local apothecary; they might have singing bowls for purchase. A singing bowl sings when you run a felt-tipped mallet around the bowl’s edges. The vibrations produced by the bowl can slow down your breathing, heart rate, and brain waves. This can produce a deep sense of calm and well-being., In the palm of your hand, hold the singing bowl. Then, grasp the mallet at mid-length with your palm facing downward, i.e., with all your fingertips facing downward and touching the wood. Gently tap the side of the singing bowl with the mallet. This is called warming up the bell.Hold smaller singing bowls, i.e., seven inches and under, on your fingertips.
 Using a full arm movement, like stirring a big pot, rub the mallet clockwise along the outside edge of the bowl’s rim. Use even pressure as you rub the mallet on the outside edge of the bowl’s rim. Make sure the mallet is positioned vertically, i.e., straight up and down.It is not a wrist movement, but a full arm movement.
Remember to apply pressure. The friction of the mallet against the singing bowl’s outer rim is what produces the vibration and the sound.
Try not to go too fast. Let the sound build up slowly as the bowl picks up the vibrations.

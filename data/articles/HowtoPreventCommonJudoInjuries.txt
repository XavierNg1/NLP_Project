 The best way to do this is to research online, but short of that, a good dojo should be clean, be willing to answer questions if you go in to check it out, have black belt instructors whose ranks have been obtained from the USJA, USJF, or USA Judo, and should request that you join one of these organizations upon joining the dojo. (This will provide you with insurance, and shows that the dojo is recognized by one of the above national organizations.) Also, the judo mats should be clean and in good condition. If there are many children who are very high ranked (ie seven or eight year old brown belts), that can be a warning sign.;
, You should not be thrown until you can fall on the mat without pain 9 times out of 10.
 They will be well versed in working with beginners and will know how not to hurt you.
 This way you avoid making a mistake that could injure you.
,, This could be the most important step, and the most difficult to do. The temptation when being thrown for the first few months is to tense up- do not do this. An experienced judoka will not throw you in a way that will injure you, and the fall will hurt significantly less if you are relaxed. Furthermore, tensing up when being thrown can cause your partner to make a mistake, which could injure them as well.
 Do not try to muscle through it, or escape from the choke/ arm bar. It is better to tap early rather than get hurt. However, in your first few weeks, no one should be choking or arm barring you anyway.

;
, Stand parallel to the post and keep a distance of approximately 6 feet between the post and you.
 Make sure there is only a few feet's gap between you and them.
 Depending on the type of ball delivered (short, long, on the ground), the next steps will differ., If you see an attacker rushing to the man taking the corner kick, it means that the attacking team is playing a short corner.
, Once the teammate has the ball, put pressure on him and don’t let him turn.
 This will help the other players in your team to come out and stop the attackers from receiving the pass.
 If a long ball has been played in the air, make sure to watch the ball’s flight, while glancing over your shoulder for the attacker positioned next to you.
 Then use your arms to help you block the attacker and jump as high as you can.
, If the attacking team chooses to deliver the ball on the ground, shift your feet to the left and get closer to the post.


Instead of trying to block off the attackers in the box, make sure there is no space between you and the post.






Stay in your position and do not move!

, If the ball falls into your path, kick it away as far as possible.

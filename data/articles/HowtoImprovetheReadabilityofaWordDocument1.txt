 Try to stick with one idea in each sentence so you don’t confuse the reader. This will make your sentences easy to understand and follow to the next idea or sentence., Try to avoid too many three syllable words, since that can be confusing for the reader and harder to follow. Keep your words as transparent as possible.


If you are writing a more academic piece, it may be a good idea to use longer words; however, keep your words as clear and direct as possible even if they are longer.
 Transition words like “first,” “however,” or “therefore” can tell your reader how parts of the document relate to one another. It can help them move between sentences and between paragraphs more easily.
 In each sentence, make sure your subject is always doing an action, not having an action done to it. For example, write “Sally threw the ball,” rather than “The ball was thrown by Sally.", Your readers should be able to view the document and understand the point of each paragraph or section immediately. If you write in the active voice, this should be easy to do.

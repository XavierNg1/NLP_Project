 Research online and offline to help you understand your spending. Paying on line can save you and paying quarterly or monthly should be considered. Direct Debit payments sometimes attract a small discount.


Determine how much electricity you use. Use the electricity bills from the last year to calculate an approximate value.
(If possible) Compare different offers from electrical companies; choose the one that is the cheapest (lowest cost per kilowatt hour).
Find out if there is an OFF-PEAK time of the day when the rate is lower and use that time for most electricity needs (e.g. running washing machine, dishwasher, or cooking). This may require additional costs for special metering hardware to track usage during those times.;
, Don't buy devices that are bigger than necessary (buy and use small pressure cookers whenever possible). Ask for energy efficient devices. Don't forget to check the stand-by consumption. Check if there is a label like Energy Star or an energy class label.
 Use a power strip with a switch, that way you'll only have to flip a switch to unplug your devices.


If a device doesn't have an on/off switch, use a plug connector with an on/off switch. Connect, for example, your TV and the loudspeakers with a plug connector. You can switch off both devices by just one action. Connect your DVD recorder with a separate socket since it is likely that you would have to readjust it if you switch it off.
Some power adapters (transformers for rechargeable appliances) also consume energy. Unplug them when not in use.

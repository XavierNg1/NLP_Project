 The United States federal government places no restrictions on private citizens recording their phone conversations, but many states require consent from all involved parties. Without such consent, your records will be legally useless in those states, and could even get you in trouble.


There are 11 states that require consent from all parties: California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington. In addition, the state of Hawaii requires full consent any time a recording is made inside a private residence.
If you're planning to tap a phone line instead, there are federal laws you must abide by in addition to state laws. Tapping a phone is the act of recording a conversation without the knowledge of either party. It is generally illegal except in certain law enforcement situations.;
, Recording your phone calls can be very useful, but it can also have unexpected consequences. Arm yourself with knowledge and play it safe.


You may get into a state jurisdiction snafu if you record a conversation without two-party consent, and it turns out that the other conversant lived in a state where two-party consent is mandatory. Even though you aren't breaking the law in this case, your phone records might be thrown out of evidence.
Your friends and family may be upset with you if you begin to record all your calls and they find out. It's better to speak to those close to you before you start, and respect whatever boundaries they set with you.
Depending on how above board your own calls are, there could be trouble if your records fall into somebody else's hands. Be sure you're living on the straight and narrow with regards to your love life, your finances, and any illicit activities you might be tempted to discuss over the phone.

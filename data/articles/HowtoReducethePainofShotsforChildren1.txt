 Telling your child about the injection in advance may cause them to feel worried or apprehensive. However, you can introduce your child to the idea of shots by engaging in some doctor's office role play with a toy.This will provide some familiarity for your child without frightening them.


For example, you could pretend that a stuffed animal is coming for a checkup and say something like, "Okay Mr. Hippopotamus, time for your vaccination to keep you healthy. It will just take a second." Then, use an object like a capped pen or crayon to mimic the motion of giving a shot on the stuffed animal.
When you take your child for their appointment, then you can remind them of the game you played and how Mr. Hippopotamus got a vaccination.;
, It may help to educate your child about the importance of shots. Find a book that explains the vaccination process in a friendly way, such as the picture book “Lion’s Aren’t Scared of Shots.” The key is to not over-prepare them, as this could make the trip appear a bigger deal than it is.


Depending on your child’s age, you may want to teach them how the immunization process works. Say this to your child: “Shots protect you by giving you a very tiny, dead piece of the germ. This germ is so small that it can’t hurt you. Instead, your body responds by making antibodies. Your body now knows how to fight this germ whenever it encounters it!"If your child is very young, the less information may be best. You may also want to use gentler language. Say this to your child: “You will get a tiny poke, but it will make your body super strong!”

, Depending on your child’s age, they may wish to bring a friend for moral support. Call the child’s parents and confirm the date ahead of time. Your child may feel better about the upcoming vaccination if they can mentally plan on their friend being there, too.

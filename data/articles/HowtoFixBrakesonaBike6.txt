 The pedals should only travel 1/4 turn and the brakes should engage. This all occurs inside the rear axle housing, and servicing is not recommended for a novice.
 On "Bendix" type coaster brakes, the brake arm is a flat, steel "arm" attached to the rear axle opposite from the chain, which is clamped to the lower frame. Look to see if the clamp has become loose, allowing the arm to rotate with the axle. If it has become detached, reclamp the brake arm facing the front of the bike.

 If your partner is upset, pull them in for a hug rather than a kiss. Hugs communicate unconditional love and support, whereas kisses require reciprocation, which may be unfair to ask in a time of distress.


Hugs also work when your partner isn't upset.
 Romance doesn't have to be so serious: it can also be humorous and playful. What's important is to show love and appreciation.Put your arm around your partner's waist when you walk. (This may be more romantic than the casual "arm around the shoulder.")
Hold hands while walking, watching TV or a movie, or sitting on the bus together. Reach for your partner's hand at unexpected moments, too, such as across the table at dinner.
Put your arms around your partner's waist when you are standing behind them.
Play with your partner's hair. Go easy, though â€“ you don't want to ruin an immaculate coiffure!
Plant some kisses in unexpected spots: try fingertips, toes, cheeks, forehead, shoulders, neck, arms, stomach, or chin.
Give your love a wink and a smile.
 No matter how busy life gets, or how stressed the two of you are, taking the time to hold each other once a day helps confirm your connection and reminds you how much you love each other.


This could be in the morning or in the evening, or, if there's no other time, try having a cuddle before sleep.

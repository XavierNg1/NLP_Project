 Most theatres sell candy and other snacks that can be purchased at any convenience or grocery store. You can easily smuggle these items into the theatre, because no one will suspect that they were not purchased from the concession stand. It is highly unlikely that you would ever be asked to provide a receipt.Some large movie theatre chains also sell food such as hot dogs, pizza, and burgers. If this is the case, you could try sneaking in larger items.
 Some foods can be loud to open and eat. For instance, most movie theatres do not sell soda in a can. The sound of a can of cola being opened will surely draw attention.If you want to bring your own soda, pour it into a water bottle so you won't disturb others watching the movie by opening the can.
Similarly, you can leave loud wrappers at home by opening up your candy in advance and transferring it to a resealable baggie. This will be much quieter and you can eat the food without drawing attention., When sneaking food into a theatre, avoid foods that have a strong scent. This may cause you to stand out and could increase your chances of getting caught by the theatre staff. Stick to scentless foods, such as trail mix, candy, or bottled water.Don't try to sneak in a burger or onion rings. Not only will the person next to you be extremely jealous, but the scent may draw the attention of the staff.
 As a general rule, you should never eat anything in a dark movie theatre that requires cutlery. Aside from the fact that you will likely make a huge mess, it is also inconsiderate to the other people trying to watch the film. Cutlery is loud and can distract from the movie. Leave your leftovers at home and stick with small snacks and finger foods., Once you are inside the theatre, be discreet. Keep your smuggled food hidden and avoid eating these items in front of the theatre employees. This way you are less likely to get caught.

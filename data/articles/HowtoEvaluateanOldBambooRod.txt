 Yes, antique bamboo rods are unique and sought-after collection pieces. But you won't become a millionaire if you have or find one! The most expensive bamboo rod sold in an auction was about 20'000$ worth. But more generally if you get 3000$ this is a very good price.


Many, many bamboo rods in the past were also made for the mass market and so they were and still are cheap bargains. Moreover, many US soldiers brought home many souvenir bamboo rods from Japan at the end of the Second War World and these are also very cheap, no-interest fly rods (they were not even split cane rods, but simply bamboo sticks).;

 Clothing companies often stretch out their fabric so that less cloth is needed to manufacture a shirt.Washing the cotton shirt, or submerging it, in warm water will help the cloth in the shirt shrink back to its natural state.









If you want to avoid the hassle of buying a shirt that's too big and shrinking it yourself, look for pre-shrunk garments when you shop. Pre-shrunk shirts are increasingly common.;
, The warmer the water, the greater the shrinkage.








If you want your shirt to shrink roughly 1-2 sizes, put your shirt in immediately after you remove the pot from the burner.
If you want your shirt to shrink roughly 1/2-1 size, wait 5 minutes before placing the shirt in the water.
If you want your shirt to shrink roughly 1/4-1/2 size, wait 10-15 minutes before placing the shirt in the water.
 You may have to alter the time based on the shirt size. Again, the longer the shirt is exposed to the hot water, the more it will shrink.
 Be careful not to burn yourself if the water is still scalding.
 For slight to moderate shrinking, wring the shirt out and let air dry. To shrink the shirt by 2 or 3 sizes compared to its original shape, use a dryer instead, as the tumbling will cause it to shrink.

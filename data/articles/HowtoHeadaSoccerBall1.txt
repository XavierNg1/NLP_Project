 As the soccer ball approaches, you must maintain eye contact with the ball and acquire your balance. Execute these steps at the same time:


Keep your eyes open and focused on the ball.
Close your mouth.
Plant both of your feet firmly on the ground. If you are right handed, your left foot should be slightly forward; if you are left handed, your right foot should be slightly forward.;
, Once you are braced for the ball's arrival, you need to gain momentum by bending your knees. This will increase your momentum and balance. These movements occur simultaneously:


Bend slightly at your knees.
Bend backwards at your waist and arch your back.
Tuck your chin., Your risk for head injuries increases when you passively allow the ball to hit you. When the ball arrives within heading distance, you need to propel yourself towards the ball in order to actively hit it. This series of movements begins at your hips:


As you bend forward at the hips, thrust your head and chin forwards and drive your arms backwards.
Hit the ball with the center of your forehead along your hairline.
In a game situation, you may need to jump up to reach the ball.

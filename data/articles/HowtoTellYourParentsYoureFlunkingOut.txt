 Offer to do small things like cleaning the dishes, setting the table, washing the car...They'll be suspicious at first, but chill. If you flash a smile at them, they'll freak out even more. Remember: known teenage trouble-makers are NOT supposed to smile.;
, Don't yell at your dad to get the door when the bell rings and you're playing Black Ops. Don't scream your lungs off when your mom feels brave enough to come into your room to help you clean up.
 This has to involve blunt honesty on your part ("Yes, dad, I was in detention again that day") and superhuman levels of patience ("Yes, mom, I know I don't apply myself.").
 Parents usually don't feel like they're getting through to their kids, so make sure you don't just nod and grunt. Blurt in a few non-rebellious words, and let them do most of the talking.
 That's just parental defense mechanism.
 Assure them that your dearest dream, contrary to their expectations, is NOT to live in a doghouse. Be down to earth, and discuss your career options. Parents are usually a lot smarter than they let on, and they can help you out a lot.
 They will feel sympathetic, even if they don't let it on. Your parents aren't a pair of sleeping beauties, they would know that your behavior reflects your grades. Don't treat this as some master manipulation trick to gain their sympathy- realize that if you don't pull up your socks now, you're doomed.
 They'll be furious that you flunked straight-out, but at least this way, they're prepared in advance.

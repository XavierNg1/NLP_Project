 In Mumbai, many of the domestic stations do not have platforms on both sides of the track, so ask the people around on which side the platform will come. Before two stations to your destination, stand up from your seat (that is if you are lucky enough to have one)and start moving towards the door. There will be more than 100 people to get down from the same door at any station and more than 100 people to enter your compartment from the same door and the whole transaction will have to be done in less than a minute, 30 seconds sometimes!! Reach near to the door, but don't go too near or the flow of people will knock you out at the wrong station!!

, Immediately there will be gathering of the people who want to get down on the next station with you.
 Clutch your luggage tightly on your chest or abdomen. Don't try to move willingly now, let the mob do its job! Never be at the end of mob, you will be left behind in the train. Never keep your luggage on the back or it will be left behind!!

, The mob is desperate to get out of the door. Just lift your heels and be on your fingers!! That is the best way to let the mob carry you with it!! Get on your feet as soon as you climb down the stairs. The train is not going to stop completely, it will just slow down. You will have to be prepared for a little bit of momentum. Take two three running steps after getting off.
 Suppose you have failed to step out at your desired station, try on next and next to that, you will surely succeed in one of these attempts!Travel back one or two stations in other train or go out of the station and catch a rickshaw or bus back to your station.

 While adult Basset Hounds range in size from as little as 40 to as many as 80 pounds (18-36 kg), they are all rather short. Their backs are also relatively long for their height, with their shoulder reaching only 15 inches (38 cm) or so. Accordingly, a Basset Hound will always appear much longer than it is tall., A Basset Hound’s sternum will push through its front legs enough to be visible from the side of the dog. The chest will also be quite deep, meaning it extends towards the ground noticeably. Shoulders are powerful looking and located on the side of the dog’s body., Both the front and back legs of a basset hound will feel strong to the touch, despite being humorously short and covered in noticeably loose skin. The paws of Basset Hounds are quite large, and feature tough, prominent padding. The feet may also splay out to the sides a bit., A Basset Hound’s gait reflects their appearance and demeanor. They move casually and with apparent heaviness, yet seemingly without effort. They will often hold their noses low to the ground. Elbows will be tucked against the dog’s body. Their powerful plodding may even warrant a chuckle from time to time., There’s no color code or markings that necessarily indicate a dog is a Basset Hound. Most feature two or three colors, often including white or black. Tan, brown, or red areas are also common. Often, the colors of the coat on the back, head, and shoulders will be different from the color of the chest and underbelly.

 Use organic fertilizers and composts when possible. Kale particularly likes fish emulsion and compost tea.
 Be sure that you sow seeds two to four weeks before the last frost date if you are planting directly in the garden.


If the plants start to crowd each other as they grow, you can always further thin the plants out to allow for more space between each plant.
 Kale seeds are small and can only grow through ¼ to ½ inch (6–12 mm) of soil. Space the seeds about three inches (7.5 cm) apart. Pat the soil lightly to cover the seeds.
 While the seeds grow, allow the top layer of the soil to dry out between watering.
 At this point, your kale seedlings should have at least four developed leaves. It takes four to six weeks for your seedlings to reach this stage.

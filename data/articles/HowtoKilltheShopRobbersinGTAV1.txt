You can avoid a car chase by using explosives. If you decide to do so, stock up on explosives (such as sticky bombs or grenades) at an Ammu-Nation.
Unlike most random events, there will be no indication on your map that this event has triggered.;
, A short cutscene will be triggered in which the robbers have you get on your knees while they rob the salon. Shortly after, they will leave the salon and escape in their vehicle., Follow them out of the salon and lob an explosive at their vehicle to kill them all at once. If you choose to chase them in your vehicle, you will need to disable their Gallivanter Baller by shooting at the tires. Alternatively, you can drive in front of them and park your car there to stop them. Once their vehicle has stopped, shoot and kill them.

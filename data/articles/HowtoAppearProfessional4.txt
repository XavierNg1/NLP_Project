 Being respectful, instead of catty or sarcastic, is a way of showing other people that you are a true professional. Encourage others to speak up in meetings, and don't belittle what they have to say. Don't respond rudely to people, even if you think the idea sounds silly., Part of treating others well is listening well. It shows other people that you actually care what he or she has to say, and it fosters true conversation, as you're not just waiting until they finish talking so you can say what you want., If you talk about people behind their back, eventually it will get back around to them, which won't make anyone happy. If you stay out of the drama, you'll definitely appear more professional., If something you worked on goes awry, don't push it off on someone else. Own up to it, and figure out how to do better in the future. If you realize something is going wrong in the middle of a project, bring it up with your boss; maybe together you can figure out how to fix it., Professionals tell the truth about their work, both to their co-workers and their clients. Lying will eventually be found out and make you look unprofessional., Though you should be confident in your work, you shouldn't try to take others down to make your work look better. For instance, if you finish your work quicker than others, your boss will notice without you crowing about it., People love to hear the sound of their name. If you use peoples' names often, they will feel more respected by you.

 Don't try to learn with the plastic one-piece toys you can get cheap in some hobby stores. They hurt your hands after only a few minutes and the balance is poor for beginners. On the internet you can get good clubs from jugglenow.com or Brian Dube Juggling. (See External Links for one of each.);
, Don't try to hold all three clubs in your hands at first. Just start with one. Hold it in your dominant hand (right, for this article) and practice tossing it to your other hand.
 You want the apex of the toss to be just above eye level. Any higher and your throws will be out of control. Any lower and you won't have time to get that second toss in.
, Now continue your single throws, getting used to having a club in the other hand.
 Toss the second club when the first begins its descent from its apex. Throw it under the first club, and aim for one good flip, then catch it in your right hand.
 Don't try to do 100, or even ten tosses. Just do two, then see how you did. You're going to drop a lot. We all did. It will come. Be patient.
 Put it in your dominant hand and just hold it there, again between the middle and ring fingers to start with. Now continue your two tosses until you get comfortable again.
 By now you are beginning to feel the rhythm of juggling the clubs so this will come easily. After you have caught the first throw, and as the second club is at its apex, throw the third club to the left hand, then catch the second throw in the now-vacant right hand, catch the third throw in the already-holding-one-club left hand, and STOP!

, Hand one club back to your dominant hand, and start over until you can catch all three throws several times in a row.
 It's one step at a time. Don't try for long runs until you can do four, five, and six throws with some regularity.
 You're now juggling the clubs! With some practice you will only get better and better.

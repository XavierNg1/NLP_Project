 A good, ripe cantaloupe will have a base color that’s tinted gold, so avoid those that appear green. The skin shouldn’t have any tears or scars, and the netting on its surface should be thick, coarse, and strongly defined.If the cantaloupe’s base color still has a greenish tint, that usually means that it isn’t ripe yet.
It’s normal for the netting on the cantaloupe’s skin to be more pronounced in some areas than others.;
, Once you’ve found a cantaloupe with skin that appears healthy, pick it up and test its weight. The melon should feel fairly heavy for its size.To determine whether it is a good weight, you may have to test several cantaloupes from the store’s display. That will help you determine if one in particular feels heavy enough.
 One of the best ways to determine if a cantaloupe is ripe and healthy is to smell it. If the melon has a sweet, musky scent, it’s likely ripe and a good one to bring home.Smell the cantaloupe at the blossom end to test for ripeness. That’s the end of the melon that’s opposite the stem area.
If the cantaloupe smells perfume, that may be an indication that it’s overripe., Finally, before purchasing a cantaloupe, examine the stem area. Make sure that there aren’t any tears in the skin, as these can sometimes mean that the melon was harvested too early. There should also be a slight indentation in the stem area to show that the cantaloupe separated easily from the vine when it was harvested.The stem itself shouldn’t be attached to the cantaloupe. That usually indicates that the melon hasn’t matured.
Avoid any cantaloupes that are soft or moist in the stem area.

 Select a piece of wood that is big enough to accommodate the size of the gun you plan to carve. Choose a wood such as pine that is soft enough to carve, but tough enough to be a durable toy. You can even try to find a board with a natural grain suitable for a gun's stock.
 Using a photograph from a book or magazine as a guide, draw the basic shape of the gun you hope to replicate, be it a hand gun or a rifle. Unless you are trying to make a scale replica, a free-handed outline should be sufficient., Saw around the gun shape you drew. Use a jig saw for curves and short angles or straight edges. If you have longer lengths to cut, you might prefer a circular saw.
 Smooth over the contours of the gun shape with a small hand grinder and a coarse sanding disc. If you don't have a hand grinder, you can use coarse sand paper and some elbow grease.
 Use a drill to create holes where they should occur on the gun, such as the trigger area and in the stock. The location of the holes will vary based upon the gun you are carving. Reference the original photograph to determine where to cut.


Use a small saw to expand the small holes to the appropriate size and shape. Sand the edges of the holes by hand., You can extend the barrel of the gun using a wooden dowel. Cut a wooden dowel to desired length and sand the ends.Mark a center line on the top of the gun's body. Carefully use a router to cut a groove along this line for the dowel barrel. The groove should be just wide enough to set the dowel in it.
Run a bead of wood glue down the groove and position the dowel in groove.
 You can choose to decorate the gun using paint or markers, drawing details, making the gun camouflaged or painting it a solid color. If you prefer the natural wood look, you can either leave the wooden gun unfinished or rub a wood stain over it.

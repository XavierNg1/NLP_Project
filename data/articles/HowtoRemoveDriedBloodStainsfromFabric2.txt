 Meat tenderizer powder, sold in grocery stores, can break down the proteins found in blood stains. While it is recommended by some silk experts, meat tenderizer does have the potential to break down silk and wool fibres as well.Test this method on a small corner of these fabrics first, to see if damage occurs.
 Put about 15 mL (1 tbsp) unseasoned meat tenderizer into a small bowl. Gradually add water while stirring until a thick paste is formed.


Do not use seasoned meat tenderizer, as the seasonings may stain your fabric.
 Spread the paste on the dried blood stain and gently rub it with your fingers. Let it sit for about an hour.
 After the hours is up, rinse the paste out with cold water. Wash the fabric as usual, but air dry rather than using a drier, since the heat can cause remnants of the stain to set permanently.

 Take enough time to heal after a heartbreak, messy divorce, or losing a spouse before you enter a new relationship. Give your new partner a fighting chance by waiting until you are completely over your last partner—and any heartache you may have endured—before getting into something new.


To avoid taking out your past experiences on this new partner, you’ll need to give yourself time before you jump into another relationship. You may even need professional help before you can consider yourself completely over your ex.;
, Ask friends, co-workers, and other people who are in your social circle for help finding a date. They know you and may have an idea as to what type of person would make you happiest.Additionally, avoid picking the same “type” person every time. By going out with someone you normally would not, you may find something you didn’t know you liked.
 The best way to meet people is get out there and mingle. Think about the kinds of things you once did before you were in a committed relationship. Can you use any of your former hobbies as a platform to becoming more social? For example, do you belong to a gym? Take painting classes? Or participate in a book club? Reconnect with your old self. Go after goals you put aside, such as learning a new language. Start back up on hobbies you once enjoyed. You’re more likely to meet someone with whom you share things in common when you’re doing things you love.
 Give online dating a try. Millions of people choose this route as an introduction to someone new and interesting.Meeting someone new in this manner is perfect for people who don’t know where to meet someone, or would rather not frequent the typical places people go to find dates, such as bars and clubs.


Also, online sites often do most of the legwork for you, and conduct screening processes before you even talk. This can reduce the pressure for people who are shy or hesitant to get back into the dating pool.
 Creating an online dating profile can feel overwhelming to some. How much do you reveal about yourself? The simple answer is to give the basics without going into too much detail. Choose a clear and attractive photo and explain a few things about yourself that you think are important in finding a match.For example, if you are divorced, it may be nice to add this to your profile, but you need not go into what caused the divorce or how much you hate people like your spouse. You could run off potential dates with this sort of energy. Keep it positive.
Refrain from listing traits you prefer in a mate, unless they are make or breaks. For instance, if you love travel, you can say "searching for someone who enjoys adventure/travel," but it could be limiting to use that as a criteria for potential matches.
Also, avoid giving out any personal information, such as your last name, home address, place of employment, or personal contact info. If you connect with someone, there will always be an opportunity to do this at a later time.
 If you make the decision to transform an online connection to an offline one, that's a good sign that the two of you are getting on well. However, keeping yourself safe in this situation is paramount. Due to scams and fake profiles, you want to use caution when meeting up with online dates.

Thinking of the dating world like this may prevent you from becoming disappointed if every date isn’t how you envisioned it., Take the initiative. If there's someone you feel a connection to, don't hesitate to ask them out. If the other person is single like you, then they would probably love to go out for coffee or ice cream with another like-minded individual. Do this successfully by portraying confidence, being specific, and being flexible.


Portray confidence by approaching the person with an attitude that demonstrates that you expect the person to say "yes." Using certain language like "I know you probably don't want to, but..." only sets you up to get turned down. Instead, say "Hey, I think we have a lot in common. In fact, there's an art show this weekend and I'd love to go with you."
Be specific. Just as you don't want to seem like you are expecting them to turn you down, you also don't want to be tentative or vague. Say "Would like to go for coffee on Saturday?" This gives a specific activity and date so that the other person has a clear understanding.
Be flexible about the timing. There's a possibility the specific date you choose may not work for the other person. But, that doesn't mean it's an automatic fail. Ask, "Will you be free next Saturday?" to seal the deal.
 Plan to meet at a restaurant, museum, or a place where others will likely be in attendance, especially if you have only met online.Avoid meeting at your homes, in order to stay safe in case the person ends up being dangerous, or you would rather they not know where you live. Also let a friend know where and when you are meeting, as a precaution.
 It’s okay to play the field, or date more than one person, as long as your dates don't think you're exclusive. Keep first encounters short and sweet. Avoid getting into conversations that are too deep and serious for a first date. Talk about light subjects, such as what your interests are, rather than delving into each other's backgrounds or family histories.Keep first dates brief by carefully selecting the timing and context of your encounters. For instance, maybe start with a coffee date as a first encounter. That way, you have the option to cut the date short if you want to, or move into lunch or dinner if things are going well.
 Know that your first date is about fun and getting to know each other, not planning where your children will attend school or the joys of joint checking accounts. Avoid putting too much pressure on this meeting, and you’re more likely to have fun and want to see each other again.If you meet with someone who you enjoy and have many things in common, then you can consider becoming exclusive with this person. Otherwise, just make it carefree and fun.
 Trust your gut instincts about relationship red flags. Getting defensive, jealous, or controlling are all signs that you are in a relationship with the wrong person. If you have any doubts, trust your feelings and get out. Additionally, protect yourself if you become intimate with someone.

 You can use an aluminum coffee can, a glass jug with a lid, or cardboard cylinders to make shakers. Wooden containers also work well. Each type of container will end up making a different, unique sound.
 Any number of small items will make interesting sounds when you shake them. Gather a handful of some or all of the following items:


Beads, either plastic, glass or wooden
Dried beans or rice
Coins
Seeds

,,, Overlap each loop of tape a bit to make sure the container gets completely covered.
 Use paint or and/or other decorating materials to add bright colors and patterns to the shaker.
 Use the shaker as a percussion instrument by itself or with a band.

,,, Most consignment sales will not accept damaged or stained clothing.
 If held up in front of you, the hook should look like the hook of a question mark.


If there is more than 1 piece to an outfit, place it on the backside of the first piece, facing outward so the front of both garments can be easily viewed by turning it over.
 Make sure the pin secures the item to the hanger so it won't fall off with excessive movement.


When hanging pants or shorts alone, pin the top of both sides of the pants to the top of the hanger.
If you're hanging 2 pieces on 1 hanger, secure them both to the top of the hanger with safety pins, making sure to pin through the both pieces. If you have 2 shirts, you can place them on 2 separate hangers and rubber band the hooks of the hangers together.
 Examples of this may be to hand write or print out the item's description and price. Some sales allow you to use an on line template with bar codes for easier tracking.
 Tag only the first piece if you are tagging an outfit.


You may choose to use a tagging gun, if you prefer, to save time.
 Separate girl's clothing from boy's clothing, and men's from women's. This will make it easier to place the clothing by department at the sale.

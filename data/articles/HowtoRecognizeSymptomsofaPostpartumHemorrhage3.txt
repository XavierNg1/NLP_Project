 Acute PPH is often accompanied by signs of shock such as reduced blood pressure, tachycardia or low pulse rate, fever, rigors, and faintness or collapse. These are the most definite indications of a PPH, but also the most dangerous. They require immediate medical intervention.
 There are some less severe yet dangerous signs of a secondary PPH that tend to occur a few days after delivery. These include fever, abdominal pain, painful urination, general weakness, abdominal tenderness over the suprapubic area and adnexae.
 PPH is a medical emergency and requires immediate hospitalization and measures to stop the bleeding. Hence, it isnâ€™t a condition that can be ignored. If you experience any of the following symptoms after delivery, contact your OB immediately, as you could be developing shock.


Low blood pressure
Low pulse rate
Oliguria or reduced urine
Sudden and continuous vaginal bleeding or passing of large clots
Fainting
Rigors
Fever
Abdominal pain

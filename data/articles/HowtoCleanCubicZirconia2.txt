 In the event a routine cleaning does not restore cubic zirconia's luster, follow up by soaking it. Make a soak for the jewelry using three parts hot water and one part mild dish detergent., Gently set your cubic zirconia in the water/detergent mixture so it's fully submerged. There is no precise amount of soaking time required, but let the gem sit for at least a couple of minutes., Under the faucet, rinse the mixture off the cubic zirconia. Rinse it until the water runs clear. Then, pat the zirconia completely dry with a clean cloth., If both cleaning and soaking do not restore cubic zirconia's shine, it's time to seek professional treatment. A high pressure steam clean may be needed, which should be done by a professional jeweler.

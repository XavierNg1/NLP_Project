 You can’t develop a complete acts of kindness habit without being kind to yourself. Many people are too harsh or overly critical about every aspect of their lives. Treat yourself with the kindness you wish to show to others — treat yourself like a beloved friend, not an enemy.Forgive yourself for mistakes, compliment yourself, smile at your reflection in the mirror, and speak about yourself in positive terms. These are all ways to be kind to yourself, and you deserve kindness, just like anyone else.
 It takes three weeks to adopt a habit. This means that you should consciously work for 21 days at acts of kindness. You can do this when you first wake up by sending an email thanking someone, or you can smile at someone you pass on the street.Make sure to do these acts every day, otherwise it won’t become a habit. Set a reminder in your phone or mark it on your calendar if you need to remind yourself.
 Each morning, come up with a specific way you will be kind that day. This helps you make the conscious decision each day to be kind until it becomes a habit and second nature. The act can be small or large.Habits take time to develop, and they require you to take action. You have to think about your acts of kindness while developing the habit.

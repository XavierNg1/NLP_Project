 Well cut hair allows you to present a confident image. Plan on cutting your hair every four weeks to retain a healthy look. Even if you are trying to grow out your hair, cutting the tips will prevent split ends and promote a healthy growth.


Don't be a stranger to your barber or stylist. While you are there, schedule your next appointment to ensure your hair stays well groomed., People with straight hair may choose to wash their hair daily while others with very curly hair may need to do so less frequently. There is some debate on how daily washing can dry out hair and strip the scalp of important nutrients.


When you do shampoo, lather the product on your scalp and don't worry about the rest.
For curly hair that becomes very dry, consider conditioning your hair more frequently than shampooing.
Use conditioner for your mid length hair and tips. These parts of hair are more vulnerable to becoming dried out.
 Shorter nails look neater. Men should always have trimmed nails. If you have longer nails, keep them in good condition. Never hesitate if you want to take your nails to the nail salon.


Do not bite your nails. This doesnâ€™t make your hands look well groomed. Always use clippers or take them to a nail stylist.
 Double check your look in a mirror before leaving the house. Mirrors can help you catch easy to miss blemishes that could ruin your look like:


Red patches on your face
Wrinkled clothing
Untidy hair
Weak collars
Faded clothing

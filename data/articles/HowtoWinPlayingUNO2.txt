 When scoring UNO, the points you give the hand winner are based on the cards left in your hand. The number cards are tallied by face value, so the 9 is worth 9 points, the 8 worth 8, and so on. Since you don't want to be left with a lot of points in your hand to give the round winner, play your highest numbered cards first. This way, you will have less points in your hand if someone else ends to round.


If you have higher numbers in a different color than the one in play, try to change the color by playing a matching lower number in the color of your high cards.
The one exception is the 0 card. There are only four 0 cards in each deck, so if you are trying to keep the color from being changed by your opponent, play a 0 to make it much harder for them to play the same number of a different color to change the color in play., If you have a lot of one color, try to play as many of those in that one color you can before the color is changed. You don't want to end up near the end of the game with four cards of four separate colors. This will make it much harder for you to win the game.


Remember you can change the color back to the one you have the most of by matching the same numbers of different colors., If your opponent has played a few cards in one color, you might want to change the color to lower the likelihood that they can play. You can do this by playing the same number card in a different color. On the other hand, if you notice that your fellow player has had to draw for a few turns because they don't have the color being played, do your best to keep it on that color. This will force them to draw more cards and increase your chances of winning.

 Make sure the stained area is not resting on another part of the fabric. Place a towel underneath the area on which you’re working. This will ensure that the ink stain will not run through the fabric and stain more of the fabric.
 Rub in enough salted butter to cover the stain, using either a cloth. Rub the stained area in a circular motion, moving and frequently turning the cloth over to prevent the spread or transfer of ink.
 Find a place where the item will be undisturbed and sheltered from any rain. An outside location in the direct sunlight is best. Allow the item to sit for a couple of days. The butter’s oil will soften up and break up the stain. The salt from the butter, coupled with the sunlight, will help to lift the stain.Wash the fabric in the washing machine. Put a regular amount of laundry detergent in the washing machine and set it to use hot water. Do not include other items in the washing machine so that you don’t risk any transfer of the ink to another item.


If the fabric is not washable (vinyl, for example), wipe away the butter with a clean damp cloth. Apply a small amount of gentle laundry detergent to the cloth to help clean off the butter.
 The stain should be gone, but if there is still a trace, repeat the process of applying butter to the stain. Wash the fabric again and if the stain is gone, then proceed to dry the fabric as usual.

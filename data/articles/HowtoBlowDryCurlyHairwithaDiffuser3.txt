 This will define your curls and keep them from getting frizzy. Apply the product section by section, taking care not to pull your curls apart. There's no need to use a brush or comb; just use your fingers.
 Curls tend to puff up when they're over handled. Now that your hair is dry, just let it be for the rest of the day. Try not to crush your curls with restrictive styles, hats and other accessories that might cause them to get too fluffy.
 Avoid using firm or maximum hold spray, since it tends to make curls look rigid and helmet-like. Use a light hold spray that allows your curls to move and bounce easily.

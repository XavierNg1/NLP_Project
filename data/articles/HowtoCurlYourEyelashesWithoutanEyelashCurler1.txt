 Use a regular teaspoon-sized spoon, and not a large one. You want it to fit neatly over your eye, so that the curve of the spoon will match the curve of your eyelid.;
, Warming up the metal will create a better curl by transferring heat to your eyelash hairs. It will have a curling iron-like effect on your lashes. Dry the spoon once it's warmed up.
 Position it horizontally and rest it gently against your lid. You want the bottom of the spoon to be against your eyelid, with the bowl of the spoon facing out. Align the edge of the spoon with your upper lash line., Use your finger to press them over the edge of the spoon and into the bowl. Hold them there against the warm metal for thirty seconds.Check out the curl you created. If you want a more defined curl, repeat the process for another thirty seconds. You can also use this method to curl your bottom lashes.
Do the same to the lashes on your other eye. You may need to warm up the spoon again before starting.
 Using either clear or black mascara will help the curl stay in place for the rest of the day.
 Use an eyelash comb to separate and define your lashes. Don't comb too much, or you'll lose the curl.,

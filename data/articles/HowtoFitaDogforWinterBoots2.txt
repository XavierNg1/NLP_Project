 There is no standard for setting the size of dog boots. Some companies measure from the heel of the pad to the tip of the toe, while others include the length of the toenail as well. Other companies use the weight of the dog to gauge the size of the boot/foot. Check to see how the manufacturer you’re interested in sizes its product., Some manufacturers offer printable measuring charts on their websites. You just need to print the charts at 100 percent and then align your dog’s foot next to the measurements. Then, you know the size to order.


This would be particularly useful if the website you’re ordering from does not offer a return policy.
 Some brands consistently run large or small, which is usually noted in the reviews. Having this information handy will help you make a better selection for your dog once you’ve made your measurements.

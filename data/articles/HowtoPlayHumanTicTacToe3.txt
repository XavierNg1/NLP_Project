 For this variation, you’ll need to have four players per team. Select one team as X’s by a coin toss or by having teams play rock, paper, scissors. The team that wins goes first as the X’s.


Teams should alternate back and forth, with X’s taking the first move. Each move, a single player stands on an unoccupied square on the board.
While occupying a square, X’s must do jumping jacks. O’s must do sit ups while occupying their squares.
Players must continue performing their action while occupying a square on the gameboard. The game ends when one team gets three squares in a row or the game ends in a tie.
Feel free to use different exercises for X’s and O’s while they occupy their squares. Basic exercises, like pushups, burpees, flutter kicks, and so on, work well.
 Place starting markers on opposite sides of the board. Each marker should be an equal distance from the game board. Then:


Require players to spin a hula hoop 10 times around their waist on their way to the game board.
Place tires between the starting mark and the game board. Players should step into the centers of the tires on their way to the game board.
Set an obstacle for players to jump over on their way to the game board, like a tall, sturdy box, a hurdle, and so on.
Require players to perform an activity, like jumping rope, playing hopscotch, shooting a basket in a toy hoop, and so on, before they can proceed to the game board.
 Set a marker for each team on opposite sides of the gameboard, with each marker an equal distance away from the game board. Teams alternate turns. Each turn, one player attempts to capture a square for their team by tossing a bean bag from behind the marker into an unoccupied square.


When a player misses a shot or throws a bean bag onto an occupied square, that player forfeits their turn to the opposing team.

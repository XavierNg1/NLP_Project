Create a super strength potion. For this, you will need a kwuarm herb, limpwurt root, and a vial of water.






Collect a dwarf weed herb. Invest in clean dwarf weed for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy dwarf weeds are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
 This will create a three dose extreme strength potion.


Be sure to click on the herb first, then the potion. Clicking on the potion first will accidentally consume a dose.

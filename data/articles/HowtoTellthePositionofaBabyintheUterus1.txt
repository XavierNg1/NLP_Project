 It might be fun to be able to look back at all the different positions your baby was in during your pregnancy. Keep a diary, journal, or notebook to document this. Write down the date, how far along in your pregnancy you are, and what position your baby is in any time you get the chance.
 Though it’s not an exact science, you may be able to locate your baby’s head or bottom just by feeling your stomach. Press gently, and try to relax while you do it – press down while you exhale. A hard, round bump like a small bowling ball is probably the baby’s head; a round but somewhat softer bump may be their bottom. Use some of these standard guidelines to estimate your baby’s position:Do you have a lump on the right or left side of your belly? Press it gently – if the whole baby moves, they might be in a head-down (cephalic) position.
Feeling a hard, rounded lump beneath your ribs might be the baby’s head, meaning they’re in breech (head up) position.
If the two round, hard areas (the head and bottom) are at the sides of your belly, your baby may be lying horizontally. Babies usually move themselves out of this position by 8 months., Babies kick, and it can be one of the easiest ways to visualize how they’re oriented in your uterus. If you feel kicking above your belly button, the baby is probably in a head down position. If the kicking is below your belly button, the baby is probably head up. Just visualize where the baby's feet and legs might be based on where you feel kicking.If you feel kicking around the front middle of your belly, the baby may be in a posterior position – head down with their back to your back. Your stomach may also look more flattened than rounded in this position.

 Place a mattress, strong board, or anything that is as tall as your bunk bed on one side of the bunk bed. If your bunkbed is in the corner, then you only need to make one wall. If not, then on the opposite side of the bunkbed, place another board or mattress or, if you have a nearby piece of furniture, move it to the opposite side of the board.;
, Find a large sheet or a blanket and drape it over the bunkbed and walls of the clubhouse. Drape it so that it hangs down the front of the bunkbed, where the opening is.
 Take a chair and place it under the blanket near where you want your entrance to be. This way there is a small hole where you can enter the lower bed of the bunkbed, and inside, you'll be surrounded by the sheet or blanket and the walls you made.
 Maybe include a lamp for light, or something that serves a table.

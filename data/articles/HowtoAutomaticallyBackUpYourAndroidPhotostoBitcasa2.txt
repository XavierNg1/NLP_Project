 Locate the Bitcasa app on your Android device. It’s the app with a green background with a house on a cloud drawing. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap the “Log In” button found at the bottom of the screen. You will be brought to the Login screen. Enter your Bitcasa email address and password, then tap the “Log In” button.
 From Bitcasa’s main screen, tap the “Settings” button on your Android device. You will be brought to the Settings screen.
 One of the settings here is for “Automatic Camera Backup.” Toggle or enable this option. Make sure the setting is turned “ON.”

, After enabling “Automatic Camera Backup,” you can also upload all existing pictures and videos from your Android device. Tap the tick box for “Also upload existing pictures & videos” on the window that will appear, and then tap the “OK” button to proceed.
 The next setting is for “Only Upload on Wi-Fi.” Toggle or enable this option if you want Bitcasa to only upload your pictures and videos when you’re connected to Wi-Fi.


If you leave this option turned “OFF,” Bitcasa will use your cellular data plan, which will probably cost you money.
 Once done, tap the back button on your Android device to go back to the main screen.

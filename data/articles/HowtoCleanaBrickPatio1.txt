 Call a local hardware store or cleaning equipment rental company for prices on pressure washer rentals, which can range from $50 to $250 a day, depending on the machine model and where you live. Ask a store employee to recommend a model that will work best on your brick patio. If you have the money to invest, consider buying your own pressure washer.Opt for a gasoline-powered pressure washer over an electric model, which will mean dealing with electrical connections that need to be kept dry and out of the way during cleaning.;
, Always wear old clothes when using a pressure washer, as rocks or debris from the surface of your patio may be propelled upwards by a stream of water when cleaning. Anticipate getting wet during the cleaning process and dress accordingly, in old clothing that you donâ€™t mind getting soaked. Wear shoes with good grip (i.e. rubber soles) to avoid slipping during the cleaning process., Connect a garden hose between your water source and the high pressure hose on the pressure washer. Attach the nozzle securely. Squeeze the trigger on the gun of the machine to release excess air, then turn on the water.Most pressure washers come with multiple nozzle attachments.
 Point the gun of the pressure washer towards a discreet corner of the patio and turn on the machine engine. Spray a quick test stream to gauge the water pressure, and to see if it is strong enough to cause any damage to your patio.Always test the least powerful nozzle first, then move to a stronger nozzle if you wish.

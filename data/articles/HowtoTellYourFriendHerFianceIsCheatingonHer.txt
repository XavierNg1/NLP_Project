 Go for a cheerful/comedy one, and try to avoid romantic ones. If you know her what favorite movie is, why not watch it together?;
, Try to have as much tact as possible since this is an extremely delicate subject. You know your friend very well, so try to avoid anything that may discomfort her even more: like trying to lighten the atmosphere with a joke, or being too negative, etc, it all depends on how you know your friend will react.
 Tell her she is too good for him, try to make her see how wonderful of a person she is and that nobody like that deserves her tears. And most of all, make her see it wasn't her fault. Nobody should be blamed but the cheater. Don't let her take the blame and remind her that if there was a problem he could have very well talked it out instead of doing what he did.
 It is very hard to forgive being cheated on, but with a little gentle help everyone can do it in time. Don't push her to forget immediately and talk her out of revenge (and of course don't give her any ideas).
 She has her reasons, and even if you don't approve you're her friend after all, not her mother. Respect her decisions and be there for her.
 If you know what her favorite food is then go ahead and cook it for her. Things we like trigger endorphins which make us feel better, and her feeling better will help her cope better.
 Sometimes having his things around helps her cope with the process of accepting, sometimes it helps her see things she didn't see before. Give her time to get rid of everything, and help her through the process. Being gentle and patient is a must.

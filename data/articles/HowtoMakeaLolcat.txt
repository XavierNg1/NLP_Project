, Remember that spelling/grammatical errors are deliberate. This "language" is sometimes called lolspeak, kitteh or kitty pidgin. You may be able to find some translators online.Try these caption templates (replace the blanks with your desired noun/verb):
"IM IN UR ___, ___-ING UR ___"
"IT ARE ___, I HAS IT"
"OH NOES! MAH ___ IT ARE ___!"



, Put a caption describing what is the 'invisible object'. A good (existing) example would be "invisible bike."

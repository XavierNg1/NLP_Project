 As with the console, give yourself access to your charger’s ports for a more thorough clean. Unplug its charger cable. Do the same with your headphones if you have a pair of those plugged in, too., Again, as with the console, start by removing as much dust as you can with your compressed air. Focus on the creases between the controller’s body and each button, pad, and analog stick, as well as any other gaps where dust may find its way into the controller’s interior. Be sure to give the ports for your cables a few short bursts, too.
 Unlike the console, your controller is held in your hands all the time, so you may need to clean more than dust off of it. Still, start off by wiping it down with a dry microfiber cloth. See how well that works on its own before using a damp one.
 If a dry cloth wasn't tough enough to get rid of any stubborn grime, use a wet-wipe or dampen the corner of a clean cloth. First, wring out as much moisture as possible so it isn’t dripping all over the place. Then, as you wipe the controller, be sure to avoid wiping near the charger port and headphone jack so moisture doesn't leak inside. Finally, let the controller dry completely before plugging it back in.

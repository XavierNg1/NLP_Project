 Lie down on the floor with your knees bent and your hands clasped behind your head. Flatten your back and clench your abs. Raise your toes up so that your heels press down into the ground and you feel your upper thigh muscles working. Then, bring your head and shoulders up towards your hips as you would for a traditional crunch. Using primarily your abdominal, hold yourself up in this position for a few seconds. Then, slowly lower back down to the starting position.
 Sit down on the ball with your legs in front of you, knees bend and feet on the ground. Then, walk yourself forward so that your back is leaning against the exercise ball rather than perpendicular to it. This is similar to the starting position of exercise ball curls. Then, tense your abdominal muscles while you bring your torso towards your knees. Keep your feet planted firmly; try not let any muscle below your hips move. Then, slowly move back and arch your back over the ball so that your head moves closer to the floor.
 Lie on your back with your hands behind your head. Cross your legs at the ankles and raise them in the air so that they're almost all the way extended. Then, contract your abdominal and lift your torso up towards your knees. Be sure to keep your chin off your chest. Slowly return to the start position as you inhale.
 To do the plank, get down on your hands and knees. Extend your legs out behind you so that your toes are together and touching the floor. Then, rest on your forearms so that your elbows are bent at a 90Ëš angle directly below your shoulders. Hold for as long as possible. Ideally, you'll be able to hold for at least 1 to 2 minutes, but you can break it up into sets of 15 to 30 seconds if needed.

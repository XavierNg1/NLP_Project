 Use the simple box recipe and pour into mini-cupcake molds before baking. Adjust the cooking time accordingly. The cupcakes need to be small enough to fit the kabob stick without being unwieldy.


When making the batter, add any food coloring you'd like. This tutorial's cupcakes are blue but you can make yours any color.;
, Use store-bought or homemade frosting, as preferred. Dip your cupcake in the frosting, turning it so it comes out with a tiny point at the top. Dip it the exact same way in a shallow bowl of sprinkles. Be modest with the amount of sprinkles added, to create a cleaner look.


It's always good to heat up any store-bought frosting for about 15 seconds in the microwave to get it a little more liquids in order for the sprinkles to stay.
If you prefer, pipe the icing onto the cupcakes rather than dipping them.
 The water will work as an adhesive for the sprinkles. Do this on both sides.
 As you can see here, different colors have been added to each end of the marshmallow for the best effect.
, Slide on the cupcakes, fruit pieces and marshmallows in any order you choose. Go crazy or follow a pre-designed pattern. Either way, the end result will look delicious!

, Adjust if needed (for example, if it feels too top heavy, rearrange the pieces a little). Use this to inform the addition of the food pieces for the remaining cupcake kabobs.
 Here, a Fourth of July themed plate has been used to serve as a complementary background. Enjoy!

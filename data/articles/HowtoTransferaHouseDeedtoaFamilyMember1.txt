 With a quitclaim deed, you literally quit whatever claim you have to the property -- hence the name -- and transfer it to someone else.


Quitclaim deeds are the most common way to transfer property among family members when money doesn’t change hands, or gift property to someone.
With a quitclaim deed, there is no risk that you might be sued by your family member or a future buyer if it turns out there’s something wrong with the deed and you didn’t have full ownership of the house, because a quitclaim deed only transfers whatever claim of ownership you have. It doesn’t guarantee that you have any particular claim.;
, A quitclaim deed has blanks for your name and the name of the family member to whom you’re transferring your home.


You also have to enter the legal description of your home. You can use the description contained in your original deed if you have access to that, or use government plats or the street address. Since it’s a quitclaim deed, the description doesn’t have to be as specific as it would be otherwise. It just has to relate back to your original deed.
The form also will have blanks for signatures, but you shouldn’t sign the form until you are in the presence of a notary.
 In some states, the family member to whom you’re transferring your house deed must also sign. Some states also require additional witnesses beyond just a notary., Once you sign the deed making the transfer, it needs to go to the person who now owns the property.


If the family member to whom you transferred your house wasn’t with you when you signed the deed, you can take it to them or mail it.
Using certified mail or similar service ensures you know when they’ve received it.
 After you’ve made the transfer, it’s the responsibility of the person to whom you transferred your house to record the deed at the county recorder’s office. Otherwise it won’t become part of the legal record of the property and could cause problems later on.

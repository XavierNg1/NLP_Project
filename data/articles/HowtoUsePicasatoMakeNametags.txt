 Click on the images if you need a bigger view, as some of them contain small details relevant to this tutorial.
 For this tutorial I will be using the Windows version, but the Mac one is pretty similar. Picasa is a free photo managing program from Google and can be found at https://www.google.com/picasa/.
 It will ask you a few questions/options, just choose what you want. Once you're finished and have Picasa ready to go, on the top bar go to "File" then choose "Add Folder To Picasa...".
 Click the "OK" button.
 Find the new folder you added in the lower left corner of Picasa and click it. Your pictures should be brought into view.
, At the bottom of the picture there should be a bar that says "Make a caption!". If there isn't, click the little grey square in the bottom left of the viewing are to bring it up. Click on the bar and then type in the first person's name.
 Then, press the right arrow to continue to the next picture. Continue the process until no un-captioned photos remain.
, You can do this by right clicking the folder containing the now captioned photos, or by manually using Ctrl or Shift to select individual pictures.
,, Cropping is probably the best idea.
 Choose the "Caption" option for text. The rest is your preference to play around with (font and size, etc.). It looks nice to add a border. You can also choose where the text is placed. Press "OK".
 Press the "Print" button once you're ready. Now just wait for the tags to print out!

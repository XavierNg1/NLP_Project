 A Slingshot can be bought from the store for 500 Bells. Much like your other base tools, two of them are available for purchase every day at a random order., When the clock has a time ending in 4 (4:44, 11:14, 8: 04, etc.), a Balloon carrying a present will drift from the edges of town. You can shoot it down with your slingshot, though you may have to chase it a bit. You’ll have to pop at least 14 of these, so better get used to chasing.

If you chase it into the top of the town cliffs by the beach, you can pop them with any tool on hand, since they drift very closely to your character.
If you pop the balloon over water or flowers, the present is destroyed and you get nothing. This is because there isn’t any space for the present to land in. The present may also be destroyed when the balloon is popped over a 3x3 pattern.
 After you pop your 14th Balloon, sometimes a toolbox will be tied to a Balloon instead of a present. If you shoot the toolbox down, you have a chance of getting either a Silver Slingshot or a Gold Slingshot. The Silver one shoots 2 rocks at once, while the Gold shoots 3.

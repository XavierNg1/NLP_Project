 Doing math calculations or problems in your head helps to activate your brain cortex and blocks the inhibiting impulses going from your brain to your bladder.You can choose fairly simple math calculations, such as the times table, starting from 1x1 = 1, 1x2 = 2, or the additions table, starting from 2+2 = 4, 2+3 = 5.
You can also try more complex math problems, such as long division math problems or trying to solve complex mathematical equations, if you know any of them by heart. You can also look up equations on your smartphone if you are sitting down in the washroom stall.
 If you have access to games on your smartphone, you may find it helpful to distract yourself by playing your favorite games while you are in the washroom stall. This will allow you to focus on the game, rather than your discomfort or embarrassment.Keep in mind your phone will likely pick up germs if you take it out and touch it in the bathroom stall. So, always clean your phone after you have used it in the bathroom.
 This could be an article from the newspaper or from a magazine. Or, you could pull up reading material on your phone. Reading can act as a useful distraction while you use the public washroom.
 Bad smells in the bathroom can be an unwelcoming distraction for some. You can try to mask bad smells in the stall or the urinal by bringing in a small bottle of air freshener with you. You can then use it to freshen up the stall before or after you use it.You may also want to bring in other hygiene products like hand sanitizer to make you feel as though you are not picking up any germs while you are using the washroom.
There are currently products on the market that can be sprayed in the toilet after you use the washroom to mask the smell. Carry a small bottle of this product in your bag so you can feel less anxious about any bad smells when you are in the washroom.

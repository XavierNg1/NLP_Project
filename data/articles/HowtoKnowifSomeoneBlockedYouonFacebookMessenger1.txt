 Look for the blue chat bubble icon containing a white lightning bolt. It should be on your home screen, or in the app drawer if you’re using an Android.


Blocking your messages is not the same as blocking you on Facebook. When a person blocks your messages, you’ll remain friends with them on Facebook and will be able to interact on one another’s timelines. They can also unblock you at any time.;
, It’s at the top of the screen. A list of names that match what you’ve typed will appear.
 This opens a chat with that person.
 It’s at the bottom of the chat.
 It looks like a paper airplane. If you see a pop-up message that says, “This person isn’t available right now,” this person has either blocked your messages, deactivated their Facebook account, or completely blocked you on Facebook.If the message goes through without error, your messages are arriving to their destination. It’s possible that the person just hasn’t logged into to read them.
 If you received the error message, your final step is to figure out if their profile looks any different in the Facebook app.


Open Facebook (the blue icon with a white “f” on your home screen), then search for their name. If you can’t find their profile, they’ve either deactivated their account or blocked you completely. If their profile appears normal, they’ve only blocked your messages.
If you can’t find the profile at all, there’s only one way to find out if you’ve been completely blocked—ask a mutual friend to view their profile. If the mutual friend can see the profile but you can’t, your entire Facebook account has been blocked by the user.

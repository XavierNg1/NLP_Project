,, Make sure that each row and each column has both a black and a red ace. For example: if the top row (left to right) is Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds, then the bottom row (left to right) would be Ace of Hearts, Ace of Clubs.
 Using your "off" hand (ie, left hand if you're right-handed,) fan one half of the deck of cards so that you can see the face of the cards, while the volunteers see the backing. Leave the other half of the deck alone.
 Tell them to tell you the first color that pops into their minds.
 Select any black card from your fanned hand and hold it (facing you) in front of your forehead. Make a show of "projecting" the color by squinting, glaring, etc. When the volunteer says either "Red" or "Black", lay the card face down on the corresponding ace in the top row. Place the face down card horizontally, so that the ace and the face down pile make a cross. Continue "showing" black cards to the first volunteer in this manner until you have run out and are holding only red cards in your fan.
 To show that this isn't a trick and I have pre-arranged, I'll move on to .
, The cards in the left hand column match the ace colors, while those in the right hand column do not.
 Instruct them to verify that the color is correct, and to share with each other so that they can both see.
, At this point, your pile consists of red cards (face down,) black ace (face up,) black cards (face down) and red ace (face up.) Move the red ace from the bottom of the pile to the top, and split the pile apart. Now, repeat step 10 -- the colors are now correct.

 If you don't look good in a pencil skirt and pumps, then don't wear them.;
, Both in make-up and in clothing, a little bright color goes a long way, and if you use too much it will look over-done and garish.
 Having one great black dress is much better than having a lot of cheesy, over-colored trendy dresses.
 Essentials are a good LBD (little black dress), some quality jeans, both in black and blue wash, a pair of reasonably comfortable and fashionable black (and neutral, if you like them) pumps, a quality tailored coat in black, white, or grey, a good string of pearls, and a sturdy handbag in a quiet and classy shade (think something you could use for work as well as other occasions).
 Deep, jewel-toned colors such forest green, scarlet, and royal blue are absolutely perfect for a classic style. Bright or neon colors are trendy and fun, but you should not waste a lot of money on accessories in these shades.
 Use just one major accessory, rather than three or four. Using too many accessories or patterns will make you look over-dressed and garish. Buy a few good quality pieces of gold or silver jewellery to go with everything.
 In order to be classic with your style, you must be polite and respectable. Acting properly will get you a long way in life.

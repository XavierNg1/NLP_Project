 Twice a day, scrub the ingrown hair gently. This will help to remove any dead skin cells, dirt, and oils that might be trapping the ingrown hair. It may also physically nudge the tip of the hair out of your skin. Try to hit the ingrown hair from a variety of directions. Use an exfoliating glove or ingrown hair brush, and try one of the following exfoliating techniques:


Exfoliate your legs with salt
Exfoliate your skin with olive oil and sugar

, You'll need to exfoliate enough to achieve this effect, but not so much that the area surrounding the ingrown hair starts to bleed.


When in doubt, exfoliate more gently but for a longer period.
Note! It's very difficult to remove an ingrown hair from under a scab. In this case, it might be best to use a different method, or consult your doctor.

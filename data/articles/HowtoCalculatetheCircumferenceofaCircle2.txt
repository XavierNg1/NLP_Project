 The formula is simply this: C = πd. In this equation, "C" represents the circumference of the circle, and "d" represents its diameter. That is to say, you can find the circumference of a circle just by multiplying the diameter by pi. Plugging π into your calculator will give you its numerical value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14.


Example problem: You have a circle tub with a diameter of 8 feet, and you want to build a white fence that creates a 6-foot wide space around the tub. To find the circumference of the fence that has to be created, you should first find the diameter of the tub and the fence which will be 8 feet + 6 feet + 6 feet, which will account for the entire diameter of the tub and fence. The diameter is 8 + 6 + 6, or 20 feet. Now plug it into the formula, plug π into your calculator for its numerical value, and solve for the circumference:






C = πd
C = π x 20
C = 62.8 feet

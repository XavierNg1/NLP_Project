Fold pant tops down again approximately 1” and press.
Pin all the way around the waist and leave an opening on each side that is around 3” (so you can add the elastic).
 Remove pins as you add stitches. Stop at the opening.
 Add an extra three or four inches to be on the safe side.









Place a large safety pin at the end of the elastic. The pin will act as your guide to push the elastic around the inside.










Push the elastic through, pin side first so it circles the inside of the waistband and comes out the other end.
Sew ends together and then trim off the excess elastic. Sew the open part of the pants together.
 Fold the ends upward and inside the legs to the desired length. Pin and then sew ends closed.

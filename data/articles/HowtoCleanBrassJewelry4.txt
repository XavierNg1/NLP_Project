 Mix 2 tablespoons (60 ml) of salt and 2 tablespoons (60 ml) of white vinegar into 1 pint (500 ml) of steaming hot water.
 Use a clean, soft rag, or a soft bristled toothbrush.
 Gently rub the tarnished brass with the rag or toothbrush. Continue rubbing until you notice the tarnish fading, but rub gently to prevent yourself from breaking chain links or other delicate parts of your jewelry.
 You may need to let the jewelry air dry, depending on how wet the jewelry got.

 It could be jungle, girly, surfer, or anything that your heart desires! If you don't want to base your room on a theme, base it on some colors you like. Find the colors that fit you, then purchase paint you like and paint the walls.;
, For example, if you have a red bean bag chair, you may not want it in a blue-and-white room. Go through all of your furniture and decide what will work, and what you will need to remove. Later, go through what you will remove and see if it will work in another room. If not, ask a friend, or donate it to Goodwill-type stores, or even charity. Donation bins are located outside most grocery stores.
 Decide if you really need more furniture. Do you really need three chairs? Or can you just add more pillows to your bed to turn it into a sitting area during the day? If you decide you want more furniture, find things with shelves and drawers built-in, so you can leave floor space. Some great things to buy for a new room are bean bag chairs that go with the color combination, white picture frames you can paint, rugs (If you have hard wood floors), and mirrors that have a frame that go with the color combination, etc.
 After your walls are dry, its time to move everything back in. Rearrange your room however you like, but make sure it is not too crowded. You may want to add some finishing touches such as pictures, mirrors, and posters.
 Remember to keep it clean. There is no point in revamping your room if nobody can see it! Make a place for everything, don't just put it in a drawer and say that you will just clean it up later! If you set time aside to tidy you room up for five minutes each night, it is much easier to manage than a large mess you must tackle all day.

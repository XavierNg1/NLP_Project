 Is it hard? Pointed? Long? Heavy? Flexible? Easy to conceal? All of these properties can be useful in a fight.


Most long objects can be handled like a club or staff; they can be used for slashing and stabbing, or for blocking and parrying attacks. When fighting, aim for the pressure points: back of neck, the back, the throat and in between the eyes.






Any small, hard object that you can grip firmly can be used for strike attacks. The impact of a hard object will always do more damage than that of an empty fist. Bonus for pointed objects.






Short pointed objects like pencils or ballpoint pens can be used for stabbing.






Small, heavy objects can be thrown.






Some small objects you can hold in your fist to strengthen your punch.






Flexible objects, like ropes, towels, or clothes can be used in a number of ways. For the following applications you need to grip it firmly with one hand at each end (or opposite corners for towels and the like).






Defensively, you can use it to block an attack, and ensnare the opponent's fist, foot or weapon in the process by wrapping your object around it. Use this to disarm your opponent, break his balance, or gain leverage.
Offensively, you can use it to strangle your opponent, blindfold him, or pull his feet from under him.

, Since no two objects are the same, no two objects have the same advantages, disadvantages and applications.

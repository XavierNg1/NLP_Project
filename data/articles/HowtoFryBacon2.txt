 You can give your bacon an extra burst of flavor by rubbing a combination of spices onto it. Make sure that the bacon is room temperature before adding the spices. Let the spices sit on the bacon for a few minutes before frying it.Here are some combinations:


1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon apple or pumpkin pie spice.1 teaspoon brown sugar, ¼ teaspoon of cracked pepper.1 tablespoon of granulated garlic and 1 tablespoon of paprika.1 ½ tablespoons of dark brown sugar., Put some bacon in a dish and cover it with a sauce, salad dressing, or syrup of your choosing. Make sure that both sides of the bacon are coated. Let the bowl sit in the fridge for thirty minutes, then fry as usual. Consider marinating the bacon with any of the following:1 cup pineapple juice plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce
Italian salad dressing
Molasses
Teriyaki sauce
Maple syrup. Thinner, Vermont-style maple syrup works best.Note that sweet sauces and dressings will caramelize when you fry the bacon. This will result in some stickiness and messiness.
 While not quite seasoning or marinating, it is possible to combine the two best breakfast foods: bacon and pancakes. Prepare some pancake batter and fry some bacon. Take the bacon out of the skillet or frying pan, set it on some paper towels, and pour out the grease.Place the bacon back onto the skillet or pan, leaving two inches of space between each slice. Pour the batter along each slice of bacon and let it cook until the batter starts to turn bubbly (about one to two minutes). Flip the bacon pancake over, and let it cook until the bottom turns golden (about two minutes).

 With the help of a seal pick, remove the older O-ring. Also, you need to remove the remains and debris of the older seal and clean the system thoroughly., With the help of a paper or clean cloth, remove any settled dirt of dust from the new O-ring. Once it is completely clean, apply oil on the O-ring so that it becomes moist and easy to install., Gently push the O-ring against the groove/ fitting of the hydraulic cylinder and press it firmly. Make sure that the ring is seated against the back of the fitting perfectly., Once the O-ring is firmly installed, wipe out the excessive oil in order to avoid accumulation of dirt in the greasy surroundings of the ring in the hydraulic cylinder., As per the instructions pertaining to each component of the fittings given in the manual, install them one by one. Fix the fittings in their corresponding places as per the torque specified in the manual., Clean the O-ring surroundings and remove the remaining parts of the older back-up ring., Similar to the O-ring, the new back-up ring has to be wiped cleaned in order to get rid of any settled dust particles. Then moisten the ring with the help of lubricating hydraulic oil., Install the back-up ring around the threads by slipping it back gently and fixing it in its place against the fittings. Make sure that the excessive hydraulic oil is removed., When the hydraulic seal is installed completely, clean the hydraulic system/ cylinder and check the intactness of the seal. Once you are sure of the working condition of the system, place it back to its original place.

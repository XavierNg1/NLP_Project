 Next time you buy green onions to use in a recipe, save the white part with roots and eat only the greens. You can grow more green onions using only the leftover roots - and next time you want to add flavor to a dish, you'll have your own home-grown green onions on hand.


Any green onions bulbs will work, but you might have the best luck if you use green onions that were grown nearby. That way you know they'll grow well in your climate. Try starting with green onions you bought at the farmer's market, since they were probably grown in your region.
 Any type of clean glass jar will do. Just make sure the glass is clear, and not tinted, so that the sun's rays can easily reach the onions inside. Put in as many green onion rots as you'd like - just make sure the roots are facing down, so that the greens grow up and out of the jar.
 Pour in enough water to cover the bulbs entirely. Set the jar in a sunny window and wait for the magic to happen. Within a few days, you should see the roots starting to get longer. Tiny green shoots will emerge from the bulbs and begin growing upward. Keep the jar filled with enough water to cover the white part of the onions.
 Once they're 4 to 6 inches long, they're ready to harvest. Remove a green onion from the jar and chop off as much as you want - or use the whole thing. If you just need a handful of chopped scallion, you can return the bulb and roots to the jar to continue growing. You should be able to harvest the same onions two to three times before they stop growing.If you want to continue growing onions year round, then put some rocks and pebbles in the bottom of the jar. Then, place soil over the rocks and pebbles and plant the bulbs in the soil.

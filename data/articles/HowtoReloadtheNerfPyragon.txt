 If you've been doing a lot of shooting, you'll find the ammunition scattered on the ground, they do ricochet off of things so they might be pretty far.;
, If the barrel doesn't come out, hit the barrel back in, push the pump in or out (depending on which way works) and try again.
 (There will be a bit less than a centimetre there).
 This will switch all the ammunition you added to one of four chambers. Each chamber houses about 10 pieces of ammunition.
, Do not force the barrel on to the gun, this might brake it.
 What are you waiting for? To shoot once, simply pull the handle back and then push it forward. To shoot rapidly, pull the handle back and then push it forward repeatedly and fast.

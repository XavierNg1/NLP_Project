 Avoid waiting until the last minute to invite friends and family. They might have made other plans for the day and won’t be able to make it.


If you are mailing your invites, send them at least 4 weeks in advance to allow for potential delivery delays.
Alternatively, you can send free electronic invitations through an online site like Evite.Electronic invites are great when time is running out because they’ll arrive almost immediately!;
, Make sure your guests will be comfortable by cleaning your home and completing any necessary yard work a few days prior to the party.
 Depending on how many people you’ve invited to your Fourth of July celebration, you might need more seating or tables. Save some money and borrow what you can from friends or neighbors.Lawn chairs and folding tables work great both inside and outdoors.
You can also encourage your guests to bring picnic blankets to sit on outside.
 Make plans ahead of time to move the party indoors in case the weather turns bad on the Fourth of July.


Push furniture against the walls, if needed, to create more space for guests to mingle inside.
Choose an alternate cooking method for any food that would have been grilled outside. Indoor griddles or grill pans are one option.
Plan to watch a televised fireworks display if rain or thunderstorms prevent you from doing your own fireworks or attending another live show.

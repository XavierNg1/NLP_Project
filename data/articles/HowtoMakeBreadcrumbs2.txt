 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Get out a large, rimmed baking sheet and spread 2 cups (100 g) of fresh breadcrumbs on it., Put the sheet in the preheated oven and bake the breadcrumbs until they become golden brown and dry. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. Leave the breadcrumbs to cool completely before you use them.If your oven has a hot spot, you might want to stir the breadcrumbs halfway through the cooking time.
 You can add a little extra flavor to your toasted breadcrumbs. Just stir in 1 tablespoon (14 g) of extra-virgin olive oil and toss it with a seasoning like:Lemon zest
Minced fresh herbs
Crushed red pepper flakes
Grated Parmesan cheese
Dried herbs (like Italian seasoning)

, Dry breadcrumbs give a great crunch and texture to foods. Try sprinkling them over pasta, roasted vegetables, or thick soups. You can also coat foods with the breadcrumbs before you saute them for extra crispiness.Store leftover dry breadcrumbs in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.

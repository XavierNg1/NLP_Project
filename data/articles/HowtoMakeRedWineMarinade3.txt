 Most thin cuts of meat, seafood, and tofu are ready to marinate. But if you have a thick cut of meat, like a large steak, you may want to tenderize it so it soaks up more of the marinade. If the meat is over one-inch (2.5 cm) thick, use a sharp knife or jaccard meat tenderizer to poke holes in the meat.The meat tenderizer does the best job of preparing the meat for marinating. Only use it if the meat is thick since thin cuts will do a fine job of absorbing the marinade.
 Place your meat, seafood, tofu or vegetables into a large, sealable freezer bag. Pour the red wine marinade into the bag and carefully press out as much air as you can. Zip the freezer bag shut so it's completely sealed. Press the bag to incorporate the food and the marinade.


Consider setting the bag of marinating food in a baking dish. This way, if there are any leaks, the dish will catch the mess.
 Marinating times will vary depending on what food you're preparing. Small or thin foods (like salmon or shellfish) only need to marinate between 5 and 30 minutes. Larger cuts of meat (like stew meat, chicken, or pork chops) will need to marinate between 1 to 3 hours.Big cuts (like rack of lamb or ribs) should marinate overnight.
 Take the food out of the refrigerator and let it set out until the marinade is at room temperature. Only let the food sit out for up to 20 minutes before you cook it. You can cook the food in the marinade or remove it to cook the food separately.For example, try cooking the chicken in a rosemary red wine marinade along with potatoes.
Avoid cooking the food and serving it with the raw marinade. If you want to serve the marinade on the side, bring it to a boil in a small saucepan before serving it.

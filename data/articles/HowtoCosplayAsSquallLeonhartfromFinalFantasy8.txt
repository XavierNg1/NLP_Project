, The jacket comes down to about his ribcage. It's sort of like a bomber jacket, except it's a half-jacket.
 For the fur, it is best to find fake fur at a store. It should be glued on to a piece of black leather long enough to fit around the neck of the jacket. Sew this piece onto the jacket and the fur-collar is finished.


, Yeah, they sell them online, but avoid the "real silver" ones because they can be really expensive.
 These are optional.
 If you need a belt, don't hesitate to get one.
 One belt has a light brown/red tint and silver buttons on the front. The other is a plain black belt with silver buttons. The black belt should be slightly larger.
 To make these, find three regular belts and cut each part in half. These can be sewn on or glued on with hot glue.
, If you think of Cloud's hair, Squall's is similar, except it's not going in every direction. You can find tons of wigs online, or if you have long brown hair, grow it out to about chin-length and keep it straightened. You can style it by looking at the reference pictures of Squall.
 Red paint should do the trick. Use a small paintbrush, and have someone paint it on for you.
 The actual blade has a distinct shape to it. The handle is a revolver, so finding a fake gun is the best idea. To make the blade, find some wood, and cut it in the shape of the blade. Alternatively, I used one single block of wood as the inner part of the sword, then used cardboard to create the blade's shape around it. Attach the blade to the revolver using hot glue or Gorilla glue, which can get messy. Don't apply too much of the Gorilla glue if you choose to use it.

 You probably want 2 sets of 2 speakers. Get ones with two speakers in each box, and make sure they are 4-6 inch speakers.;
, Specially, position them where the party will be facing them most of the time.
 For large parties, try a Sony Xplod 12" Subwoofer, or a Kenwood 12" KFC W3005 Subwoofer. If necessary, get 2 of them.
 Have the port under the sub. Place the subwoofer in between the speakers.

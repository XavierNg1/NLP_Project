 If you are inviting a married couple, tradition dictates that you write “Mr. and Mrs.” followed by the husband’s name. However, if the couple does not have the same last name, you should include both of their names. If you are addressing an invitation to a married same-sex couple, you should include both of their names as well.For example, you could write “Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Smith,” “Mr. Stanley Smith and Mrs. Emma Stone,” or “Mrs. Julia Gould and Mrs. Elizabeth Gould.”

, If any of your guests have distinguished titles - like “Dr." - you should be sure to use them. If one member of a couple has a distinguished title, use that title and then "Mr." or "Mrs." or "Ms." for the other member of the couple.For example, you could write “Dr. Stephanie and Mr. James Smith” if they have the same last name, “Dr. Stephanie Jones and Mr. James Smith” if they have different last names or “Dr. Stephanie Jones and Dr. James Smith” if they have different last names but both have distinguished titles.
 Unless they live with their parents, any adult over the age of 18 should receive their own invitation. You can use “Ms.” or “Mr.” in the addresses if they are single., If you wish to invite an entire family to your event, whether the children are over 18 or not, you can simply write “The Smith Family” and include their address. This lets the recipient know that everyone in the household is invited.

 Smoking lowers good cholesterol and increases the risk of heart disease. It damages your circulatory system and increases plaque buildup in your arteries. Both of these put you at greater risk of a heart attack or blood clot., If you get the okay from your doctor, exercise for at least 30 minutes every day. Additionally, try to be more active and less sedentary throughout your day. Regular exercise increases HDL levels and decreases LDL levels.Even simple exercises such as walking or stretching can help. If you don’t have time for 30 minutes straight, squeeze in 10 minute intervals.
Losing weight through diet and exercise is also beneficial: trimming even 5 – 10% of your body weight will lower your bad cholesterol levels and put less stress on your heart.Remember to talk to your doctor first to make sure daily exercise is recommended.
 Lowering your alcohol intake is recommended for those at risk for cardiovascular disease or who have high LDL levels. While there’s evidence that moderate drinking can improve HDL levels, or good cholesterol, the evidence doesn’t support starting to drink if you don’t already do so. Limit consumption to one drink a day for women, and two drinks per day for men.

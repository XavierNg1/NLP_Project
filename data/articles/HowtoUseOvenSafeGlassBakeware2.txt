 Your glass bakeware can be used for storing food as well as cooking food. The dish can be stored in the freezer or refrigerator. For example, if you bake a lasagna using your glass bakeware and want to freeze it for later you can keep the lasagna in the glass bakeware and seal it with the plastic lid before placing in the freezer., If you decide to use your glass bakeware to store food in the freezer you need to make sure that you fully thaw the dish before re-heating in the oven or microwave. Failure to thaw the dish could result in thermal shock which may crack or break the dish.
 Many glass bakeware dishes will come with a plastic lid. These lids are not to be used in conventional ovens. Instead, they can be used for storing food in the freezer or refrigerator or when heating food in the microwave. Read the directions before placing plastic lids in the microwave or dishwasher.


If you need to cover food while it cooks in the oven, use tinfoil.

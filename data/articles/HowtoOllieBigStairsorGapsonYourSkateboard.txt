 You don't want the spot you're doing to have too many cracks or too much security there.;
, A few run-ups are fine, but not too many. If you do hesitate before you Ollie, it could be extremely painful (depending on the size of the set/gap).
 It's better to go fast than slow with bigger gaps and sets.
 Pop a good Ollie while you're going at a decent speed.
 It may feel like the longest time you've ever spent in your life in the air on your skateboard, so don't freak out.
 When you are about to hit the ground extend your legs a little bit.
 If done right, it won't hurt.
 Your friends will be impressed if you can do big stuff and they can't.

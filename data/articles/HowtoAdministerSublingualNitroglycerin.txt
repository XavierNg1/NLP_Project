The person taking sublingual nitroglycerin should be in an upright, comfortable seated position. This is important for ensuring proper administration of the dose, preventing accidental swallowing of the medication and helping blood pump through the heart.;

Administer sublingual nitroglycerin while trying to keep the person experiencing the chest pains as calm as possible. It's important to maintain as regular a heart rate as possible to allow the medication to circulate and to help alleviate the chest pain.



Rinse the mouth out with clean water and spit the water out before administering a dose of sublingual nitroglycerin. This will aid the mucous membranes in the mouth in absorbing the medication faster.



Position the sublingual tablet of nitroglycerin under the tongue so that it is completely covered by the tongue.



Nitroglycerin can cause a warming or tingling sensation when placed under the tongue. Reposition the tablet under the tongue if this occurs. Be sure the tablet is still completely covered by the tongue.



Wait for at least 5 minutes with the tablet under the tongue to allow the tablet to fully dissolve. The person taking the medication should avoid eating, drinking, talking, moving or standing during this time.



Administer another tablet of sublingual nitroglycerin if symptoms or chest pains have not improved within 5 minutes of the first tablet being fully dissolved. Call a doctor if symptoms have not improved after the first dose has been taken.



Do not administer more than 3 tablets of sublingual nitroglycerin. This is the maximum dosage of sublingual nitroglycerin that can be taken at one time. Allow at least 12 hours before administering another dose.

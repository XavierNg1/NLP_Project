 You will instantly be transported to the Dark World.;
, When you reach the top, keep going right until you see a glowing blue tile; it will be in plain sight with no rocks hiding it.
 With your automatically-equipped Titan's Mitt, lift the big black rock that is blocking you. Then pick up the only stone in the enclosure to reveal the warp tile.


You could also make your way through the Lost Woods, go south, and hammer in the stakes with the Magic Hammer.
 Off to the right, surrounded by stakes, will be a rock-covered tile. Hammer in the stakes with the Magic Hammer and lift the rock.
 The tile will be in an area surrounded half by rock and half by water. There will also be creepy green statues and stakes blocking it off. An overly enthusiastic Octorok will be there to spit rocks at you. Smash the stakes in with your Magic Hammer and lift the rock. Lo and behold, it's the fifth tile.
 Lift the rock covering the tile. Stepping on it is the only way to gain access to the Ice Palace dungeon.
 Lifting the black rock and stepping on the tile is the only way to get to the Misery Mire dungeon in the Swamp of Evil.
 Go up the ladder and to the right. Use the Hookshot to get across the bridge, and then keep towards the southern wall. It won't be long before you see a small black rock behind a bolder. Lift the rock. Tile number eight!

, Climb until you get to the second warp tile. Warp to the Dark World and stand on the area that will allow you to get to the top of Spectacle Rock. Jump off the northern side and go east across the bridge. Pound the stakes in and keep going east until you see a giant rock. When you climb onto Turtle Rock, hammer the stakes in order: right, top, and left. The tile will then appear.

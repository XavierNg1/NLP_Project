 To start, give your futon a good vacuuming to remove loose dirt, hair, and other debris. Make sure to unfold your futon first. Run the vacuum over the futon. Use an upholstery brush if necessary to get into cracks and crevices. Flip the futon over and do the same to the other side., Futons start to smell over time, so make a point of deodorizing your futon when cleaning it. To deodorize your futon, sprinkle baking soda over the unfolded mattress. Let it sit for about an hour Then, use the vacuum again to remove the baking soda., If you notice any spots on the futon when cleaning it, use a damp wash cloth, mild laundry detergent, and warm water to gently blot them out. Do not use too much water, as too much moisture can cause mildew. Most stains will lift with simple detergent and water.Make sure to test your cleaning solution on a small portion of the futon first to make sure your detergent does not cause damage like discoloration.
 While you're cleaning the futon, you should also work on cleaning the frame. While the mattress is removed from its frame, dust the frame with a commercial dusting solution. Metal frames, however, should only be wiped down with a damp cloth.Test any solution you use on a small portion of the frame first to make sure it doesn't damage the futon.

 You can cut your potatoes by hand if you want, but a far more efficient — and probably more effective — way of slicing them would be to use:









A food processor slicing attachment
A mandoline slicer (be very careful!)

, After they've soaked for 30 minutes, rinse them in a colander, then rinse them again and let dry.
 While vegetable, safflower, corn, or peanut oil are all perfectly viable options, many people are increasingly turning to olive oil because it contains no trans fats.Since deep-frying is already the least healthy method of cooking potato chips, it might be a good idea to use the healthiest oil you can get.
 Optimally, use about a quart of oil. At the bare minimum, cover the bottom of your pan with an inch of oil.


Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature of your oil. If you need to eyeball things because you don't own a candy thermometer, stick the end of a wooden spoon into the oil and wait for bubbles to start forming at the end of the spoon.Another way to check the temperature of oil without a thermometer is by frying a small cube of bread. Bread will turn a golden hue at 320° F after 30 seconds; 355° F after 15 seconds; and 375° F after 10 seconds., Cooking your potatoes all at once can drop the temperature of the oil too far too quickly.
 If desired, season immediately.

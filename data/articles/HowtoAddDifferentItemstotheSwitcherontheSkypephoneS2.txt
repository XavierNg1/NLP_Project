The switcher should appear with "home" on it.



Now, back on your homepage next to the "Skype" icon the icon of either My Stuff/App Store, etc should have appeared.
 Exiting stuff by pressing the red button deletes these off the switcher and also the icons are for one time use, so when exiting them, don't press "back"- always use the switcher button on the side.

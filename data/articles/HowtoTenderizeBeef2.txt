 There are chemicals, or enzymes, in many foods that break down the muscle tissue and yield tender, delicious cuts without pounding. Some of these include:


Citrus fruits such as lemons and limes.
Acidic foods, such as vinegar, yogurt, and wines.
Enzyme-rich foods such as ginger, pineapple, and kiwi.
 Using any of these ingredients—by themselves or in combination— and marinate from 2 to 24 hours, depending on the strength of the marinade.
 These are usually enzyme-based as well.

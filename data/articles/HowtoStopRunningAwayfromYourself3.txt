 Living in the present moment will help you deal with problems as they arise, instead of running away from them. To develop the habit of mindfulness, practice focusing all your attention on everyday tasks as you do them. Notice the physical sensations you feel, as well as the thoughts that pass through your mind.For instance, when you walk out your front door in the morning, notice the colors outside, the way the air smells, and the sensation of your feet on the ground.
 Dealing with challenges is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. Stay alert for new issues that need your attention, and face them sooner rather than later.Once you’re in the habit of being proactive, it’s easier to face your problems.
 A journal is a great way to preserve your thoughts and track your progress. Establish the habit of writing at a certain time every day. Don’t worry about spelling or grammar – just get your thoughts down on paper.Writing in the evening lets you reflect on the events of the day. Consider making journaling part of your bedtime routine.
 Live in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for you. Don’t pretend to be someone you aren’t, even if you think that’s what other people want. Putting on a fake persona will drain your energy and lead to emotional problems like anger or depression.If you feel like your personality changes depending on where you are and who you’re with, you may not be staying true to yourself.
You can be truer to yourself by adding a filter to your actions and decisions. Before commencing, ask yourself "Who am I doing this for?" If you frequently find that the answer is someone else, you need to prioritize your own wants and needs.
 Don’t expect to overcome all your issues overnight. Bigger problems may take months or even years to deal with completely. It’s normal to fail at things and have to start over occasionally, so don’t be too hard on yourself if your progress is slower than you’d like.

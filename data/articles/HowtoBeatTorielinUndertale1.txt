 Start by pressing the "Act" button when Toriel blocks the way. Once you press the "Act" button, select "Talk", or whatever you have to use.


Also make sure that when you are low on health, you heal yourself. You can eat Toriel's pie, or something from the spider bake sale. It doesn't really matter what you eat because you are on the pacifist mode and you will not ever gain more than 20 hp.;
, After this, press "Spare".
 This takes a bit of time, but don't get discouraged. She will give up, hug you, and run away after a piece of short dialogue.
 You have spared Toriel, and you are now in 'Snowdin' Forest!

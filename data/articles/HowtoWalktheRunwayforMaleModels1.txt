 As you stride, your feet shouldn’t cross over each other in an “X,” like women's feet do when they walk the runway. Instead, the classic male runway walk is a “V” formation, in which the toes point out slightly. Try not to point your toes out too much, or you might look like you’re waddling.The “V” formation broadens the body, emphasizes the upper torso, and gives the strut a slight swing while preserving masculinity.;
, When your foot lands, try to place the ball of your foot down first, then land your heel. It might feel weird at first, but keep your weight balanced on the balls of your feet as you walk.Keeping most of your weight on the balls of your will make your stride more elegant.
 While your stride needs to be longer than your normal gait, you shouldn’t look awkward or like you’re on stilts. Practicing will help you make your stride longer but appear natural instead of clumsy., As for the quickness of your step, let the music guide your tempo. Try to match your walk's rhythm to the beat of the music.The music that accompanies fashion shows is usually chosen to help the models pace their walks.
 At the end of the runway, pose with your hand on your hip, one leg out, and the other foot forward ready to pivot. Stand still for three to five seconds, then use your pivot foot to turn back for your return walk.Your pose can vary, and you can work with your designer to create a pose that’s suitable for the show.
If you nail your pose, photographers will have a better chance of getting a great shot that you can add to your portfolio.
 After you’ve posed, turn on the ball of your pivot foot as you pick up your other foot and reverse directions. As you pivot, your face should be the last part of body to turn away from the audience.Try not to make a quick pivot as if you were doing a pirouette. Instead, try to make your pose, pivot, and turn in one continuous, fluid motion.

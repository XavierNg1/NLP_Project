 Use the shovel to put gravel into the grizzly, and shake it through the holes in the grizzly. Inspect all oversized rocks and other materials for possible gold nuggets, and toss anything that is not gold back into the stream.;
, Squat down by the edge of the stream, and submerge a half-full gold pan in gently moving stream water between your knees. Point the pan riffles away from your body so that you can catch any gold that emerges over the pan's lip. Throw back any pebbles into the stream. Break up clay balls in case any placer gold is trapped inside them. When the water inside the pan clears up, the clay is gone and you can start panning.
 Shake the pan sideways or in a circular motion while keeping it completely submerged underwater. Be on the lookout for heavy, unusually shaped or colored pieces that sink to the bottom of the pan. If you have gold, it will settle to the bottom of the pan.
 If you see dark, heavy mineral grains, you are panning correctly. These minerals could contain precious and semiprecious stones such as magnetite, garnet, scheelite, zircon, cassiterite, and platinum, so look out for them as well as for gold.


As a general rule, if you find something heavy, keep it for later analysis. A geologist or miner will be able to identify the items you find.
 Use a magnet to separate magnetic grains from everything else. Use tweezers to pick up possible small gold pieces. If you find any possible small pieces of gold, save them in a water-filled vial.

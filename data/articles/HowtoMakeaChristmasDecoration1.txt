 Mix the cinnamon and the apple sauce and then stir in glue. Let the mixture sit for about thirty minutes., You want to soften the dough so that it will not be crumble later on. Work with one third of the mixture at a time.
 Distribute the dough about a quarter of an inch thick across a cookie pan. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough out evenly.


Use a little extra cinnamon on your rolling pin to make sure the dough does not stick to it.
This is a good time to decorate your ornaments. You can add glitter or anything else you think will add flare.
 Use your cookie cutters to give your ornaments a festive shape. Separate your ornaments from the dough and put them on your drying surface. Some great Christmas shapes include:


Snowmen
Santa Claus
Reindeer
Elves

, Using your straw, make a hole in the top of your ornament where it will hang from the tree. Make sure the hole is in the center so your ornament will hang evenly.


Make the hole before the dough dries or the ornament will be too hard to puncture.
 It will take your ornaments about a day to dry completely. Be sure to turn them over every few hours to make sure that both sides dry evenly or the edges may begin to curl.


You can speed up the process by baking the ornaments in the oven for a few hours at two hundred degrees. Be sure to turn them over once or twice.
 Thread a piece of ribbon through the hole in the top of your ornament. Tie the ribbon in a knot. Hang your ornaments from the tree for everyone to enjoy.

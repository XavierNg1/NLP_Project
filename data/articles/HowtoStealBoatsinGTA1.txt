 Boats can only be found parked on docks. Make your way to the edges of the city where large seaports and small docks can be found.;
, Although cops are rarely present around the edges of the city or inside seaports, you still need to check your surroundings for any law officer. If a cop sees you stealing a boat, your wanted level will go up one star.
 Approach the boat and stand right beside it while it’s tied to the dock. Press the Y (Xbox), Triangle (PlayStation), or F (PC) button, and your character will jump onto the boat and board it.
 Once the boat’s engine starts up, press the Right Trigger (Xbox), L2 (PlayStation), or W (PC) button to accelerate and sail away from the dock.
 Cops will chase after you if you stole a boat while an officer is around. To lose the police, look at the mini map on the lower left corner of the screen to check the range of the police, marked by a large flashing circle, that’s chasing you. Just sail straight out of their range and they should give up on chasing you, making the boat yours.

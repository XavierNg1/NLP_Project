 Black is preferred to blue. Make sure you have pens that allow you to write neatly and legibly. A neat, clean application will be preferred to a messy one.
 You never get a second chance to make a first impression, as they say. Regardless of the job, managers are more likely to hire someone who looks professional. Also, you may end up getting an on-the-spot interview, so you want to look how you would when going in for a scheduled interview.
 It is always better, if possible, to take the application home so that you can take the time to fill it out neatly and have someone proofread your work., Employers sometimes include specific instructions on applications to see if applicants can follow directions appropriately. For instance, you may be asked to list information in a certain order.
 In describing jobs listed on your model application, emphasize the skills and experiences that are applicable to the job you are applying for.For example, if you have worked as a cook and are now applying to be a sales associate, you might emphasize your work ethic and ability to multitask when describing your cooking job.
You may want to get two copies of the application and fill out a practice one first, so that you can produce a clean draft after having used the first to craft your responses.
 If something is not applicable to you, make sure that you mark it as “Not Applicable” or “N/A.” Otherwise, your potential employer may think that you accidentally skipped the question.
 You don't want a hiring manager to think of you as someone who makes errors that should be easily avoided.


For checking bodies of text, reading backwards can catch spelling errors you'd miss by reading it normally.
Make sure all information is accurate. You can be fired for presenting inaccurate information on your application.

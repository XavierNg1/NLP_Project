Make sure not to take too much off of one side, just keep filing and turning the blade over until an edge shows. The edge will be very rough at this point but it will become refined in the next steps.
 This is more polishing rather than grinding. Pass the blade over the stone as if slicing pieces off of the stone, but not so much that it bites into it. Do this at a 30 degree angle, using a slow and flat stroke; you want to making sure you pass over the stone at the same angle every time. Use a good light source to find the parts you've missed or even use a marker and draw on the edge, then sharpen until all the marker is worn off.
 Wet with a little water, and carefully run the paper along one side of the edge of the blade with your finger at a 30 degree angle the.


This is a dangerous step. You may cut yourself so turn off the TV or radio and focus (it can actually be quite relaxing). If you want a higher polish then get finer and finer grit paper, I generally take it to 1000 grit. Eventually using a cotton rag and buffing compound if you want mirror finish.

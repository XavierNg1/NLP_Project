 A Dusk Stone is a kind of Evolution Stone that induces transformation to dark-type Pokémon such as Murkrow. Dusk stones are dark violet, semi-circled stones that can be found on specific locations, depending on the version of the game:


Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum—Victory Road, inside Galactic Warehouse and Wayward Cave.
HeartGold and SoulSilver—By defeating Biker Reese, a trainer on Route 17, inside Pokéathlon Dome and Cerulean Cave
Black and White—Inside the Mistralton Cave and Black City
Black 2 and White 2—Inside the Strange House, Black City, and Join Avenue
X and Y—Inside Terminus Cave, Laverre City, and by defeating Inver, a trainer on Route 18.;
, To get one, all you need to do is walk around the areas where you can get a Dusk Stone. When your character walks on the right section of the floor (which is randomly selected), a message prompt will appear telling you that “Your character has found a Dusk Stone,” and it will be added in your Bag.
 Press the Start button and move the directional arrow buttons of your Nintendo console to select “Bag” from the options.


Press the A button to open and access the contents of your Bag.
 Use the directional arrow keys to navigate around the Bag. Look for the Dusk Stone and press A; a list of Pokémon in your current party will be displayed.
 Select Murkrow from the list of Pokémon, and press the console’s A button to confirm using the Dusk Stone. Watch as Murkrow evolves to Honchkrow.


Do not cancel the evolution or you’ll waste a stone.

 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Oil a loaf pan, 8x8 baking dish, or a muffin tin for your vegan zucchini bread.
 Peel the zucchinis using a vegetable peeler. Grate them over a bowl using a cheese grater. When you have a large pile of grated zucchini, place it in the center of a paper towel and squeeze out the excess water. Measure the grated zucchini to make sure it adds up to 2 1/2 cups, and grate more if necessary.
 Measure the flax seeds into a bowl. Add 1/2 cup warm water. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes to soften the flax seeds and allow them to release the binding agent that makes flax seeds a great substitute for eggs.
 Pour the flax seed mixture into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar, oil, applesauce, and vanilla. Stir in the grated zucchini.
 In a separate bowl, mix the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Use a whisk to make sure the ingredients get fully incorporated.
 Add the flour mixture to the bowl with the wet ingredients in thirds. Use a spoon to gently stir the flour in until it is just combined with the wet ingredients.









Don't over mixÂ  the batter, since this will result in a denser bread.
Stir in a cup of dark chocolate chips or carob chips if you'd like. You can also add a cup of chopped walnuts or pecans.
 Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan, baking dish, or muffin tin. Place the dish in the oven and bake the bread until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
 Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before serving. Vegan zucchini bread is delicious served with jam or vegan margarine.

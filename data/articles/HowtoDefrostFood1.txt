 Most items will usually defrost within up to 24 hours; however, large items such as frozen turkeys and chickens may take several days to defrost.


Place frozen items that weigh approximately 1 lb. (0.45 kg) into the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook them.
Calculate the amount of days needed to defrost large items such as hams or turkeys, allowing 24 hours for every 5 lbs. (2.26 kg). For example, to defrost a turkey that weighs 16 lbs. (7.25 kg), place the turkey in the refrigerator at least 3 days prior to cooking it.;
, Your food will take longer to defrost if the temperature of your refrigerator is several degrees lower.
 Any juice that drips from your defrosted food onto other food in your refrigerator may contaminate those foods.
 Some foods must be prepared and eaten immediately to prevent bacteria growth; however, you may refreeze the food, as long as it is placed in the freezer within the time frame in which you should have eaten it.


Eat ground meats, seafood, and poultry within 1 and 2 days after they have been defrosted.
Eat lamb, pork, beef, steak, roast, and all other types of meats within 3 and 5 days after they have been defrosted.

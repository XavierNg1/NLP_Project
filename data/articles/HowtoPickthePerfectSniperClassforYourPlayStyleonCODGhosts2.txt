 If you tend to remain stationary, any sniper will do, but the L115 is recommended because it is one shot kill from the knee up.
 As for attachments you will need the silencer (so nobody can see you on their mini map when you shoot) and any sight of your choice.
 You will need Fully Loaded because you are going to be getting a massive amount of kills (if you are good), Ghost (so when people run their cross hairs over you your GamerTag won't pop up, and Off The Grid (so when people on the opposing team get a Sat Com you won't pop up on their mini map).

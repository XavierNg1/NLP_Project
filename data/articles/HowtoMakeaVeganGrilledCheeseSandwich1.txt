 Look for vegan cheese in a flavor of your choice. There are many possibilities, from Cheddar and mozzarella to smoked and feta styles, all veganized. Choose one that can be cut into slices.
 Put it on medium heat. Grease the pan with olive oil to prevent it from sticking., Spread it on one side of the bread slices.,, Once the pan is done heating, cook each side of the bread slices until golden brown. Use a lid to press down on the sandwich, so that the cheese melts more easily.

To tell if the pan is done heating, splash some water on the pan; if it starts toÂ sizzle, it's done.
 Place it onto a plate., Enjoy your grilled cheese sandwich!

 Quickly stick out your hand for a handshake or bob down and do a bow or a curtsey instead. Turn your face away as a kiss comes for you. Let the person get a head full of hair instead.;
, Say as quickly as you can that it was nice seeing the person but you have to go now and do homework or answer a phone call.


Set your phone to ring so that you can escape and take that call...
Tell the would-be kisser that you need to go to the bathroom, desperately, right now and simply take off as fast as you can.
 Say that you feel a cold coming on and you'd really rather that they didn't catch anything if you did happen to be contagious.
 Have them take the person aside and gently inform them that you're "a little touchy" or "frightened by" kisses and to please not give you one.

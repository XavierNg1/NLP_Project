 A drain stick, such as a Zip-it, is a mini snake that can be used to remove clogs. Once you have the stopper removed, you stick the end of the stick down the drain. The barbs catch on any clogs, and you can pull them out. However, the stick is only about a foot long, so it won't work on clogs further down., A snake, also known as an auger cable or sewer rod, is used to find clogs further down. It's a cable that has a tip on the end to pick up clogs. You can buy or rent one at your local home improvement store to use on your drain., On a shower, remove the strainer part. On a tub drain, take off the overflow plate and go through that hole. Start threading the cable or rod into the hole. Keep going until you feel the line hit a clog, then stop pushing., With an auger cable, latch on to it by turning the handle clockwise. That twists the end into the clog. Keep pushing, pulling, and turning to get rid of the clog. With a sewer rod, push forward and back to break up the clog., If the standing water starts draining, that's a good sign the line is starting to clear. Keep working at the clog until it feels completely gone, and run some more water down it to make sure that it is draining properly and that there's not a clog further down the line.If there's a clog further down the line, you may need to feed in more rod or cable to clear that clog out.
 Once you're sure the line is clear, wind the rod or cable out of the pipe. Run some hot water down the pipe to ensure you are completely clear, and then replace anything that needs replacing, including the shower drain. Wind up the pipe and return it to the store or put it away.

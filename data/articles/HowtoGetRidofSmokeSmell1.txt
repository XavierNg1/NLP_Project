 Gently hang an open book over a railing or on a clothesline outside for a few hours to a day. This should cause the smell to decrease.


Make sure that you choose a shaded spot since sunlight can bleach the pages.;
, The smoke smell should be replaced by the smell of the potpourri.


You may need to replace the potpourri after a day and continue sealing the book up with fresh potpourri for several days after that.
Get rid of the potpourri when done.
 Shove four to five dryer sheets in between the pages at even intervals and seal in a plastic bag. Let sit for a few days before removing.


Both scented and non-scented sheets should effectively absorb the smell.
 Place the book or paper product in a resealable plastic bag or container and cover with a handful of cedar chips or roughly 1 qt (1 L) of charcoal. Use activated charcoal, not charcoal briquettes. This should neutralize and mask the smoke smell after a few days.


Cedar chips and activated charcoal can be purchased at pet stores, aquarium shops and hardware stores.
Cedar chips may leave behind strong odors of their own when finished, but these odors are usually capable of warding away the smoke smell.
Activated charcoal absorbs the odors without leaving its own smell. Put it in a cloth bag or wrap it in cheesecloth to keep the book clean. It doesn't have to touch the book to absorb those nasty odors.
 Place the book in a plastic bag or container and sprinkle with a decent dusting of baking soda. After two or three days, gently remove the baking soda using a vacuum cleaner.


Baking soda is one of the best tricks you can use to neutralize the odor since it has no smell of its own to mask the smoke smell with.

If you grow your own Yacon roots at home, dig up some of your roots (depending on how much syrup you'd like to make). If you have a large area of roots, it is advisable to harvest the most mature plants. Once you've collected the roots, wash them under a pressurized hose to remove any dirt residue.
If you purchase Yacon roots at the market, select the healthiest and freshest-looking roots. Take them home and rinse them in your sink to remove any residue left on the roots.;
, Using either a potato peeler or a paring knife, peel the Yacon roots and discard the peels. Take out your food processor and put all of the peeled roots inside, then juice them., Pour the Yacon juice into a pot, then put the pot on the stove. Cook the juice on medium heat until you see a film developing. Skim the film off of the top and the sides, then bring the juice to a boil for a few minutes before letting it simmer overnight. The next day, bring the juice to a boil again and skim the film off of the top and sides. At this point the juice should be darker and smell like molasses or treacle., Let the juice cool down, then use a sieve to strain the syrup. The thin liquid that can pass through the sieve is the syrup itself, and the thicker material that remains in the sieve can either be discarded or put in a separate container and used to sweeten foods., Pour the strained syrup into a bottle or container of your choice, then place it in the fridge so that it will keep longer.

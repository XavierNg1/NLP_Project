 You can use food to learn about how igneous rocks are formed. Remember that these rocks are formed when magma cools and forms crystals. You can use food items to simulate this process. You may need a parent to help you.The supplies you need include:A bag of white chocolate chips
A bag of milk chocolate chips
A piece of wax paper
A cookie sheet
A spoon
A microwave safe bowl
A microwave

, Place the chips in a microwave safe bowl and notice how different they look. Each of these pieces represents the individual minerals in a rock. Heat the chips until they melt.


The chips melting is similar to the earth melting the rock.
 Once the chips have been heated, use your spoon to blend the chips together. Stir until you cannot see the individual chips anymore. This liquid mixture represents magma.


When the earth melts the rock and forms magma, the individual minerals of the rock cannot be seen anymore. They blend together, just like the chocolate chips.
 Place a piece of wax paper on the cookie sheet, and pour the melted mixture onto the sheet. This represents that magma coming out of the earth as lava. As the meted chocolate cools, it will become hard. This is the same way that magma turns into igneous rock.When magma cools, it forms igneous rock.
Allow the chocolate to cool and do not touch it.
 Once the chocolate has cooled on the sheet, break it and notice what it has become. The white and milk chocolate chips have formed a new piece of chocolate that looks completely different from the original pieces of chocolate.When magma cools, the rock becomes a new igneous rock.

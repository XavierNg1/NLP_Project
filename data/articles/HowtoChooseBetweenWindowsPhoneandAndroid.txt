 The Home / Start screen is the first thing which catches the eye of any user of any electronic gadget. Therefore it is necessary that the start / home screen is very stylish and impressive.


The Start Screen of Windows Phone

Windows Phone 8.1 is one of the most stylish operating systems for smartphones.
It stands out unique with its "vertical-scrolling" interface of Live Tiles, each of which acts like a widget.
The Start Screen is colorful and absolutely has lesser empty space when compared to Android.
Each of the tiles is arranged properly in the form of grids, that makes it less cluttered and more organized.


The Home Screen of Android OS

Android on the other hand has a "horizontal-scrolling" approach.
It has more empty space when compared to Windows Phone.
Though the shortcuts and widgets are arranged in the form of grids, they seem to be more cluttered due to a large space between the rows of tiles.
There is a "bar" at the bottom, no matter in which tile you are.
There are customizable widgets such as a running clock, a news feed or a calendar.

There is a wide selection of apps in the Android Platform. So Android just has a sharp advantage of the wide range of apps.



Windows Phone does not bear the necessity of an Antivirus app.

The Windows Phone operating system can only be changed by OTA (over-the-air) updates released from Microsoft.

 These are accessible by a number of subway and local bus transportation lines, as well as by taxi. While there was once a fee implied to ride the ferry, it was eliminated in the late 1990s and there is currently no charge.;
, If you are traveling with children, keep a close eye on them as you prepare to board. The crowds can get unexpectedly large at peak times, and kids can easily become separated.
 A one-way trip on the ferry will typically take around 20-30 minutes, which offers plenty of time to relax your feet and savor the view. A few ideas for making the most of your ride include:



Grab your camera and step outside to enjoy the view. The ferry passes several landmarks and icons of New York City during the journey, including the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, and a variety of other ships and sailboats cruising the harbor.
Visit the ferry's concession stand and get something to eat. Your typical ballpark offerings are the menu, and can provide a quick lunch or refreshing drink while traveling between boroughs. Beer is the only alcoholic beverage served on the ferries.
Doze off. A pleasant boat ride across the harbor with the gentle breeze offers a great opportunity for a quick nap.
Strike up a conversation. New Yorkers are a melting pot of different cultures and people. Your friendly "hello" to the person sitting or standing next to you can go a long way meeting new people.
 Make sure to keep an eye on children here as well in the swarm of people.

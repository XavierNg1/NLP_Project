 Playing games online can be highly addictive – your child gets hooked to a favorite game and shuns mealtimes unless gorging on potato crisps in front of the computer counts as a meal. Sounds familiar? That’s when you, the parent, need to step in and enforce limits. About 1 – 1 ½ hours every day should be okay. More than that and he’s likely to get addicted and you’ll have your work cut out for you. So let him know how much is too much before it’s too late.;
, You know he’s feverishly trying to get to the maximum level, achieve the maximum score, or whatever it is that’ll help him beat the game. And while determination is a desirable quality, too much of it can be harmful. Forbidding him to play online games won’t work; what you need to do is encourage him to play different kinds of online games. If he’s into action games, buy or rent RPG games. If he’s crazy about simulation, trying out a few strategy games will be a healthy change. Anything that challenges his thinking and playing skills is fair game.
 Many times, kids get bored and play video games because they think there’s nothing else to do. But you certainly know better, so help him learn about the hundreds of fun, creative and productive activities he could do if only he would get off the computer! Allow him to pick something he enjoys – cooking, sports, crafts, reading, bowling – the list is endless. As long as the activity involves some amount of physical movement and enables him to exercise his mind, he should be fine.

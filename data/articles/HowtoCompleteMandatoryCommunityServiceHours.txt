 It would be a giant letdown, if the hours were done, only to be found out later that the adequate number weren't completed. This would also be a problem if the opposite happened, if too many hours were done, then the student would feel as if their time was wasted.;
, If the student is going to do community service, they might as well do it in the field of something they like to do. Not only does doing community service on something the student likes make the service more fun, but the student will be more efficient and do a better job as well.
 Clubs are fun things, but what students usually don't realize, is that they are a goldmine for hours. By joining a club, not only are you doing something you like, but you are going to be doing it with your fellow classmates.
 Having people to share the experience with, not only makes it more fun and makes the work easier, but it creates a lasting memory that will live on forever.
 Many schools have specific forms for documenting community service hours. Obtaining one of these forms is a necessity. There is nothing worse than not graduating because you didn't get your form signed even though you did the service.

 Baking soda has been known to irritate certain skin types, so avoid it if you're worried or know you're sensitive. In its place, substitute some more organic arrowroot or non-GMO cornstarch -- both are gentle for sensitive skin.If you can find it, some recipes substitute 2TB Bentonite clay for one tablespoons of baking soda., It is also good for sensitive skin types, though it is not always easy to find. While you can ignore it, instead adding more coconut oil and butter, it is a nice touch that makes a much gentler, easier to spread deodorant.
 Probiotics help fight bad-smelling bacteria on your skin. Add it with the arrowroot and other powders. Make sure the mixture has cooled slightly so that it is warm, but not hot, to the touch. Hot oils can kill the probiotics.The probiotic needs to be one that doesn't have to be refrigerated.
 DE, which is mostly made up of the essential trace mineral silica, helps your body fight rashes and infections, helping the deodorant stay on comfortably. You should make sure it is food-grade, and thus safe for application, and add with the powdered ingredients.

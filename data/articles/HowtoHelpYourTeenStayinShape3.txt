 Healthy bodies require good foods like fruits, vegetables and whole grains. They do not need processed foods that are filled with chemicals, preservatives and artificial everything. Don’t refer to foods as “bad” though.


Don’t forbid food either, as your teen will be more likely to resent the fact that you have told them they cannot eat something. or they will become too much to ignore.
 Make your dinner table a ‘no screens’ time and stick with that rule for yourself as well. There is almost nothing in the world that cannot wait environment until your meal is over. Watching television while eating encourages mindless munching and prevents everyone from actually paying attention to their body's signals (namely the feeling of being full).Activities like games or texting may also speed up the rate at which your teen eats This can be problematic because it takes twenty minutes from the start of the meal until the body realizes that it has been fed and can stop. Getting absorbed in a television show can cause a teen to inhale their dinner so fast that they walk away convinced that they are still hungry.
 Have your teens watch videos about what sodas (even diet ones) do to the body because visual lessons are often more effective than just talking about it. Remind them that some colas are used to clean the gunk off of car batteries and to unclog drains and then ask if they are really interested in drinking this same thing.
 Don’t forget that sleep is important, especially to a teen body. Sleep deprivation or the chronic lack of good, restful sleep increases the risk of metabolic disorders including obesity and also impacts grades, behavior and social development as well. Teens generally need between nine and eleven hours of sleep each night.Help your teen to establish a better sleep/wake pattern by discussing their biological clock and avoiding waking them when they don’t need to be woken up early.

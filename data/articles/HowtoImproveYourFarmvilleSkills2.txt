 Animals take up space and they can be somewhat tedious to collect from. Dairy farms and chicken coops have takes away a lot of these complications when it comes to cows and chickens though. Other animals may still be cumbersome to keep, but the cows and the chickens can help you create a steady income stream in no time as long as you have these structures to put them in. They make collecting easier and they take up much less space than the animals themselves would if they were left to their own devices.

 Add 1 pound (454 g) of crumbled feta cheese, ½ pound (227 g) of whole milk ricotta, 2 cloves of smashed garlic, ⅓ cup (79 ml) of olive oil, juice from 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon (2 g) of chopped thyme, 1 tablespoon (5 g) of dried oregano, and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of crushed red pepper to the bowl of a food process. Pulse the mixture until it is mostly smooth.You can adjust the amount of crushed red pepper in the dip to make it as spicy as you’d like.
 Remove 1 roasted red pepper from the jar, and carefully drain it of excess oil. Next, use a sharp knife to finely chop the pepper.You can use either a homemade or store-bought roasted red pepper.
 Once you’ve diced the red pepper, place the blended feta mixture in a bowl. Use a spatula to carefully fold the red pepper into the dip so it’s evenly distributed., After you’ve folded in the red pepper, add some freshly ground black pepper to taste. You can serve the dip right away, but if you are making it ahead of time, refrigerate it until you are ready to serve it.Serve the dip with pita wedges, olives, vegetables, and crackers.

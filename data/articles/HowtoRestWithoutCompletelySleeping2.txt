 A cat nap is a short power nap of about ten or twenty minutes that will refresh and rejuvenate you.Find a quiet place that is comfortable and away from distractions. If you can, make the space dark, as if you were going to bed and try to lie down.
Don’t oversleep or the exact opposite effect will happen – you will become more tired.
 Or, what the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) refers to as “planned napping.” Basically, this is where you schedule a time of the day to take a nap before you are tired. It is good to prepare for this type of nap if you know you will be making a long road trip or working late into the night.Similar to cat napping, try to limit planned napping to twenty or thirty minutes max.
Bring a clock or watch with you so that you can set your alarm accordingly.
 When you suddenly become so tired that you cannot function properly and could potentially cause harm to yourself or others, take an emergency nap. These types of naps are most common for people working double shifts or traveling great distances because of their job.This type of nap is used during times of fatigue or when using dangerous machinery and are taken out of necessity for safety reasons.
If you have to resort to emergency napping frequently, it can become dangerous to your life and health.

 It sounds simple, really, but for a few weeks, or days, before you plan on asking your parents; drop subtle hints, such as 'are really good. I love them. I wish I could see them live!' Your parents may just nod in agreement, or not respond; but it will definitely help, as when you come to mentioning them again later, they'll remember you speaking of them before.;
, Things such as good grades, you know a friend who you can go with, etc. If you've thought it through, your parents will see you as mature, and may consider it more thoroughly.
 Maybe things such as it's far away, or expensive. Try to think of ways to overcome them, in case your parents bring them up - Things such as paying for yourself, or getting the bus.
 Make sure they're in a good mood, and preferably that you haven't asked for anything in a long time. Start by pointing out something good you've done recently, or that you rarely ask for anything. Slowly explain what you want to do, and keep calm. Show them your list of reasons, and maybe even offer to pay for your ticket - Or at least pay for some of it, especially if it's very expensive.
 They may say they'll have to think about it, but don't pester them or go on about it - This is a sign of immaturity, and they may think that you're not ready to go to a concert or convention on your own.
 It may take several weeks; do chores around the house without being asked, don't bring up the subject at first and don't yell at them if they tell you no. Just stay calm.
 They may see that you're talking the mature way of looking at it, and change their mind. Alternatively, if you wait a while and it's not brought up again; try writing them a letter. Explain how much you want to go, how you can pay for your ticket and who else would go with you. Leave them letter, and hopefully; their minds will be changed, once everything is perfectly understood.

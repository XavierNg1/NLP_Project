You can get a lot of ceramic and plastic inanimate objects at hobby or craft stores that carry doll house items. Check online as well, such as auction sites but get your parent's okay to purchase things online. Alternatively, make things from items you have around the house.
 For example, make soda machine and a cool crane (toy game). Glue to the outside of the store for a special effect.

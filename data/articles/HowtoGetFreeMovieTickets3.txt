 Contact the corporate headquarters of your local theaters. Some viewers are allowed free movies in exchange for rating the quality of service, choice of movies, customer service, and, in some cases even the quality and selection of the snacks.
 Once you are on the inside, sit back and enjoy (after your shift is over, of course)! This is probably your best option for being able to see free movies on a regular basis. Just be aware that you are at work, not vacation, and keep that popcorn flowing.
 This takes a bit of skill and training, and a bit of luck. But writing for a small paper or website will get you a seat for almost every movie that comes to town.


Be aware that jobs in this area are often very competitive, and even in small communities you will need to have a degree in journalism or communications before most papers will even consider you. Contrary to popular opinion, becoming a paid critic is difficult work.
If you're having trouble breaking into the traditional media outlets, try starting your own movie blog, and start reviewing movies on your own. You'll have to pay at first, but if you provide quality content and earn a lot of followers, you may have some leverage in getting into more and more movies for free.

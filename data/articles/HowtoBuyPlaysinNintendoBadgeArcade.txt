 If you do not already have the game, you can download it for free off of the eShop.
 As soon as the game starts, you'll see it in the middle of the arcade., From there, tap the "Purchase" button to purchase your free plays. The normal cost is $1.00 (US)/£0.90 (UK)/¥90 (Japan)/$1.30 (Australia and Canada) for a set of 5 plays, but you can get up to 20 plays at once for 4 times the cost of one set. If you want to change this, tap the bunny who runs the arcade on the bottom screen and select the "Bundle setting" option to adjust the bundle setting you want to use.

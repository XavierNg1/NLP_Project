 Relaxers that contain an active ingredient of ammonium thioglycolate arenâ€™t as strong as other relaxers so they may not effectively relax coarse or coily hair. This type of relaxer would work well on hair that is wavy, somewhat curly, or fine., There are plenty of relaxers available on the market that are specifically designed with damaged hair in mind. These relaxers will generally be on the milder side and may contain natural plant extracts that nourish the hair. When browsing relaxers in your local beauty supply store or online, look for ones that are marketed for color-treated, fine, or damaged hair.
 Over processing your hair can cause it to become weak, brittle, and damaged. Those with damaged and/or color-treated hair are cautioned against using relaxers, since it can further weaken and damage the strands.

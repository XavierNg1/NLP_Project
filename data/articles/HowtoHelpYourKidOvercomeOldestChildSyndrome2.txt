 In order to avoid the development of jealousy and competition between your children, avoid making direct comparisons. For example, when you are praising the accomplishments or successes of one child, focus solely on their actions and do not compare it to their sibling.For example, if one of your children gets a high grade in math don’t say “your sister gets good grades in math. Why don’t you?”
Instead, celebrate their individuality and uniqueness. This way each of your children can flourish and engage in activities that they enjoy.
 As your children get a little older and begin playing together, try and create cooperative games for them to play. For instance, see if they can clean up their toys within a certain time limit. This way they are racing against the clock cooperatively rather than racing or competing against each other., When your children get into a fight it is important that they learn how to resolve conflicts in a respectful manner. Teach them to look at each other when they are speaking. Make sure that they echo the other person's words to ensure that they have heard them correctly. Give both parties an opportunity to explain their side and allow them each to suggest a solution and agree to a solution.Guide them through this process at first, but eventually they should be able to do this on their own.
 Your children are less likely to develop intense rivalries if you spend quality time together as a family. Take a family vacation, eat meals together as a family, or engage in a family board game night. Children are likely to work out small disputes and disagreements with each other, if they share positive experiences.

 You are going to have a lot of questions when raising triplets. That is natural. It might be useful to talk to others who are in your same situation.Ask your doctor for recommendations. Many hospitals offer all kinds of support groups, including groups for parents of multiples.
Consider joining an online support group. Many parents find online communities to be very helpful.
Support groups can provide advice on things such as, "When should my babies begin tummy time?" They can also provide support for times when you are feeling at your wit's ends.
Remember that you will usually know what's best for your babies. It's great to lean on others for support, but don't feel like you have to let someone else tell you how to raise your children.
 It's tough to raise kids. Raising three who are the same age can sometimes feel overwhelming. Don't be afraid to ask for help.Accept offers of help. If someone asks if they can lend a hand, say yes.
Be specific. If someone offers assistance, say, "Sure, I would really appreciate it if you could run to the grocery store for me. Thanks so much."
Voice your needs. If you need a break, tell your partner, "I need a few minutes to myself. Can you please watch the kids?"

, Your triplets are understandably going to take up a lot of your time and energy. This is especially true when they are young. Many people find themselves putting less efforts into their marriage or partnership.It's normal to let things lapse. But it's also important to try not to neglect your relationship.
Be supportive of each other. If one of you needs a break, the other should step in with kindness and understanding.
Make time for each other. If you can't afford a babysitter, ask a friend or family member to come over and give you time to go grab dinner together.

 In riding it is necessary to have even toning all over your body. Do not neglect doing some upper body exercises. Many upper level riders have a small set of weights and lift them a few times a day.
 Give your horse a good massage with a rubber curry comb. Carry your own water buckets and hay. Do chores around the barn like clean the horse's stall or paddock and wheel the wheelbarrow. All of these horse related activities are exercise and make the barn your free workout gym.
 You donâ€™t need to be aerobic shape to run a marathon, but you do need to be relatively slender and fit. Try to go on a 20-30 minute run three times a week to keep your endurance and stamina up and any extra weight off. , Endurance is a huge part of being a rider. Running should help with your aerobic endurance, but you need to build muscular endurance also. Try starting a weight lifting regimen with lower weights and high reps. Fitness is great but if you don't have endurance you can't go anywhere.
 Always stretch before and after exercise. Take time to warm up and to cool down. Focus on stretches that target your groin and thighs, such as the butterfly stretch, to stay flexible and reduce stiffness. Be sure you do all of your stretches slowly and carefully.


Studies have shown passive static stretching prior to a workout can reduce stability and strength. If you must stretch, warm up using dynamic stretches particularly for the inner thighs.
 Swimming is also a good option. Many beginner and intermediate riders focus too much on abdominal strength and end up leaning forward in the saddle. Counter this tendency by exercising back muscles and think "lean back" instead of "sit up" when on the horse.

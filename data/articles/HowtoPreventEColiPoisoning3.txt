 Many large or notable outbreaks of E. coli are announced in radio, Internet, and television news reports. Consider checking a national public health food safety agency’s website on a regular basis to learn about potential outbreak sources.
 Local health departments often test food from local restaurants and food handlers (such as grocery stores) for E. coli contamination. A quick call to the bacteriology or food safety unit of the public health center may allow you to avoid unclean restaurants or markets.
 When brands or specific food products have been identified as carrying E. coli, they are supposed to be removed from vendors’ shelves.


In addition, you should check your refrigerator and pantry for the listed items and throw away potentially contaminated products.
If you are suspicious about a restaurant’s food handling, do not consume raw or undercooked meats or fish.
 Except in absolute emergencies, all water should be treated before use for food preparation or drinking.

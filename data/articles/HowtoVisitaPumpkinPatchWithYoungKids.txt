 You and all of the kids going on the trip must be available. So, if you are working on the day you want to go on the trip, choose another date. Same goes if the children have a birthday party to go to or another arranged play date. If you want, you can also make a 'rain date'. A rain date is a back-up date for the trip in case it rains on the day you were supposed to go. If you want to go even if there is rain, prepare rain coats/rain frocks, rain boots, and rain hats (you could also use an umbrella or just the hood of a raincoat).;
, Use simple, easy-to-understand words and be prepared to explain your explanations. Some of the rules might be:


no wandering/going out of my sight
no fighting
listening ears on
be careful not to trip over pumpkins and vines
have fun!

,, they will be fascinated and want to learn more about pumpkins. Remember, keep the words simple and not too long.
 Ask them what it feels like. If they are stuck, ask things like, does it feel bumpy or smooth? Hot or cold? Soft or hard? This can be a learning experience if you include simple (but fun) activities in your pumpkin patch adventure.
 If they get stuck, ask things like, what colour is it? Is it big or small? Is it tall or short? This is another fun learning activity!

, If you don't want to bring a big pumpkin home, ask them to select a small one.
 Ask them questions about their trip, and ask them how they want to decorate their pumpkins.

 Once you have gotten your hamster out of their cage, take them a quiet place. Go someplace small, where they can’t get lost, and where this isn’t anything that could hurt them. Usually a good place for this is the bathroom., Set your hamster on your lap and allow them to crawl on you. Interact with your hamster using slow, gentle movements. It is important to avoid making the hamster anxious and therefore aggressive. Anytime you play with your hamster, keep your motions even and smooth. , Anytime the hamster comes close to biting you, you can discipline them by blowing in their face. One, brisk exhale into your hamsters face should deter them from biting, and act as a form a discipline to help show him that biting is wrong., Each night at your designated “hamster time,” take your hamster out of their cage and interact with them 10-20 minutes. When you are finished, gently transfer them back into their cage. Do this each night for two weeks., If you stick to program and spend quality time with your hamster each night, they will most certainly become tame and refrain from biting. It will take some patience, however, because this will not happen overnight. If you become frustrated with your hamster, they are likely to become frustrated as well. Stay calm, and they will stay calm too.

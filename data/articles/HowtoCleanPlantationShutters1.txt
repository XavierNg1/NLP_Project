 A simple feather duster can be used to dust any obvious dirt off the shutters. Run the duster in between each blind, hitting the tops and bottoms, to dislodge any built up dust.If you don't have a feather duster on hand, use a clean, dry cloth on your shutters.;
, To more thoroughly remove dust, use your vacuum. Pop the upholstery attachment onto your vacuum cleaner. Run the attachment over the shutters to remove any stuck on dirt.It's also a good idea to vacuum the floor around your shutters, as some dust may fall on your carpet or floor during the cleaning process.
 Dryer sheets actually help prevent dust from sticking to surfaces. After dusting your shutters, take a dryer sheet. Run it over each blind. This should lead to less dust build up in the future, cutting back on cleaning time.

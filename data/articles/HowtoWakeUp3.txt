 Somewhere nobody will interrupt you. Probably somewhere away from your desk, phone, or computer. That way you can rest in peace. You only have a short amount of time for a power nap so you want to make the best of it. If you have a secretary, you may ask them to hold all calls and stop anyone from coming in.


Be careful that your quiet place is not too secluded or remote. Make sure someone knows where you are at in case they need you.
 Some naps last 15 minutes while others last several hours. Decide how long you want to sleep and limit yourself to that. If you have a limited amount of time for your nap, adjust to ensure you have some time to wake up before your next task.


You may want to vary your nap times based on your own sleep cycle rhythms. Some naps may also be better for achieving different results. A 20 minute nap is good for improving your motor skills while a 60-90 minute nap improves decision making., If you are using your usual alarm clock, set it as you usually do. You may use a wake-up call at a hotel or the alarm on your phone. Travel alarms work well in these situations. If you are at your desk you may try setting up an alarm on your computer.


Even if your usual alarm clock is available you may want to use a different alarm clock instead. If you alter your regular alarm clock you may forget to reset it later. This could cause you to be late in the morning.
 Anything will do here. Hotel wake-up calls. Friends, family, colleagues, and co-workers will often help too. Setting multiple alarms on multiple devices can be helpful too. That way you don't give in and sleep for too long in the middle of the day.
 Although you may want to turn the alarm off and fall back to sleep, don't. Stand up instead. Get moving to get your mind going. You may even want to set your alarm across the room so you have to get up to turn it off. Turn some lights on or stare out a window if it is sunny.

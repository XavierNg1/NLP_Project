 Position the paper horizontally. You can use any type of paper you have lying around the house. If you want sturdier claws, then use thicker paper.
 Align the fold to the paper's bottom. The left side of the sheet now has a point.
 Only fold these corners to the line of the previous fold. This will create two smaller triangles., Imagine this right triangle without the other two triangles. Just fold the right tip to the opposite tip of the right triangle.
 Fold the excess strip with the two smaller triangles up onto the other triangle. This will form a triangle with this recent fold on top of it.
 Imagine a vertical line dividing the triangle in half, from the point to the base, right down the middle. You're creating a right triangle.


This fold is to form a crease that will be important for the following fold.
 Unfold the recently formed right triangle and fold the two folded edges directly to the half-way line of the triangle. The fold's outer edge should be going straight down, perpendicular to the bottom and even extending below the bottom of your triangle.
 Fold the same side over itself again. You should be able to see the claw coming into form.
 You may need to open the hole for the flap up with your finger. Hold it so the opening is visible and easy to insert one flap.
 Simply stick your finger into the smaller triangle to open it up. This will look like a knuckle for the claw.

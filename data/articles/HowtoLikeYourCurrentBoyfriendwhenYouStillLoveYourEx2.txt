 If you don’t believe your new relationship has a future, you aren’t going to be as invested in it or in liking your new boyfriend. Believing and wanting your relationship to work will help you be positive about the relationship and your boyfriend. It will also help you get over ex if you are fully invested in making your new relationship the best it can be.


Make a list of all the reasons you believe this relationship can and will work out.
Talk to your new boyfriend about how the two of you can make your relationship good for both of you.
 Don’t try to do what you did, the way you did it with your ex. Remember that this relationship is new and different. You don’t want to replay your old relationship with a new boyfriend. Trying new things, having new rituals, and making new traditions with your boyfriend will help the two of you bond — making it easier to like him even though you still love your ex.


If you and your ex ate lunch together every Wednesday and Friday, consider meeting your new beau for weekend brunch.
If you called your ex "Baby," try calling your current boyfriend "Sweetie," "Honey," or some other nickname.
 You should, however, talk briefly about why the relationship ended.Talking about it is part of letting your boyfriend get to know you better. It also reinforces for you why your ex is your ex and not your boyfriend, which can help you like your boyfriend even more.


Keep the talk to the basics: who he was, how long you were together, why you aren’t together anymore.
Be honest. Don’t bash your ex if he honestly doesn’t deserve it and, at the same time, don’t glorify him. Just be truthful about him and your old relationship.
Talk about it once and then don’t talk about any more. Bringing it up over and over again will hurt your new boyfriend.
If you feel the need to talk about your ex more, then talk to a friend, or if needed, a counselor.

 Coasters are a great way to decorate your home with gemstones in a subtle way. Buy several coasters to place around a room. You can buy gemstones that have been cut and polished, like rose quartz. Or, you can make a gemstone coaster by yourself by gluing gemstone to the side of a plain coaster. Using real gemstones can be costly, so you can find fake gemstones to attach to the coaster at art and crafts stores.You could glue some flat gemstones to the top of a coaster, but round gemstones would make the top uneven and wouldn’t support a drink well.
 Gemstone drawer pulls are unique and classy. You can choose one room, like the kitchen to replace the drawer pulls, or you can replace the drawer pulls on a bedroom dresser. Choose smooth and round gemstones, or rough minerals.For polished gemstones, you can use turquoise or pearl. For rough minerals, you can use crystal.
 Using mineral coat hooks is a great way to add an organic quality to your home in a very subtle way. The entire coat hook does not have to be made of mineral. Instead, you can find coat hooks that have a mineral attached to it—like quartz. If you prefer to use gemstones, you can make your own by gluing one or multiple gemstones, like rubies, to a coat hook., Using bookends made of minerals can be subtle to obvious, depending on how you use them. If you want to use them in a subtle way, put a few books in between the bookends within a bookshelf. For a more obvious use, place some of your favorite books between the bookends in the center of a table.


Quartz bookends dipped in gold are a great way to achieve an organic and classy look.

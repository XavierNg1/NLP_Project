 Let the gold air dry overnight in a secure spot.Alternatively, buff the clean gold dry for immediate use. Use a soft, dry polishing cloth, a fresh microfiber towel, or a scrap piece of cotton fabric. The softer the fabric, the less likely it is that the gold will be scratched.


If you let the gold air dry, store it in a spot that doesnâ€™t see a lot of activity. Otherwise, the gold may be knocked off its perch and lost.
Buff air-dried gold with a soft towel to make it shine.
 Once the jewelry is clean and dry, carefully inspect any gemstones or settings. To do so, gently wiggle the stone with your finger. If anything has come loose, immediately take it to a jeweler for repair. Otherwise, the stone may fall out and get lost.


Place the jewelry in a plastic sealable bag while traveling to the jeweler. If the stone falls out, it will stay in the bag.
 Clean a pearl by buffing the surface with a soft cloth dotted with olive oil.Avoid using detergents on pearls as this can cause discoloration. Similarly, clean gemstones with a wet cotton cloth and buff them with a soft, dry cloth until they shine.


If your gemstones are especially dirty, see a professional jeweler. They may have to sand the gemstone to clean it properly.

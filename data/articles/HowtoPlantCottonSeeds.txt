 About 3 spoonfuls should be enough.
,, Plant them 1 inch (2.5cm) deep and 6 inches (25cm) apart., Once you've planted the seeds, water them after 7 days. They don't like a lot of water. In the summer months ,you can water them more frequently if the leaves show any signs of drying (for example, every 4 days)., In about a week to 10 days, the seeds should germinate if the soil temperature is above 16ÂºC.,, Floral buds appear about 35 days after planting; floral buds of cotton are called squares. At about 60 days after planting the the first white flowers will appear.They are a flower one day and after that the fruit is called a boll. The boll grows larger each day as the seeds mature.The fibers are located on the seed coat. When the seed and fiber development is complete the boll splits. Stop watering the plants once first cotton bolls open about 17-19 weeks after planting. You can then harvest it, if wished.

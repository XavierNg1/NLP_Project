 One of the best ways to stay in touch is to always know where your friends currently live and/or work. In addition to their home address, maintain cell and landline information, email addresses, and work information. Obtain family contact information if your friends are under 30. Young career go-getters tend to move around a lot, so it can be easy to lose pace with new apartments, phone numbers, and cities. However, parents will usually have this information handy.Remind your friends that you do not have Facebook, but that it is still important for you to stay in touch.
 Alert your friends if you change your address, phone number, email, or any other communication method. This way you will remain current despite everyone’s changing lives.


If you use email, send an email blast to your contact list (create a group so you don't reveal everyone’s address) to confirm new emails, phone numbers, and any other preferred methods of contact.
Consider using holiday cards as a way to check in with snail mail addresses. Physical cards are also a nice way to show that you would like to stay in touch and that you care about your friendship.
 There are several ways to stay organized and keep track of the contact information you have for your friends. You can use a physical address book or create a virtual address book through your email or other websites. A virtual or physical calendar may be a useful addition to the address book. With a calendar, you can remind yourself of special dates such as birthdays and anniversaries. Calendars may also help you keep track of how often you get in touch with friends. After having a conversation with a friend, consider writing down the date in a calendar so you can quickly see how long it’s been since your last interaction.
Mutual friends may also help with keeping track of your contacts. Stay in touch with other friends who have access to contacts that you may have lost.

 If you have a single small fish, such as a goldfish or a beta, it is easier to remove it from the tank for gravel cleaning. Fill a clean container as close to the size of your fish tank as possible with non-chlorinated water. Use a drinking glass or a fish net to gently move your fish from the tank to the container., Unhook your water filter, and remove any plants or decorations from your fish tank. Set these aside. The tank should be full of only water and gravel before you begin cleaning., Gently pour the water from your fish tank through a colander. Under a stream of lukewarm water, agitate the colander to loosen and wash away any stubborn debris. Do this several times until the water coming off your gravel runs clean and clear., When the gravel is clean, spread it evenly back over the bottom of your fish tank. Reattach your water filter and set up any decorations as desired.
 Refill your fish tank with non-chlorinated water.If your breed of fish necessitates any other particular requirements, such as water of a certain PH, treat your tank accordingly. When everything is in place, gently submerge your fish and its holding container in the tank, letting your fish swim free.


Consult your local pet store for more information about the water requirements of your particular fish.

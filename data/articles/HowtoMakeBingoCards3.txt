 Do so on a piece of card stock paper. Use a ruler to help guide your lines. It is best to know ahead of time the number of columns/rows you will be using so that dividing them up later doesn't become to hard. For example, it is best to draw a top line of 10 inches if you wish to have 5 columns. That way you can easily divide them into columns (each column is 2 inches wide). If the top line were 9 inches, and you wish to have 5 columns, the math becomes much more difficult.In traditional bingo games, the top line and bottom line are the same length. However, this is only if you plan to have a traditionally square bingo card.
 On both the top and bottom lines, make a small pencil mark where each column line will be. Connect the corresponding top and bottom marks with a straight pencil mark (use a ruler as a straight edge). On the left and right lines, make a small pencil mark where every row will be. Connect the corresponding left and right marks together using a pencil mark (use a ruler as a straight edge)., You can put a term in each square such as "dog," "moose," etc. You can also put in numbers such as 56, 76, 87, etc. If you wish, you can also put in pictures of terms.Example: If you are making a bingo card for your Spanish classroom, you can put in Spanish words on the bingo card. Then call out English words, and the students will have to match the English word to the correct Spanish word on the bingo card.
Feel free to decorate the card as well. Give the bingo cards a title. Draw designs surrounding the actual square itself. Be as creative as you want.
 Do so until you have enough bingo cards for the entire group of players. On each bingo card the words should be placed in different positions so that no two players have the same cards. If you are only using the square on each piece of card stock, you can cut the square out with a pair of scissors. If you have a design surrounding the bingo square on the rest of the card stock, do not cut out square.

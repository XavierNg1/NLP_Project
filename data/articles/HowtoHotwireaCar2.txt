 Your goal with this method is to destroy the lock pins and allow you to turn the car over using a screwdriver, rather than the key. This is commonly done on cars the keys to which are lost.
 Every lock pin has two sections followed by a spring, so drill it more than once, removing the drill each time to allow the bits of the lock inside to fall into place.
 It doesn't have to go in deep because the pins are already broken. Use it the same way you use your key, just turn it about a quarter-turn in a clockwise direction to try to turn the engine over.Warning: this method will destroy your key switch and make it so that anyone with a screwdriver or a strong fingernail can steal your car.

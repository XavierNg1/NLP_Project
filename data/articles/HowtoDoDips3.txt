 They are common at gyms with weight machines. They may also be set up in parks, gymnastic centers or recreation areas.
 Grasp onto a bar with each hand. Keep in mind that you have to have a lot of upper body strength to complete even one true dip.
 Bend your knees and keep them bent at a 90-degree angle. Some people prefer to cross their knees to keep the legs steady as they do a set of dips.
 Focus on creating a straight line between your knees and the top of your head. Look straight forward.
 Stop when your upper arms are parallel to the floor. This portion of the exercise is the same with assisted, bench and true dips.


Your torso may lean slightly forward when you are lifting your full body weight. However, you shouldnâ€™t bend at the waist.
 Stop just before they are completely straight and repeat the exercise as many times as you can while remaining in proper form. Avoid using momentum to dip down and up.


If you start to rock back and forth, lower yourself to the ground and start again.
 If you are able to complete them comfortably, add a weighted vest to increase the resistance.

 Boil the red cabbage strips in water to cover. Once boiled, remove the cabbage and save the liquid. Pour it through a sieve or colander, catching the liquid in a bowl. Allow the purplish liquid to cool.
 This is so that you can make different colors. Add a little flour to the bowls. This will thicken the liquid slightly; you'll see that the liquid changes to a slight pastel pink shade, as shown in the image., Add one or more of the following ingredients to change the colors of each liquid (note that the color changes will tend to be pastel shades):

Add a little egg yolk: The color changes to yellow.
Add a drop of lemon juice: The color changes to red.
Add a pinch of baking soda: The color changes to green.
No flour or other items: The color stays bluish purple (the cabbage color)
Only flour: The color stays pale pink.
 In the example here, the colored liquids have been used to create a custard-like sweet dish. To sweeten a dish, obviously you'll need to add something more to the colored batter or liquid you've made, or the food will taste bland despite the lovely coloring. Suggestions for sweeteners include:

Melted chocolate
Jam, such as "Takoyaki"






A good recommendation is adzuki bean paste.Sugar or syrup
Or add sweetener after baking––you might like to add butter and syrup on the cooked food before eating.

 Take a shower every day, brush your teeth and try doing your hair nicely in the morning. Then put your makeup on! It adds extra girly-ness. If you don't own any, they have some at your local Walmart, Target, basically any store like that. If you don't have foundation or blush then that's okay.;
, To be girly, you have to look girly, right?

, Here are some things you can do:


Listen to music and dance to it
Run with friends,
Jump rope,
Swim,
Join the gym,
Do yoga

, Try to smile to everyone and have clean hands. If you burp say excuse me with a giggle, so people get side-tracked on your adorable giggle and forget the burp.
 If you get good grades that will make you happier about yourself, which will raise your self-esteem and make you feel more confident. Also, that will make you come off as a smart girl which is really good!

, If you got a new outfit or got an A+ on your test, don't show off, it's okay to tell a few people but don't be a show off or people may not like you.
 If you try to do a food journal you can keep track of your food. You eat a lot more food than you realize!

, Even if you weren't invited to a party or something, make your own fun. Invite your friends to your own party and who knows... You might have more fun than you would've had at the other party.
 Most guys think it's cute when girls have diaries.
, That way if you decide to put your hair up, it will look its best.

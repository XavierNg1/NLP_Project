 There are certain regular activities in life that should be done in an alert state, so that you are keenly observing certain things around you and will be warned if things aren't as you remembered them being. Practice deliberately observing things around you and committing them to memory as a deliberate defensive strategy to keep yourself safe.;
, Take note of what you have done by way of shutting or opening windows, pulling down blinds or shutting curtains, leaving lights on or off, closing gates and putting things like the trash can away.
 Again, notice similar things about how you've left your desk, office, business in terms of lights, locked doors, open windows, items on the desk, etc.
 When you get home or back to your business, do a memory check of the things you left in place. Are they still as you left them?


Naturally, if someone else at your work or in your household could have moved or changed things, take this into account but if anything seems out of place, timed wrongly, moved inaccurately, etc., then pay heed to your memory's recall and approach with care.
 It is better to be mistaken about thinking something isn't right than to convince yourself things are okay and to walk into a dangerous situation. Naturally, if you're struggling to overcome paranoia about absolutely everything on a daily basis, your intuition and memory are both going to serve you badly and see someone for help about your constant fears. However, for an average, emotionally competent person, trusting your senses that something isn't right is an important part of remaining safe.


If things do seem wrong, different, and your memory of things is backing up your concerns, call for help. Do not proceed to enter a building or area where you are concerned about the safety of such an action. Use your cell phone to call the police, visit the neighbors, or call someone you can trust for advice.

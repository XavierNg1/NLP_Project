 This is Apple’s internet-based phone and video chat service. You can call any other iPhone device, nationally or internationally, and both parties will talk for free.


Make sure you have a contact created for the person. Your call can be through the phone number or email connected with the person’s Apple account.
Go to your contact list, find the person and press the “Facetime” option, instead of the call option.
 Select the person’s name, select the “I” button and tap “Make free call.”, Skype will give you free international calls to other computers with a Skype account. KNCTR allows you to call international landlines from the computer app.

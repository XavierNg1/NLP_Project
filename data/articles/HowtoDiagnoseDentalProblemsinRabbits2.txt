 Rabbits with dental problems are likely to eat less and start losing weight as a result.If you notice that your rabbit is not eating as much as he used to eat, then this could indicate that he has a dental problem.


Keep in mind that not eating can be due to other health issues as well. Make sure that you get your rabbit checked out as soon as possible if he is not eating well.
 If your rabbit stops eating a certain type of food and starts opting for softer foods instead, then this is a good sign that he may have a dental problem.
 If you notice that your rabbit has been making more of a mess than usual, then this may also indicate that he has a dental problem.
 Some dental problems may even cause eye infections or eye discharge.If you notice a white discharge coming from one of your rabbit’s eyes or if you notice swelling around one of your rabbit’s eyes, then this can also indicate that there is a dental problem.


Eye swelling due to a dental problem can lead to blindness if not treated.Seek treatment for your rabbit as soon as possible.
 Rabbits with dental problems can also start to have a hard time grooming themselves as well. If you notice that your rabbit’s fur looks messy or that his bottom is dirty, then this can also indicate a dental problem.You may notice cecotropes on your rabbit's bottom if he has a dental problem.Cecotropes are stools that contain partially digested food and that the rabbit needs to re-eat.
 For example, your rabbit may hide more than usual, grind her teeth, or seem reluctant to move.


These types of unusual behavior may also indicate other health problems. If your rabbit is displaying any unusual behavior, then have her checked by a veterinarian.

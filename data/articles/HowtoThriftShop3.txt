 If you buy a damaged or badly made piece, you may have to spend a lot of money to fix it. This would defeat the purpose of buying thrift furniture. Look at the construction a piece of furniture to examine whether or not it’s well made.For example:


If it wobbles or leans, it’s damaged.
If there is a broken or cracked section, it might be too expensive to fix.
If a piece of furniture seems flimsy, it probably won’t last very long.
 There are many ways to use paint to breathe new life into a piece of furniture.For example, if you find a wooden table that you absolutely love, you can spruce it up with a coat of white paint. Make sure you use the right kind of paint for your material. For example, don’t use wood paint on a metal chair.


You can find metal, wood, and plastic paints at your local home improvement store. Talk to a store associate if you’re not sure what kind of paint you should use.
If you’re painting wood, make sure to sand and prime it first.
 Reupholstering can be time intensive and expensive. Therefore, only reupholster pieces that you absolutely love, keeping in mind the total cost. If the project ends up being expensive, it defeats the purpose of thrift shopping. For example:


Dining room chairs are very easy to upholster. They usually only have one or two fabric sections.
Couches and sofas are expensive and time intensive upholstering projects. Additionally, getting it reupholstered professionally can cost thousands of dollars.

 Different types of water are associated with different rituals. Morning dew is used for healing and beauty, spring water for blessing and cleansing, rainwater for fertility and abundance, and sea water for exorcism. Which kind do you want to use?


Collect and store the water in a non-metal container. If you'd like, leave it out to absorb sunlight, moonlight, or starlight.
 As long as it's silver, you're good. It could be a coin, a ring, a bead, or any silver object. The metal silver, not the color! Leave it in the bowl until the ritual is complete.
 They should be spoken monotonously and steadily, like a chant. Choose the one that most matches your intentions:



Water and earth / Where you are cast /No spell or adverse purpose last / Not in complete accord with me / As my word, so mote it be!

This charm is used for cleansing and purification.



Hale fair washing to thee / Hale washing of the Fians be thine / Health to thee, health to him / But not to thy female enemy

This charm is used for newborns (of Gaelic origin).



God bless your eye / A drop of wine about your heart /The mouse is in the bush / And the bush is on fire

This charm is used for averting negativity (also of Gaelic origin).
 You can either finish here or continue on, depending on how you intend to use the holy water. Add herbs like St. John's Wort to bless a house or sick person, Leaves of Vervain before a ceremony, or stir it with the twig of a sacred tree or add rose petals to unite the object with the Earth. It's up to you!


Holy water has a variety of purposes. A person can drink it to protect them from evil or illness, or it can be bestowed on an object (a house, even a piece of furniture) for cleansing.

 Hype other looks, post comments, post comments on the forums etc. This way more people will see your face. If you can, get to know some of the Lookbookers a bit better, but don't ask them to hype you.;
, Look at the 'New' and 'Hot' list and try to make your outfit a bit different. Make sure you plan it. For example, a popular look is Doc Martins, shorts, knee-highs and a shirt. You could change it to a completely casual upper-top, then some smart heels or brogues to make it that bit unique.
 It could be in a beautiful forest, in front of an old cottage etc. Don't have people walking in the background. If you can't go anywhere quiet to do your shoot, then do it in your own home, against a plainly coloured wall. It is good if you have a friend to shoot your looks, or a tripod and self-timer on your camera.
 Try different poses but try to make sure your feet/ shoes are in the picture. Lots of Look bookers only hype if the shoes are shown. Try a collage look, and have your shoes in a separate photo if you can't have a head-to-toe photo. Make sure it goes by the rules too. Only edit your photo if you really have to, but it is best if you don't so you can see the colours properly.
 A good time for this is midday to evening time. As there are people from all over the world on it, it will get seen by someone. Also try to have a good, interesting title and add a descriptive piece on why you chose the outfit or what made you choose it.
 Don't worry if you don't get any hypes within the first few minutes. It will take time to get popular. Just keep trying. Good LuckÂ :)

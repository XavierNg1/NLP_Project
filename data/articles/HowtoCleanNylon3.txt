 Mix warm water with laundry detergent that doesn’t contain bleach. Cover a white cloth in the mixture and rub the stain with the soapy solution. Let the solution sit on the stain for about 15 minutes.Blot the mixture with a damp cloth that has been soaked in warm water. Continue pressing against the stain until you have rinsed away all the solution.
Dry the spot by pressing paper towels onto the wet spot.
 Try to soak up as much of the grease as possible with paper towels. Then, use a dry cleaning solvent, like Woolite if it is on clothes. For non-clothing items, try a cleaning solvent for grease stains, like Shout or Spray 'n Wash. Put the solvent on a paper towel and blot the stain. After the stain is removed, dry the nylon with clean paper towels.Don’t pour solvent onto the nylon. Always use a paper towel.
Wear gloves and open windows when using cleaning solvents.
 Hydrogen peroxide can help neutralize the smell of blood, urine, or vomit stains in addition to cleaning. Lightly cover the stain with a 20% solution of hydrogen peroxide. Leave the hydrogen peroxide on the stain. You don’t have to do anything because hydrogen peroxide will neutralize itself.You can go over the area with a mop or paper towel after the stain has been neutralized just to make sure it is dry.

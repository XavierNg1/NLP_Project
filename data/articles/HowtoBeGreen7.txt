 Try writing a full page or using both sides of the page, millions of paper are wasted every year just by throwing away unused paper.
 Instead of purchasing a bottle from the shops and throwing it away all the time, reuse the bottle by filling it up with water and putting it in the fridge.


Keep in mind that bottled water should only be used when going out somewhere where there is no available water such as the park or to the beach.
 When shopping, it's more green to use your own reusable bag instead of a plastic bag which will be thrown away as soon as you get home.



Unfortunately, almost all clothing is made from sweatshops that abuse and mistreat their workers. There have been several incidents of terrible working conditions, including protests that took place in Cambodia against Walmart and the collapse of several sweatshop buildings, one of which killed over 1,000 people. Ethical clothing brands include Eth-ics, Stella McCartney, Naja (lingerie), Krochet Kids, People Tree, etc. These brands will be significantly more expensive (with the exception of Naja, whose prices are about equal to Victoria's Secret), but worth it to buy sustainable and ethical clothing.
To find out more, watch The True Cost (a documentary on Netflix), and check out their website to find more sustainable clothing makers.

 Bite inhibition is what a dog learns about how strong his bite is. Basically, when playing with other dogs, your dog can learn to not bite hard enough to harm another dog. Your dog can learn to do the same with humans, as humans can take even less force than other dogs.It's important to teach the pup to not bite hard first, so that if your pup ever does decide to bite out of the blue, it's less likely to break skin or cause a serious injury.;
, The first step in this training is to start playing with your pup. Let him mouth on your hand, though not hard., When your puppy actually chomps down on your skin, you need to react. Make a noise like a yelp, or yell "Ow!" Your pup should jump back at your reaction. If your reaction doesn't work, try a different sound., First, let your hand relax, and then take your hand back. You want to teach your pup that hard biting stops the fun of play.However, don't jerk back, as that could make him think you're playing; he may bite again., Wait a bit to start play again. Once you begin again, repeat the process if your pup bites hard again. Repeat as many times as your pup needs to get the picture., When your dog is biting at the right pressure in play, say "Good dog," using a happy tone of voice. That reinforces that the right pressure is soft.

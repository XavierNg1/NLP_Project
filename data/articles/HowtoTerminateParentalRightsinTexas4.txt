 Once you are comfortable with the reputation of your chosen agency, contact them. The agency will help you through the paperwork and any other requirements for adoption. Your agency may even provide free counseling, medical care, and legal services.You may be able to choose the adoptive family yourself, and/or arrange for an "open adoption" whereby you can opt to have some contact with your child and the adoptive family or request updates and information.

 Since the landlord pays for tenant improvements, all expenses for these improvements are recorded by the landlord. Tenant improvements are treated as ordinary capital expenditures on the landlordâ€™s financial statements.The total amount of the expenditures are recorded as an asset on the landlord's balance sheet. Then, each month, the depreciation expense is recorded on the landlord's income statements.
 In order to accurately record capital expenditures, know the total cost of the tenant improvements. You also need to know the useful life of the improvements. Finally, know the salvage value of any of the assets.Subtract the salvage amount from the total expenditure. This is the amount that will be depreciated each month on the landlord's accounts.
For example, suppose the landlord paid $35,000 for capital improvements. The useful life is 7 years (or 84 months). The salvage value is $1,400. So the depreciable amount is $33,600 ($35,000 - $1,400 = $33,600).
 Divide the depreciable amount by the number of months in the useful life of the assets. Each month, make a journal entry for the monthly depreciation. Record a debit to depreciation expenses on the landlord's income statement. Record a credit to accumulated depreciation on the landlord's balance sheet.For example, if the depreciable amount is $33,600 and the useful life is 84 months, then calculate the depreciation with the equation $33,600 / 84 = $400. This is the amount of depreciation to be recorded each month.

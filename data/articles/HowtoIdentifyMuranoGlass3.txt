 It is a good primer for the techniques and styles of Murano glass. You may want to refer back to it when you are looking at factory catalogs.
 Factories have catalogs of at least their current offerings, but possibly also their vintage glass. Look on 20thcenturyglass.com to find popular Murano glass factories, and then search for their websites so that you can request a catalog.
 If the authenticity is still in question, you should contact a local glass antique expert and show them all the information you have. Although experts are not 100 percent accurate, they will have an easier time identifying it than almost anyone else.


If you canâ€™t find an expert, try posting pictures and information on an antique glass forum. You may be able to discover more creative ways of identifying the glass.

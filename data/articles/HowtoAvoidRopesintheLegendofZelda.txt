 In any version of the Legend of Zelda, Ropes can only be seen inside dungeons. They are randomly placed inside dungeons, so it may be quite surprising to see these monsters. Whenever you’re venturing inside a dungeon room, always have your shield equipped and conveniently assigned to one of the buttons of your controller.;
, Ropes will instantly charge at you once you come within its sight. When entering a dungeon, always be watchful when going from one dungeon room to another for any possible Ropes that may attack you.
 Once a Rope sees you, it will instantly charge at you at full speed, giving you only a second or two to react. Quickly press the button on your controller where your shield was assigned to raise it and defend yourself. The Rope will slam on to your shield, temporarily stunning it.
 If you don’t have your shield with you, you can do a quick side-step using the arrows keys on your controller to jump of out the Rope’s way. If there’s a wall behind you, the Rope should slam into it and get stunned. Otherwise, the monster will just turn back and charge at you again. When this happens, simply side-step again to avoid its attack.
 While the Rope is still stunned from running into your shield or the wall, draw your sword and attack the Rope. It takes two to three strikes of your sword to kill a Rope.

 Essentially the opposite of the bleach method above, this method uses tea and/or a similar staining agent to make a shirt's colors appear darker and muddier, rather than lighter and more faded. As such, this method is best for white or light-colored shirts, though it has some usefulness for vibrant, brightly colored shirts, so long as they're not too darkly shaded.
 Using a large plastic bucket or bathtub to contain your ingredients, mix your staining agents and water to create a staining bath for your shirt. The more dilute your staining bath, the less your shirt will be darkened (and vice versa). There are many possibilities in terms of potential staining agents - see below for just a few:


Tea
Coffee
Dirt
Paint (earth tones work best for the "naturally worn" look)

, Add your clothing to the staining bath and stir vigorously. Allow your clothes to soak in the liquid, occasionally checking their progress. Depending on the concentration of your staining bath, it can take anywhere from half an hour to several days for your shirt to reach its desired level of darkness, so be sure to remain vigilant as it soaks.
 If you have time, remove your shirt from its staining bath and place it in a bath containing vinegar and water mixed in a 1-to-3 ratio. Soaking the shirt in this dilute vinegar solution helps the stain "set" in the fabric. Allow the shirt to sit for 4 to 12 hours or as needed.
 Finally, remove the shirt from its bath and rinse thoroughly in the sink, removing any lingering staining agent or vinegar. Machine wash and dry as you normally would.


Congratulations! Your shirt should be ready to wear.

 Skill points are earned when you level up and you can buy skills with them. You can access your skills by pressing the house under your profile picture and finding the skills button.,,

By the way, if you have "Big Spirit" in the 'Mechanic' section, you can spawn things super fast.
 If you're a hard mode sham, red nail for the plank (B button on keyboard) is gone, and Sp (spirit; the spark that makes you go up) is gone. Instead, there is totem feather. A totem is something you can spawn that doesn't have to be assembled; to make your totem click the feather in hard mode that says "Edit Totem"., When you become sham, don't sit there, help the mice get the cheese.

Remember, you can always learn the basics in you are new by clicking 'Help'.
Leave no mouse behind, and only kill mice if you are in survivor (where mice are killed by sham and have to survive).
You can only enter the hole when all the mice have been saved.
Don't get angry with the mice; don't kill them.
 However, you can save your friends. For example: attaching a balloon by pressing the B key and attaching the balloon string to the mouse intended.

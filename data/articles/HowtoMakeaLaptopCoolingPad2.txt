Cut it slightly larger than your laptop's dimensions. Add about 2 centimeters (0.75 inches) on each side for extra space. The wood should be around 1.25 centimeters (0.5 inches) thick.
Measure the wood after cutting. Adjust, if necessary.
 Make the holes about 2 centimeters (0.75 inches) apart in a grid pattern on the board. You should be able to fit a pencil through the holes, but not much more.


If you have serious overheating problems, drill the holes closer together.
You will also need to buy fans and plug them into each hole. Or, you can simply disassemble something that already has a fan that you don't need.

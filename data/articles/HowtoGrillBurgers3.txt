 Ignite your grill and turn the heat to high. Close the lid and give your grill about 10 to 15 minutes to get hot. Scrape the hot grill rack clean with a wire brush. Brush the hot rack of your grill with oil to prevent sticking (optional).
 Place your patties into the grill and sear on one side for about 3 minutes. Avoid pressing down on your burgers while they are grilling.


You may see flare-ups during cooking. Flare-ups are caused by the burger fat dripping into the flames below. Carefully move your patties to a higher rack or cooler side of the grill until the flames subside.
On a gas grill, you will find the cooler areas on higher racks, or along the edges of your grill, away from the flame.
 Using a metal spatula with a long handle, flip your patties and sear them on the other side to lock in the juices. Continue grilling until you have reached your desired doneness. Here are some guidelines to consider:


Cook for about 3 1/2 minutes for medium-rare. Your burger is done when you reach an internal temperature of 130 to 135° F (55 to 57° C).
Cook for 4 minutes for medium. Your burger is done when you reach an internal temperature of 135 to 150° F (57 to 65° C).
Cook for 4 minutes or longer for medium well. Your burger is done when you reach an internal temperature of 150 to 165° F (65 to 74° C).
Your burger is well done when it's internal temperature reaches 165° F (74° C) or greater. Serve immediately.
Add cheese to your burgers in the last minute or so of the cooking process so the cheese has sufficient time to melt.
Toast your buns on a cooler side of the grill or a higher rack during the last minute of grilling. Lightly butter the inside of the buns if desired.

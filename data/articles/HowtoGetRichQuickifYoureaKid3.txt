 Your parents might give you an allowance. A high allowance will work for getting rich quick. Chores without being asked are great bonus points. Even if you get five bucks a week, know that this money can add up very, very quickly.
 You never know what you might find! Look anywhere for loose change. Just make sure that your parents aren't planning to use that extra change.
 If you don't have an allowance, ask for one, but don't bother your parents. To convince your parents that you deserve a bigger allowance, do your chores extra well, do extra chores that you don't really need to do but need to be done, and be super helpful.


Make an agreement with your parents. For example, tell your parents that you'll earn at least an "A" or "B" in all of your classes if you can get an extra $20 per month. Then, both parties are happy: Your parents are happy you're doing well in school, and you're happy that you get that extra dough.
 This works especially if you have a means of transportation, such as a car, but it's still doable even if you don't. Walking places is an option, as is taking the bus or asking a friend for a ride.
 Cleaning your parents' house can earn you cash in a few hours, especially if you do a good job. Make sure to hit the windows, the awnings and gutters.


Make sure to get the inside of the house as well as the outside. Your parents probably don't want to do the kitchen or the bathroom, but because you're super-motivated to make some extra money, it won't be a problem for you. Get the proper cleaning supplies (all-purpose cleaner, rags, gloves, etc.) and get to work!

 A short and simple way to do this is to cut logs, preferably next to the entrance of the G.E. You may also collect bones. 100 Bones can earn you around 28k, depending on the market. A necessary thing to do is go to Lumbridge and get the exp lamps from the knight below the trapdoor. Also, go to the Stronghold of Security and Player Safety and get your 20k and lamp. Use the lamps all on Ranged.;
, A cape is also useful. As well as the armor, you must purchase bows from Oak to Maple,around 1000 Iron or Steel Arrows, and a power amulet. Equip it all, and now you have your fighting equipment. You should already have like 13 Ranged.
 Do it. Monks can heal you btw. Betrayal is sweet ain't it? They heal you and you kill them, while the other monks WATCH and they also heal you.
 You can now pk if you want and take a break from this boring-as-'ell training. Just get some Mith/Addy arrows and an inv of tuna to save money. You can also go to the cows near Beefy Bill to make some profit. Sooner or later, also get Magic to 25-37 to teleport to various places.
 Do this until 50. By the way, you should have at least 150k to support this account. Get fishing to at least 30, or go on Woodcutting.
 Do this until 70 Ranged. Equip your highest bows.
 You may switch around with different monsters, like Worker Cocks.
 Anyway, at any time you may pk. ANY TIME! This game is about fun. I think. Do this until like 98.9 or you can do Soldier Cockroaches, or Ankous. Yeah. Important three are the following: Ankous, Lesser Demons, Soldier Cockroaches. These all hit pretty hard, so bring nice food like tuna or lobsters. Shrimp is great also if you can afford it.

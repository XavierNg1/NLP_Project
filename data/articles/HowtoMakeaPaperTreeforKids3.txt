 Using green construction paper, roll and tape it into a narrow cone which is as tall as you want your Christmas tree to be., Cut long strips of the green construction paper to about 2-3" wide. Cut slits close together all along the bottom edge, leaving about 1/2" at the top to create the fringe of the branches.
 Starting from the bottom and working your way up in rows, tape the strips, fringe side down, around the tree.
 Once you've added on all the strips, fluff up the fringe (especially near the bottom) to make the tree look fuller.
 You can use glitter glue, beads, puff balls, pipe cleaners, and any number of other materials to decorate your tree. Don't forget to make a tree topper!

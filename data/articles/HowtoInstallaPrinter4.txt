 A shared printer is a printer that is connected to one of the computers on your network, and then made available to others. The computer that the printer is connected to must be powered on in order to print to it. Almost any printer can be shared on the network.
 Follow the steps in the first section to install the USB printer as you normally would.


Note: This method only works with Windows 7 and 8. If you are using Vista or XP, click here.
 Select "HomeGroup" from the results.


If you are using Windows 8, start typing homegroup while on the Start screen.
 If there is already a HomeGroup present, you can join the existing HomeGroup instead.


Windows 7 Starter and Home Basic can only join HomeGroups, not create them. If all of the computers on your network are using these editions or older versions of Windows, click here.
 In Windows 7, make sure that the "Printers" box is checked.
, Open the HomeGroup menu the same way as you did on the other computer by searching for it in the Start menu.
 You will be asked to enter the password you were provided earlier.
 You may also be prompted to install drivers as well.


Windows 8 users should be able to access the shared printer as soon as they join the HomeGroup.
 Once the printer has been installed, you'll be able to print to it just as if it was plugged directly into your computer. The computer that the printer is connected to must be turned on and logged into Windows in order to connect to it.

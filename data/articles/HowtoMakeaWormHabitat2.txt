 Ask whether they have plastic boxes for dragonflies or similar large flying insects. Nature hobby stores might also have such a box.


If they do not, you could choose a cuboid plastic box. You could look in a storage shop or a fishing gear store. However, it must have plenty of ventilation (breathing holes), so you may need to add these. If adding holes would break the container, choose a different one.
 This can include dried grass, dried leaves, shredded newspaper or scrap paper, straw, old hay, etc.
 Add it gradually, and as you do so, lift the bedding material to create air spaces. Don't add too much soil.


You can add some dead leaves and twigs for it to look more natural.
 Add to the habitat. Cover with well rotten compost. Add the lid.
 Be sure to feed the worm plant scraps. Feed the worms half their body weight per day; any more than this and the food will go off and smell bad.

, Mix together the olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Place the ingredients in a small bowl and stir them until they're thoroughly incorporated.
 Pour the marinade into the zip-top bag with the chicken and seal it. Remove as much air as possible from the bag and seal it. Turn it from side to side to ensure that all of the chicken is coated in the marinade. Then, place the bag on a sheet pan and refrigerate it for an hour or even overnight for best results. Turn the bag every few hours to keep the chicken freshly coated.
 Brush the grill grate with olive oil to coat it. Then, heat the grill to 350ºF (175ºC).
 Cook the chicken until it's crispy and brown on both sides. Turn the chicken every few minutes to evenly cook both sides.









If you're looking for a less crispy, more juicy option; it's recommended to place the chicken breast on a diagonal angle, wait until the edges turn white, rotate 180º and repeat on the other side. This will result in the picture perfect grill marks you see in a commercial.
The internal temperature should reach 165ºF (74°C) when the chicken is ready. When the chicken is cooked, place it on a serving platter and let it cool for 3-5 minutes before you eat it.
 Enjoy this tasty grilled chicken while it's hot.

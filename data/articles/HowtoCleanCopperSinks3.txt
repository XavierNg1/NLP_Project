 The most important aspect of copper sink care is to steer clear of harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners or scrubbers. Don’t use bleach, lime or rust removers, or ammonia-based cleaners in or around your sink. Stay away from abrasive powdered cleaners like Comet.Never use scouring pads, steel wool, or any other hard scrubbing pad.
 Acidic foods and liquids are harmful to all copper surfaces. Don’t let things like tomato sauce or lemon juice sit in your sink, and keep the water running when dealing with any acidic items.Toothpaste can also discolor copper, so rinse away toothpaste residue after brushing if your bathroom sink is copper., Putting cookware away as soon as possible will keep any copper sink in the best condition, whether vintage or polished. Dirty pots and pans might contain acidic ingredients that can discolor both patina and polish.Pots and pans left to dry in the sink can shift positions and potentially leave a dent in a shiny copper surface.
 If you have hard water, it’s especially important to dry your sink every time you use it. Mineral deposits can be unsightly on both polished copper and surfaces with a patina.The most accurate ways to Determine if You Have Hard Water are to ask your water company or to use a home test kit. You can purchase a kit online or at a store that sells pools, or you can contact a water softener company and ask if they offer free tests.

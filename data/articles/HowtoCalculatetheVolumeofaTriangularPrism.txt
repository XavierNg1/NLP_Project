 The triangular bases of the triangular prism will have the same dimensions, so it doesn't matter which triangle you use. Now, find the base and the height of the triangle by locating the length of one of the sides of the triangle as well as the length of a line perpendicular to that first line. If you're working with a right triangle, then great -- you can just take the length of the two sides.


Let's say you're working with a triangle with a height of 3 cm and a base of 4 cm.;
, This is the first step to finding the area of the base, which is in the case of the triangular prism, a triangle. So: 3 cm x 4 cm = 12 cm 2. Don't forget to state your answer in square units since you're working with area.
 To finish finding the area of the triangular base, simply divide 12 cm2 by 2. So, 12 cm2/2 = 6 cm2
, Let's say the height of the triangular prism, or the length of one of its sides, is 10 cm. So, just multiply 6 cm2 x 10 cm to find the volume of the triangular prism. 6 cm2 x 10 cm = 60 cm3. Don't forget to state your answer in cubic units since you're working with volume.


You have just followed the simple formula for finding the volume of a triangular prism: 1/2 x bh x l.

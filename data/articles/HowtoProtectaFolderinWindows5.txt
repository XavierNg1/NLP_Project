 There are a variety of encryption software available, both for free and paid. Research your options and read customer reviews. Only install security programs from trusted companies.
 Some software will install simple passwords on folders that you designate. Others create encrypted drives that are mounted as a disk image. These drives are typically much more secure than a password protected folder, but require a bit more technical knowledge to operate correctly.

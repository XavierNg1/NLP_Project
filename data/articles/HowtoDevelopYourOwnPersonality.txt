 For a little while and then, possibly forever, stop caring about what others say about you. That means "You're not cool enough" or "If you don't have a cell phone, you can't be our friend" or "Those clothes are stupid" or "That thing you do is pointless" are not true. Think that you never heard them and if you ever will, they won't mean anything. Accept the fact that we're all different a little bit;
, Star asking yourself any questions you can think of about yourself. "What do I like to do?" "How am I towards others?" "Am I artistic?" "Do I like to be in the outer world?"Determine, basically, anything you can about yourself. Whether you like arts or math, whether you like being in the outdoors or not, what movie/book/video game theme you like, what jobs get you, etc.
 That won't make you a clich√©. Movies are based on reality, not vice versa. You may see yourself as a math genius, as a party maniac, as a book lover, as a gamer, as a skateboarder, as an innocent kid, as a werewolf who is quiet and protects his friends, as a loner who doesn't have many friends, but pursues his talents and interests, as a megalomaniac who seeks attention, or many more. No matter how you are, you are great. Remember that

, Don't do anything you don't want to, just because someone tells you to. Listen to yourself, do what you like, be how you are and you'll find your people. True friends will never try to change you. You can listen to other opinions, but don't follow them if you don't want to

, Why feel bad about the fact that you like a certain band or a TV show? Is there anything bad about LIKING something? Whatever you like, embrace it. Watch your movies, listen to your music, read your books, do your things, wear your clothes and play your games

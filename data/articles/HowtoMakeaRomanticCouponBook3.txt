 One great concept for a coupon "book" is including gift cards with each of the coupons you create. You can even fold each coupon into an envelope to hold each of the gift cards.You can find free templates to guide you online. Individual envelopes can be attached with a hole punch and a binder ring.
For instance, write “Grab your roller-blades!” onto a coupon that is folded around a gift card to your local skating rink, or “Good for one share-able sundae,” around a gift card to your boo’s favorite ice cream shop.
 There is a huge range of coupon types within the realm of physical romance. In fact, you could probably make a whole coupon book of only this sort of coupon. The specifics, of course, are entirely up to you.Example might include, “One immediate make out session” and “You look dirty… meet me in the shower.”
Be as creative as you want. In fact, coupons can be a great way to introduce ideas for new intimate activities to try together.
 If you’re in a time crunch, the internet can come to the rescue. There are complete sets of printable romantic coupons that you can download, print, and assemble. Granted, these won’t be too creative, nor too personal, but they can work in a pinch.

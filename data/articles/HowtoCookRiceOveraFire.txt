 Don't use a roaring hot fire with licking flames, just one that can boil water. Keep moving the coals around to maintain as constant a temperature as you can.;
, Use four times as much water as rice by volume.(You need more than the rice can absorb because much of it will boil off.)

, Compared to a stovetop, the higher temperature will cook the rice faster, but the rice will lose some nutrients and fluffiness. On the bright side, it's easy to check on your rice frequently using this method.


Just as with any rice, you can add spices, butter, and salt to make it more exciting.
 If you are having trouble controlling your fire, the rice can continue to cook off the flames for a few minutes, especially if you cover the pot.
 Drain the rice in a colander or carefully tip most of the water out, using a wooden spoon to keep the rice in.
 Add more water if it's boiled off and cook a few minutes longer.
 Remove from heat and run cold water on the outside of the pot to stop the rice cooking. Remove the good rice from the center.
 Boil the rice uncovered for 6 or 7 minutes, then remove it from the heat entirely and cover with a tightly fitting lid. The steam should finish cooking the rice in 10â€“15 minutes with no risk of burning.

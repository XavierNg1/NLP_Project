 You will need these measurements when you are looking for furniture and cabinets.;
, Look for a space about 5 or 6 feet (1.5 or 1.8Â m) wide. The best kitchen work space will be 1 with a definite boundary, such as a wall or an empty pantry space.
 No office is complete without a computer, a monitor, an iPod charger, a printer and/or a scanner. This amount of electronics require a grounded power source, so hire an electrician and install outlets, if you do not have any nearby.
 Unlike ambient lighting, which provides the general glow to a room, task lighting is installed right above or near your work station. It should cast light on your keyboard or desk surface.


One option for task lighting is to install a pendant light from the ceiling. These lights hang down from above, so that they cast a light over the spot of your choice. You should hire an electrician to wire pendant lights into your ceiling.
Another option is to install a standing lamp or large desk lamp. As long as the lamps shed enough lighting across the desk, they can work well without requiring an electrician.
 Charging all of your important electronics at once can mean plugging in 5 or more different wires. You can buy docking stations that allow you to simply set your iPod, phone, iPad and other devices on a charging pad, making those wires obsolete.
 If you have a desktop computer, then buy a single-axis mount and hang it on your wall behind the desk. It may be able to fit comfortably between the desk and the cabinets, leaving extra desk room.

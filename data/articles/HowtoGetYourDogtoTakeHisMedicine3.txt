 When giving a liquid medication, check on the box to see if it says "palatable". This means that satisfactory or pleasant to taste. If the medication does say this, then try adding the medication (at its required dosage according to your vet and the instructions) to your dog's regular meal. Because the medication is designed to be tasty, the dog will likely eat his food quite happily and be none the wiser about the addition.
 If the medication does not say "palatable," then syringe it directly into your dog's mouth. To do this, draw up the medication in the dosing syringe or pipette. Use your non-dominant hand to gently hold your dog's mouth shut.Hold the dosing syringe in your dominant hand, and wriggle the nozzle part behind the upper canine (fang) teeth. There is a small gap here through which you can gently syringe the medication without the dog opening his mouth.Alternatively use the grip and method for opening a dog's mouth to give a pill described in Part I and syringe the medication straight onto the tongue.
Never squirt medication quickly. If your dog does not get a chance to swallow the liquid, the medication can go down into his lungs and cause a serious chest infection. If in doubt, dribble in about half a cc at a time, then pause and give the dog a chance to swallow in between, and then repeat., You could melt a certain amount of cheese depending on the dose of medicine (e.g. more medicine, more cheese and vice versa), and mix the liquid medicine with the cheese to make it more palatable for your dog.


If you want a less timely procedure, mix the liquid medicine with some applesauce or some peanut butter.

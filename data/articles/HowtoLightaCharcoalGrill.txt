,,, Wait to add the grilling grid until you are ready to cook the food.
 DO NOT GET LIGHTER FLUID ON YOUR SELF!! You have added enough lighter fluid when the charcoal briquettes are slightly shiny.
 Using a long match or a long lighter, light the charcoal briquettes in the grill. You are ready for charcoal grilling when they are mostly covered in ash and glow red. In general, plan on it to take about 15 minutes for the charcoal briquettes to be hot enough for charcoal grilling.
 Regardless of the type of food, the briquettes should spread out on the bottom of the grill slightly wider than the width of the food, to allow for even cooking. Use tongs or a spatula to spread the charcoal.


For thinner meat, spread the charcoal evenly on the bottom of the grill.
For thicker meat, make the charcoal higher on one side than the other. You will start cooking the meat on the side with more charcoal. When the outside is cooked to your preference, finish cooking the meat on the side with less charcoal.
 Using grilling gloves, carefully put the grilling grate in its place.
 The exact steps to cook the food will depend on what you are cooking.

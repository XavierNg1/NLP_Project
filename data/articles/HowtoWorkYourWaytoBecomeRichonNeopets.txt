 You're not going to make a million Neopoints your first week or anything.Understand that this guide is just a helping hand; you can read it, but the rest is all you.;
, Playing a few each day will earn you a good amount of Neopoints before you know it! Some games that will earn you some quick points are: Fashion Fever (900/day), Adver-Video (500-about 2500/day), Nickelodeon's Big Green Help (nearly 1500/day). There are many others; find your favorite.
 If you've got a good sense of humor, why not enter the caption competition?

, Here's a good method.Start by setting a goal for yourself. (For example: The first week, I will deposit 1000 Neopoints/day into the bank. The second week, 2000/week, and so on...)

, You work toward smaller goals, and it may seem easier.

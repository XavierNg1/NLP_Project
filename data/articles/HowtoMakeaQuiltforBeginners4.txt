 This isn't necessarily a fabric you used in your actual quilt -- it could even be an opposing color to spice things up. Each strip should be the length of one side of the quilt and a few inches (at least 7.5 cm) wide.
 There are a variety of way to do this, but the simplest way is outlined below:


Carefully trim off the selvage edges (the part that comes on the edges of fabric to keep it from fraying) of the borders themselves. Then lay 2 of the border strips across the middle of your quilt, lining up one end of the strips with the edge of the quilt. The other strip edges will hang over the side.
Place a pin in the border strips where the quilt ends. And then carefully trim with your ruler and rotary cutter where that pin marks.
 Fold the border strip in half, end to end, to find the center. Pin the center of your strip to the center of the edge of your pieced quilt top and pin the ends of the strip to the ends of that quilt side.


Space pins along the strip to secure the strip in place. It is not bad if your strip is slightly smaller than the pieced part of the quilt (the other two strips are longer), but this is why starting at the center and the ends when pinning is important.
 Pin opposite side of quilt and sew both borders on to the edges of the pieced portion. Press the borders open and flat working from the front side of the quilt.


Repeat the process on the other edges. Lay the 2 remaining border strips across the center portion of the quilt. Place a pin to mark where to trim, cut off the remnants, pin and sew. Press once more.

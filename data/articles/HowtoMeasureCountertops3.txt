 When measuring the length of one section of cabinets, run a measuring tape flush along the back edge of the section from one end to the other end.Round the measurement to the nearest ⅛ inch and record this measurement on your diagram or a separate sheet of paper. Repeat this process until you have measured the length of each section of your new cabinetry., When measuring the depth of your new cabinets, you must account for the overhang of the countertop. Run the measuring tape from the back of the cabinet to the front top edge of the cabinet.To account for the countertops’ overhang, add 1-½ inches to the measurement. Record this revised number on your diagram or a separate sheet of paper. Repeat this process until you have measured the width of each section of cabinets.To account for the overhang of an island, you must add 3 inches to the length and 3 inches to the width., To receive an estimate from a contractor for the cost of your new countertops, you need to provide an approximate calculation of the countertops’ square footage.


Calculate the area (or square inches) of each section by multiplying the length times the width of each section (Length x Width = Area).
Calculate the total square inches by adding together the areas of each section.
Calculate the square footage by dividing the total square inches by 144 (Total Square Inches ➗ 144 = Total Square Footage).

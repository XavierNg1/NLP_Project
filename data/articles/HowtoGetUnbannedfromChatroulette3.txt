 A proxy server or proxy site allows you to browse the Web through a third party server, thereby masking your own IP address. When a website attempts to ping your computer and read your IP, the website will receive a third party IP address, instead.


A few popular proxy servers include:

Anonymouse: http://anonymouse.org/anonwww.html

Change IP Country: http://anonymizer.nntime.com/

Free Proxy Server: http://freeproxyserver.net/ /
Warp Proxy: http://www.unblocked-proxy.com/




, Once you choose a proxy server, scroll down to the website address bar on the page and type the Chatroulette URL into it. Hit the "Go" button (or its equivalent) to be sent to the Chatroulette site.


Make sure that you actually attempt to chat using the proxy server. Your IP address may not be blocked from the homepage of Chatroulette, but you could run into problems once you try to chat.
 If the first proxy server you chose does not fix the problem, try a different one instead of giving up.


There is some chance that the server has a gap in it, causing your IP address to leak out to Chatroulette.
It is also possible that Chatroulette will identify the IP address as a proxy and block you for that reason.

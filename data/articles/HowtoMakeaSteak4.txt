 In a bowl, mix two cloves of fresh minced garlic, one eighth of a cup of your favorite steak sauce, a few dashes of Worcestershire, 4 tbsp of olive oil and a cup of dry red wine.


Mix the marinade up in a plastic Ziplock bag, add the steaks, and marinade overnight in the refrigerator. Don't forget to let the meat get back to room temperature before grilling.
Some people favor marinades as diverse as Italian salad dressing, barbecue sauce, soy sauce and mustard. If you'd put something on a steak, use it as a marinade beforehand.
 If you prefer, a dry rub of herbs and other seasonings can be a great addition to a cut of steak. Green herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano can be great on steak, while red pepper flakes, black pepper, coriander, and mustard seed can be surprising additions. Use flavors you like.


For something surprising and unusual, try mixing up a tablespoon each of fresh-ground or crushed fennel seed, anise, cinnamon, peppercorn, and clove, along with salt to taste.Lots of commercial dry rubs are available as well, which you can experiment with. They're easy to use and can be quite good.
 Take one half-stick of butter, softened, and mix well with peeled, chopped garlic, chopped herbs, and lemon zest. Form into a log and refrigerate.


Generously season your steak with salt and pepper on both sides and sear the steak in olive oil. In the last minute of cooking, take the log of compound butter and slice a nice thick piece to place on top.
 After grilling, resting, and slicing steak, chop up a handful of fresh parsley, cilantro, thyme, or rosemary to top the meat before serving. Fresh herbs make for an excellent addition to grilled meats, added at the last minute. They add aromatic flavor and bright color to the dish.
 In Mediterranean regions, grilled meats are rarely served without slices of lemon on the side, to squeeze over the top. Lemon can add a brightness and tanginess to grilled steak, especially with some chopped cilantro on top.

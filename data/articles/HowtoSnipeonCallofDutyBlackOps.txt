 The good thing about Black Ops is that there has been a drastic drop in count of snipers. The majority of players you'll meet online will be a ground player. So this can give you a small advantage, because you'll most likely be the only sniper in the game you're in.;
, The same moves and measures you sniped on MW2, WOW, and MW still apply. Nothing about the scope, shooting, or anything has changed whatsoever.
 The first is the Dragonuv, then WA2000. Then you'll go onto more advanced rifles, but they're bolt action which makes them easier to hit enemies with. The third rifle is the one you want to go for.
 Sniping overall isn't something for everyone. Some people get bored easily which can come with being a sniper (due to the laying around, and non-mobility. But whenever you get kills, it'll all be worth it. So positioning is a key factor here. You want to lie somewhere that is not easy to be seen in, preferably off the ground and has small holes in the bordering and sheltering so no one can shoot you easily. But if you're on the ground, then don't be afraid to lie on the ground. Sometimes, enemies will think you're a dead body. But if you are on the ground, you need the right camouflage to match the ground. I.E.: Arctic Level: Arctic Camo. Then it's all focus from there. When someone walks by you, pull the trigger (but don't assume an auto kill, you might miss and or just hurt them).
 Now starting off, sniping can be tricky and you'll wind up with fewer kills than the average ground players, but usually with fewer deaths which means a higher KTD(kill to death) ratio which can impress higher ranked players. But as you can become better, you'll go on to getting twenty,thirty, even forty kills a match! And with zero deaths!

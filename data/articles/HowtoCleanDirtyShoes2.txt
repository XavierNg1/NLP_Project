 Using a stiff bristled brush or an old toothbrush, gently removed any dirt from your leather shoes. Take care not to scrub too hard or you might accidentally scratch the surface of the shoe., Find a clean and dry cloth you can use to gently wipe away any grease, oil, or grime that might be on the surface of the leather. An old washcloth, dish towel, or hand towel works well for this purpose., Once you’ve used the dry cloth to wipe away grease and grime, wet a cloth with warm water and gently wipe down the surface of the shoe. Be sure you don’t saturate the leather or you can cause damage., It’s important that you give your leather shoes an ample amount of time to air dry once you’ve finished the cleaning process and before you wear them. Allow shoes to dry for at least 30 minutes in a space away from direct sunlight, heat, or air vents.
 Apply a cream leather polish with a soft cloth and allow to sit for a few minutes. Then take the cloth and buff the leather to a shine. This will help preserve and protect your leather shoes.

, Put scoring box next to plug and insert the circular end of the cord into the bottom of the scoring box. Plug the other end of the cord into the wall outlet.
 Place the reels 14 meters (45.9 ft) away from each other, 7 meters (23.0 ft) from the scoring device in each direction. Place the reels so the retractable cords of each reel are facing each other. Many people will have a pre-measured rope so that it is easy to set up distances. If using a pre-prepared rope, spread the rope out, placing the middle at the center of the scoring box. The front edge of each reel will be lined up with markings on each end.
 Insert one end of the box-reel cords (longest three prong plug cord) into the non-retractable side of the reel. Insert the other end into the scoring box using the outlet on the scoring box nearest to the reel.
 Properly securing the plastron includes two fastening points, one Velcros around the neck with the other securing around the waist.
 As you prepare to put on the jacket, place the end of one body cord in your dominant hand. Hold on to the cord as your put on the jacket allowing the body cord to feed through the jacket from the hand to the back. To securely fasten the jacket make sure to step through the leg loop and zip up the back.
 This will allow you to move forward and backward without moving the reel. Also make sure to fasten down this connection with the silver clip on the reel.
 The glove will go over the sleeve. The body cord will go under the glove, protruding out at the wrist. Make sure to leave enough slack to allow you to attach the body cord to the sword. See picture for clarification.
 SAFETY: Always keep track of where the point of the sword is pointing.

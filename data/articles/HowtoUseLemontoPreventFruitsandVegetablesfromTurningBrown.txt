 Since you may never know when you are going to need to maintain the integrity of cut fruit or vegetables for more than a few minutes.;
, In some cases you could pour lemon juice all over the produce and it wonâ€™t make any difference. Have a list of which fruits and vegetables will not turn brown with lemon:


Cut fruits include apples, pears, bananas and peaches.
Cut vegetables include cauliflower, potatoes, sweet potatoes, parsnips, and artichokes.
 Corrosion on the knife will accelerate browning effects so its in your best interest to select a cutting instrument that is not only extremely sharp but also 100% stainless steel.
 Before cutting fruit and vegetables, have your lemon base ready to go so all you will need to do is apply the citrus to the cut fruit immediately to stop the oxidation process.
 Cut first piece of fruit/vegetable and then either rub the surface with lemon or dip into saucer of lemon juice.


Avoid oversaturating the fruit or vegetable to avoid having it take on a strong lemon taste (unless that is your intention).



If you are planning to integrate the fruits and/or vegetable into a dish in the future, immerse in cold water until ready to use.

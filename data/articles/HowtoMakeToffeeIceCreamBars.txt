 Once done, with a spoon, pick a little up and test try (If kids are doing this too let them test try some too) and decide if it's 'toffee' enough. If not, add a little more, mix well, and test try a little more. Do the same over again if you think it doesn't taste like toffee yet. Put in freezer until use.;
, Make sure there is at least an inch left that is not covered with chocolate chips.
 Because the chocolate chips are not in a puddle when you take them out doesn't mean they are not heated.
 If the chocolate is still not melted enough put in for a little longer. Do the same thing with the spoon and again for shorter time if still not melted enough.
 Let a child crumble a little of the cut toffee on the bottom of the plastic box. With heated chocolate, pour a little in the middle of the plastic box. Spread with a spoon to cover all of the bottom.
 Shape the ice cream carefully with your hands into the shape of the box, but a little smaller. Place it in the middle of the box so there is still a little bit of room in the front, back, and sides.
 Do the same thing with all the other sides. At one side pour heated chocolate in while pushing it in. Do the same thing with the rest of the sides.
 Let a child sprinkle toffee on top.
 Repeat to make more toffee ice cream bars. Enjoy!

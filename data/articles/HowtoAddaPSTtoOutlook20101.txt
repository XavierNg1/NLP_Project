The ribbon is the new term for Microsoft Office applications' main toolbars. While the number of options may seem more limited than those in previous versions, it is simply that Microsoft redesigned the menus to make them more intuitive, concise and better organized. This includes the process necessary to create a PST file.
,, This will create a PST file.


You will be able to see where Microsoft Outlook is storing your main personal folder in the large section of this window. To preserve the organization and keep things simple, allow your new folder to be created in this same location.



If at all possible, use the same name for the PST file as you want to name the Personal Folder within Outlook. This will also help keep you from getting confused.

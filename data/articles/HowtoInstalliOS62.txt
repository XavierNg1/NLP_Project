 Just in case anything goes awry during the installation process, you want to make sure all your data is secure.
 You don’t have to connect it to the computer, but make sure it’s connected to a power source. Turn on your Wi-Fi. Software installations can be done over the air, meaning directly on your device without connecting to iTunes, but they do require a wireless connection.
 From there, click General > Software Update. Any available updates will be displayed here, and if there is a more up-to-date version available for your iOS, it will be listed.
 Your only option may be Download, and if that's the case, select it. If your device requires additional space to perform the download, you can select Continue when prompted and your device will temporarily remove some applications.Once your device has downloaded the proper iOS, if you only opted to download (not Download and Install) you will now have to install it. Still under Settings > General > Software Update, select Install. Enter your passcode if prompted, and agree to Apple's terms and conditions to continue.
 When it’s finished, it will restart itself. When you unlock your device, input your Apple ID and password if you are prompted, and then your phone will be ready to go.

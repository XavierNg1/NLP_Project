 Before you make any drastic changes to your diet or lifestyle, it is a good idea for you to speak to your doctor. Your doctor can help you determine the right amount of iron (and other nutrients) you need and can help you make a health-conscious plan., The best way to increase your MCH levels is to include more iron-rich foods in your diet. The amount of iron you need each day varies based on your age, sex, and other factors. Refer to this chart at https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-Consumer/ to determine the level that's right for you. Iron-rich foods include:

Spinach
Beans
Seafood
Red meat and poultry
Peas

, In order for your body to properly absorb iron, vitamin B-6 must be present. You can help to improve your MCH levels by making sure that you eat plenty of B-6, alongside iron.Foods high in vitamin B-6 include:

Banana
Wild tuna (not farm-raised)
Chicken breast
Salmon
Sweet potato
Spinach

, Fiber is an important part of any diet. For those with low MCH levels, increasing the amount of fiber you eat can help with the absorption of iron in the intestines.Foods high in fiber include:

Peas
Lentils
Black beans
Broccoli
Brussels sprouts

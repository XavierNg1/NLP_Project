You may find it easier to do the measurements with a partner, so they can keep your cat calm while you get the measurement. Then, place your cat on a home scale to obtain their weight. When you go shopping, see if the heated cat beds will comfortably fit your cat’s size and weight.If you have a kitten, you can look up the approximations for the full grown size and weight of your cat’s breed.
If you have two cats who like to sleep together, you should account for their size together and look for a larger bed.;
, If you have an indoor cat, you will have lots of options to choose from for heated cat beds and pads. For outdoor cats, there are also a variety of options for heated cat beds that could be placed in garages, barns or porches. Outdoor cat beds typically have a roof, whereas most indoor cat beds are not enclosed., You should consider the location of the cat bed, such as whether it needs to fit on a small table beside a window. If there are space limitations, such as a small area in your apartment where the bed needs to fit, you should write down the dimensions of the surface area where you want to place the bed., If your cat likes to sleep in a spot that is not anywhere close to an electrical outlet or if the bed is for a cabin without electricity, it is best to choose a self-heated bed or microwavable style pad. However, if there is an outlet close to your cat’s favorite spot, there are many styles to choose from., You can find machine washable heated cat beds and pads. Typically, you will just have to unzip the cover and throw it in the washing machine. With some models, you remove the heating element and then wash the bed. However, not all brands have this option, so keep an eye out for the machine washable versions.

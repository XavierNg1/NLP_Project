 Before you can apply makeup to give your Stardoll an anime look, you should change the facial appearance so that she can appear as cute as possible. Give her large eyes, light eyebrows, a small nose, pale skin, and an innocent-looking mouth.;
, Once you have adjusted her face, focus on her eyelashes. Apply white mascara in the corners of her eyes to help them shine. Place black mascara on her eyelashes. Don't worry about applying a certain amount, as more eyelashes gives your doll bigger eyes.
 Take a white eyeliner, and apply a generous amount in the corners of her eyes. This will enhance the glow in her eyes and help brighten them. Then, switch to a jet black eyeliner before applying it to her eyes without leaving a wing on the ends.
 Once again, focus on the corners of her eyes with a white kohl pencil. Layer it on top of the white liner and mascara. Then, apply black kohl eye pencil to the other areas of the eyes without worrying about it appearing perfect.
 Using a black eyeshadow pencil, apply it straight across the eyelid from the slight crease to the very end. Repeat for the other eye. Avoid making it too thick, or else your Stardoll will appear fake and overdone.
 Ombre eyebrows help them appear slightly thinner. To do this, stroke the ends with a light brown eyebrow pencil. Then, move onto the middle, running this streak from the middle to the ends. Finally, stroke the entire brow.
 For a dewy appearance, apply two strokes on each cheek with a medium-pink blush, including skin going down the cheekbones. Take a dark brown blush before applying three strokes on each cheek, going directly down the cheekbones. This will help her face appear slightly tighter and lifted.
 To help your Stardoll's lips appear soft and moisturized, apply a small amount of lip gloss to her mouth. This will be the final touch of her makeup.

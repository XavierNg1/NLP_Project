 If you are the sole tenant on the lease and you are not married, you have the right to make the decision. In fact, if her name is not on the lease you may be violating your lease altogether. However, if both of your names are on the lease, she has every right to remain in the home., If she does not have the legal right to remain in the home, consider giving her a written request to leave. This can be done by you or your landlord. The request should give a moving deadline.If she does have rights to stay (e.g. she is on the lease), you might still consider giving her a written request to leave. This will give you proof of an exact date that she was asked to leave if things go to court.
Most states require you to give a certain amount of notice when you ask someone to move out, such as 30 days. Follow your state's eviction laws to ensure things go smoothly and you don't run into legal trouble down the line.
 If your girlfriend is abusive or you fear she will become violent, aggressive, or retaliate against you, then you need to protect yourself. It may be best for you to give your girlfriend a formal eviction notice and stay somewhere else temporarily while she moves out. You may also need to contact the police or request a temporary restraining order against your girlfriend.

Make sure you are never alone with your girlfriend and change the locks once she has moved out.
 If you have followed all of the previous steps but she is still unwilling to move you can go to the police. They may evaluate the lease agreement and make a determination themselves. Or, you may have to go to court to settle the dispute. This should only be used as a last resort.


If she is on the lease or deed, the police are unlikely to remove her from the house.

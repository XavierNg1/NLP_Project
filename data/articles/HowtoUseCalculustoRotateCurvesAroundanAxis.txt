Let f(x) = sqrt(x) and a = 1 and b = 4.


 


Subdivide the interval into n subintervals by a partition P, and choose n points wi, one in each subinterval. Draw n approximating rectangles with base and altitude f(wi), i = 1, 2, 3, ... , n; a typical one of these rectangles is shown in the diagram as Rect HGFE.
Revolve the region R about the x-axis to generate a solid of revolution, using the n rectangles to sweep out n right circular cylinders. The cylinders swept out by the typical rectangle, eg. Rect HGFE, is shown in the following Diagram; since the radius of its base is f(wi) and its altitude is ∆xi, its volume is ∆Vi = π*^2 *∆xi.





Note that if you want to create a washer type of form, the formula changes to π * ∫ba *dx -- so it is a definite integral of the difference of the squares of the external function, f(x), and the internal (hole) function, g(x).
Note also that you may let f be a continuous function on and if the region bounded by y = f(x), the x-axis, and the lines x = a and x = b lies in the first quadrant, the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving this region about the y-axis is V = 2π * ∫ba x*f(x)*dx, another definite integral.
 If the arc of the curve y = f(x), from the point (a, f(a)) to the point (b, f(b)) is revolved about the x-axis, a surface of revolution S is swept out.

Find the area of the surface of revolution by first partitioning into n intervals , i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n.
Let Qi be the point on the curve whose coordinates are (xi,f(xi)), and denote the point (a, f(a)) by Q0.
Then let the broken line formed by the n chords Qi-1Qi of the curve be revolved about the x-axis; it sweeps out a surface which approximates S, and this approximation improves as the norm |P| of the partition decreases.
Consider that the lateral area of a frustum of a cone, having slant height s and radius of its bases r1 and r2, is π*(r1 + r2)*s. Thus each chord Qi-1Qi, as it revolves about the x-axis, sweeps out the lateral surface of a frustum of a cone whose area is π**|Qi-1*Qi|.
Consider that, because of the formula for the arc distance (see the article Approximate Arc Length Using the Distance Formula), this may be re-written and defined as follows:

Let f and f' be continuous on with f(x) ⩾ 0 for a ⩽ x ⩽ b. The area of the surface of revolution swept out by revolving about the x-axis the segment of the curve y = f(x), from the point (a, f(a)) to the point (b, f(b)) is: 2π * ∫ba f(x)*sqrt(1+f'(x)^2)*dx.

Example: Find the area of the surface of revolution generated by revolving about the x-axis the segment of the curve y = sqrt(x) from (1,1) to (4,2).
Solution: By substituting f(x) = sqrt(x) and f '(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)) in the above formula, you get: 2π * ∫41 x^.5 * sqrt(1+(1/(2*sqrt(x)))^2)*dx =
π * ∫41 sqrt(4x +1) dx (by dividing by sqrt(4) =
π/4 * ∫41 (4x +1)^.5 * d(4x +1) =
π/4 * /(3/2)41 (by integration) =
π/4 * 2/3 * (17^1.5 - 5^1.5) = π/6 * (17^1.5 - 5^1.5) = 30.8465 √

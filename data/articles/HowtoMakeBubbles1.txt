 Toy stores, drug stores, and dollar stores carry bubble solution that usually comes in small plastic bottles with plastic bubble wands. Buying a ready-made kit is probably the quickest, easiest way to go from bored to bubble-blowing, and when you're finished you can screw the cap back on and put it aside until you want to blow bubbles again.

, If you have liquid soap and water, you can make bubble solution. Just mix up 1 part soap to 4 parts water in a jar, cup or bowl in preparation for bubble-blowing. There are a few things to keep in mind when you mix up a homemade solution:









Different soaps result in different types of bubbles. Experiment with dish soap, body soap, baby soap, and other soapy liquid washes.
If you dilute the soap too much with water, the bubbles will be thin, and may break almost as soon as you blow them.
 Once you have a basic bubble solution mixed up, you make it unique by adding ingredients that change the texture and color.









Adding a little sugar, corn syrup, corn starch, or glycerin can thicken the solution and result in stronger bubbles. Experiment with different amounts of sugar or starch to make bubbles that last a long time before they pop.
Add a bit of food coloring. Bubbles naturally take on a beautiful iridescent rainbow hue, but you can also customize them and make them your favorite color. Simply add a couple of drops of food coloring to the mix.
Experiment with other ingredients. Ever wondered if you could blow a bubble with something inside it? Try adding tiny flower petals, glitter, or other small materials to the mix to see what results you end up with.

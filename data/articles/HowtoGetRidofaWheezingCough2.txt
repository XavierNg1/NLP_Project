Let the tea steep for about five minutes, then remove the tea leaves or tea bag from the water. You can drink a few cups of herbal tea every day. Some good choices include:


Slippery elm
Garlic
Peppermint or spearmint
Ginger
Cayenne and black pepper (use just a pinch of each!)

, Drinking a mixture of warm water and honey can help to loosen up mucus and reduce coughing.Lemon juice is a good addition because it contains vitamin C.


Keep in mind that children under one year old should not have honey., Consuming soups and broths can help to increase your fluid intake and may make it easier to get rid of your cough.The warm liquid can help to loosen up mucus in your throat and lungs that may be aggravating your cough.


Try eating chicken noodle soup, vegetable soup, or just some plain beef broth.
 Turmeric mixed with warm milk has been used as a traditional treatment for colds and coughs, so this remedy is also worth trying.Mix ½ teaspoon of turmeric with one cup of warm cow’s milk.


If you are not a fan of cow’s milk, then try mixing turmeric with almond milk, rice milk, or hemp milk instead.

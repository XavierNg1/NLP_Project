 Bright, neon colors were very popular in the 80s, but you can use a neutral color as well, such as black, white, or grey. You will be cutting this shirt up, so make sure it's one you don't mind permanently altering. A blank shirt would work best, but you can use a decorated one too.
 Begin by making a snip 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from each shoulder seam. Connect the snips with a curved line, just below the collar. This will give you an off-the-shoulder look.You can cut through both layers of fabric at the same time for something quick and easy.
For a more professional finish, cut the front neckline lower than the back.
 You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to turn your shirt from a t-shirt to a tank top. Cut the sleeves off following the seam on the shirt body, not the sleeve. You can make the arm holes bigger by cutting a littler further down past the armpit., You can cut as much of the hem off as you want. For a high-low look, cut the front hem higher than the bottom one., It needs to go about a quarter of the way up the shirt. The tassels need to be Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide.Try to cut through both layers of fabric. This way, you can be sure that the fringes are even on both sides of the shirt. You'll also save some time.

If you made a high-low hem, cut the fringes separately. Make sure that they are the same length (however many inches/centimeters long you choose) on both sides of the shirt.
 Twist the tassel into a tube, then thread it through a plastic bead, such as a pony bead. You can add as many beads as you want; 1 to 3 would be ideal. Knot the tassel below the bead.You can also use a large yarn needle to thread the beads onto the tassels.
Alternate the colors and the number of beads on the tassels.
 You can leave the shirt as is, or you can decorate it further. If the shirt is blank, consider adding an iron-on transfer. You can also paint the shirt instead using fabric paint.

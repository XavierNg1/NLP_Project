 The newborn puppies will have a harder time nursing if their mother isn’t staying still enough for them to latch on to her nipples. If the puppies’ mother isn’t staying still, hold her gently and tell her to stay. As the puppies nurse, her body will produce a hormone called prolactin that will help her relax and stay still., Soon after giving birth, a mother dog will lick her nipples to put saliva on them. This saliva will give off a scent that will encourage her newborns to find her nipples and start nursing. Since bathing will remove the saliva, do not bathe the puppies’ mother after she gives birth., A mother dog needs plenty of fresh water to stay hydrated. The better hydrated she is, the better able she will be able to produce colostrum for her newborns. Since she may not want to leave her newborns to get up and get water, place a water bowl close to where she is lying down.Refill the bowl with fresh water regularly.

 When you see an exponent of two, you know that you need to square the number. To square a whole number, you multiply it by itself.For example:


52 = 5 × 5 = 25;
, To square a fraction, you multiply the fraction by itself. Another way to think about it is to multiply the numerator by itself and then the denominator by itself.For example:


(5/2)2 = 5/2 × 5/2 or (52/22).
Squaring each number yields (25/4).
 The actual order that you multiply these numbers by themselves doesn’t matter as long as you have squared both numbers. To keep things simple, start with the numerator: simply multiply it by itself. Then, multiply the denominator by itself.


The numerator will stay on top of the fraction and the denominator will stay at the bottom of the fraction.
For example: (5/2)2 = (5 x 5/2 x 2) = (25/4).
 When working with fractions, the last step is always to reduce the fraction to its most simple form or turn the improper fraction into a mixed number.For our example, 25/4 is an improper fraction because the numerator is larger than the denominator.


To convert to a mixed number, divide 4 into 25. It goes in 6 times (6 x 4 = 24) with 1 leftover. Therefore, the mixed number is 6 1/4.
 If you are working with a negative fraction, it will have a minus sign in front of it. It is good practice to always put parentheses around a negative number so you know that the “–“ sign is referring to the number and not telling you to subtract two numbers.For example: (–2/4)

, Square the fraction as you would normally by multiplying the numerator by itself and then multiplying the denominator by itself. Alternatively, you can simply multiply the fraction by itself.


For example: (–2/4)2 = (–2/4) x (–2/4)

, When a minus sign is present, the entire fraction is negative. When you square the fraction, you are multiplying two negative numbers together. Whenever two negative numbers are multiplied together, they make a positive number.For example: (-2) x (-8) = (+16)

, After you have squared the fraction, you will have multiplied two negative numbers together. This means that the squared fraction will be positive. Be sure to write your final answer without the negative sign.Continuing the example, the resulting fraction will be a positive number.
(–2/4) x (–2/4) = (+4/16)
Generally, the convention is to drop the “+” sign for positive numbers., The final step when doing any calculations with a fraction is to reduce it. Improper fractions must first be simplified into mixed numbers and then reduced.


For example: (4/16) has a common factor of four.
Divide the fraction through by 4: 4/4 = 1, 16/4= 4
Rewrite simplified fraction: (1/4)

, It is usually easier to reduce fractions before squaring them. Remember, to reduce a fraction means to divide it by a common factor until the number one is the only number that can be evenly divided into both the numerator and denominator.Reducing the fraction first means you don’t have to reduce it at the end when the numbers will be larger.


For example: (12/16)2

12 and 16 can both be divided by 4. 12/4 = 3 and 16/4 = 4; therefore, 12/16 reduces to 3/4.
Now, you will square the fraction 3/4.
(3/4)2 = 9/16, which cannot be reduced.
To prove this, let’s square the original fraction without reducing:

(12/16)2 = (12 x 12/16 x 16) = (144/256)
(144/256) has a common factor of 16. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 16 reduces the fraction to (9/16), the same fraction we got from reducing first.
 When working with more complex equations, you may be able to simply cancel one of the factors. In this case, it is actually easier to wait before you reduce the fraction. Adding an additional factor to the above example illustrates this.


For example: 16 × (12/16)2

Expand out the square and cross out the common factor of 16: 16 * 12/16 * 12/16
Because there is one 16 whole number and two 16’s in the denominator, you can cross ONE of them out.


Rewrite the simplified equation: 12 × 12/16

Reduce 12/16 by dividing through by 4: 3/4

Multiply: 12 × 3/4 = 36/4
Divide: 36/4 = 9

, Another way to solve the same example is to simplify the exponent first. The end result is the same, it’s just a different way to solve.


For example: 16 * (12/16)2

Rewrite with the numerator and denominator squared: 16 * (122/162)
Cancel out the exponent in the denominator: 16 * 122/162
Imagine the first 16 has an exponent of 1: 161. Using the exponent rule of dividing numbers, you subtract the exponents. 161/162, yields 161-2 = 16-1 or 1/16.


Now, you are working with: 122/16

Rewrite and reduce the fraction: 12*12/16 = 12 * 3/4.
Multiply: 12 × 3/4 = 36/4
Divide: 36/4 = 9

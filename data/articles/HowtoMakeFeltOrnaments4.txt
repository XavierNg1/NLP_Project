 Not all felt ornaments need to be stuffed. You can also be creative and make a variety of different types of ornaments out of felt. For instance a stacked felt tree ornament is quite simple to make:Select a colour and cut felt into squares of different sizes. Begin with 6 ½ inch squares, followed by 6 ¾ inch squares, followed by 6 1 inch squares, etc. Continue cutting bigger squares, increasing the size by ¼ inch each time, until you reach 1 ¾ inch squares.
Stack the squares in piles based on size. For example, stack all 6 squares that are 1 ¾ inch in one pile, and then all squares that are 1 ½ inch in another pile etc.
Then run a looped thread and needle through the centre of each stack, starting with the largest squares and moving to the smallest.
At the top glue two ½ inch squares together to look like a star on top of the tree. Leave an extra loop of string for hanging the ornament.
Once complete rotate the squares so that they stagger looking like a tree.
 You can also make a felt ornament that requires no sewing. Simply cut out a desired shape, such as a circle to look like a bauble ornament. Then decorate the bauble by gluing on sequins and other smaller pieces of felt. Alternatively, you could cut out a red piece of felt in the shape of a candy cane and then glue smaller stripes of green and white felt to the front to make it look like a colourful candy cane.Once complete, attach a ribbon to the top of the ornament so that it can hang. Cut a hole at the top of the ornament and loop a ribbon through the hole.

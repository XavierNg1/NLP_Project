 Including how they look, act, BF, BFF, what the other characters think about them, etc.;
,, Characters getting thrown on teams like Team 7 (usually instead of Sakura) is way too overly-used. Try not to do it! You can make you're own team! (It's usually 1 girl and 2 guys.) If you're worried about not having enough interaction with the other Naruto characters or your planned love interest, don't fret! You'll most likely be living in the same village anyway so you'll be able to see them all the time!

 It doesn't have to be perfect!

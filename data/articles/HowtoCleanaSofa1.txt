 Before getting into the deep-cleaning, you want to remove any surface debris or particles from the surface of the sofa. Use a dust-buster or a hose attachment on a full-sized vacuum cleaner to clear the sofa.


Use the long, narrow attachment to get into the crevices.
Vacuum all the surfaces of the cushions.
Remove the cushions and vacuum the base of the sofa.;
, If there are any spots that have heavy dust or dirt caked in, use a stiff-bristled brush to break up the spots and vacuum up the released dirt.Rub vigorously, but not hard enough to damage the fabric.
 Although some companies make products specifically for households with pets, your average vacuum cleaner won’t be able to remove lint or pet hair. Use a lint roller to remove what the vacuum cleaner can’t.


Work in a systematic grid across the entire surface of the sofa to ensure you don’t miss any hair.
 Many sofas have exposed wood or other materials, and you want to make sure you give them attention too. Find a cleaning product appropriate for the surface you want to clean. An all-purpose surface cleaner will suffice if you don’t have a surface-specific product on hand.


If the spray zone is broad, spray into a paper towel and simply rub that over the surface to be cleaned. This will prevent getting unwanted chemicals on your fabric.
 These tags usually have instructions for what cleaning products you should use on the fabric.

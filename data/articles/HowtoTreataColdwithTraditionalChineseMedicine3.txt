 Acupuncture is another means of treating the common cold using traditional Chinese medicine. In this method of healing, certain points are stimulated with needles in order to encourage blood flow to the head, neck, chest, and shoulder areas. Acupuncture works by releasing endorphins and natural steroids like cortisol, to manage the pain and discomfort caused by the common cold.
 If you cannot get acupuncture treatment from a specialist, there are some massage techniques you can apply to yourself at home. These techniques trigger some of the same pressure points as acupuncture, albeit less effectively. At home you can do the following:


Rub your forehead from the middle to the sides (10 times).
Knead the area on the side of your eyes (10 times).
Rub your temples (10 times).
Knead your nape or the back of your head (10 times).
Grasp the back of your neck (10 times).
Rub your shoulders (10 times).
The area between your thumb and index finger should be nipped and kneaded (10 times).
 This person is capable of conveying energy throughout the body of an afflicted individual by means of meridians, by patting the patient, or by his own bare palms. They can transmit Qi energy to non-living objects and solutions which can be touched or taken by the patient in order for them to absorb the Qi energy and restore balance within the body system.
 Expert practitioners of Chinese medicine can employ a variety of other methods to help alleviate your cold. Other methods used to treat common cold include moxibustion or the burning of mugwort, and applying the remains to the skin to promote healing.


Additionally, massaging, cupping, or drawing blood towards the exterior of the skin with the use of oxygen depleted suction cups can provide relief from a cold.

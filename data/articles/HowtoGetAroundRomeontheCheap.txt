 Rome is really best seen on foot, anyway. Do not bother to rent a car while you are there.


Take the subway if you need to get across the city and it is too far to walk. It is much cheaper than a cab, and it works similar to the subway systems in most cities.;
, Unless you get breakfast for free in your hotel, you should save your appetite for later. If you are hungry, grab a banana or an apple from one of the corner fruit markets for less than 1 euro.
 You will probably need to share a bathroom with lots of other people, but you will pay a fraction of what you would pay in a hotel.


Stay in a hotel near the train station. If you want budget accommodations but do not want to stay in a hostel, check the hotels near Rome's Termini station. They are clean and much cheaper than the luxury hotels closer to the main city attractions.
 Rome is full of classic ruins and old churches which can be enjoyed free of charge.


Explore the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain, 2 popular attractions that cost nothing. You can also see the Coliseum, the Forum and other ruins for no charge.
Visit Rome's churches. There are over 900 churches in Rome. Stick to the major basilicas and historical churches such as St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, St. John in Laterno, Basilica of Santa Maria in Maggiore, Santa Croce and Saint Paul Outside the Walls.
See the Vatican Museums, including the Sistine Chapel on the last Sunday of the month. The Vatican admits people for free on Sundays from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Get there early and prepare to stand in line.
 Rather than sitting down to an expensive dinner in Rome, there are plenty of local trattorias and cafes that serve good food for less money.


Make a picnic. Buy some bread from a bakery, and stop by a deli for some great cheese, Parma ham or salami, and a bottle of wine for just a few euros. Take the meal to a park or other scenic spot.
 This is often cheaper than exchanging cash in a bank or tourist center.

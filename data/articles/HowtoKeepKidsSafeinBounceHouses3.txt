 Commercial-grade bounce houses are generally heavier than the ones you may buy in the store. On concrete, a commercial bounce house should be weighted with at least 100-pound weights on each corner. When the bounce house is set up on grass, it should be secured with heavy-duty metal stakes.The metal stakes used to secure the bounce house should be 30 to 40-inch steel stakes. This secures the bounce house and keeps it in the ground. Bounce houses shouldnâ€™t be secured with short plastic stakes.For example, a commercial bounce house may weigh over 200 pounds while one purchased from a box may weight 30.
 Wind can be very dangerous to bounce houses. Multiple incidents have reported that strong winds have blown bounce houses away. When using a bounce house, you should tell your children to get out of the bounce house if the winds range from 20 to 25 miles per hour or higher.You may also consider deflating the bounce house in high wind conditions.
Before putting up the bounce house, check the wind conditions. You can do this via your local TV weather report or an online weather app.

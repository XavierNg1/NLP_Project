 Sweep off any branches, leaves, or other debris. Organic material collects water and decays when left in place, creating growing places for mold and other substances that can degrade the deck. Remove the debris as quickly as possible.
 Use a cleaning solution to remove stains and prevent wear and tear. Use a paint roller, hose, or broom to evenly apply a store-bought cleaner. Apply hydrogen peroxide the same way to remove mold.Don’t use a pressure washer, as this can abrade the wood.
Substitute bleach for oxygenated bleach or hydrogen peroxide to limit damage to the wood.
Water your plants before and after cleaning and cover them with plastic.
 Mold setting in or your last coating running thin are both signs you need to apply a new coat of sealant. On a dry day, use a paint roller to apply two thin coats of a deck sealant from a home improvement store. Switch to a paint brush to reach smaller areas.Spray nearby plants with water before and after you finish and coat them with plastic to ensure the sealant doesn’t damage them.
 Look at any cords for your deck’s lighting fixtures. Check for exposed wires that pose a fire hazard. Turn on the lights to make sure they work. Clean off any lighting elements with soap and water.
 During your inspection, look up. Overhanging vegetation drops branches that can fall on someone or the deck. The shade and the plant matter left behind also promotes mold.

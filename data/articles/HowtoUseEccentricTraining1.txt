 To do eccentric overload training, you need to focus your efforts on the lowering part of each of your exercises. By focusing on the eccentric or lowering part of the exercise, you can build more muscle, strength, connective tissue and flexibility.You need to lower the weight in a controlled rhythm.If you are doing a bench press, focus on the lowering of the bar to your chest.
If you are doing squats, focus on the part where you move your body into the starting position.
If you are doing bicep curls, focus on the lowering of the weight away from your body.;
, Accentuated eccentric or eccentric overload training involves pushing yourself in both the concentric and eccentric phases of weight training, but with slightly more emphasis on the eccentric phase.Since it takes a long time to recover from this type of training, you should only do it once per week., In order to see any benefits from eccentric training, you need to use more weight during the eccentric (lowering) phase than in the concentric (lifting) phase. There are three main ways of increasing your weight load during the eccentric phase:Lift a weight with two limbs and then lower it with one limb.
Ask your weight lifting partner to press down on the weight during the lowering phase.
Use lifting aids such as eccentric hooks that you attach to the weight prior to lowering., When you are lowering the barbell after a bicep curl or other exercise, you should take no longer than three seconds. Your muscles will not grow as much if you use longer eccentric phases during your weight training.Faster eccentric contractions are associated with more muscle building potential.

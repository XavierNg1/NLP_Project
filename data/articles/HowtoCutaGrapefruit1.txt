 Place the grapefruit on its side on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut about 1/4 inches (.6 cm) away from the round points at the end of each grapefruit. This will make the grapefruit easier to section.






;
, The other end can rest on one of the ends you cut off for extra cushion.
 Use a knife to make these slices all the way around the edges of the grapefruit. This will make it easier to peel the grapefruit. Turn the grapefruit about 1/8 of a turn each time you cut into another section. Keep doing this until you've made the cuts all the way around the grapefruit.
 Now that you've made the slices, it'll be a bit easier to peel the grapefruit. Just run the knife along the skin of the grapefruit, peeling off every little cut section at a time until all of the skin is peeling off. If there's any remaining skin after you've gone around the entire grapefruit, slice the remaining white part off before you continue.
 Now that you've peeled off the skin, you can use a knife to cut out each individual section until you've separated the grapefruit by sections. You can enjoy the grapefruit on its own or in a fruit salad or a variety of other salads.

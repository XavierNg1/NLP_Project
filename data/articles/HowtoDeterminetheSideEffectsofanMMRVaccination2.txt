 Due to high fever, infants sometimes experience convulsions or febrile seizures. During a seizure, the childâ€™s body may stiffen, they might lose consciousness and their arms and legs will twitch. These typically occur in children between the ages of six months to three years.Take your child to the doctor after they have a fit to ensure that it is the vaccine causing the seizure, and not another disease.Febrile seizures are extremely rare, only occurring in one in every 1,000 to 3,000 doses of the vaccine. While febrile seizures are scary to watch, they aren't usually dangerous or long-lasting. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or if the baby seems very ill.
Children who receive the combined MMR vaccine are twice as likely to have febrile seizures as those who get the separate shots., In very rare causes a child may develop a small rash of bruise-like spots known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The spots may also look like tiny bright-red dots, which are called petechiae. This is a side-effect of the rubella vaccine and develops in one in every 24,000 to 30,000 doses.There is a greater risk of developing ITP from a measles or rubella infection than from receiving a vaccine.
The rash typically gets better on its but you should still consult your physician as soon as possible.
 The rubella vaccination can cause temporary arthritis in adults. One in four adult women who receive the MMR vaccine will experience joint discomfort following. This side-effect mostly impacts teenage and adult women. Take a common pain reliever to treat symptoms.These symptoms generally begin one to three weeks after receiving the injection and can last for about two days. These symptoms are rarely long term.

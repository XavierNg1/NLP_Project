 These are crucial to your success as you will need the Eve to use your plasmids and beat him down and the health kits for obvious reasons!;
,


Atlas will change elements through the fight, so you will need these for your battle. They are the keys to your success.
To change your powerups, go to the nearby Gene Bank, turn right and you will see it.
 With your powerups, you'll defeat Atlas easily just by using a wrench. How's that for cred?

, Run up to him and hit A to start the battle. He will knock you back and transform into his fire-element form.


You will have to the ADAM three more times after this, but only after you’ve backed Atlas to his restraining table.
 This will distract Atlas enough for you to make your next move.


Whatever you do, don’t get him too close to you; the dummies will help keep him away.
 Do side steps while hitting him, that way, you will avoid damage.


After dealing enough damage, he will respawn back to his station.
 When Atlas’s health is depleted, he will return to his station. He is vulnerable at this point, so take this chance to drain ADAM from him.


Each time you drain more ADAM from Atlas, he will come back as a different element. The first was fire; the next two will be ice and electric.
When he comes back as an ice element, repeat steps 2 to 3 using your Wrench until you’ve depleted his health. Then drain more ADAM from him.
When he comes back as an electric element, repeat steps 2 to 4 until you’ve depleted his health.
 When you’ve drained his 3rd ADAM, splicers will come out to attack you. Ignore them if you can. Just focus your attacks on Atlas until you have a chance to drain his last ADAM to finish him off.


With some patience (especially on hard mode), you will be able to combine all these steps together and pull off a full on assault on Atlas, and he will be defeated in no time! Happy hunting!

, A cut scene will then play. Congratulations! You have defeated Atlas!

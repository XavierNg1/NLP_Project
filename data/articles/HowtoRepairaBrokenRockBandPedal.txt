 That half will be going underneath the pedal, so the top plate will stay in place, but will be short enough to not interfere with the spring that bounces the pedal back into place after you press it with your foot.
 Be VERY careful here. Don't drill through and of the ribbing on the underside of the pedal. Chances are you will have to drill through the orange, so make sure the hole is in a place that will not affect the movements of the pedal. If you don't have a drill press or an electric drill, ask one of your friends that does. If you're still in school, your school or university/college probably has a shop, ask the teacher if you could use the machines. It's a good idea to use either clamps or a friend to hold down the pedal while you make the holes.
 Put the bolt through the hole and secure it in place with the nut. Be careful not to over tighten the bolt, or you run the risk of breaking the pedal. Again.

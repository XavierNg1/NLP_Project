 If you see a pimple forming, do not squeeze it or try to pop it. Squeezing can actually push the infected material deeper into the skin, worsening the pimple and causing it to become more red and inflamed. It is also more likely to result in permanent scarring if you pick at it., Before washing, applying a warm, damp washcloth to the area will help to clear your pore. This will improve the chances of your pimple clearing up naturally as soon as possible.
 Pimples are worsened by clogged pores and oily skin, so washing twice a day will help to keep the zit as short-lived as possible.


Note that it is important not to rub your skin too harshly, particularly over the sore or affected area. This can worsen the potential breakout.
 Applying a thick layer of any product will trap bacteria, dead skin cells, and oil inside the pore. Keep your skin clean and follow your preventive skincare regimen as closely as possible, wearing makeup only when needed.


Note that, for some people with acne problems, even non-comedogenic products clog their skin and cause pimples.
Test all makeup products and replace them if they start to clog your skin.

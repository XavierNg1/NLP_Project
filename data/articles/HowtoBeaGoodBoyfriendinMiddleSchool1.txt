 No one likes being sick, but a cold can be made a bit better when someone you care about is there. Go with them to their doctor’s appointments, bring them some soup; just be there to help them through it. It’ll show that you care, and that you’re willing to risk catching their cold in order to be with them., Good gifts don’t have to be expensive. Think about the things that they like and try to find gifts that fit within that. You might have to do some snooping around with their friends or family to find out what they like.


Stuck for ideas? Make your own! Duct tape roses, a jar of love notes and baked goods are all great examples of personal gifts that don’t cost very much. They’ll appreciate the work you put into your gift., Pay attention to the little things to show that you care! If they get a new haircut, tell them it looks great. If they’ve got a new outfit on, they’re probably hoping that you’ll notice it. Mention these things when you notice them and always in a nice way.


If complimenting a haircut, think about specifics, like “I like what you did with your bangs.”
When you want to compliment an outfit, try saying things like “I love that color on you” or “I love that skirt.”, They’ve probably had their friends longer than they’ve been your partner, and there’s a good reason they’ve chosen to keep them around. You don’t have to be friends with them too, but you shouldn’t be mean to them or ignore them. Definitely don’t try to break them up.


If their friends are mean or taking advantage of your partner, then you should talk about it with an adult., Your partner might think you don’t care about their feelings, or about the relationship! It’s not like you need to stop talking to everyone else, but if you're constantly smiling and touching someone else, then your partner might feel hurt.

 A 2 1/2-quart (2 1/2-liter) bowl should be large enough, but if possible, you should consider using a 3-quart (3-liter) bowl to make sure that the ingredients do not overflow.;
, Use in any cloves, cinnamon, orange peel, or ginger you wish to use, and toss lightly with a spoon or fork to combine. You can skip one of these ingredients if you prefer the taste of sorrel juice without it, but you should include all four for the most accurate taste. Do not add sugar or agave yet.
 Stir to mix slightly.
 Allow it to sit in a sunny location for 8 hours or overnight. The sun warms the mixture enough for the flavors to combine, but even if you do not have a sunny location to sit the mixture in, allowing it to settle overnight should also mix the flavors thoroughly enough.
 Use a strainer with small gaps to separate as much juice as possible, since strainers with large gaps may allow sepals, orange peel, and cloves to get through.
 The red liquid should escape into the pitcher, leaving behind the solid ingredients, such as the sorrel sepals.
 Use one or the other, but do not use both.
 Serve with ice, and store any remaining juice in a sealed pitcher with a lid.

 Runline gambling is a combination of moneyline and a point spread system. This type of betting is only recommended for the most serious baseball aficionados. Runline requires a prior knowledge of stats, trends, and pitching performances. Runline brings a familiar element to sports bettors who favor wagering on football and basketball based off adding or losing points. Points translate into runs for baseball., The key to understanding runline is to understand baseball’s scoring technique. A run is a point awarded when a player successfully makes it around the bases before three outs. The favored team is presented as a negative, like -1.5, and the underdog is attached to a positive value, +1.5.


With a 1.5 odds, the favored team needs to win with 2 runs or more, and the underdog team must lose by one run or win the game., Some bookmakers won’t have runline bets as an option since it isn’t as popular in baseball. You can always ask your bookmaker if it’s possible to place a runline. Look at the odds and compare them to your preferences.


For example: A bet on Cincinnati would require that the favored team, Cincinnati, to win the game by two runs to cover the spread and pay out the bettor. If the final score was Cincinnati 4 Chicago 2, $55 laid on the Reds would pay out $50 for a grand total of $105 at the window.
In contrast, if the final score was Cincinnati 3 Chicago 2, the Chicago runline bet would pay out as Chicago was given -1.5 runs. If the runline final score is Cincinnati 3 Chicago 3.5. In that situation, $50 laid on the Chicago would result in $110 at the window - $50 bet plus the $60 runline.

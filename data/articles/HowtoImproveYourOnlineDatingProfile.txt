Do the photos best represent you? Do you even have photos up? It’s important to post pictures since most members will only look at profiles with photos. It’s also important to upload your best quality photos. Otherwise, you’re taking a gamble with potential hook-ups who may pass on you solely based on a bad picture. If you’ve had the same photos up for awhile, upload new ones. Include appealing photos that show a variety of sides: playful, sexy, flirtatious, seductive etc. Don’t upload photos of you standing next to your sports car or swarmed around half naked girls. Women consider these type of photos extremely tacky. Another great way to catch someone’s eye is to periodically rotate the order of your photos. Active members will often notice.;
, A new handle and headline could help spark interest in your profile. Do you have a catchy headline or is it blah?

, Are your essays brief or long? Do you come across as confident or arrogant? Do you suggest in your essays that you’re open to meeting a variety of people or are you being picky? Most online daters don’t have the time to read long essays, and the majority is also turned off by arrogance. Another reason you might not be getting results is because your requirements are too rigid. The more flexible you are with looks, age, height, weight and location, the better your chances of getting responses. Another indication that it’s time to redo your essays is if you’re not getting the kind of responses you want. Remember to be as specific as you can about what you’re looking for.
 Have your buddies look it over and ask for their honest opinions. After all, who knows you better than your friends? They might be able to spot things in your profile that you wouldn’t have noticed or realized. An even better idea is to have a female friend take a look at it, since they’re the sex you’re trying to appeal to.

 At least ten or twenty people is even better. You'll also need several decks of cards, sets of chips, and people who are willing to be dealers.;
, Decide which type of poker will be played (Texas Hold'Em is a popular one), what the buy-in will be, what the prize pot will be worth, and whether people who lose can buy themselves back in (and for how much).
 Let everybody know what's going on and invite everyone you can. The more people enter, the more money the charity will make.
 This will depend on how many people you have, but separating people into tables of six to ten players will work. Do not lock the tourney line-up in advance of game day; take seat reservations in advance, but a tourney will see a lot of walk up players on game day if it is well-publicized.
 Everybody should begin with the same amount of chips.


People will play until they run out of chips, and then they can either buy back in (paying more money for a fresh stack of chips) or quit.
As play continues, players will bust out and choose to leave. When you are playing multiple tables, it is unfair to have a large disparity in the number of players at each table. During play, the tournament director should re-seat players at different tables to keep a reasonable balance. If at a three table tourney where 10 players start on each, a particular table experiences a rash of bust outs and is left with 7 players while the other two lose only one between them. Players at the table of 7 are playing 30% more hands in the blinds, which causes irritation to the players. Refer to Reseat Players in Poker Tournements.
 Keep going until one person has won.
 Whatever money doesn't go to the winners is for charity.
 Hope you had fun.

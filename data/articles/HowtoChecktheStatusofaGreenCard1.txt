 This is a 13-character identifier that you can find on any notice of action USCIS has sent to you. It should begin with three letters and then have 10 numbers., You’ll check the status of your case at this website: https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do. Bookmark it so that you can revisit the page if necessary.
 Enter the number in the box underneath “Enter a Receipt Number.” Remember not to include the dashes, though you can include asterisks if they are part of your identifier.
 After you enter your receipt number, you should be told about the status of your green card. Generally, you will receive the green card 120 days from the date you entered the U.S. on your immigrant visa if you paid your immigrant visa fee before you entered the country.


If you paid after you entered the country, then you can expect to receive your green card within 120 days after you pay your fee.

 For some breeds, swimming is not instinctual, and water inspires fear rather than pleasure. That fear can become dangerous when it hampers your pet’s breathing and ability to stay afloat. If your dog panics around water, you should definitely get them a life jacket.The list of breeds that are typically water-shy is longer and more various than you might think. It includes everything from English Bulldogs to Chihuahuas to certain types of Terrier. As a general rule, if your dog has short legs or weighs less than 15 pounds, chances are they should have a life jacket.Toy dogs are especially prone to being less than enthusiastic about water. If you have a pet that belongs to the Toy group, it’s advisable to get them a life jacket.
 Pooches with low body fat and thin coats will find it challenging to regulate their core body temperatures and keep themselves afloat. If you have a trim dog, it’s wise to get them a life jacket.Canines with low body fat and short fur include breeds like Greyhounds, Salukis, Whippets, Dobermans, and Boxers.
 If your pet is not in a peak state of fitness, it’s a good idea to get them a life jacket. They might be a water dog, but illness, old age, lack of exercise, susceptibility to overheating, and/or obesity can seriously affect their swimming abilities.If your dog has a seizure disorder, heart condition, or respiratory condition, it’s probably best to keep them out of the water altogether.
 If you’re taking your dog out on a boat or exposing them to potentially dangerous waters, it’s always wise to have a life jacket for them. Likewise, if there’s a chance that your dog will be swimming for a prolonged period, they should have a life jacket on.It is not a legal requirement to have a life jacket for dogs on a boat (as it is for all human passengers), but it is highly recommended.
Significant safety risks include water that is deep, fast-moving, wavy, and/or prone to currents or undertows.

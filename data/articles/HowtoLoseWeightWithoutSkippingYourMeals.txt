 Weight loss will depend on decreasing your total calorie intake - not skipping meals. Cut out a few calories each day to help you lose weight.


It's typically recommended to cut out about 500 calories daily. Over the course of a week you might lose about one to two pounds.If you skip a meal, you might think that is an easy way to cut out about 500 calories. However, when you skip meals your blood sugar drops, your energy level drops, and so does your metabolism.If you shave off just a few calories from each meal or snack you can end up with a 500 calorie deficit without having to skip entire meals.;
, Skipping meals won't help you lose weight. Eating regular consistent meals every few hours will.


There's been some back and forth over which amount of meals is better for weight loss. Some experts recommend only three meals daily while others say to eat five to six. There are benefits to both.
Eating more regularly might seem like it will increase your metabolism and make weight loss easier, but this has been proven to be untrue.However, you may find you have less cravings and your appetite is controlled more efficiently if you eat more regularly.
You may only need to eat three meals daily if you choose the right combinations of foods at each meal.
You may want to try a few days of only three meals daily and a few days of five to six smaller meals daily. Stick to the meal pattern that helps you lose weight, satisfies your cravings and hunger levels and is easy to manage.
 Many studies show that both protein and fiber can help you feel more full and satisfied throughout the day when you're on a diet.Increase both protein and fiber to help you lose weight while still being satisfied.


Make sure you eat one to two servings of protein at each meal. You need to have protein spread evenly throughout the day. Choose leaner proteins to help you stay within a lower calorie goal each day.
Measure out a 3 to 4 oz (80 to 120 grams) serving of lean proteins like poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, seafood, legumes, tofu or low-fat beef.Many foods are high in fiber and when combined with protein can increase your overall satiety. Go for 1 oz or 1/2 cup (125 ml) of whole grains, fruit or vegetables at each meal.For the longest feelings of satisfaction or satiation, combine a higher protein food with higher fiber foods.
 Fruits and vegetables are great for weight loss. Bulking up your meals with these low calorie foods can make following a lower calorie diet a little easier.


Fruits and vegetables are known to be very low in calories. In addition, they have a fairly high fiber and water content. By bulking up meals with more fruits and vegetables, you can feel more physically full and satisfied for few calories.Some health professionals suggest making at least half of your meals and snacks a fruit or a vegetable. This is a great idea to help decrease your overall calorie intake but keeping the volume of your meals the same.
Measure the portions of your fruits and vegetables. Go for one cup (250 ml) of vegetables, two cups (500 ml) of leafy greens or 1/2 cup (125 ml) of fruit., In addition to modifying your diet, regular aerobic exercise can help boost and support your weight loss. Start exercising more regularly or consistently.


Most health professionals will typically recommend participating in at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week.However, if you're interested in faster weight loss, you can safely do up to 300 minutes of cardio each week.
In addition to weight loss, regular cardio is responsible for: reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease, reduce your risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome and decrease your risk of high blood pressure and stroke.Include cardio exercises like: jogging/running, swimming, dancing or cycling.
 Weight training or resistance training is a type of exercise that can help build and support lean muscle mass. Used in combination with aerobic exercise, you can support your weight loss efforts.


Weight training offers slightly different benefits compared to aerobic exercise. It can help support or build lean muscle mass which can increase your body's metabolism and ability to burn calories plus reduce your risk for osteoporosis by increasing your bone density.Add in one to three days of strength training. Over time, it can help your body burn more calories at rest. Make sure to work each major muscle group and aim for a 20 minute workout per session., Inadequate amounts of sleep can make you feel hungrier throughout the day. This can make weight loss difficult.


When you don't get enough sleep, your body produces additional hormones that can increase your feelings of hunger and appetite all day long. This may cause you to eat larger portions, snack or eat the wrong types of foods.Aim for at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Try going to bed early so that you can get in more hours before your morning wake up.
 Like lack of sleep, stress can make weight loss difficult. It can increase your hunger and make dieting less effective over time.


Controlling and managing stress can help you lose weight more easily. Specifically, it can help manage your appetite.When you're overly stressed, you have increased hunger and cravings for high fat, higher calorie foods.Consider adding some relaxing and de-stressing activities to your weekly routine. Try: going for a walk, meditating, talking to a friend or doing yoga.
If these activities don't help or you continue to have more difficulties managing your stress, consider seeking the help of a behavioral specialist.

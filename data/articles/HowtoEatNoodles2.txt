 You will want to use a two-handed method when eating the noodles in soup.To eat noodles in soup, put the chopsticks in one hand and a soup spoon in the other hand. Ladle a spoonful of broth into the spoon, and then pick up noodles with the chopstick. #*Now, put the noodles in the spoon and then eat the noodles and broth from the spoon, while using the chopsticks to guide the food into your mouth.
 Some Chinese people eat noodle soup by using the chopsticks to lift the noodles into their mouths and then alternate by eating spoonfuls of the broth.

Start by snapping the chopsticks apart. Take one stick in your dominant hand and hold the narrower tip like you would a pencil. You want to hold the stick so that only an inch of the thicker end is sticking out of the area between your forefinger and thumb.
This is the base stick, which doesn't move as you manipulate the other stick between your index finger and thumb to clench the noodles between the two sticks.
The same general process is used to eat noodles with chopsticks that aren't in soup broth. Asian countries such as China, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand use chopsticks to pick up the noodles and deposit them in a large spoon; then eat the contents.
 It depends on the culture. In some Asian cultures, slurping your noodles and soup as you lift them to your mouth with chopsticks is not considered rude. In other countries, it's not done as often, though (such as in Thailand).


In some cultures, such as in Japan, it’s also appropriate to pick up the entire soup bowl and to drink or slurp down the remaining broth in it.
Slurping noodles actually has a practical purpose. It’s done because the breath cools down piping hot soup before you eat it.

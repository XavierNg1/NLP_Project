 A mother dog and her puppies need a clean, warm, and quiet place to nurse. Make sure you keep the temperature constant, and provide the mother and puppies with plenty of blankets and pillows for warmth. If possible, give the dogs a separate space in the house, partitioned by a door or gate.;
, It is critical that you do not separate a new mother from her litter. The mother should be with the puppies at all times to encourage proper feeding habits and ensure the puppies receive adequate nutrition. Allow the mother time away from the puppies to defecate and urinate, but then return her to her litter., Sometimes a mother dog cannot nurse her litter because she does not have enough milk available. This can sometimes be complicated by dehydration. Try giving the mother dog warm or lukewarm water. You can also give her chicken broth, as the salt may increase her thirst., If it appears as though your mother dog is not nursing her puppies, as she should be, you can gently encourage her to do so. Put the puppies up toward the mother dogâ€™s teats. Allow the puppies to nurse., If the mother dog is reluctant to nurse her litter, or if the puppies are exhibiting signs of malnutrition, you should set up an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible. A vet can help diagnose the root of the issues, as well as help you set up a manual feeding plan for the puppies.

 Worm grunting, sometimes called worm charming, is the process of using vibrations to entice earthworms out of the ground. For this activity, you will need your worm container, a wooden stake that’s about two feet long with one pointed end and one flat end, and a one-inch thick metal file (known as a rooping iron).Alternatively, you can use a handsaw if you don’t have a rooping iron, but you will likely also need a hammer to drive the stake into the ground.
 A shady field or wooded area with damp soil is the best location for worm charming. Somewhere near a running stream or small body of water is even better.
 Use the rooping iron or hammer to drive the stake about halfway into the ground.
 To create vibrations that will drive the worms from the ground, you need to recreate the vibrations that burrowing moles make as they dig through the ground looking for worms to feed on.Run the file (or the blade of the handsaw) over the flat top of the stake at a medium pace.


As the earthworms sense the vibrations, they will make their way to the surface to escape the predator they think is near. Be ready to gather the worms as they surface and collect them in your container.

 Avoid shriveled, dried up or moldy berries. Avoid soggy strawberries too as this means they are past their prime. A good strawberry should be firm and shiny. (Choose organic, if available, as strawberries are listed on the "Dirty Dozen" list of fruits and veggies most pesticide-laden.)


Some cooks believe smaller strawberries have more flavor due to a higher concentration of sugars.;
, Rub the berries gently under running water to make sure each berry is clean and free of as much soil as possible. Most strawberries sold at the grocery store are fairly clean so a good rinsing should do the trick.
,, Sweeten with a sprinkling of superfine sugar if desired, and use within two hours of preparation. Keep the strawberries refrigerated until ready to serve.
 They will keep for up to 7 days after purchase. Do not wash and prepare the strawberries until ready to use.

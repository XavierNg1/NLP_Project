 Learning your own values, and what's important to you, can make what others think of you far less important. When you know your priorities and feel comfortable with who you are, you'll be less apt to care what others think.


Make a list of attributes that you like about yourself as well as values you aren't willing to compromise. This can give you certainty when others are pressuring you to change something about yourself and worry less that people are judging you., Many times when we are worried about what others think of us, it prevents us from trying new things, or even old things, we enjoy. If you find yourself unwilling to try something new because you are afraid you'll look silly and be judged, picture the worst case scenario. You'll see that the worst case scenario is usually not that bad., Don't ask people to weigh in on you and your ideas, especially people who tend to be overly critical. Choose a select few people that you trust and know aren't overly negative for feedback and forget the rest.When you do seek reassurance, try asking a different question. Rather than asking "What do you think?" ask "How can I make this better?"

, If you have co-workers, friends, or even family who are constantly weighing in on what you do negatively, this can make you more prone to care about others' opinions. Instead of reeling over negative things people say, try to remove the perpetuators of negativity altogether.If that's not possible because you see them constantly, then try to block out what they say by reminding yourself of your values and worth, regardless of what others think.
 Part of taking yourself too seriously has to do with being worried how others perceive you. Realize that some people may not like you, and that's okay. Keep being who you are, and enjoying it.

 If a little glycerine is put in the water, the bubbles will last longer (see how to make bubble solution).;
,,, Two children, one from each side, play at a time. Each stands on his side, blows the bubble from the pipe and blows it toward the opposite side, and over the rope if he can. If it goes over the rope without breaking, he has won one point for his side, if not, his side has lost.
 The tally is kept as each set plays, and the side that has the most points, wins, and surely deserves a prize.

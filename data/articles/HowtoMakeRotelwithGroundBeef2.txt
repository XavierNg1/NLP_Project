 Place the beef and chopped onion in a large skillet and cook the two ingredients over medium-high. Continue cooking for 10 minutes, or until the beef is fully done.


Use your spatula or a wooden spoon to break up the beef as it cooks, separating it into small crumbles.






Note that you can substitute half the ground beef for ground turkey if you want a lighter, healthier option.






When the beef has finished cooking, drain off the grease. You can do so easily be pouring the contents of the pan through a colander. Make sure to return the mixture to the pan when done.
 Stir in the undrained Rotel, cumin, chili powder, and oregano. Cook on medium heat for 3 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.When ready, most of the liquid should have evaporated off the ingredients in the skillet.
 The taco mixture is done and ready to serve. Enjoy it inside soft tortillas or crispy taco shells.


The taco mixture could also be transferred into serving dishes and enjoyed with tortilla chips.






Add your favorite garnishes to the meat mixture. Guacamole, black olives, sour cream, green onion, shredded lettuce, and shredded cheese are a few options worth considering.






Note that this dish can be made up to one day in advance. Simply reheat it on the stove or in the microwave before serving.

 Are you a traveller, simply after basic board and a vegetarian breakfast? Many temples offer very simple accommodation commercially, especially in Japan. These may be found through lists of accommodation, by contacting the temple, or by word of mouth. They will normally charge a small fee.;
, Many temples regularly hold 'retreats', which may last anywhere from a day to several years. They may be free (with optional donation), or a price may be charged, depending on the type of lay support the temple receives. It is best to ask a temple administrator or resident teacher about these. Some retreats can be very intensive.
 Again, ask the appropriate party at the temple.

 It is often best to let severe diarrhea run its course so your body can rid itself of the bacteria causing the diarrhea. But you can also try taking medications to help slow down your diarrhea. You can get Pepto-Bismol over-the-counter at your local pharmacy. It has mild antibacterial effects and slows down your diarrhea. Follow the label instructions for dosage information.;
, Psyllium fiber can be an effective antidote to severe diarrhea as it can help to soak up water in your intestines and make your stool more firm.


If you are an adult, have 2.5 to 30 grams (0.09 to 1 oz) a day in a divided dose. You can take psyllium when you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
If you are a child, six to 11 years old, have 1.25 to 15 grams (0.044 to 0.53 oz) a day orally in divided doses.
 Sometimes, severe diarrhea can be caused by medication you are already taking for other medical issues. Talk to your doctor about your medications to rule them out as the causes of your severe diarrhea.


If your medication is causing the severe diarrhea, your doctor may switch your medication or suggest a lower dosage.

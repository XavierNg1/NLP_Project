 Make sure that you are holding the bow grip directly in the center.
 Try to pull the string back in a single, smooth motion, keeping your arm steady.
 This is called your anchor point and is the point at which the arrow is drawn furthest back before release.
 The peep sight is located on the bowstring itself and the forward sight, which is made of a several pins and a balance level, is located on the front of the bow.


The forward sight pins are pre-set to distances with the highest pin set at 20 yards (18.3Â m) and the lower pins working out, usually in 10-yard increments. You want to set your pin to the same distance that exists between you and your target.
Make sure you can see through the peep sight and line your target up with the pin that you just set on the forward sight.
Check to make sure that the bubble in the level on the forward sight is resting exactly in the center.
 Do your best to hold the bow steady and keep your dominant hand pulling straight back as you release.

 You can do this manually or with a hacksaw.Sand down any sharp edges when you are done.
 Hold it with the front of the spoon facing up, and bend the handle down to make a 90-degree angle. With the handle perpendicular to the floor, the bowl of the spoon should face skyward.
 If you are right handed, the bowl should point to your right; if you are left handed, it should point to your left. The handle should lie flat against your palm, and be angled so that it is concealed behind your wrist, rather than jutting out visibly under your hand. The rest of your fingers will form a visual shield, blocking the handle of the bent spoon from view. Make sure they are held together, with no cracks showing between them., The idea is to create the illusion that the broken handle is attached to the bowl of the bent spoon. Try to grip it more with the tips of your fingers, so that you will be able to roll back your grip on the broken handle, loosening it while still holding on to the bent spoon firmly.
 It will droop downward, creating the illusion that it is bending. Make sure not to loosen your grip so much that you drop the broken handle.
 With a quick flourish, “bend” the broken handle all the way into your palm—making sure the two handles don’t clunk together audibly—and slide the bent spoon up out of your fist with your other hand.
 Hold it up for them to see, tap it against the table a few times, or invite a member of the audience to examine it. While their attention is on the bent spoon, slip the broken handle into your pocket.

, Select Image → Duplicate in the menu bar, or just select File → Save As and save the file under a new name.
 At this point, a screen will pop up indicating your image's current size.


You'll see two boxes in the Image Size window: Pixel Dimension and Document Size. For the purposes of resizing the image, you only need to worry about the first box, or Pixel Dimension.
 Unless you change the default settings, typing in one dimension for width will automatically adjust the height setting. This is what the small lock icon indicates.
 Once unchecked, you should be able to type in separate values for both the width and the height.
 Changing from "pixel" to "percent" will allow you to adjust the size in proportion to what it was before.


For example, if your file was originally 2200 pixels wide and 1400 pixels high, choosing 50 percent will reduce the file to 1100 pixels wide and 700 pixels high.

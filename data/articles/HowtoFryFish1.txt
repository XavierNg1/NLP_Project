 Salt and pepper fish is only lightly battered, so the freshness of the fish really impacts the dish. Select fish filets that are firm, bright in color, free of bruises and spots, and not leaking liquid.









The fish should have a fresh saltwater smell that isn't too "fishy." If the smell makes you wrinkle your nose, the fish aren't fresh.
Make sure the fish you buy are boneless. You can test them by pressing your fingers on the flesh and feeling for small pin bones.;
, Run cool water over the fish fillets to rinse them clean. Remove any skin or scales that may still be clinging to the fish. Use a small pair of pliers to remove any stray pin bones.
 Salt and pepper fish is served in bite-sized pieces, rather than whole filets. Lay the filets on a cutting board and use a sharp butcher knife to cut them into bite-sized squares about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) across.









Cutting the pieces too small will result in overcooked fish.
If you wish to serve filets instead, skip to the next step.

, Then, look to the bottom right and tap on Search.
 Or, you can perform a general search by entering Anonymous Text. Various results will come up. Tap on an app of your choice, then tap GET (most of these apps are free), then Install.

 Once the app has finished installing, tap on Open. Then, you'll be asked to log in or sign up. Tap on sign up, then enter your phone number. Keep in mind that you'll have to enter your real phone number in this step. You'll likely receive a text from the app with a confirmation code. After you've successfully registered, the app will ask you to create your new, fake number. Or, you can choose to have the app randomly choose one for you.


Keep in mind, that some apps like Burner are free to download but will require you to purchase credits in order to send anonymous texts.
 Once you've set up your texting app, simply write a message from within the app. Enter your contact's phone number, then simply hit Send.


Your contact will receive an anonymous text.

 Food allergies may cause bloody diarrhea. If your vet believes this is the cause, you will be instructed to change the cat’s diet. If the cat has a food allergy, they will be given a food without the ingredient they are allergic to. Some cats may need fiber added to or fat decreased in their diet.Never change a cat’s diet suddenly. Always slowly phase out one food and replace it with the new food.
 If the bloody diarrhea is due to a parasite or bacterial infection, the vet will prescribe medication. Antibiotics are commonly given to cats. If the infection is serious, the antibiotics may have to be given intravenous instead of orally. Dewormers may be given to treat or prevent parasite infections.Anti-inflammatories may be given to help reduce inflammation.
Immunosuppressive drugs may be given to cats with inflammatory bowel disease. Anti-anxiety medication may be given to cats with irritable bowel syndrome.
 If the cat has a blockage from a foreign body, the vet may perform surgery. Surgery may also be the treatment if the cat has cancer and the vet wants to remove the tumor.

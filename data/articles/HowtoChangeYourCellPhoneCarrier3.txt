 Provide the PORT code along with your personal information to the new carrier. You must submit this information before the date you received when you requested your PORT number. After submitting the information, you will receive your new SIM card.

You may be charged up to ₹ 19/- for the porting process.
 After you provide your information to your new provider, you will need to wait 7 days for the master clearing house to process your account. The changeover to your new SIM card will occur after the 7th working day during the nighttime.
 Once the changeover has occurred, you can begin using your new SIM card on your phone. You cannot change providers again for at least another 90 days.

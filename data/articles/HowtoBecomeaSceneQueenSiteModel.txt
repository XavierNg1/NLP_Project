 Yes, your style can evolve as you get further into modeling, but establish a style you're going to have for a while.


Your own style could involve such approaches as: Glittery rainbow makeup, neon clothes, a certain unique pose, and so forth.
Develop a cute and unique style that's not a lot like any other site model.
Be sure to have clean teeth, perfect make-up, and smooth hair in your pictures.;
, Costumes are cute and normally become the most famous site models.
 Sites such as Facebook, Formspring, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr and Photobucket are fine if you want to become super popular.


It is recommended that you make at least a few sites, consisting of a Facebook, Formspring, YouTube, and Photobucket page.
 You need a substantial portfolio, otherwise viewers won't take you seriously and no one will want to use you as a great popularity example if you have very few photos.
 Also shoot a few cute webcam pictures. Take different pictures in the mirror, outside, in your room, standing on your dresser, etc.
 You can edit them to fix blemishes or dark spots and everything like that but less is better.
 Make it clear what your style is and that you're a scene queen.
 Reply to all fan mail, be nice.
 Viewers love the new. Try to set up a certain time you upload new pictures each week or two weeks. For example, take about 100 pictures (edit and publish around 50) every other Saturday or Sunday.
 YouTube is a great place to upload videos of makeup tutorials (this can get your signature look really famous), slideshows, or proof videos are great to do on YouTube! This shows you're authentic and that you are giving back to the audience that loves you.


Good videos to do on YouTube include: daily hair routine, make-up routine, proof video, room tour, music you listen to, picture slideshows, what's in my purse?, and so forth.

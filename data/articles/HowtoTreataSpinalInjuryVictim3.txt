 Though many victims of head or neck trauma experience immediate symptoms of spinal injury, this is not always the case. Sometimes there are no immediate signs but as bleeding and swelling put pressure on the spinal cord, symptoms develop.Victims of potential injury should be monitored closely. It’s best to go to the hospital right after injury, but if not then seek immediate medical care if the injured person develops late symptoms of:


Changes in sensory perception, like numbness and paralysis, which may worsen gradually.Gradual inability to control bladder or bowel, such as “leaking” urine or becoming incontinent.
New onset of erectile dysfunction or changes in genital sensitivity.Increased or new difficulty with walking, balance or coordination., If you or a loved one are at risk of spinal injury after an accident, go to the emergency room or at least see your doctor for testing. Your family doctor can perform sensorineural testing, manually testing muscle strength and ability to feel light touch. More definitive tests are CT scans, X-rays, and MRIs., The injury victim of spinal trauma will initially be stabilized in the hospital. After the hospital stay, however, long-term rehabilitation will begin. The rehabilitation team can involve physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, nutritionists, and social workers.This can be a physically and emotionally challenging time for the victim.


Provide emotional support and help however you can, whether that’s making frequent visits to play cards, walk the victim’s dog, preparing meals, or just being available to talk about their struggles.

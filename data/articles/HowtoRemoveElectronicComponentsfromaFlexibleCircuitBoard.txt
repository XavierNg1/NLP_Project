 In order to melt the solder, preheat a soldering iron (25W or 30W capacity, not more that that) for approximately five to ten minutes.;
, While the iron is heating, clean its tip with the help of a wet sponge. Wipe the sponge two or three times in order to thoroughly clean the tip.
 In this step, you will need to locate or roughly mark the components that you need to take off the flex PCB and identify their terminals.
 From a spool of desoldering braid, unroll approximately 1 inch (2.5Â cm) and place it on the board in such a way that its tip is pressed over the solder and one leg of the electronic component on the PCB.
 Place the tip of the heated solder iron on top of the desoldering braid in such a way that it will cause melting of the solder around the electronic component that is to be removed. The melted solder will get wicked into the braid and the leg of component will come off of the circuit board.
 As soon as the solder gets absorbed in the desoldering braid, you need to take the iron and braid away from the flexible circuit board to avoid undesired melting of solder surrounding other components.
 In order to remove the component completely, repeat steps 5 and 6 and take off other legs of the component. Once the component is completely free, let it cool for some time and then lift it off the board. If the electronic component is very small in size, then you can use a fork or tweezers (forceps) to pick it off the board.

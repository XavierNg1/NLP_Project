 You need to prepare baking sheets to place your pralines on to cool. Take two flat baking sheets and cover then with aluminum foil. Butter the aluminum foil.
 Put your sugar, cream, and corn syrup into a large glass bowl. Stir the mixture together until you dissolved the lumps in the sugar.


You can use any microwave safe bowl if you don't have a glass bowl.
 Once you've stirred the ingredients. Place your bowl in the microwave. Cook the mixture on high for 13 minutes. Carefully remove it from the microwave. The bowl will be extremely hot.
 Put the butter, pecans, and vanilla in the bowl. Stir them with a spoon. Continue to stir them for around 1 minute. You know that you have stirred the mixture enough when the texture becomes less glossy.


You can chop your pecans or leave them whole. That is up to you.
This recipe was modified for the microwave, but it can also be made on the stove. Cook everything but the nuts and vanilla in a saucepan until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes before you add the nuts and vanilla. Follow the rest of the recipes as it is.
 Right as you finish stirring, you have to start spooning the mixture onto your prepared sheets. Using a tablespoon, drop heaping tablespoon sized pralines onto the baking sheet. Continue until you are out of mixture. Let them cool to room temperature. This should take about 20 minutes. Serve and enjoy.


Add 1-3 teaspoons of cream if the mixture cools and hardens while you are spooning them out.
These pralines are best the first day they are made. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container for up to four days.

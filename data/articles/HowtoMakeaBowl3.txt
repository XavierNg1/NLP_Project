Tear strips of newspaper into small pieces.
Fill a bucket about a quarter of the way with the pieces.
Add hot water to cover the pieces.
Let cool. Once cooled, mash with a wooden spoon until the pulp turns mushy.
Process in the food processor in small batches. Each processing should end in a smooth pulp.
Place the processed pulp into a sieve. Press down hard to remove all liquid.
Add one cup of PVA glue to the pulp in a bowl. Mix well. The pulp will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for a few days.
 Cover the bowl with plastic kitchen wrap.


Be sure to continue the wrap over the rim of the bowl.
 If possible, place on a stand, such as a pitcher or jug.
 Make sure it covers every part of the bowl. Aim to keep the layer even all over, at least 1cm/1/2 inch thick.
 Leave for at least 2 days, possibly longer in a more humid environment.
 Peel off the kitchen plastic wrap.
 Add patterns if wished. The bowl is ready for display once it has dried. As with a papier-mâché bowl, this bowl is suitable only for display or holding objects, not for eating from.

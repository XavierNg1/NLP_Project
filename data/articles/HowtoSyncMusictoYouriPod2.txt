 Do so before connecting your iPod in order to avoid recognition problems.
 Make sure that you are not accidentally using a USB port that is not part of the computer such as a keyboard USB port or an external USB hub.


Be sure that no other USB devices are occupying any of the other ports.
 Be sure you are using the Apple Dock Connector to USB port cable that came with your iPod.


If your computer has USB ports on the front and back, connect to a port on the back of the computer.
If iTunes does not recognize your iPod when you connect it, try closing and re-opening iTunes.
If it still does not recognize your iPod, restart your computer entirely and start over.

 Peel 1 tbsp (15 mL) fresh ginger and two cloves of garlic, then finely chop along with 3 scallions.Feel free to add additional spices. Consider 1 tbsp (15 mL) sesame oil and 1 tbsp (15 mL) sesame seeds to match the other East Asian ingredients., Mix the flavorful ingredients together with 1/4 cup (60 mL) olive oil and 3 tbsp (45 mL) soy sauce.
 Pour the marinade into a zip locked bag or a wide dish, then place the salmon in the marinade. Refrigerate, turning fillets occasionally, for 30–60 minutes. If you continue to marinade past that point, the texture of the fish may be compromised.


Because the marinade was in contact with raw fish, it should be discarded after use, or brought to a boil before using as a sauce.
 If you like, you can create a glaze to brush onto your salmon for additional flavor during cooking. A simple glaze that pairs well with this marinade is a mixture of 2 tbsp (30 mL) honey, 1 tsp (5 mL) soy sauce, and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) Sriracha. Feel free to experiment with the amounts until you find a flavor you enjoy, keeping in mind the glaze may seem overpowering when tasted on its own, rather that eaten on the salmon.
 Consider pan-searing your salmon to a temperature of 125–140ºF (52–60ºC) on each side.If you do not have a thermometer, avoid overcooking by cooking only skin-side down, briefly cooking the flesh side for only 15–30 seconds once the salmon is opaque but still mostly juicy.


You may eat the skin of the salmon, or remove it after cooking.
You may also grill, bake, broil, or poach your salmon after marinading.

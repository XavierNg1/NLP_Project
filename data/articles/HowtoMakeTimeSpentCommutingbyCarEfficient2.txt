 Planning ahead has been shown to be an effective way to reduce stress and increase happiness.The ride to work is a great time to think about the day to come and to plan out your schedule. The ride home is the perfect time to reflect on what you’ve accomplished, what still needs to be done, and how you will do it.
 Just because your hands are on the wheel doesn’t mean you can’t get some serious work done. A hands-free headset and voice-to-text program for your phone makes it easy to write anything from brainstorming notes to letters to reports to the next great American novel. Indeed, many great novelists, including Dostoevsky, Dumas, Dickens, and Tolstoy dictated their works, so you’ll be in good company. Most smart phones come with a built in voice-to-text function, but for more accurate transcriptions, consider these apps:Google Keyboard – Android; free; speech recognition so it learns with every use; can be used without a network with the right voice data packages.

Dragon Dictation – Android / iPhone; free; requires a network.

Evernote – Android; free; records both voice and transcription; requires a network.

Voice Assistant – iPhone; $2.99; speech recognition so it learns with every use; autocorrect for grammar and spelling; requires a network.
 Whether you are working on ideas for your job, hatching your own business plan, or outlining a novel, your car commute offers you a great opportunity to talk your way through ideas. You can purchase a voice recorder or use your smart phone. Better yet, use a speech-to-text program like Dragon, so you won’t have to transcribe your recording later.
 You don’t need your hands to talk. Try scheduling your commute so that you can make business calls that don’t require you to consult your computer or texts. Be sure to use hands-free equipment. It is the law in 19 of the 50 states of the U.S., and it is always a safer option.

 The number you purchase should be commensurate with the number of dehydrator trays you have. If you plan to do it in the oven, two to three mangos will cover a baking tray.;
, If you depress the skin with your thumb, a ripe mango will have some give to it. An unripe mango will be very hard.
 Slicing them is a sticky process and a mango slicer will reduce your chances of cutting yourself.
 Slice about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the centerline down through the mango to extract the “cheeks.” Turn a cheek so that the peel is facing down and slice parallel lines down from top to bottom.


Be careful not to cut through the skin at the back.






Flip the mango cheek over and peel off the skin.,, Try not to take too much time between slicing and placing the dehydrating trays inside, so you can preserve the nutrients in the fresh fruit.
 Make sure there is some space between each slice for air to move through.
, Crack the door of the oven to let air flow through. Dehydrate for 10 to 14 hours.
 Place them in an airtight glass jar or in plastic bags. Keep them in a cool, dry and dark place to preserve freshness.

, Choose a natural one, or one that (as well as being moisturising) has no harsh chemicals in it. Massage the cleanser into wet skin, and follow the instructions on the product, before rinsing of with warm water.


Use rose water as an alternative.
 If you have any special creams for dry patches, now's the time to apply them, before picking a thin daily moisturiser for sensitive skin. Just apply a thin layer of this, massaging it in with circular motions.
 This will help protect your skin, and if you choose a moisturising cream for dry and sensitive skin, it will also help keep your skin hydrated throughout the day.
 Only apply a little, but if you need extra cover up, use concealer or highlighter.

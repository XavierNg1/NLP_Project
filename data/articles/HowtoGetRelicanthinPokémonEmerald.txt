 These balls are 3 1/2 times as powerful as a regular Poké Ball against underwater Pokémon (e.g. Relicanth); that's almost twice as powerful as an Ultra Ball.;
, False Swipe is a 40 power move that will never knock out an opponent (it will instead leave them with 1 HP), perfect for catching Pokémon.


Grovyle or Sceptile. If you started with Treecko, level it up to level 53 as a Grovyle or 59 as a Sceptile to learn False Swipe. You can also TM it False Swipe.
Nincada. Catch a Nincada on Route 116 (uncommon) and train it to level 25 without evolving to teach it False Swipe.
Trade. Alternatively, trade a level 46 Farfetch'd, level 33 Cubone, level 39 Marowak, level 16 Scyther or Scizor, a Smeargle that Sketched False Swipe, or a level 55 Zangoose that knows False Swipe.
 When Relicanth is asleep, it is much easier to capture. An alternative (though less effective), is paralysis inducing moves.


Ralts, Kirlia and Gardevoir. Catch a Ralts on Route 102 (rare) and train it to level 41 as a Ralts, level 47 as a Kirlia or level 51 as a Gardevoir, to teach it Hypnosis.
Spinda. Catch a Spinda on Route 113 (common) and train it to level 23, to teach it Hypnosis.
Oddish or Gloom. Catch an Oddish or Gloom on Route 110, 117, 119, 120, 121 or 123, or at the Safari Zone, and train it to level 18 to teach it Sleep Powder.
 Train it to Level 54 as a Shroomish to teach it Spore.
 They are very rare (1/20 chance of appearing), so patience is necessary.
 Use other moves if necessary, but when Relicanth gets weak, make sure you use False Swipe, so as to not accidentally knock it out.
 Sleep is more effective than Paralysis.
 This can take a while, as Relicanth has a very low catch rate, similar to some legendaries. If Relicanth wakes up, remember to put it back to sleep.

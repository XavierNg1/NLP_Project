 Then take the Kaballa's  market starter card and big carrot cards and place them next to the small cards.;
, Give everybody seven cards each. If you have Kaballa  Dolla (bunny money)  put it off to the side on your save pile. If you have play immediately cards put them in your discard pile. Be sure you have a bunny. If you do not have one replace one of your cards you have with a bunny drawn from the deck.


The Killer Bunnies game consist constantly of planning out two moves at once before anything happens. You first place a bunny down face down, vertically. Then you place a run card down for your first move and below that, a second run card down for your second move. Last take a card from the deck to replace your last card that you placed down. Once every one is done planning, flip your bunny card over. The player that goes first, will try to kill your bunny. When a bunny killer(run) card is placed on your bunny, you have to roll the dice. If you roll less than the weapon level, your bunny will have to go to your discard pile. If you roll higher than the weapon level than you get to keep your bunny. (Remember: After you place a card down draw a new card from the deck.)

, This way, spending bunny money lowers your chance of winning the game because it lowers your money of spending on a carrot. Now, if you have water or carrot left, you should keep a record of how much supplies left. So next time some one pulls a feed the bunny card on you, you can discount some of your supplies off or not have to pay at all.
 To use this card,You need to not have one of your own bunnies at place or it will kill them. If you pull one of these cards up and have a bunny at place you need to put it in the discard pile. And Remember you have to play this card from your hand immediately  if you are going to play it at all. 

, This allows you to get a free carrot at the market. You can also play a free water card on your self to get a water card free.

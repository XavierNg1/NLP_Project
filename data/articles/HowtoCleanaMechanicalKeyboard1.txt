 If you have an accident and spill something on your mechanical keyboard, the first step is to do damage control and clean up the mess. Soak up any of the excess material with paper towels or a regular bath towel.Then let your keyboard air dry completely before trying anything else. This usually takes about 2-3 days.;
, Use a damp paper towel to wipe down the surface of the mechanical keyboard. You should be able to scrub off any sticky residue or grime that is stuck on the surface. This will help minimize the amount of dirt that gets down into the keys that could potentially cause a problem later.

You can also use a disposable cleaning wipe to get this job done.
 A jelly compound is a material that is often used for cleaning keyboards because it conforms to the small spaces and attracts dirt and debris stuck down in your keyboard. Take off all the keycaps and then dab the sticky compound on your mechanical keyboard.You can also try using the jelly material with the keys still on. But youâ€™ll get a more efficient clean if you remove the keycaps.
Be careful not to use a compound that is too sticky, as this could result in residue being transferred to your keyboard that negates the whole point of cleaning it in the first place.
You should be able to purchase sticky compound at any office supply store.

 If you're learning this for a class and taking a test, you might be provided with a ready-made set of numbers, e.g. 1, 4, 5, 7, 10. This is your data set â€“ the numbers that you will be working with. You may, however, need to arrange the numbers yourself from some sort of table or word problem. Make sure that each number refers to the same sort of thing: for instance, the number of eggs in each nest of a given bird population, or the number of parking spots attached to each house on a given block., In other words: arrange the numbers from lowest to highest. Take your cue from the following examples.


Even number of data example (Set A): 4 7 9 11 12 20
Odd number of data example (Set B): 5 8 10 10 15 18 23

, To do this, find the midpoint of your data: the number or numbers in the very center of the set. If you have an odd amount of numbers, choose the exact middle number. If you have an even amount of the numbers, the midpoint will rest between the two middlemost numbers.


Even example (Set A), in which the midpoint lies between 9 and 11: 4 7 9 | 11 12 20
Odd example (Set B), in which (10) is the midpoint: 5 8 10 (10) 15 18 23

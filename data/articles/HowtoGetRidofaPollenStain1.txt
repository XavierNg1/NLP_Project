 Shake the stained garment and press the adhesive side of tape to it to lift remaining pollen. Similarly, loose pollen grains can be gently vacuumed from the fabric. This will prevent you from grinding the pollen grains into the fibers of your garment any more and prevent the stain from growing larger. , Hang the garment up in direct sunlight for two to three hours. After a few hours have passed, check the stain; the sun should completely (or nearly completely) fade the pollen stain. If the stain is severe, however, this may not be enough to eliminate it.
 If sunlight alone is not enough, place the fabric in cold water and soak it. After soaking, allow the garment to dry in direct sunlight.

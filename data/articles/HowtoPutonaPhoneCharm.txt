 If it is in a packet and you are using scissors, be careful not to snap charm or the charm string. If your phone has an antenna, just put the plastic circle thing around your antenna and you won't have to follow any more of these steps. If you don't have an antenna but your phone charm has a plastic circle, just chop it off with scissors. You can skip this step if you already have one.;
, You should really use a FLAT surface because if you do it on something bumpy, or worse just hanging up in the air, you might mess up.
 Don't worry, you'll be able to put them back on. It's just that if you keep it on, it makes the next few steps a lot harder.
 This is where you will slide the charm in.
 You slide the end of the string part of your charm through the TOP hole is the upper left or right corner of the phone. I used a pencil to kind of poke mine through but you could use anything. Just be sure to concentrate.
 So now you pull the end of the string so the phone charm is pressed up against the top of the phone and can't go any further.
 This is probably the simplest step.
 Now just pull the phone charm all the way down and you are set to go!

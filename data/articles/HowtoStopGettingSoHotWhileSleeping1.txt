 The simplest way to keep your room cool while you sleep is to use your air conditioner if you have one. Central air or a portable window unit will both do the trick. The ideal sleeping temperature for most people is between 60 and 70 °F (16 and 21 °C).If you have a programmable thermostat, don't forget to set it so that it automatically adjusts to a warmer temperature just before you wake up in the morning.;
, If you don't have air conditioning, a fan is the next best option. You can use a fan to increase circulation, create a cross breeze, and pull hot air away from you.If you have a ceiling fan, set it so that the blades are turning counter-clockwise. This should help pull the hot air up towards the ceiling and away from your bed.
If it's cooler outside than it is in your room, try putting a box fan in an open window facing outside.
Multiple fans can be used to create a nice cross breeze in your room, especially if you have two windows on opposite walls.
You can also try creating an old school air conditioner by placing a large block of ice or pile of ice cubes in front of a fan. Just make sure to use a large enough bowl or pan so that the water has somewhere to go when the ice melts!

, On really hot days, keep your bedroom cool by keeping your blinds closed all day. You will have to deal with a dark room, but it will be much cooler when it's time for bed.Thermal blinds or shades might be a good investment if the sun makes your room unbearably hot in the summer. They will also help prevent drafts in the winter.
If you own your home, you might want to consider planting trees near your bedroom windows to give yourself some shade.
 Heat rises, which means that the second floor of your home will typically be warmer than the first floor. If you live in a two story house and you can't get your second-floor bedroom cool enough on hot nights, consider setting up a temporary sleeping area on the main level.

 In a large mug, mix ½ cup (118 ml) of hot coffee, ½ cup (118 ml) of hot chocolate, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of hazelnut creamer. Stir well to ensure that the liquids are well combined.You can use whatever coffee and hot chocolate that you prefer, but make sure that they’re not flavored variations, such as salted caramel, or it will alter the taste of your finished coffee.
 Add ¼ cup (20 g) of whipped cream to a medium sized bowl. Carefully fold in 1 tablespoon (8 g) of icing sugar and 1 teaspoon (2.5 g) of cocoa powder into the whipped cream with a spatula until the ingredients are well combined.You can use homemade or store-bought whipped cream, depending on your preference.
In some areas, icing sugar is sold as powdered sugar. Just check the ingredients to make sure that cornstarch hasn’t been added to the sugar.
 Add a dollop of the whipped cream to the top of the coffee mixture. If desired, you can drizzle some chocolate syrup and toasted, chopped hazelnuts over the coffee for garnish.

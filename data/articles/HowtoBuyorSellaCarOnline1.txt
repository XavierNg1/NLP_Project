 Of course, you must have an eBay account. It only takes a few minutes to establish an account and it is not difficult.;
, Take advantage of the tools available and add a picture of the vehicle.


eBay offers two methods of purchase. The "buy it now" option allows the seller to post the he will take to cancel the auction and sell the car outright. This is a good method in that it gets you the price you want for the car. The second purchase method is to establish a reserve price, which is the minimum for which you will let it go and let the auction go as far as it will. It is a gamble based on a bidding war that gets you the optimal price for your car with the safety of it not selling for less than your minimum price.
A disadvantage of eBay is that you will have to pay a listing fee to list your car and then an auction fee for selling the car. You pay the listing fee even if you do not sell the car. The auction fee is a percentage based on the amount of the sale.
 The only fees you pay would be if you use PayPal, the preferred method of payment on eBay. The downside is that you rarely get to see the vehicle you are buying until it is yours. Always check the seller's approval percentage of happy contacts. Think twice about buying from them if it is less than 90 percent.

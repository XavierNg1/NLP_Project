 Liquids, specifically water, play a major role in the body’s health. Water is needed by the body to help the kidneys get rid of waste in the body.


Drinking eight glasses of water every day makes the kidney more active in removing the excess uric acid produced in the body.
It also lessens the formation of crystallized uric acid in the joints.
 Doctors usually advise FSGS patients suffering with gout to adopt any reduced-calorie diet containing low quantities of protein and low amounts of fat.


Obesity is closely associated with gout, although the exact link isn’t understood.
 The traditional medications used for gout such as prednisone, allopurinol and colchicine are not usually used in kidney patients suffering from gout, as medications have negative side effects on the kidneys.


These medications may worsen the disease and since the kidneys are the root cause of gout, the integrity of the kidneys must be maintained.
Immunotherapy is the one of the best options for kidney patients suffering from gout.

 Common genres played on FM radio stations include pop, rock, R&B, hip hop, urban contemporary, dance, alternative, oldies/classic, adult contemporary, light sounds, country and more. These genres are often ambiguous and do not necessarily have the same meaning in each market. And they may change over time.;
, Note which stations get a good reception where you live, and write down the frequency and the genre it plays. If you live near other cities, you may be able to reach other stations within an hour's drive or sometimes more.
 Set each of the six buttons on the car's radio (most car radios have 6 buttons) to those stations.


You could set one button to represent two stations close in frequency. For example, if you like 100.3 and 100.7, you could set one button to 100.3, and just two taps up brings you to 100.7. This could free up another button for another frequency.
If you like a chain of nearby frequencies, you could set one button to represent all of them. For example, you could set one button to 100.3 that also represents 100.7, 101.1, and 101.5.
Â As long as that station is playing a song that you like and are up to hearing, there is no need to flip.
 Keep doing this until you find a song that you like.

 Coffee and wine are two of the most troubling domestic stains out there; the beverages are very common, and the stains they leave are insightful and horrid. as such, it's important to attend to them as soon as possible. Take an absorbent paper towel and blot the stain without delay. Try to refrain from rubbing or applying significant pressure to the stain at this stage-- you'll end up spreading the stain further if you do!


A dish towel or light bathing towel will also suffice, although paper towel's preferable for its absorbent qualities.
 Mixing water and ammonia together will make a potent solution to ward off wine stains. Stir them together in a cup and get them ready for use on your stain. Use a mild detergent and water instead when treating wool-based carpets, as ammonia is known to have a destructive effect on them.
Alternatively, you can use lemon juice and dish detergent. This combination is seen to be better used for coffee stains as opposed to wine stains.
 Get a kitchen sponge and dab it lightly in your ammonia solution. You'll want the sponge to be damp, but not soaked; you don't want to get more of the solution on the carpet than is necessary.
 In curt, circular motions, apply the damp sponge to the stain and rub the affected area. Begin at the outside of the stain, and work your way gradually inwards; doing it as such will minimize the risk of spreading the stain. , Take a paper towel and blot the affected area. With the ammonia solution now in place, the stain in question should start to come undone. Blotting the area and adding some pressure with the convex side of a spoon will give the stain an opportunity to be lifted from the carpet.
 Depending on the size and severity of the stain, you may need to repeat these steps a few times before getting best results. Keep the ammonia solution on hand just in case; that way, you'll be able to continue using it.

 The experience is just as romantic no matter who initiates the hug.
 If you want to, tell him or her how much you care and how much you love spending every second together.
 Hug the person you love for as long as you want to.

Males: Carefully sliding both your hands down from her shoulders, put them on her waist and slide them around her lower back. Put your head on her shoulder and press her towards you for as long as you like.

If you want to, you can give her a small massage with your hands, and try to warm her.
You can also lift her in the air and shift her weight towards you. Girls especially love this one.
When you separate, you can look into your lover's eyes, smile genuinely and, if the situation is fitting, kiss her like you mean it.


Females: Extend your arms toward him and wrap them around his neck and shoulders. Lean as close as possible and press your torso against his.

In situations of extreme intimacy, interlocking your leg in his is appropriate.
Avoid holding your arms below his shoulders and embracing too tightly, even if you're about the same height as he is.

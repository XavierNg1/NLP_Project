 Read the Koran and the Hadith. Think about the various branches of Islam. You can find much information on the web. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam http://www.patheos.com/Library/Islam.html;
, All true religions do lead to God. God is primarily a transcendent experience of the religion's founder. Through spiritual exercises, he has come in contact with a higher cosmic consciousness. This consciousness is described personal by some religions (as a person) and impersonal by other religions (as a higher dimension, truth, love, peace or light).
 Then it is not about to create peace, love and happiness inside the people, but to make bigger the ego of a religious leader or secular ruler. Realize that all religions did wrong, some more and some less.
 Attempt to solve it from the true objectives of the religion. The aim of a religion can be described as holiness, living in God or to get the paradise after death. Paradise is a place of love and peace. A person must develop a consciousness of love and peace so that he can rise after his death into the peaceful and loveable areas of the beyond. Ask yourself which interpretation of the Quran in this context is right.
 Get involved for a positive multicultural coexistence. Get involved for a world of love, peace and happiness. We are one human family. We have to live peaceful and tolerant together, to build up a happy world. Islam is a peaceful religion, if we interpret the Koran correctly.
 Reading is important but meeting with an expert is as important.

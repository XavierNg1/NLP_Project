 Also, it is good to wear shorts (like gym shorts) and a tank top while getting in shape for cheering.;
, Split stretches are a good example of these.
 Start with reasonable amounts, such as 30 jumping jacks and 30 crunches, but if you feel this is too strenuous, do as many as you can, and add 5 each day, until you reach a good point.
 walk at least a mile each day, and one of the other activities for at least 2 miles (3.2Â km). Try go further and further each day.
 Ditch the chips and soda, or you'll never succeed. However, have at least one day a week, set aside with a special treat for how well you eat on other days.
 Don't start with a backflip! Try some cartwheels, and kicks at first. Then get into backbends, eventually working up to flips,like back handsprings etc.. Look up other cheer moves on the internet, and find ones you like.

 Pro-life protesters often camp outside of Planned Parenthood clinics, which makes it difficult and intimidating for people to find their way into the building and access the care they need. You can help these people access the healthcare professionals in the Planned Parenthood building by volunteering to be an escort. Escorts usually meet the patients at an arranged time and place and lead them into the building.If becoming an escort interests you, then call your local Planned Parenthood branch and ask how you can become an escort.
Keep in mind that as an escort, you may become the target of pro-life protesters, so you must be willing to endure some shouting and harassment. If this does not sound like something you can handle, then this might not be the best way for you to get involved.
 Your local chapter of Planned Parenthood might host events that you can get involved in. Try to stay abreast of what they have planned and attend them to show your support. You might also offer to help out with the event if they are looking for volunteers.


Check your local Planned Parenthoodâ€™s website for information about any upcoming events.
For example, if your local Planned Parenthood is putting on a talk by a guest speaker, then you might offer to set up chairs before the event.
 If you want to get involved in an even bigger way, then you might consider working for Planned Parenthood.Local Planned Parenthood chapters hire doctors and nurses to work in their clinics, along with support staff to work at the front desk. Or, you might consider working for Planned Parenthood as an accountant, call center representative, or grassroots organizer.

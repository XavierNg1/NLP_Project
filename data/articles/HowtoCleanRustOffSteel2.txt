 Although rust converter is a relatively mild rust neutralizer, it can cause lung, skin, and eye irritation. Wear protective goggles and rubber gloves when using converter. Only apply converter in areas with good airflow to prevent the buildup of harmful fumes.


Rust converter can be purchased at most hardware stores or home centers. Converters are generally safe for use on iron and steel., Use a stiff or wire bristle brush to remove loose rust flakes. Grease and oil will interfere with rust converters. Use a degreaser or soapy water to clean away dirtiness, then dry the metal with a towel., Open your rust converter or add a moderate amount to a plastic paint tray. Dip a paintbrush in the converter and paint rusty surfaces. Larger surfaces can be covered more quickly by applying converter with a roller. Some converters may have a spray applicator.


If your steel is galvanized, most rust converters will only be suitable for severely rusted areas. Converter will not adhere to galvanized surfaces., Most kinds of rust converters will dry in about 20 minutes. For the converter to fully cure, it generally takes about 24 hours. Apply a second coat of converter after it has fully dried, especially for heavy rusting. A second coat will convert any missed rust.After the converter has dried, you don't need to rinse or do anything more to the rust. The converter will stick to it, neutralizing it and preventing it from spreading.
 Paint can help prevent rust and corrosion from spreading to other areas of the steel. Additionally, paint can hide the black, inert substance created and left behind by the converter. Only use paints formulated for steel.

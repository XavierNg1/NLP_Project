 In deciding you can level it up if you want the cards to be all the same or make some for your favorite teacher and some for the others or just make them the same.;
, Get all the materials needed and then you can start.
 If you want to make your own card shape you can use a white folder, be creative. Create the front of the card as previously designed, or just let your imagination flow and make it up as you go along.
 Every card has a letter inside it so choose your own font design and color, if you want it to be printed it's ok but handwritten can be better because it expresses something and shows hard work.
 Putting the design after the text is better because then you can fit the design around the writing, rather than trying to squeeze in the writing around the design.

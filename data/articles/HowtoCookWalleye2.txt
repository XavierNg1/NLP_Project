 Marinating the fillets before you grill them will ensure that they are well seasoned. To marinate the Walleye fillets, place the fillets in a casserole dish or plastic bag. Then, pour the marinade over the fillets and ensure that they are all well covered in the marinade.Let the Walleye fillets marinate in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight to allow the marinade to soak into the fish.
 When you are ready to cook the fillets, turn on your grill to medium-high heat. Then, wrap each of the fillets in some heavy duty tin foil. Place the fillets on the heated grill and cook for about 15 to 20 minutes.After 15 to 20 minutes, check one of the fillets to see if the fish is cooked. Walleye has a light, flaky texture when it is fully cooked.

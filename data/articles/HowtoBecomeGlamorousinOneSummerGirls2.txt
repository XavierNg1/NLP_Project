 Take your vitamins, (if you take vitamins). Drink milk, eat foods containing iron, etc.
 Use a sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. If you are pale, you can always use self-tanners.
 Not only will this give you an idea for when you go big-time shopping, you could find some good deals. Again, don't go overboard only one more month until you can go big on shopping.
 Also, cut out pictures of haircuts or hairstyles you like. Remember what you wrote down on your list of improvements about your hair. Keep this in mind when looking through the magazines.
 Have you completed any of these? Are you more than halfway done? If not, re-evaluate what you must do.

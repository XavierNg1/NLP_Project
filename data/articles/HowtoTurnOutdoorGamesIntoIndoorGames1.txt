 Harder balls, like baseballs, can be replaced with softer variations to prevent damage to the things inside your house. Consider replacing hard balls with balls that would be safer for indoor play, such as beach balls, balloons, or bean bags.Many toy companies sell softer, lighter variations of outdoor balls marketed towards younger children.
Even a crinkled piece of paper can double as a makeshift basketball.;
, Toy companies like Nerf produce small indoor basketball hoops. These hoops can be attached to a wall or the back of a door. Other indoor sports equipment include small soccer or hockey nets.Look online or go to the store and compare brands.


Most indoor equipment will come with age suggestions on the packaging., Games that require chalk to play, like four square or hopscotch, can be played inside using painter's tape. Instead of drawing the grid on the blacktop with chalk, use painters tape to draw a grid on hardwood or tiled floors. Once the kids are done playing, you can remove the tape, and it will be like it was never there.
 Furniture can represent different things if you use your imagination. For instance, if you're playing soccer inside, you can clear out a room and use two pieces of furniture to represent goal posts. Likewise, two chairs can become the goal posts for a game of nerf football. Think of other things that you can do with the items laying around in your house.


Be very careful when incorporating things into your indoor play. Don't pick anything that can easily get knocked over or shatter.
A trash bin can become a basketball hoop.
Furniture can become cover in a nerf gun fight.
 Other games that are played outdoors can be brought inside with almost no alteration to the game itself. Things like jump rope, hula hooping, obstacle courses, darts, or a paper plane competition can be brought indoors.

 Click the Start Menu and then Control Panel. From here, select “System and Security,” “Action Center,” and then “Troubleshooting” near the bottom left of the window.


In the Troubleshooting window, click “Programs” at the top of the page then “Windows Media Player Settings,” which should be third from the bottom of the page.;
, A new window will appear. In the lower left-hand side of the window is the “Advanced” option in blue letters. Click this, and in the window that appears, make sure the box is checked to the left of “Apply repairs automatically” before clicking “Run as administrator.” The current window will close and reopen using the new permissions.


Make sure that you have the proper permission to perform this action. You may be prompted for a username and password to continue on.
 Click “Next” on the troubleshooter window, and the troubleshooter should begin scanning the WMP settings. Once this finishes, it should say “Reset default Windows Media Player settings” at the top of the page, and “Apply this fix” under it. Click the latter to continue.


The steps above should reset all of the settings in WMP. After completing these steps open WMP and see if your issue has been resolved. If not continue with the next method.

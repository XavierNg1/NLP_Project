 Whether you inherited a propensity toward getting bunions from one of your parents or your bunions are the result of a lifetime of wearing shoes that are too tight, spending as much time as possible walking barefoot can prevent and even heal bunions. Walking barefoot strengthens the muscles in your feet and helps the bones realign in their natural position, rather than having to conform to the shape of your shoes.However, if your bunions are advanced and very painful, walking barefoot can make them feel worse. If this is the case, only walk barefoot on thickly carpeted floors. Otherwise, wear padded socks when you're walking around the house and doing your daily activities.
Wearing thick, comfortable slippers around the house is another option to help ease the pain of your bunions without subjecting your feet to the pressure of wearing shoes.
 You may think they are comfortable and good for your feet, but even tennis shoes and other athletic shoes could be making your bunions worse. Wear supportive shoes with good padding and arches. If you're in doubt about what type of shoe to buy, ask your doctor for advice.


Make sure that your shoes are the right size for you. Wearing shoes that are too small can make bunions a lot worse. When you're trying on shoes, your big toe should never touch the end of your shoe. Use the thumb rule: make sure that there is a thumb's width of room between the tip of your big toe and the end of your shoe.
Don't wear high heels or pointy toes. They're pretty, but heels and stylish pointy-toed shoes are terrible for bunions. They lead to additional pain and prevent the bunion from healing. Wear less restrictive sandals whenever possible.
 Ballet dancing, and other activities requiring constrictive shoes, may lead to bunions. If it isn't possible to do the activity in shoes that are healthier for your feet, avoid the activity altogether.

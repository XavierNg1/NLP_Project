 If your shoes are really muddy, you may want to soak them in warm water before you clean them. This may also be helpful if the caked on mud won’t come off. Fill a plastic bin with warm water and submerge your shoes.This works better for sneakers.
 If you are washing sneakers or canvas shoes, mix warm water with a detergent. Only use a small amount of detergent, enough to make a light soapy mixture.Don’t use soaps or detergents on leather boots. Instead, use water or a boot cleaner designed for leather., If you can use soap on the shoe, dampen the cloth with the soapy water. If you cannot use soap on the shoe, just use warm water. Take the cloth and clean the muddy areas on the shoes., If there is detergent left on the shoes, wipe it away with a different cloth dampened with warm water. Wipe away all excess soap on the shoes.
 If your shoes have shoelaces and insoles, wash those. Remove them from the shoes and place them in a plastic tub filled with warm water and detergent. Hand wash them, and then lay them out to dry.If the laces and insoles are too dirty, just buy new ones.
 Place crumpled newspaper into the shoes to help them maintain their shape. Let the shoes air dry. Don’t place them in the dryer because this can damage the shoes. Don’t place them in direct sunlight because that can fade the color of the shoes.Replace damp newspaper with new newspaper so it can soak up more water.
 Some shoes, like running shoes or cloth canvas shoes, can be washed in the washing machine. If you want to wash your shoes, place them in a mesh bag and put them in the washing machine. You should place some other sturdy clothes in with them, like towels or jeans, to protect the washing machine.Check the tag to make sure your shoes are machine washable.
Let them air dry afterwards.

 Some fabrics will shrink and some will not. Some shrink more than others. Make sure your shirt is made of a fabric that will shrink. Acrylics absolutely will not shrink...ever. Polyester does not shrink. But cotton or a cotton blend will. A cotton blend will shrink less than something made of 100% cotton.;
, Heat is your best form of attack to shrink fabric. Wash a shirt made of cotton in hot water, and then add to a hot dryer. Shrinkage is caused by the heat and agitation.


Customize your washer settings for optimum shrinking. Place the item you want shrunk in the machine by itself and set the machine to an extra small load. Set the temperature dial to the hottest setting possible. If your water is a little tepid instead of habanero hot, consider adding boiling water to the machine carriage. The hotter the better.
Keep up the heat by immediately transferring the shirt to the dryer. Set the dryer to the hottest setting. Dry the shirt completely. Leave it in the dryer to cool completely before removing.
 This may or may not work but is worth a try if you need the shirt to be just a little smaller.

Avoid using pressure washers since they can damage the rubber mat., If there are particularly stubborn stains, you may need to use a cloth rag or brush. Scrub the stain with the rag or brush until the dirt is removed. If the stain won’t come up, use a bit of soap or water-based spray cleaner.Don’t use solvent-based cleaners. They can weaken the rubber.
 Use the hose to rinse the soap from the mat. Use the broom to remove excess water and any leftover debris from the mat.
 Pick up the mat and hang it up to dry. Make sure to leave it long enough that it completely dries so it doesn’t start to mold.

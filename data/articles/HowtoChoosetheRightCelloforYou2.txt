 Before going, find popular brands online and check the prices and the quality. The better cellos should be more expensive, but not necessarily.
 If you have a private teacher, see if they can come. They will usually know which brands are best.
 At most stores there will be employees just waiting to help customers like you.
 Different heights require different size cellos. The employee will probably have you try out a few different cellos. If a cello's C-peg comes to your left ear when you put the end pin out, it is a good size cello for you. Be sure you do not have to put the end pin out more than a foot or so, otherwise you will have to get a new cello very soon.
 A good case is one that will protect your new cello and have room for a bow, rosin, and a cleaning cloth without having any of them banging up against the cello. Most cases are just made of fabric but there are also harder cases that have wheels. These hard cases are usually more expensive, but are more durable than the fabric ones.
 Some cellos include a bow, some do not. If yours doesn't, you need to look at the bow selection. A good bow is not too long or too heavy.

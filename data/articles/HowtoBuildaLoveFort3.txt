 For this love fort, you will need the following items: a sofa, blankets, sheets, pillows, chairs, clothespins and twine. You will also need a lot of floor space on and around the sofa, in order to build the fort.Clear out any valuable items, just in case.
Move any small tables or other small pieces of furniture out of the way.
 Drape a fitted sheet over the back of the sofa. Then pull the sheet taut and prop it up with one of the chairs. The roof of the fort should be high enough for two people to comfortably sit inside.You can create a higher roof by tying twine to the side of your sheet not affixed to the sofa and attaching that twine to something tall, like an armoire.
Make sure the roof is secure before moving on. Add more twine or tuck the sheet in tighter until you feel comfortable that the roof will not collapse on you.
 Use the rest of the blankets and sheets to fill in the sides of your fort. Layer the fabrics over the roof of the tent until the entire space is cozy and covered.If you feel you need some additional support for the roof after adding the blankets, place a chair in the middle of the fort to help prop the roof up.
Place any remaining bedding inside the fort to create a nest on the floor. Add as many blankets and pillows as it takes to make the fort truly comfy.
 If you have twinkle lights on hand, string these around the exterior of the fort to add some ambiance. Hang a piece of twine inside the fort and using clothespins, attach handwritten love notes for your sweetheart.Create a trail of candles leading up to the fort (do not place lit candles inside the fort; it may create a fire hazard).
Make a tray of your significant otherâ€™s favorite snacks and have it waiting for them inside the fort.

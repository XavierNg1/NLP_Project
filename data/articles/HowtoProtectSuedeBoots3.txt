 When you are wearing your boots, be sure to slip a small package of cornmeal or talcum in your bag. This could be a zip-lock bag or very small Tupperware container. In the event that any type of liquid is spilled on the boots, pat the area dry with a clean cloth, and immediately apply a layer of the meal or talcum powder. Allow the product to set overnight, and then use a suede brush to gently remove the dried powder.


If you are going to be away from home, bring an extra pair of shoes and a clean cloth and keep them in a bag or the trunk of your vehicle. This way, if you spill something on your shoes, you will be able to clean the stain and not have to walk around with dirty boots.
 If you are unable to treat a stain right away and the stain has dried, use a suede brush to scrub away the stain but avoid using too much pressure. For stubborn stains, use a small amount of white vinegar and a clean cotton towel. Moisten the towel with the vinegar, and blot the stain without applying a lot of pressure to the area, to avoid spreading the mess. Repeat as necessary with clean sections of the towel until the stain is loosened and removed from the surface of the suede., Water can change the texture and even the color of the suede. If the boots are stained so deeply that talcum powder or cornmeal does not soak up the stain before it sets, take the boots to a professional cleaner. You can do this by taking them to a local dry cleaning service or shoe repair shop.

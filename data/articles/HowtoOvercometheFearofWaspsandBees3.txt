 Many times, anxiety and fear stem from unrealistic thoughts or expectations that we have about an encounter with a wasp or bee. Cognitive therapy will help replace those thoughts, but the first step is to recognize them. Negative thought patterns typical come in three categories:


Fortune telling is when you assume that you already know the outcome of an encounter. “If I see a wasp or bee, I will panic and get stung.”
Overgeneralizing is when you use one specific incident and project it on all future encounters. “Last time I saw a wasp or bee it stung me. I know, if I see one again, it will sting me.”
Catastrophizing is when you imagine that an encounter will be as bad as it could possibly be. “If I see a wasp or bee then there is probably a nest or hive nearby. They will all attack me. What if I’m allergic? I might die.”

, Ask yourself if there is any evidence to support your fear. Usually, you will find that there is little or no evidence to suggest you will be stung or attacked by wasps or bees.It is sometimes helpful to imagine what you would say to a friend who expressed similar fears. If you would tell you friend that their anxiety is unreasonable, it will help you to recognize that your own anxiety is unreasonable.This can be a good place to consult a therapist to help you walk through which thoughts are really concerning and which ones might be exaggerated.
 Once you have acknowledged that your fears are exaggerated, you can start to think in a more positive way. Instead of thinking something like “I will definitely be stung,” you can think something like “It is unlikely that I will be stung.” This will help to moderate your fear and anxiety because you are evaluating the situation from a reasonable point of view.

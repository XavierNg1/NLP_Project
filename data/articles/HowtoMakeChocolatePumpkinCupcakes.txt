 Grease a cupcake tin with non-stick cooking spray and scoop 1/3 cup of batter into each hole.

For easy scooping and pouring in, use an ice cream scoop to pour cupcake batter.
 Have the cupcakes bake for 10-12 minutes or until they rise and get puffy. To test if cupcakes are ready, poke a toothpick in the middle of one cupcake. If the toothpick comes out dry, the cupcakes are ready. If not, cook the cupcake for an additional five minutes. Have cupcakes cool on a plate or wire rack.
 You can use canned frosting or homemade frosting. Use a frosting pipe or butter knife to apply frosting on top of cupcakes.


Vanilla or buttercream frosting is recommended for these cupcakes, but any frosting can do just fine.

 To detach the spaghetti straps from the back of the tank, you can use a seam ripper or a pair of scissors. Seam rippers are designed to remove individual stitches. If you choose to use a seam ripper for this project, you will be able to remove the entire strap from the back of the tank top neatly. If you do not have a seam ripper, you may use a pair of scissors to cut the straps off the back of the t-shirt., Pull the hardware down to the end of each strap. This will loosen, or lengthen, both straps completely. Use a pair of scissors to cut the small loop as close to the end of the strap as possible. Slide off the hardware., To prevent the ends from fraying, you may finish the straps in one of two ways.


Tack down the ends of the straps. Fold over the end of one strap and secure it in place with a pin. Thread a needle and proceed to tack down the end of one strap. Repeat this process on the other strap. This application will leave your halter top looking looking polished.






Tie knots at the ends of the straps. To prevent the ends from fraying, tie one to two knots at the end of each strap. Secure the knot in place with a few stitches. This application is simpler.

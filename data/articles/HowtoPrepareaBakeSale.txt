 In many European countries, for example, it is forbidden to sell prepared food without a permit from the local health department. Before you go through all the work of making and selling your treats, make sure you won't be busted and sent home 10 minutes after you started making money.;
, If you live on a busy street you can put the table in front of your house, but if you don't, then you might like to ask a store owner if you can set up your table outside of their premises. This latter option will probably be more favorably received if you're raising money for charity rather than for yourself.
 The more, the merrier! Assign different jobs to your friends. For example, have some friends bake and some friends at the table.
 In most areas you are allowed to hang them on those wooden electricity poles. On the signs, always use the "when, what, where, how, and why" technique. Also make some fliers, and go door to door to people you know and give them out.
 When people come, ask: "Hello, would you like to buy something from our bake sale?" If they say yes, explain what everything is and the prices.
, It's as much about bonding with the community as it is about raising funds!

 A fall from a great height is an overwhelming, frightening experience. You must focus on the task at hand to maximize your chances of landing safely. Avoid the temptation to hold your breath, and try to breathe evenly. Relaxing your limbs will also reduce your risk of serious injuries, as locked joints are much more likely to be harmed by impact.
 If you are falling from a very significant height, such as from a tall building or an airplane, you will have time to alter your body position by creating air resistance with your upper body. Spreading your arms will help your upper body "drag" more in the air, slowing it down and allowing your legs to catch up., Tilting your head back will further increase the air resistance of your upper body, allowing you to shift from a head-first falling position more quickly. Be aware that you only want to do this position as you're trying to slow your fall â€” you will eventually want to protect yourself during impact by tucking your chin against your chest.
 If you are falling into water, then you should point your legs directly towards the surface of the water. This will allow your legs to absorb most of the force from the fall. Experts disagree as to what position is best for landing on a solid surface, but a feet-first or full-body landing are both certainly preferable to a head first landing.To achieve a full-body landing, you should spread your legs out behind you as you transition from a head-first falling position. This will even out the air resistance of your body, allowing you to point your chest and belly towards the ground.
 Head trauma is a frequent cause of fatal injury while falling. As you are about to land, wrap your arms around your head, being sure to protect the side facing the ground. Your arms may be injured, but you will increase your odds of surviving the fall.

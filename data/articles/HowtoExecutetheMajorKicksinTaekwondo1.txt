 The target of a front kick is — not surprisingly — in front of you. Your target should be a “leg-length” away from your body for your kick to be effective. In some cases, you might jump a little forward or backward to make sure that your kick lands. If this is the case, you’ll also want to make sure that you have sufficient room around you to complete your front kick.

, Which leg you choose to perform the kick with will depend on a number of factors. If your opponent’s weak side is on the left, you’ll want to kick with your left leg. If you are performing several kicks in a row, you might want to vary which leg you use to keep your sparring partner off guard. In any case, you’ll want to make sure that your thigh is pointed directly towards your target in order to line up your kick.
 One of the keys to a strong front kick is establishing a strong base. If you don’t rotate your standing foot, you’ll topple or waver from side to side, making your attack less precise. Turn your foot to compensate for this.
 Your taekwondo front kick depends on the momentum of your hips as much as the strength of your leg. When you rotate your standing foot, make sure that you are also pushing forward with the side of your hip that aligns with which leg is kicking. For example, if you are performing a front kick with your right foot, when you adjust your left standing foot, push the right side of your pelvis forward. This added momentum will carry through your entire leg, making your kick that much more powerful.
 Now that you’ve set a great foundation, it’s time to make contact. Extend your leg straight out. Make contact with your target. Front kicks can be used for lower, core, and upper body targets. This means that you’ll need to have the flexibility to kick higher up in the air.
 This is key. Since the ball or heel of your foot is the hardest part of your foot, it is where you should make contact. If you kick with your toes, you’re likely to break them.

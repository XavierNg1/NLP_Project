 The food table is a social hot spot that always has a flux of people. If you find yourself alone, make your way over to the refreshments. This location eases social anxieties and takes the spotlight off you.Food generates conversations. People love free food, so party goers will always make their way over to the chips and dip. If you are getting a plate of food at the same time as someone else, strike up a discussion about how great the punch is or how bad the quiche is.
The refreshments table allows you to be occupied. This is one of the few places at a party where you can be alone and not look awkward. If you are holding a drink or a plate of food, you’ll be less likely to fidget.
 This is another social hot spot where you can be occupied. You don’t have to dance to every song. If the DJ is playing your favorite song, you can dance to that. When the music switches to something that you don’t like, use that as an excuse to get something to drink. You can dance with others or by yourself.


If you don’t feel comfortable dancing, don’t worry! You and other spectators can talk about the music or engage in some light self-mockery. (“Last time I tried to dance, my friends thought I was trying to shoo away a swarm of gnats.”) On the other hand, if you choose not to talk to anyone, you could use your attention to your peers’ moves as an excuse.
 Whether you plan to participate or simply observe, see if any games are taking place. While games like beer pong and “I never…” usually involve alcohol, you might be able to find one or two (like air hockey or foosball) that do not. If more than one game is going on, you will have a choice of what to play. On the other hand, if you choose to just watch, you and other spectators will have a mutual conversation topic.
 Take it upon yourself to introduce people to each other, make or distribute drinks, or tell the DJ what songs people want to hear. These interactions require you to be more talkative and let your social side shine.

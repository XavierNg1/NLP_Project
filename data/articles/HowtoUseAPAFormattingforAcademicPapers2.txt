 To create a basic book citation, follow this format: “Bard, S. (1999). Coffee and caffeine. Salt Lake City, UT: Buzzed Books.”


In this citation, “Bard” is the author’s last name, and “S” is the first initial. “1999” is the date of publication. “Coffee and caffeine” is the title, using sentence-case capitalization, meaning only the first word is capitalized.
Finally, “Salt Lake City, UT” is the place of publication, and “Buzzed Books” is the publisher.
 To use this for an in-text citation, add a parenthesis at the end of the sentence you want to cite with the author’s late name, the publication date, and the page number you found the information on:


“A standard cup of coffee has an average of 100 milligrams of caffeine (Bard, 1999, p. 24).”

, For an essay in a book, follow this format: “Grace, G. (2002). Green tea. In Grey, H. (Ed.), Caffeine in beverages (55-89). Salt Lake City, UT: Buzzed Books.”


In this instance, “Grace, G.” is the author of the essay, while “Grey, H.” is the editor of the anthology. “Green tea” is the title of the essay (no italics), and “Caffeine in beverages” is the title of the book. “55-89” is the page numbers of the essay in the book.
Make an in-text citation with the author of the essay. For example “Green tea has less caffeine than coffee (Grace, 2002, p. 57).
 For a journal article, follow this format: “Smith, G. (2005). Green tea’s benefits. All about Tea, 23(4), 44-76. Retrieved from http://www.greenteadatabase.com.”


In this case, “All about Tea” is the name of the journal, and 23(4) is the volume and issue number, while “44-76” is the page range.
To make an in-text citation, use the same format: “Green tea is a calming beverage (Smith, 2005, p. 47).”

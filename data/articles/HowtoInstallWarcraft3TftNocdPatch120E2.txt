 You will need a regular installation of all of your game files before you can install the No CD patch. This patch only works on the 1.20e version of Warcraft 3. If you have a newer version of Warcraft 3, connect to Battle.net and download the latest official update to disable the CD check.
 There is a chance that the patching process can go wrong, and backing up your game data will help save you time instead of reinstalling. Copy the entire Warcraft 3 folder, which is typically located at C:\Program Files\Warcraft III.
 There are two patches that you need to download: Hellkiller’s No CD patch and Vandoff’s fix for that patch. They are available online at various websites. Use your search engine to find up-to-date links.
 The patches get unzipped directly into the folder, and they will change the necessary files. Agree to overwrite anything during the unzipping process. Install Hellkiller’s patch first, and then Vandoff’s fix.
 At the top of the window that pops up, there will be a path to the icon. It may look similar to this: C:\Program Files\Warcraft III\Frozen.exe. Copy that for the next step.
 Right-click on PIGON_LOADER.exe in your Warcraft 3 folder. Select Send To, and then select Desktop (Create Shortcut). Right-click on the new shortcut and select Properties. Click the Change Icon button. Paste the path to the icon that copied from the previous step.


You can rename the shortcut to whatever you’d like, such as Warcraft 3. You will be using this shortcut to start Warcraft.

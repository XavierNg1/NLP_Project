 Look for the round hinge pin that sits between the flat plates on the hinge. This hinge pin holds the hinge plates together.
 Be careful not to slip, so as to avoid scraping your knuckles.
 This will remove any dirt or rust which might be causing the squeak.


If you roll the pin on a flat surface, you might see if it is bent. If the pin is bent, you can put it on a cement floor and tap it with a hammer to straighten it out.






You can also scrape paint and grime that collects in the hinge with a nail after you remove the pin.






If you sand down the pin with sandpaper, you can remove the rust and the pin will fit more loosely and the hinge will have less resistance.
 Spray with spray lubricant or oil.
 Take the hinge pin out and rub with a bar of soap. Replace the hinge and open and close the door a couple of times to allow for the soap to spread through the mechanism.
 If the door still squeaks when you open and close it, repeat. Keep trying until the squeak disappears. Once you are happy with the door's performance, push the hinge pin back into place and ensure that it is secured.
 Wipe away grime, oil drips, dust, etc. from the hinge area and leave it nice and clean. Dispose of waste in the garbage.

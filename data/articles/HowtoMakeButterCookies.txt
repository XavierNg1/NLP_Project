 Grease a baking tray and sprinkle a little flour on it until it's completely covered.;
, Add to a medium bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until it's soft.
 Continue stirring until the mixture becomes smooth.
 Make sure each one is well blended before adding the next.
 Use a spoon or a fork to mix, but only until a dough forms. Do not over-mix.
 Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it for about 15 minutes, or until the dough is firm and smooth. If the dough is still a bit sticky, you can add a little more flour.
 Aim to roll the dough to a 5mm-thickness. Or you can divide the dough in to smaller pieces if you have a smaller space. Just make sure not to make it to thin.
 Try to cut as many cookies as you can, using differently shaped cutters for a pretty variety.
 Leave sufficient room between cookies, as they will expand in the oven; if they're placed too close together, they'll stick to one another.
, Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes.
 Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack until they reach room temperature.
 You may store these in an airtight container for up to two weeks.

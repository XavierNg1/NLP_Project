 The person you are meeting for the first time is not interested in your “good excuse” for running late. Plan to arrive a few minutes early. And allow flexibility for delays in traffic or taking a wrong turn.
 If you are feeling uncomfortable and on edge, this can make the other person uneasy and that’s a sure way ruin a date. If you are calm and confident, so the other person will feel more at ease, and so have a solid foundation for making that date and impression a good one. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and so the “picture” you first present says much about you to the person you are meeting. Is your appearance saying the right things to help create the right first impression?

, Try deep breathing. Deep breathing is a very effective way of relaxation.


Progressive Muscular Relaxation - The idea behind this, is that you tense up the muscles of your body as tightly as possible. Hold them in a state of extreme tension for a few seconds. Then, relax the muscles to their previous state starting at your feet, knees, thighs, tummy, shoulders, neck and head. Finally, consciously relax the muscles even further so that you are as relaxed as possible.
Keep the attention on your breathing. Repeat a few times and be amazed at how relaxed you will feel.

 When additional people are entering your home (especially during the colder months), you are going to need more space for their coats, shoes, and other items. Get rid of shoes, umbrellas, coats, etc. that can clutter up your entryway. Store these in a closet, bedroom, or basement until your guests depart., You are going to want extra space for guests to hang up their coats. Otherwise, you’ll end up with an unruly and unattractive coat pile. Add some additional hooks (or a coat rack) to your entryway to help keep everyone’s winter gear organized., If you have the room, it can also be helpful to add storage bench to your entryway. This provides guests with a place to set bags, purses, or presents. A multi-level bench can also provide extra storage for shoes.

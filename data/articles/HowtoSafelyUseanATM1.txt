 Visit an ATM that is in a well-lighted area, or one that is monitored by surveillance cameras or security personnel. This is true of both indoor ATMs and drive-up ATMs. If possible, try to use during daylight hours.


Drive up ATMs are often safer than walk-up ATMs because of the privacy and safety of your vehicle and locked doors.;
, Before using your card, be vigilant and look around for anyone who may arouse your suspicion. If you feel the least bit apprehensive, avoid using that particular ATM and search for a safer option.If using a drive-up ATM, keep your engine running, keep your car doors locked, and keep all windows rolled up (except the one you are using).
At a walk-up ATM, always lock your car doors and take your keys with you. Never leave the car running.
Some ATMs require that you use your card to open the door to gain access to the ATM. Avoid letting anyone follow in behind you, and make sure the door is completely closed behind you when in the vestibule.
 Prepare all transactions before going to the ATM. Have your card ready so you won’t have to fumble around with your purse or your wallet. Also, if you’re making a deposit, have all checks endorsed and have the envelope sealed if you’re using one., Never share your PIN information with bank personnel, strangers, or anyone not associated with the account. When typing in your PIN, use your free hand to cover the keyboard. Some ATMs come equipped with screening devices but you can never be too safe., When withdrawing money from an ATM, be sure to place your card, money, and receipt in a secure place such as your wallet or purse before leaving the ATM. Discreetly count your cash to ensure you have the correct amount and store it quickly.

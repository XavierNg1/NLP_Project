 Cover your nail with the pad of the bandage, and wrap the adhesive part around the flesh of your fingertip.
 You can apply fresh bandages every time you shower, every time the bandage gets soggy or dirty, or every few days.


You can remove them for a special occasion, or choose to keep them on so you look silly during the occasion and are even more motivated to stop biting your nails.
Unless you bite your nails in your sleep, it's probably a good idea to take the bandages off at night. Doing so will give your skin a chance to "breathe." You should also remove bandages that look notably moist or dirty.
 It takes at least 21 days to break a habit, so you should be prepared to stick with this method for at least that long. You can remove the bandages after that point.


To really break a habit, though, you should also work on replacing it with a positive habit. For instance, switch the chewing sugar-free gum or playing with a stress ball while consciously following the bandage procedure.Replacing a bad habit with a neutral one usually makes it easier to break.
 If you start biting your nails again, put the adhesive bandages back on for a longer period of time or attempt another method to quit.


Some research suggests it may take up to three months to successfully break a habit, so don't expect yourself to be in the clear just yet.Remain conscious about your habit and your desire to break it, even after you take the bandages off.
Consider backing your efforts by painting your nails, getting a professional manicure, or using a bite inhibitor after removing the bandages.

 Conduct a Google search of salons near you or within a reasonable distance from your location. Jot down the phone numbers of a few salons that look interesting to you and call them to find out if they have any stylists that specialize in curly or dry hair. Save yourself some heartache from a horrible haircut and do your due diligence before letting someone near your hair with a pair of scissors.If you believe you have found someone that is able to cut curly hair, ask to schedule a consultation where you can ask how they cut curly hair. The way they talk about curly hair should reveal their level of knowledge about it. Ask to see samples of their work on other curly-haired clients.
 To maintain healthy hair, visit your hairdresser at least four times a year (every three months) for a trim. Regular trims will prevent split ends, which can contribute to unruly frizz.
 If you see another curly-haired person with a great haircut, don’t be shy! Approach them and ask where they get their hair cut. You can start a conversation by saying something like, “Hey! I love your hairstyle. Would you mind telling me where you get your hair cut? I’m looking for a good stylist.” It is generally perceived as a great compliment, and most people are willing to divulge who cuts their hair., Curly/dry/frizzy hair should always be cut in layers to avoid the dreaded triangle-head, which is a term for curly hair that is cut in a blunt style. Curly hair is often voluminous, and when it dries, the ends become voluminous while the top remains flat, creating a triangle effect. Cutting hair into layers will distribute the volume and look much more flattering on you.

 If you've not yet had sex with the other person, don't make any assumptions. Even if she is interested in having sex tonight, she'll be more comfortable and likely to do so if she can set the pace her clothes are removed.


If pausing to ask a question every few minutes feels too awkward, try holding a button, zipper, or bra strap, then looking at your partner with a raised eyebrow and questioning look instead.
 Nothing kills the mood like your partner punching you in the face because he yanked your shirt too hard. When you're stripping the clothes from another person, do it slowly and sensuously. Take some time between each item of clothing to kiss your partner's newly exposed skin, or run your hands along his or her body.
 Grab both ends of the belt, then unbuckle and tug them off in one motion. It's fine if you take a couple tugs to get this right. Try this while reaching from behind, if you're feeling extra skilled.
 Pull up the lower hem of the T-shirt until the shirt is pulled partly over your partner's arms, but the collar is still around the neck. Hold your partner playfully in this position while you kiss or nibble his skin, before tugging it off the rest of the way.
 Distract your partner by making out, while you unbutton or unzip his pants and pull them down. Use your foot to pull them the rest of the way. If you're distracting enough, he may not notice what you're doing until the trousers fall at his feet.


This probably won't work on women's trousers, since they tend to be more difficult to remove.
 This often takes a few attempts, so it's best attempted when you're feeling confident, or when you and your partner are in a silly mood. With enough effort, even buttoned shirts can come off, but avoid hurting your teeth on metal zippers.
 Bras are infamously difficult for men to remove, although it's not difficult if you learn how. If you haven't figured it out after a few seconds, just stop and let her do it.

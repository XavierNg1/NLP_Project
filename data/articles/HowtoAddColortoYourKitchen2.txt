 Colorful flowers and plants are a great way to brighten up a kitchen with a more neutral color scheme. Stop by a local greenhouse or department store and select some flowers with a lot of color. You could, for example, hang up a pot of geraniums in the corner of your kitchen or have some bright yellow sunflowers sitting on a kitchen windowsill.Make sure the plants you choose can thrive indoors.
If you don't have the time to care for real plants, fake flowers can also add some color and charm to your kitchen.
 Stop by a local art studio and buy some colorful artwork. A bright impressionist painting hung up over your kitchen counter, or a colorful mobile dangling near a kitchen window, can add a variety of color to an otherwise dull room.If new art work is not within your budget, consider rearranging your home. Transfer a colorful painting from the living room into your kitchen.
 A colorful rug is a great way to spice up a kitchen floor in neutral shade. If the bright white tiles of your kitchen floor bother you, place a colorful rug underneath your dining room table. This can add some color to your kitchen.Pick a rug that's easy to clean. It's inevitable that you'll eventually spill food or drinks on a rug in the kitchen.
 If you have windows in your kitchen, opt for colorful curtains. This is a simple way to incorporate some color into an otherwise dull room. You can, for example, have bright purple curtains hung up near the window by your sink., A tapestry can be a classy item that will brighten up any dull room. You can hang a colorful tapestry up in your kitchen to add a bit of color. Large tapestries can cover almost a whole wall. If you, say, can't stand the off-white paint on your kitchen walls, hang a tapestry up to cover them.You should hang the tapestry away from busier areas in your kitchen, however. You do not want the tapestry to get stained with food as it may be difficult to wash.

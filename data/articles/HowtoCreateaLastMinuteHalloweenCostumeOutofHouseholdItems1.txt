An old/unwanted bed sheet
Scissors
Safety pins
A black permanent marker
A sash, cord or belt (optional);
, Cut its length so that it won't be a tripping or fire hazard. You want it to end just around the feet without trailing on the floor.


The bed sheet should be white, or light colored such as cream/pastel. Once you've cut it up, you obviously won't be able to use it on the bed again, so make sure you're willing to part with it.
 If you want holes for the mouth and/or nose, cut those as well. Try to make the holes circles or ovals, or jagged if you like. Good eye holes will help you maintain good vision for walking around.
 Do not do it when the person is wearing it, though!

, Add a sash, cord or belt, if you like.
 Make sure you can move comfortably in it, especially if you're hitting the streets or a party. Avoid catching fire from candles in pumpkins on the floor/sidewalks, so take care with the sheet that may trail on the floor.

 Bacterial infections can impact your parrot's liver and GI tract. The symptoms of this distress usually include diarrhea that is green or yellow colored and urine that is bright yellow in color.The discoloration of feces and urine caused by a bacterial infection is usually due to excessive bile created by the liver malfunctioning.
 Bacterial infections can also impact your bird's respiratory health. If a bird is having a hard time breathing, it may have an infection in its lungs. Pay attention to coughing, wheezing, and other signs of respiratory distress.Additionally, your bird may have nasal or ocular discharge associated with a bacterial infection in its respiratory system or sinuses. These are visible symptoms that should signal to you that your bird needs to be assessed by a veterinarian.
 Parrots with bacterial infections often do not eat and become emaciated. Problems with digestion can lead to a lack of appetite, which then leads to quick and serious weight loss.If your parrot has not eaten for a day or two, you should get it looked at by a veterinarian to rule out an illness that needs treatment.
 Bacterial infections can impact your parrot's health so much that the bird becomes immobile and non-responsive. It may stop preening itself and abandon all self care. If the condition advances this far your parrot's health is in grave danger and it may pass away if not treated immediately.If your bird is so weak and lethargic that it cannot move then you need to get it to a veterinarian immediately. If your veterinary office is not open at that point, you should take your bird to an emergency pet hospital. At an emergency pet hospital your parrot can get supportive care, at the very least, which will ease any pain or discomfort it is experiencing.

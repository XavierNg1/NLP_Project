 Whether this is your first bladder infection or a recurring one, see your health care provider to get a diagnosis. If left untreated, bladder infections could lead to worse conditions, including kidney infection.The most common cause of a bladder infection is bacteria, specifically E. coli, but tests might be necessary to confirm there are no serious contributing factors.If you are male, seeing a doctor is important to rule out an enlarged prostate and other conditions.
Children suffering from this condition must see a doctor right away.
 Ask your health care provider if a course of antibiotics is recommended. Typically these must be taken for 3 days or up to two weeks, depending on the brand and type of antibiotic prescribed.Make sure to complete the entire pack or bottle, even if you start feeling better before you have taken them all.
Misuse (such as not completing the full course of treatment) and overuse of antibiotics both contribute to bacteria evolving to become more resistant to these drugs. The next time these bacteria reappear, they may not respond to the same medicines.Infections may be caused by bacteria other than E. coli, including Staphylococcus, Chlamydia, and Mycoplasma. Only your doctor can determine which bacteria are involved and the type of antibiotic that will best treat it.
 If you have had more than one infection every three months, ask your doctor about the possibility that you are infected with an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Your doctor will perform a urine culture to determine if this is causing your recurring infections. You may also wish to ask for a referral to a urologist to check for interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome (IS/BPS). This is a chronic condition that involves inflammation of the bladder and may need different treatment.IS/BPS may have different causes, including nerve problems, a weak immune system, or genetic defects.
IS/BPS patients may require a low-dose antibiotic taken for up six months to two years.

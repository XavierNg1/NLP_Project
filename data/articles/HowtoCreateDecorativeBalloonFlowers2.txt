 The balloons should be facing opposite sides when you tie their ends together. You can use a small piece of craft wire to bind the ends of the two balloons together by wrapping the wire around them a few times. Just be careful -- the wire can pop your balloons. If you're concerned about this, you can use ordinary string instead, but it will be a bit weaker.
 The balloons should be evenly spaced when you tie their ends together, creating a "Y" shape. Use the same material you previously used to bind the ends of the remaining three balloons together. Just hold the three ends together with one hand and use your other hand to wrap the wire around the ends.
 Tie the set of two flower petals to the of three petals by tying all of the ends together. The balloons should extend outward, so that all of the ends are tied together in the center. The balloons may not feel stable during this process, but they'll be positioned correctly once you add the center.
 Tie the two smaller balloons together with wire or string. The balloons should be facing opposite directions when you tie the ends together.
 Take the two flower center balloons and wrap them around the flower petals so that one balloon center appears on each side of the balloon. To do this, gently place the ends of the flower center next to the ends of the flower petals and move the flower center balloons around until the ends catch and you have one balloon center appearing on each side, surrounded by petals.





Having a flower center on each side will create a 3-D effect for the flower.
 Now that you've finished your flower, you can place it on the ground, hang it up with some ribbon, or even think about adding a stem to it.

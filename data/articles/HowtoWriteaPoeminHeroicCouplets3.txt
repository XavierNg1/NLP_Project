 In free writing, paragraphs are used to group ideas together. However, in poems, stanzas are used to group or organize ideas. Therefore, whenever you have a new idea, create a new stanza to express this idea., Clichés are phrases and ideas that have been repeated and used so many times that they lose all originality and freshness. Clichés can also refer to overused literary elements like overused plots, themes, and character types.Examples of clichés are, “crystal clear,” “busy as a bee,” “beet red,” and “sparkles like a diamond,” to name a few.
Instead, think of an original way to describe what the cliché is describing. For the “busy as a bee” cliché, think of other things that can describe or relate being busy, for example, a college student balancing school and a job.
 Once you have put all of your ideas down on paper, you will need to revise. When revising, look for common spelling and grammatical errors, as well sentence structure errors. Also, look for words that do not create an accurate description, and extra words that do not serve a purpose.Remove “poetic” words that are used just to impress the reader. These types of words create a sense of artificiality and insincerity in writing.

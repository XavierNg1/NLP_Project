 Assign one villager (if you're Greek) one ulfsark (if you're Norse) three laborers (if you're Egyptian) or one citizen (if you're Atlantean) to build ten houses.;
, Do not advance through Athena if your major god is Hades for example. Ares will be a better choice instead. You should train the type of soldier that your major god specializes in.
 The recommendation is 10 buildings (if you're Greek), fifteen (if you're Egyptian), 10 (if you're Norse) and 10 (if you're Atlantean). Egyptians will need more buildings since their soldiers are weak.
 Focus on destroying their town center and houses so as to decrease their population. Don't ever forget to use siege (Heliopolis work very well with over 600 hit points and 27 crush attack).


Kill your enemy's villagers! The less they have, the slower their resources come in and the faster they run out of resources. Also, they can build less. The only exception would be when your enemy is Norse.






Make surprise attacks! Try building on all the corners of the map in addition to the center. Most people never suspect an attack from behind or a base in one of the corners.
, Wall up your town, build walls to the center of the map. Wall up settlements that you want to claim. Wall your enemy up! Just don't barge into your enemy's town attempting to wall it up. That would be a very serious mistake.
 One of the most dangerous mistakes is to forget to gather them. Although it seems that you'll never run out of resources, you eventually will (unless you play the beginners' maps that being with TW which stands for total war. Those maps are easy to play on). No matter what civilization you are, resources are very important.

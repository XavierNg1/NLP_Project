 Have your swimmers get into water holding onto the edge of the pool. Have them practice holding their breath underwater and getting their entire heads wet. This helps kids overcome any fear of water.;
, With kids sitting on the side of the pool, have them place their arms over their heads pointing upwards, with arms against ears.


If they want to hold their noses, let them; they can put only one arm up and against the ear. They'll outgrow the nose-holding.






From this sitting position, have them lean forward with hands and head pointing toward the water until they slip off the side of the pool. They likely won't get their hands and heads into the water first, but they will become comfortable with being mostly head first. Be patient with this step.
 When they have mastered diving from a sitting position, have them kneel and lean forward until they slip into the pool head-first. At this stage they will truly be going head-first. Be patient and repeat as often as necessary (it won't be long).
 From a kneeling position, hold your arm straight out in front of them so they have to dive over it. Start low to the water and work up a little bit at a time until they are diving over your arm.
 Progress to a standing position and have them just lean over until they slip into the pool head-first. Have patience, and have them repeat, repeat, and repeat.
 For example, you can use starting blocks and then higher diving boards. Go slowly and make sure kids are comfortable with each step.
 If there's a set-back, like a belly flop or a nose full of water, get them right back up to do it again, so they know it was a fluke and they really do know how to do it. This is important.

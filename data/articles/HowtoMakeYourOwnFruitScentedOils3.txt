 Drop your fruit peel inside. Pour the oil on top. Use a jar that is narrow enough for the oil to completely cover the fruit peel., Place it anywhere that will receive plenty of light over the course of the day. Use the sunlight to warm the oil and begin extracting the fruit's essence. Give it one or two days to do so.
 First, line a strainer with cheesecloth and place the strainer over another container. Pour the jar’s contents into the strainer. Sniff the liquid to judge the strength of its scent. If desired, add a fresh ¼ cup of fruit peel to the jar and pour the liquid back in to soak for another day or two.Repeat as desired up to a half-dozen times.

 It makes sense that what you put in your mouth can have a big impact on the health and appearance of your teeth. Dentists warn that sugar is the substance that does the most damage to teeth. Make sure to read nutrition labels and avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar.Avoid sodas, fruit juices, and energy drinks. All of these have significant amounts of sugar that can be harmful to your teeth.
There are certain foods and beverages that are good for your teeth. For example, drinking tea (black or green) can slow the growth of bacteria in your mouth. Cheese can lower the amount of acid produced in your mouth.
Eat more calcium. This nutrient supports bone health, which includes your jaw. This can help your overall oral health. Try cottage cheese or low fat milk.
 Smoking is harmful to your overall health and this includes your teeth and mouth. Smoking can cause tooth discoloration, gum disease, cavities, and mouth cancers. One of the most important things you can do to help your teeth look great is to avoid smoking.If you don't smoke, don't start.
If you smoke, try to quit. It is a very difficult process, but well worth the effort. Ask your doctor to recommend a smoking cessation product, such as the patch or a gum.
 In order to have great teeth you need to keep them. This means that you need to try your hardest to keep your teeth safe. If you play any sports, consider wearing a mouth guard. This is especially important if you play contact sports, such as football or roller derby.Mouth guards are also very useful if you grind your teeth. Wearing a guard can help you keep from grinding down the enamel on your teeth while you sleep. Ask your dentist to recommend a product; they might even be able to take impressions of your mouth to make you a customized mouth guard.

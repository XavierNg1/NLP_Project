,, While your partner executes the attack, attempt to dodge or block it. Be wise to understand that certain attacks can't be blocked, for instance, blocking a punch will just get yourself hit both by the punch and by the hand or arm you chose to block with. You can also train an immediate counter-attack after successfully dodging the original attack.
 If you think you're doing it right, then begin increasing the attack speed and the defense speed. Do this for about 10~15 minutes. Your body will learn to react to this particular situation.
 Continue training for about 10~15 minutes. Your body will now learn to react to a different situation. Nevertheless, until here, you're always expecting the attack.
, Once again, begin slowly and keep increasing the attack speed if you're being successful in your training. Your body will now start to train on how to quickly identify the attack and respond accordingly.
 Repeating is the only way your reflexes will be trained.
 You want to improve fighting reflexes, not improve your reflexes when someone you know punches you in a very particular way.
 Have one stand on each side of and in front of you, and execute the same attacks at random (It is best to have another person call out a certain number for each person, to avoid all of them attacking you at once.)

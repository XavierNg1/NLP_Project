 Naturalization is the method through which a non-Irish citizen can get Irish citizenship. There are a number of requirements you must meet before you can apply.Those include:


Be of legal age (18). Children can be naturalized through a different form if they are the children of an Irish citizen.
Be of good character.
Be a resident of Ireland for the required amount of time.
Make a declaration of loyalty. (This is done at the naturalization ceremony after your application is accepted.)

, To be naturalized, you must have been living in Ireland legally for at least a year before the date of application. You must also have been a resident for at least 4 years in the past 9 years prior to the application. Residency is proved via the dates on the stamps on your passport. You get those stamps when you register for residency with the Immigration Bureau., Good character means respect for the laws of the state. When you apply for citizenship you must provide information about your criminal record and offenses commited both inside and outside of Ireland. Everything down to traffic tickets will be evaluated. A background check will be conducted after you submit your application., Application forms can be found here: http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Citizenship%20Application%20Forms. You must mail the application form to the address listed on the same webpage. A background check will be conducted and an assessment of your financial status will be conducted. These processes may take a good amount of time. Eventually, the form will be sent to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who has absolute discretion on the applications approval or disapproval.If the application is approved, you'll be sent a letter telling you so, with instructions on final procedures. After you submit the final documentation and fee, you'll be invited to a ceremony. At the ceremony you'll recieve your certificate of naturalization.

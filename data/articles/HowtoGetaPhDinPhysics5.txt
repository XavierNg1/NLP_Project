 Being a teaching assistant is great experience, but you've got to focus on graduating eventually. *You should choose a topic and adviser you'll enjoy!* This can't be stressed enough. If you choose an adviser or topic for any other reason, you may not enjoy the work, and your performance will suffer. Additionally, many students who choose an unnecessarily difficult course end up hating physics and leaving the field. Remember, you'll be doing this for decades.
 Usually, the oral exam is *much* easier than the written exam. The exam is to determine whether you're ready to start your thesis work. You'll be asked questions on your research topic, and you'll probably also be asked some general physics questions as well. Always try to answer a question. Perhaps you won't know how to solve the problem, so you should show that you have an understanding of the underlying physics. Most times a student doesn't answer all the questions completely or correctly. Some oral exam committees will even ramp up the difficulty of the questions until they're out of your league, just to see how you perform. Practice reasoning out loud and keep chipping away at a problem - this is always better than just saying you don't know.
 It's painful at first (you may not understand a word of it) but it gets much easier over time. You need to become conversant in your research field.
 It means a lot when you're trying to find a position after grad school. Also, try to present a couple papers at conferences. It'll get you more exposure and it's a great (but sometimes stressful) way to see how your research fits into the rest of the field.

 Navigate to the Flash video that you want to watch. Firefox is the easiest browser to use when downloading a Flash file directly from a website.


This method will not work with YouTube, Vimeo, and other streaming sites. This is for Flash videos on sites such as Newgrounds.
 Once the video has loaded in Firefox, right-click on the page. Select “View Page Info” from the right-click menu. This will open the sidebar with detailed information about the site you are viewing. At the top of the sidebar, you will see a set of icons that open different aspects of the site.


If you right-click on the movie itself, you will not find the View Page Info option. You must click somewhere on the page that is not the video or a link.
 This will show a list of all of the multimedia objects that the site contains, such as button graphics and banners. It will also contain the .SWF file of the movie. Click the Type column heading in the list to sort by object type.
 The movie will be in .SWF format, and will be listed as an Object in the Type column. The name of the file is often similar to the title of the video on the website. Select it from the list and click Save As… Name the file whatever you would like and click Save.
 Once you’ve downloaded the movie, you can open it in any browser that has Flash installed. When you first try to open the file, Windows may tell you that you need to specify a program. If your browser is not listed as a suggested program, search your computer for it. Most browser programs are located in the Program Files folder on your hard drive, in a folder labeled by the company (Google, Mozilla, etc.).

 Fold it the long way, or "hot-dog style.";
, The slits should be vertical and go down from the fold, NOT from the unfolded edges. Do not cut the ends; leave a bit of space.
 Be careful to not cut the ends, and stop when you reach the slits.
 Alternate each cut, one coming from the unfolded edge and then one coming from the folded edge. They should all be parallel to one another.
 It will unfold into a large hole. If you followed this how-to correctly, it should be large enough for you to step through!

 Use a microwave safe bowl.;
, Alternatives are listed in the ingredients section. Keep mixing until there are no lumps present.


Lemon juice is not vital for consistency but is strongly recommended as it inhibits the growth of mold.
 Microwave it for 15 seconds at a time, taking it out to stir in between. Depending on the power of your microwave, this should take somewhere between three and nine 15-second intervals.The mixture will form clumps as it cooks. Try to stir in as many of these as possible between microwaving.
The mixture is ready when it is sticky and very clumpy. This will be easier to judge once you see how your first attempt ends up.
It's better to make an undercooked batch than an overcooked one, since the former is easier to salvage.
 This will prevent sticking. Feel free to prepare the work surface during the microwave intervals.
 Immediately remove the hot dough-like mixture from the bowl and begin kneading it.


It will usually take 10 to 15 minutes for the mix to cool to room temperature.Knead the mix for this entire period.
 Use plastic wrap to make an airtight seal around the cold porcelain mix. Store it in a cool, dry place for 24 hours.


You can coat the plastic wrap with lotion to prevent sticking.
To make an easy airtight wrap, shape the mix into a log and roll the plastic wrap around it. Twist each end.
The refrigerator is a fine place to store the mix, but any location out of direct sunlight, heat, and moisture is fine.
 After a day of rest, remove the cold porcelain and see how it turned out. It should now be ready to use.


Take a piece of the cold porcelain and tear it apart gently. A well made batch will form teardrop shapes as it stretches and breaks.If the inside of the clay feels sticky, knead in additional corn starch.
If the cold porcelain is brittle or dry, it was probably overcooked. You can try adding a little more oil, or make an undercooked batch and knead the two together afterward.

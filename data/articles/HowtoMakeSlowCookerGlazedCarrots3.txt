 To prevent the carrots from sticking, you should grease the slow cooker. Spray a nonstick cooking spray to the interior before you add the carrots and other ingredients.For this recipe, you should use a slow cooker that holds at least 2 quarts (1.9 l).
 After you’ve greased the slow cooker, add 1 pound (450 g) of carrots that have been cleaned and cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter to it. Next, drizzle 2 tablespoons (43 g) of honey over the carrots.You don’t have to stir the ingredients together. They will combine as they cook.
 Once you’ve added the carrots, butter, and honey to the slow cooker, add some salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle the seasonings as evenly as possible over over the carrot mixture.If you like, you can add in other spices, such as cinnamon, ginger, or nutmeg.
 When all of the ingredients are mixed, cover the slow cooker. Let the carrots cook on high for 3 hours or until they are as tender as you’d like.You may want to stir the carrot mixture every so often while they’re cooking to ensure that they heat evenly.
 When the carrots are finished cooking, transfer them to a serving dish or bowl. Serve them alongside your favorite main course while they’re still warm.

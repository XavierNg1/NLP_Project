 Make sure that there is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of space between the guacamole and the rim of the container.


Try to pack the guacamole as tightly as you can so that there are no air bubbles.
 You can use the bowl of a spoon or a spatula. Make sure that there are no bumps, ridges, or ripples.
 Don't worry, the water won't soak into the guacamole. Avocadoes have a very high fat content, which helps them repel water., The guacamole will be good for up to three days.
 If you need to, give the guacamole a quick stir. This will help blend in any excess moisture into the rest of the guacamole.

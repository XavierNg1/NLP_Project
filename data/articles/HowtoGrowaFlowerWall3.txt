 For this method, you'll need sufficient cinder blocks to complete the area of wall you wish to cover.
 The approach to this is to stack the cinder blocks so that they leave open holes for slipping the containers into. As such, you'll need to develop a criss-cross building method, such as:


Build a row of cinder blocks measuring five blocks in total.
Place the first cinder block lengthwise, the second cinder block frontward, with one hole completely facing outward.
Place the next cinder block lengthwise. Place the next cinder blocks facing frontward, again with one hole completely facing outward. This first row allows for three flowerpots to be inserted into the holes.
Build the next row with three cinder blocks going along lengthwise.
Build the next row with the first cinder block facing frontward, with one hole hanging in mid-air and the back of the block firmly held on the row beneath. Place the next cinder block lengthwise.
Finish up with one cinder block facing lengthwise.
In all, starting with a five block base, the above described structure will give you about nine holes for inserting flowerpots into.
Adjust the amount of cinder blocks according to your needs, using the above description as a guide to the criss-crossing method.
 Place the flowerpots in their new homes, one in each of the holes.
 Water and feed regularly. Mulch to keep the soil moist. When the flowers bloom, you'll have a pretty flower wall.


The cinder blocks can be decorated with paint, glued-on craft items, etc., as wished. If painting, use paint suitable for cinder blocks.

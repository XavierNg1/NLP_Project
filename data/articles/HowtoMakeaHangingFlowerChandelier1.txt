 Cut four equal strands of twine, about 33 inches (83.82 centimeters) long. Tie them together into a secure, double-knot, then tie the remaining ends to top, curved part of wreath.It's best to tie the string to the horizontal bars. This way, they won't slide around as much.
You can also use fishing line instead.;
, Pull the leaves off of a silk fern so that you have individual branches. Next, get some silk flowers in a variety of sizes, and pull the blooms off of the stems. Consider pulling the green leaves off of the stems as well; you can use these to fill in any gaps.

If you can't pull the leaves or blooms off, you can cut them using wire cutters or a sharp pair of scissors.
Ranunculus and zinnias are great choices!You can also use eucalyptus instead of ferns. Pull apart the branches, but keep the leaves attached., Place your first fern frond on top of the wire wreath.Bend it so that it follows the curve of the wreath. Secure it to the wreath with 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) pieces of green floral wire., Place the next front just behind it, so that the tip overlaps the base of the first one. Secure the second frond with more wire. Keep securing fronds to your wire frame until the entire frame is covered. Don't worry if there are gaps.

Be sure to cover the bottom of the wreath as well. You don't have to go full-out--just enough to hide the wires., Take some of your largest blooms, and secure them to the wreath using hot glue. Try to glue them directly to the wire wreath so that they are nestled between the fern fronds., Alternate using different types, colors, and sizes.Try to group your flowers together in odd numbers. This will create a more balanced and aesthetically-pleasing look., Carefully go over your wreath. Fill in any remaining gaps with silk leaves, greenery, and tiny "filler" plants, such as baby's breath. Pull or snip off any threads or whiskers left behind by the hot glue.

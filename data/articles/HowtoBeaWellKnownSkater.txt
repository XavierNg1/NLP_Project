 It's okay to lose as long as you try your best and show your skate buddy that you had fun playing skate with him/her. Next, go to your local skate park and skate with random people, but don't play too much or else the skater you're playing with will think that you are a poser. Make sure that person is cool with you if they are jerks don't waste your time with them. Enjoy playing skate with them and show you are down to skate. If you try your best, that person will talk about you with his/her friends.;
, Show everybody that you are down to skate.
 but make sure they are well known and they are down to skate with you everyday if you do that make sure you invite your friends to skate with you or the crew.
 Also skate where there's a lot of people. If you are shy that you might fall when the people are looking at you, don't worry just skate and try your best to impress them. If you fall just get back up and do that trick again until you land it. Then people will know that you are a good skater. If you are still shy well just pretend they are not there. Don't try to look all bad-ass then the people will call you poser right behind your back. Just be yourself and everything will be alright. Also don't show off its really stupid to show off.
 If you think the video is good go to your local skate shop and show your video to them. If they like it the skate shop will make you well known.

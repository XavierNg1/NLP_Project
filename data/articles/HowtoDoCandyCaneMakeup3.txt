 To create perfect candy cane lips, you want the white to be very pigmented and opaque. In order to achieve this, you want to conceal the natural redness of your lips that could show through the white lipstick. Use a makeup sponge to dab concealer over your lips, making sure to cover the entire surface.
 After applying you concealer, it’s important to set it with a powder. Otherwise, you’ll be applying lip product over a creamy base, and you’ll end up with a smudged mess. Use your makeup sponge to press the powder into your lips, covering all of the concealer.








Brush off any excess powder with a fluffy brush.
 You can purchase a white lip liner at any beauty supply store. First, outline your lips entirely. This is a helpful first step, because it will define the border that has been concealed. Instead of just lining your lips, however, you’re going to use the lip liner to fill in the entirety of your lips.
 The white lip liner creates a really nice base for a white lipstick to adhere to. Carefully apply your white lipstick over the white eyeliner, making sure that every bit of your lips is opaque. If the white lipstick you use is creamy, dab it with translucent powder when you’re finished. If the lipstick is matte, you don’t need to do this.
 After your lips are completely white, it’s time to turn them into a candy cane! For this step, you’ll need red liquid lipstick and a small lip brush. Dip your lip brush into the liquid lipstick, and start creating diagonal stripes down your lips. Let your mouth rest naturally, so you can create lines that continue from the top lip straight down to the bottom lip.








Alternate between thick stripes of red and thin stripes of red, to mimic the pattern of real candy canes.
Continue creating these stripes diagonally across your lips until they are covered.

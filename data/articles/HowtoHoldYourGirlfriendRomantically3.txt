 This move is classic for a reason--it allows you to hold your girlfriend against you and invites her to rest her head on your shoulder.


When sitting side by side, drape your arm across her upper back. You can hold her arm or shoulder with your hand or run your hand up and down her arm.
After a few minutes, try gently running your fingers through her hair.
If you are very comfortable with each other, take your free arm and slide it under her knees, encouraging her to lift her legs and drape them across your lap.
If she's resting her head on your shoulder, you can rest your head on the top of her head.
 Lie down on your side behind your girlfriend. She should also be on her side. Wrap your arm around her and pull her back against you, so her back is pressed against your chest.


You may have to move around a bit to figure out what to do with the arm that is beneath you. It can quickly become uncomfortable if your arm gets pinned underneath your body weight or your girlfriend.
Make it even more intimate by intertwining your legs together while you're spooning.
 If you two are having a lovely day in the park and decide to stretch out on your backs and gaze at the sky, now is a perfect time to bring her close to you. If you are not already side by side, scoot over so you are close to her.


Slide your arm under her neck or have her lift her head so you can get your arm around her.
Place your hand on her shoulder and gently pull her toward you.
This position will allow her to rest her head on your chest or arm. She may remain laying on her back or roll onto her side so she is facing you.
Use your free hand to run your fingers through her hair or caress her face.

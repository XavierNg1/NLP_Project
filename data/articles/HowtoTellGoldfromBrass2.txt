 The karat is a measurement used to designate the purity of gold. Higher ratios of gold to other metals in a piece means a higher karat count. Pure gold is 24 karat. A brass piece will not be marked with a karat count. The karat count is typically found in an inconspicuous place such as the bottom or inside of a piece, though it varies from piece to piece., Many brass pieces will have the word “Brass” somewhere on the metal. This word is often stamped or engraved in the metal piece when it is forged. Just like the karat count, the location of this stamp will vary, but it is likely to be on the inside lip or the bottom of an object., If you know what the metal piece sells for, you can easily tell the difference between brass and gold. Gold is quite expensive depending on its purity. Brass is relatively cheap compared to precious metals like gold and silver.

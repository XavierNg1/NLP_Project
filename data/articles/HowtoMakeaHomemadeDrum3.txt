 For this method, you will need a round tin container or can, a roll of faux leather, a roll of thin rope, a marker, and scissors., Using a marker, draw around the can. Then, move the can over and draw around the can again.


These circles are going to be the top and bottom parts of the drum.
 This will give you extra leather to thread with rope.
 These snips will be used to thread the rope around the drum.
 Once you have thread the rope through the holes on the top piece and the bottom piece of leather, tie it off with a small knot and cut away the excess rope.
 Then, thread the rope from top to bottom using the threaded rope on the leather pieces, tightening as you go.
 The drum should not only look good, it should sound good too.


If you want to make a more durable drum, use eyelet pliers to make holes in the leather to then thread the rope through, as this will make the drum stronger and likely last longer.

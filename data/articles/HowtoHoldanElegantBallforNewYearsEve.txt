 If you are going to hold it at your home, you may want to decide where to move the furniture, where the coats will go, is there enough parking, is there enough seating areas, is it inviting, is it formal enough.;
, For example: masquerade ball. If you choose to have a theme mention it in your invitations

, They should read something along the lines of:


Please join us in celebrating the new year
New Year Inn, Newyearsville 09923
R.S.V.P 1-409-555-0163
Black Tie

,, Otherwise you may want to stock up on some music for background noise or ballroom dance.


If you are going to hire entertainment (dancers, fire breather, whatever you think would go best with your theme) book them.
, You may want to turn on the television (on mute) to a channel that will show the ball dropping.

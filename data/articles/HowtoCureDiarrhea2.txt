 Absorbents are medicines that bind to the walls of the intestine and colon and absorb water so that your stools are less watery.Follow package directions for dosage.


If using an absorbent, it is important not to take any medication within several hours of taking the absorbent. Absorbents can cause the medication to bind to the intestine and colon, diminishing their medicinal power. For best results, take absorbents and medications separately.
 Bismuth compounds, found in common products such as Pepto-Bismol, are reputed to have antibiotic-like properties that counteract the bacteria that produce diarrhea.It's not exactly known how bismuth compounds combat diarrhea. They may only be beneficial for patients suffering from traveler's diarrhea or those battling the H. pylori bacterium.
 Anti-motility medications cause a slowdown in the movement of the intestine and colon. This slowdown relaxes the bowel organs, which gives the organs more time to absorb water, resulting in less watery stool. Two common anti-motility medications include loperamide and diphenoxylate. Loperamide is available without prescription in various forms (such as Imodium A-D).Individuals with infectious diarrhea (such as from E. coli) should avoid anti-motility medications., If the medications you're taking, in conjunction with bland food and plenty of water, don't seem to improve your case of diarrhea after seventy-two hours, see your doctor. They may prescribe an antibiotic medication, which will help treat diarrhea caused by a bacterium or parasite. Antibiotics will not help diarrhea caused by a virus.It is very important to see your doctor if OTC options have proven ineffective because diarrhea from bacterial or parasitic infections can actually worsen due to these medications.Your doctor will determine the specific antibiotic to prescribe for your symptoms after using a stool culture to identify the bacteria causing the symptoms.

 Get ahead by sorting through your things. Go through old papers, donate clothes that only take up room in your closet, or file away photos. You will feel so good after you are done, and you won't have to worry about not being able to find something later on when you don't have the time., Even if your house may not seem dirty, there are always places that get neglected. Now is your chance to finally clean behind the fridge, dust those fan blades, or clean out your microwave., If you have the time, use it to plan for the future. Whether it be for next week or next year, there are always things you can be prepping for. Plan your Halloween costume, what you want for Christmas, how you want to redo your bedroom, or even what you want to do for a career.

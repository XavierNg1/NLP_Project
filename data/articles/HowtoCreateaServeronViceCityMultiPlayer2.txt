 Gamemodes are available from the VC:MP Showroom.



If the script is a ZIP and there is a gamemodes folder in the archive, extract the gamemode to your server's gamemodes folder.
If the script is a ZIP but there are no folders, extract the gamemode to the server's gamemodes folder.
If the script is not a ZIP, move it to the server's gamemodes folder.
 Open server.cfg and change the gamemode line so it is the filename of the mode without the ending .amx extension.
 If the gamemode works properly, the server should run and your new mode should be loaded.

 Your passenger-side front tire should be gently touching the curb, and your passenger-side rear tire should be no more than six inches from the curb.If you are parking uphill, make sure to leave a full car's length of space behind your vehicle. You will need this space to back into the curb.
If you are parking on a downhill incline, be sure to leave a full car's length of space in front of your car so that the wheels can roll forward into position.
 Face your tires away from the curb if you are parking uphill. Twist them toward the curb if you are parking downhill. Press your foot on the brake, put the car in neutral, and turn your steering wheel one full turn in the proper direction.


If there is no curb, make sure
Avoid "dry steering" â€“ turning your wheels while the vehicle is completely stopped. This is hard on the tires and the power steering system.
 First, put the car into neutral, but keep your foot on the brake. When you are ready, take your foot off the brake. Let the car roll slowly downhill until you feel your front tire touch the curb. Hit the foot-brake to stop the car.Make sure that there are no other cars coming up or down the hill behind you. Check your mirrors and look over your shoulder., Then, shift the car into either first gear or reverse. Leave the vehicle in first gear if you are parking on an uphill incline, and leave it in reverse if you are parking on a downhill incline. This will help keep your car from rolling, as it sets your transmission in the opposite direction that the car would roll if your emergency brake fails.

 As a general rule, you should use about 5 oz (150 ml) of juice per 1.5 to 2 oz (45 to 60 ml) of gin. The type of juice you use is really up to you, but tart juices are more commonly used than sweet juices.


For a milder taste, consider using pineapple juice, orange juice, pomegranate juice, cherry juice, or grape juice.
For a slightly stronger taste, consider grapefruit juice or cranberry juice.
You can also combine juices as long as the ratio of gin to juice remains the same. Try mixing grapefruit juice and orange juice, cranberry and grape, or another of your favorite juice combinations.Strong citrus fruits, like lemon and lime, can also be mixed with gin but are generally combined with other ingredients, like syrup or soda water, to dilute the sourness.;
, Secure the lid on the container and shake it using a vigorous up and down motion away from your face and away from anyone else. Shake it for at least 15 seconds to mix the ingredients completely.
 To chill the glass, store it inside the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes before using it. Fill the glass at least halfway full with ice.
 Release the lid and pour the contents of the mixture over the ice.
 A slice of citrus fruit, like lemon or lime, works well depending on the juices in your drink. You could also float a small sprig of mint on top of the drink.
 In order to maintain a proper balance of flavor, the drink should be consumed before the ice has a chance to melt.

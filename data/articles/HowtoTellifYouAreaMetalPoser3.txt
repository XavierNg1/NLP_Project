 Choose an instrument from the classic arrangement of metal. You have the guitar, drums, bass, or keyboard. Keyboard isn’t as popular of an instrument for metal, but it does have its place. Pick what you love the most from the genre. If you catch yourself playing air guitar during a Van Halen song, pick up the guitar.


If you notice yourself tapping out rhythms while listening to motorhead on the bus, start playing the drums.
 Once you start playing an instrument and learn the basics, attempt to play a song you know well. It is easier to learn songs that you already know by heart. This way when you are reading tabs online, you won’t need to listen to the song repeatedly.


You can get far by learning classic metal songs like “Master of Puppets,” “Thunderstruck,” or “Iron Man.”, The best way to start a band with your friends is by assigning instruments in the beginning. That way each person can pick out an instrument to learn and dedicate time to practice. Once you all become decent at your instruments, try to write a song together.


It especially helps if you have this conversation before Christmas.
It is easier to write a song as a band if the guitar player creates a riff before practice. That way she can show it to the group and the band will waste less time.
It is also good for a band to become comfortable together by learning metal songs.
Have a decent space to practice music., Look at local venues in your area that host metal shows. A lot of venues host shows that have age restrictions like “18+” or “21+”. Look on the venue’s website before showing up to the venue.


If you follow a specific metal band, check to see if they have an upcoming tour.
 Many people start out as metalheads in middle school but start to lose their roots as they grow up. Be true to your metalhead roots if you want to be a true metalhead. Even if you take a break from listening to metal for a month or a year, you can still enjoy metal.

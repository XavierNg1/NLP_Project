 Don’t ignore bullying of any kind. You can deal with someone else being bullied because of their sexual orientation if you take action. Just knowing that someone cares and is there for them can help someone that is experiencing homophobic bullying.Hang out with the bullying victim. This may help them feel better about themselves. It can also discourage the bully from bothering them anymore.
Tell the bully to stop. You could say something like, “Bro, leave him alone. He hasn’t done anything to you.”
Immediately tell someone of authority like law enforcement, religious leaders, or teachers if the bully is threatening to physically hurt or does hurt the other person.
 If you are comfortable doing so, then say something when your friends, family, or others are saying or doing things that are homophobic.This is a good way to deal with homophobic bullying because it lets the bully know that what they are doing isn’t okay.


You could look confused and say, “I’m sorry, but what does being gay have to do with anything? No one cares about that type of stuff anymore” if you hear someone make a homophobic comment.
You don’t have to confront the bully, but you can do something like make a joke to break the tension of the moment.
For example, you might say with a laugh, “That reminds me of my grandma – talking about sexuality and stuff like that. She can be so old-fashioned. She even calls DVDs silver movies.”
This takes the pressure off of the bullying victim and expresses that homophobic bullying isn’t cool without directly confronting the bully.
 Educating people about bullying and about homosexuality can go a long way in ending homophobic bullying.


Plan an event or participate in one for International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia on May 17th.Work with your school or work leaders to make sure anti-bullying policies are in-place and that people are trained to deal with issues such as homophobic bullying.

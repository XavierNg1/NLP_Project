 Even if you would usually bring your computer or mp3 player to study while by yourself, leave that behind to study with a group. If you do pack these devices in your bag, be aware that you can only use them if your group takes a break or has self-study time during the meeting. Do not bring them out in the middle of the group work, and leave them behind altogether if you think you might be tempted to do so.


As with individual study, make sure to bring any textbooks, notebooks, and past assignments need to study for the class or subject you plan on studying with your group. Also bring fresh notebook paper, pens, and highlighters.
 If the library is large enough to have a designated quiet floor, stay off of it. Quiet floors are meant for individual study. During a group study session, you will need to speak with other group members. As such, you should stick with a floor that is not designated as a quiet area.
 Make sure that everyone can fit comfortably. If you have a small group made of two or three people, a small circular table will still probably work. If you have a group that is larger than that, though, you will likely need a larger rectangular table.
 Find out what your libraryâ€™s policy is concerning the use of these rooms. Oftentimes, you will need to reserve the room in advance, but this is not always the case. Some libraries will allow you to use any study room you please as long as it is open when you get there.


For exceptionally large groups, you may want to consider asking about using a large meeting room at the library.These rooms tend to have stricter conditions placed on them.






Use an open meeting room if the library will allow it. If a meeting room is not reserved by a group, some libraries may allow you and your study group to meet in there, especially if all the study rooms and other study areas are filled.

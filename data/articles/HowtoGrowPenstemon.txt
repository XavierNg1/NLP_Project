 These can be bought online or from a nursery. Alternatively, for more true-to-type flowers, grow them from cuttings.;
, The soil should be rich, free-draining but rich. Add a little well-rotted compost or manure. If growing alpine penstemons, they don't need the soil to be enriched.


Choose a sunny or dappled shade position.






Mulch well if in a cold area.
 Planting should take place in mid- to late spring. Leave 45 centimeter (17.7Â in) (18") between each Penstemon plant.
 This will encourage the formation of more stems, and therefore more flowers.
 Once established, the mature plant can draw much water from the soil but supplement this with weekly to bi-weekly watering if it's hot and dry.
 This will encourage new growth and more flowering, extending the flowering season.
 This will ensure vigorous growth.
 This is to prevent a woody and straggly appearance. They can be trimmed hard once winter is over. Remove old flower spikes as cuttings once the new shoots appear in spring.

 It is recommended that beginners go to shops such as the Food Shop or the Book Shop.;
, You can watch the shop as it restocks for a while, or look it up with a search engine.
 In the shop, they will sell for a set price, usually higher than you can actually get for them in the user marketplace. Some items, like certain neggs or chia pops, will sell in shops for a few hundred to several thousand neopoints below what you can get for them from other users, while rare items such as morphing potions will fetch up to a few MILLION more points than you spend on them. (Note that the higher the profit, the more likely it is that someone else will get to it first.) You can check out how much an item is worth to users by using the Shop Wizard. If it doesn't show up there, it might be too expensive. Try searching it in auctions and at the trading post.
 If there is, move on to the next step. If not, just wait a bit and refresh a little. Do not constantly refresh, or Neopets will ban you from restocking. If you are unsure if you are banned from restocking, go to the Tiki Tack. That shop is never empty. If there is nothing for sale, you are for sure banned from restocking.
 It should go without saying that you only want to buy the items you will make a profit on.
 Now you have to haggle. It will give you a price that the shop keeper wants at least for the item. Haggle around 50 Neopoints below the price they want. If they don't accept the offer, keep haggling.
 Put it into your shop, and price it slightly below the lowest prices you see on the shop wizard, to ensure it sells, or if it is in a price range of a million or more, put it on the trading post or up for auction.
 This is the key to having people buy from you. Get the link to your shop, and post it onto the boards under shop ads.

 Try to keep the lines as straight as possible. You can use a ruler if you want.
 It should be congruent and behind the first square you drew. You should now have two squares overlapping one another. The further they are apart, the longer your house will be. (For a relatively square house, the distance between the squares should be about a quarter of either square’s length.)

, Draw lines connecting the corners of each square. Make sure you connect each to the nearest corner, and that you then connect that to the other square. This will make your squares into a three-dimensional cube.
 This will determine the point of the roof. It should be high in comparison to the house’s base, but not more than half its height.
 They should all be attached to the dot by a smooth, straight line. This will be the roof.
 All of your inner lines should be gone except for the line that differentiates the roof from the base of the house. (You can still erase it if you want, but it will be harder to tell where the house stops and the roof begins.)

, The windows should be small and square, and not too close to the walls’ edges. The door is a rectangle with a circle for a doorknob. If you want you can draw a window on the side of the house, but it needs to be a parallelogram, not a square.
 Create details and make sure you shade correctly. It works best if you choose a bright color for the base of the house, and an equally bright color for the roof. Then take darker versions of these colors, and color in the other side with them; this will shade your drawing effectively.

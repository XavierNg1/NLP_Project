 Sometimes extreme heat or cold weather can cause your electric key to stop working properly. Also if you go on a run with your key in hand the sweat can work it’s way in there and cause some issues. Let your key rest for a little while before you pay money to replace it. It might come back to life.
 A key fob may stop working properly after a change or repair to your car’s electrical systems (such as replacing the battery, for example). Find the owner’s manual for your particular car (or hunt one down online) and reset all the keys according to the instructions provided.
 If you notice your key working poorly over the span of a few days it might be the battery dying. A replacement battery for a key fob is usually inexpensive and can be found online, at an auto-locksmith or electronics store. Make sure you have the make, model, year, and VIN number of the car. Most batteries should be simple enough for you to replace yourself. You unscrew the Philips screw at the back of the key, remove the old battery, and put the new one in. Voila! You can also go straight to the dealer or manufacturer, but this may be more expensive, especially if they charge for labor when they install the new battery. Check your car’s warranty to see if battery replacement is covered.
 If you don’t want to do this yourself, you can get help from some locksmiths or even the car’s dealership, but the simplest solution is usually to follow the instructions provided in your owner’s manual. Normally the reset involves pressing a series of buttons in a certain order but it’s different for every car. Check your owners manual.

 Talk with your siblings to decide who should take on which responsibilities. Split up tasks based on what your siblings are good at or what they can do easily.For instance, if your sister is an accountant, maybe she should be in charge of your parents’ finances.
Or, if one sibling is having an exceptionally difficult time dealing with the parent's illness, do not assign them the role of healthcare power of attorney.
 Just because one sibling lives far away doesn’t mean they can’t contribute. Perhaps they can chip in extra money towards your parents’ care, find ways to visit more frequently, or call their parents several times a week.Avoid making decisions about your parents’ care without talking to far-flung siblings first. They may want to help just as much as you do and feel upset if you leave them out.
Remember that this new situation means that roles and dynamics may be changing, so don't assume that a sibling who was not involved with the family in the past won't want to be very involved now.
 It will probably never be possible for you and your siblings to split elder care tasks equally, especially if you have different income levels or live in different locations. Accept that one of you may end up doing a bit more work than the others, and focus on finding ways for each sibling to contribute to the best of their ability., Avoid assuming that you shouldn’t have to ask your siblings to help you out more. They may not realize you’re feeling overwhelmed unless you tell them so. Instead of letting your resentment build, tell your siblings what kind of help you need.Ask for help in concrete terms. Say something like, “Can you start picking up groceries for Mom every week? I’m having a hard time fitting it in with my other errands.”

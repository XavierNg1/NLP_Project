 Keep it light; you want to gain the trust of your players as quickly as possible. Be transparent about your plans, but be willing to accept suggestions or tips. Most of all, stress the importance of having fun. Your players will be looking to you for guidance, so set a good example.
 Rather than simply sending everyone out on the court and letting them start playing, you should find out who enjoys playing where. At the very least, it gives you a starting point when you run your first practice.
 Have the players do some pre-practice jogging. Encourage them to run layup lines or take jump shots. Light activity leading into a practice is a good way to prevent injury and get loose—and that goes for players of any age or skill level.
 Keep things basic at first, running simple half-court sets while focusing on instruction rather than execution. At this point, your primary goal should be to have the players moving to the right spots at the right times. Run each play until it is clear that your players understand what they’re supposed to do and where they’re supposed to be. Then, move on to the next play.
 Maybe Dave believes he should be a point guard, but that doesn’t mean he’ll be good at it. Perhaps you see Dave’s ability to move without the ball and his good mid-range shot and you decide that he would be a better small forward or shooting guard. Encourage your players to keep an open mind as you find the best fit for them. Sometimes all it takes is one or two position moves to turn your team into a world-beater.
 You may not like what you see at certain points of the practice, but a good coach will always find a way to highlight what players are doing correctly, even if there isn’t much to praise. Players—young or novice ones in particular—are more likely to respond positively when a coach isn’t berating them all the time.

 California provides a statewide uniform guideline for calculating child support. Within the statute is a formula that is used by judges and others when coming up with support payments. The guidelines, and the formula, can be found at http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&group=04001-05000&file=4050-4076. The child support formula is: CS = K.


CS is the child support amount.
K is the amount of both parents' incomes that can be allocated to child support.
HN is the high earner's net monthly disposable income.
H% is the approximate percentage of time the child will be in the physical custody of the high earner.
TN is the total net monthly disposable income of both parents., To calculate K, you add one to your H% value if that value is less than or equal to 50%. If your H% value is greater than 50%, you will subtract two from that number. You will then multiply that number by one of the following fractions:


(.20 + TN/16,000) if your TN value is between $0 and $800.
(.25) if your TN value is between $801 and $6,666.
(.10 + 1,000/TN) if your TN value is between $6,667 and $10,000.
(.12 + 800/TN) if your TN value is over $10,000.
For example, if H% equals 20% and the TN value is $1,000, K = (1 + .20) x (.25), which is .30. Therefore, in this example, your K = .30., To figure out each party's net disposable income, you will need deduct various amounts from your total annual gross income. You will then divide this number by 12 in order to get the monthly amount.


Some of the deductions include income tax deductions, contribution deductions, mandatory union dues, health insurance costs, other spousal support payments, hardship deductions, and some job related expenses.For example, assume your annual gross income is $40,000. After deductions, assume your yearly disposable income is $6,500. Next, consider the other parent's yearly disposable income, which you can assume is $5,500. Assume they have an annual gross income of $35,000. Therefore, the total yearly disposable income of both parents equals $12,000 ($6,500 + $5,500). You will then divide this number by 12 to get the total monthly disposable income. In this example, that will equal $1,000 ($12,000/12). Therefore, your TN value will equal $1,000.
In the same example, in order to figure out the HN value, you can simply divide the high earner's yearly disposable income by 12. Because the high earner is you, who makes $40,000 annually, you will divide your yearly disposable income by 12. When you do so, you will get $541.67 ($6,500/12). Therefore, your HN value will equal $541.67.
 This will be an approximation based on the amount of time the parent that makes more money has physical control over the child. If you have worked out an agreement with the other parent, look at that agreement and make a determination.


For example, if you are the high earner, the H% percentage will represent the amount of time you have physical custody of your child. Assume you have an agreement with the other parent and it states that you get the child 20% of the time. Therefore, your H% value will equal 20%.
 Once you have all of your numbers, you will plug them into the formula and make the calculation. The total that comes out is the amount of child support that should be paid according to the state guidelines.


For example, using the examples above, your completed formula should look like this: CS = .3. When you do the math, your CS should equal $102.50, which is the amount of monthly child support you would owe.
 While the formula is the most common way of calculating child support, courts will deviate from it in certain situations.


For example, courts might not follow the formula when it produces a CS value that greatly exceeds the needs of the child. This usually happens when one parent has an extremely high income.
In another example, if children have special medical or other needs, a court may require child support in an amount that exceeds the amount calculated using the formula.

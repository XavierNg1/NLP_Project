 If you see a large spill sitting on your floor, grab a paper towel or clean cloth and wipe it up. Keep going until youâ€™ve picked up all of the liquid. If the stain is sticky, follow up with a damp cloth., Try to vacuum your laminate floor at least twice a week. This will help to remove any dirt or grime that could scratch your floors. Every two weeks or so, do a deeper clean with a solution and mop. Of course, if your floor looks particularly dirty, it never hurts to clean a bit sooner., Do an online search for a floor cleaning specialist in your area. Let them know that you have a laminate floor and provide any information that you have regarding the manufacturer. Specifically request that they use only natural products when cleaning. They will then visit your home, clean your floors, and set up a future cleaning schedule with you.

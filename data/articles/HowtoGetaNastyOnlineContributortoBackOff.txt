 If they are saying bad things to other users, then know the nature of the bad things that they are saying, and if they are simply targeting one user, or a lot of users. If they are vandalizing pages on the site, know what pages they have vandalized, and what they put on them. This is helpful information for going to a site administrator and asking if they can block them.
 Be sure that you avoid having your message sound rude when you tell them, as this may only encourage them to keep doing what they are doing., When writing your message, use a format similar to this: Hello _______ (person's username). I would like you to stop ________ (what they are doing), because _______ (why you would like them to stop).

You can also put this together with the message warning the user about the consequences that may happen to them.
 Usually, a list of them can be found somewhere on the website., Once you have decided, contact or email that person, and explain to them:

The person's username.
What they are doing.
The nature of what they are doing (extremely hurtful to others, criticizing people's work in a rude way, etc.)
That you would like them to take action on the person, if they can.
 Sometimes, if you just ignore a bully, then they will back off because it's no fun when their target is not responding to them.

 Do your parents know what a convention is? Do they have the wrong idea? Perhaps they've seen something like it on TV, and they might think it's a festival of women wearing skimpy outfits and men wearing tights. Tell your parents exactly what a convention is if they don't already know. Make sure they don't have the wrong idea!;
, Just as with asking for anything else, be mature with your parents. Whining, begging, and complaining might lessen your chances of getting what you want.
 If your parents aren't aware that you're an anime fan, let them know. If they are aware, express your desire to go and why it means so much to you. Portray it as an event for you to meet new friends who like the same things as you.
 Tell them that conventions are not for abnormal people, and that perfectly normal people cosplay and go to conventions.
 If your parents meet another person who likes anime, or has been to a convention, they might come to realize that you aren't the only one.
 If it's the money part they're worried about, then pay for it yourself. Find a job, like babysitting or doing chores, to earn money for your convention, and maybe even your costume. This will show your parents that you are mature, responsible, and can work for things you really want.
 If your parents are worried about the appropriateness of the convention, try to wait until you're 13. Also, tell them that skimpy outfits usually only appear in conventions meant for superheroes, not anime.
 If you and a group of friends are planning to go to a con, perhaps having your parents chat with the other parents about it will widen their understanding, and they will be reassured that other parents allow it as well.
 Perhaps by then, you will be living all by yourself, and you can go to as many conventions as you want!

, You now have officially convinced your parents to let you do something, which is not an easy task! Kudos to you.

 Grab a 1-1/2 to 2 quart (1-1/2 to 2 L) oven-safe baking dish. A glass or ceramic one with a lid is ideal., Bring the water to a boil on the stove over high heat.


Note that you may also boil the water in a tea kettle.
 Pour the boiling water over the barley. Stir to combine.
 Make sure that it is well-combined, then cover the dish with its lid.


If you do not have a lid for your baking dish, cover it tightly with aluminum foil.
 Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for one hour. Place it on the center rack for best results.
 Lightly fluff the finished barley with a spoon or fork. Spoon it into a serving dish and serve alongside a main course.

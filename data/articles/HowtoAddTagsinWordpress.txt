,, The dashboard is the vertical list of words running down the left side of the page.
 You should be sent to a page that says "Edit Post."





, Under the boxes entitled "Publish" and "Categories," you will find a "Tags" box.
 Use nouns of things that you discuss in your post, but also feel free to post words like "humor" if it is a funny post or locations and emotions that describe the post. Click "Add" after typing each word in lowercase letters, to add it as a tag to your post. When adding WordPress tags, be sure to add after every word, unless they are words that go together like "Carson City."





,, You will arrive at a screen showing all your tags, a paragraph showing your most popular tags and the option to add more tags.


You can also use this page to delete or edit your current tags.

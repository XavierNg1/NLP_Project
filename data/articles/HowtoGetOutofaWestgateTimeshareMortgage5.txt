 Timeshare cancellation is a different process than a deed transfer or timeshare donation. You do not need to have your timeshare paid off, or be up to date on your maintenance fees. Timeshare cancellation works by using consumer rights violations to cancel a timeshare contract.
 To be a candidate for a timeshare cancellation, you must have been the victim of lies or misrepresentations in the purchase of your timeshare. Some of the biggest lies timeshare salespeople tell are that buying a timeshare is an investment and that the timeshare will increase in value, that the price of the timeshare you are being offered is a "once in a lifetime opportunity", and that you'll be able to rent your timeshare out when you aren't using it to make money.

 BBB accreditation is a good indicator of a legitimate business.

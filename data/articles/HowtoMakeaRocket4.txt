 The triangle should be an isosceles triangle approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the base and 2 inches (5 cm) from the center of the base to the apex.,, Place the match and pin so that the pinpoint touches the match head no higher than the thickest part of the head.
 Wrap the foil as tightly around the match head as you can without disturbing the pin. When youâ€™re finished, the wrapping should extend about 1/4 inch (6.25 mm) below the match head.
 This will push the wrapping closer to the match head and also better define the channel formed by the pin under the wrapping

, Be careful not to tear the foil when you do this.



Bend the outer bend to a 60-degree angle. This will form the base of the launching pad.
Bend the inner bend upward, then around to form an open-ended triangle. This is where you will rest the foil-wrapped match head.
 Again, an open, outdoor location is strongly recommended, as the matchstick rocket can travel a considerable distance. Avoid locations that are exceptionally dry, as the matchstick rocket could start a fire.


Be sure the surrounding area is clear before launching the rocket.
 The rocket should rest at least at a 60-degree angle. If it rests any lower, you may have to bend the paper clip until it does.
 Light a match and put its flame directly under the wrapped match head. When the phosphorus in the wrapped match head ignites, the matchstick rocket should lift off.


Have a pail of water handy to dunk spent matchstick rockets in to ensure they are completely extinguished.
If a matchstick rocket should land on you, stop moving, drop to the ground, and roll until any flames are extinguished.

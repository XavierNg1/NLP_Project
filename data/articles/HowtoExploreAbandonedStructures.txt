 Trespassing is illegal in many countries and jurisdictions. Private property laws vary from one place to another and you should not assume a legal action in one area is legal in another. At many larger structures, the caretakers will grant permission to view the premises they preserve.;
, Without speaking with a caretaker or owner, you could be perceived as a squatter, vandal, arsonist, or someone looking for salvage. Make your intentions clear to avoid unfounded accusations.
 In most cases, the structures you are looking to explore caught your interest during other activities, rather than by intentional scouting. However, unmentioned structures show their neglect and can be found simply by traveling around your town or city. You can also find structure locations from people with similar interests on internet forums.
 What are the possible entrances (or exits, if there is a need to escape)? Windows, unlocked doors, doors that can be opened by force (note laws), rooftops, tunnels, and holes are all possible entry points into abandoned buildings.
 Sometimes it's better to enter during the day for lighting purposes, but nighttime is usually better because you're less likely to be seen. Bring a flashlight and a friend along!

, Do you have to hop a barbed-wire fence, or can you squeeze through an opening instead? In many cases, you'll find infiltrating a structure is much easier than it looks. Barbed-wire, high walls, and locked doors are all good deterrents, but in many cases, there is a part of the structure that is much more vulnerable.
 Take pictures; look at old furniture, papers, machinery, or anything that catches your eye.
 You wouldn't want to ruin the experience for future explorers. You also don't want a police report filed if anything is destroyed or stolen.

 If you are raising money to start a business or other activity which will have returns, consider getting a loan. There are many different types of loans, all with different benefits and downsides. Investigate these to see which type is best for you.
 Apply for the loan. You will probably need to go in to whichever bank is offering you the loan (be sure to choose a reputable bank, preferably that you have a history or account with) and talk to them about your options and what is expected of you. The paperwork will probably be long and complex, so pay attention to what you are signing up for.
 If you get a loan, it will be very important to pay it back. Donâ€™t get lazy and take the money for granted or you will find yourself with a bad credit score or even in trouble with the law. Plan ahead so you know exactly how much money needs to be set aside and when it needs to be paid by.

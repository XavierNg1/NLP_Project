 A time signature contains two numbers and is written as a fraction. The top number represents the number of beats in one measure of music.Common top numbers include: 2, 3, 4, and 6.


For example, if the top number is “4”, then each measure consists of four beats. If the top number is “6”, then the measure consists of six beats.;
, In a time signature, the bottom number represents the type of note that receives the beat. Each type of note is assigned a specific number.


“1”: Whole note (the whole note is worth one beat)
“2”: Half note (the half note is worth one beat)
“4”: Quarter note (the quarter note is worth one beat)
“8”: Eighth note (the eighth note is worth one beat)
”16”: Sixteenth note (the sixteenth note is worth one beat), After you’ve viewed the top and bottom numbers independently, you can view the two numbers as a whole. Below are a view examples:


4/4: each bar has four beats and the quarter note is worth one beat.
3/4: each bar has three beats and the quarter note is worth one beat.
2/2: each bar has two beats and the half note is worth one beat.
6/8: each bar has six beats and the eighth note is worth one beat., Instead of numbers, sometimes the time signature is represented by a symbol. The letter “C” stands for common time and it is used to replace 4/4 time. The letter “C” with a slash through it stands for cut time and is used to replace 2/4 time.

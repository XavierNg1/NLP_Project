 Do not be afraid to consult your doctor if the 4-6 hour interval between doses doesn't manage the pain. You need to have treatment for the pain that works for you and the doctor might have to tailor it specifically.;
, The rules are there for a reason, so that you don't go past your limits, or so that you don't simply give up and do nothing. Follow the therapist's instructions as best you can and explain if anything is too difficult for you.
 The pain is intense the first 14 days post op. Have a raft of activities around you to keep your mind on other things and coping with it as it heals. Each day promises to be better as you mend.
 Keep moving - this is the best way to help your body heal and to prevent any complications from arising.

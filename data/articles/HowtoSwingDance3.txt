 Start with the left foot forward and the right foot back, with the right toes level with the back of the left foot.
,,,, You should have four “foot spots”, two on each of two parallel lines. Two should be on the right and equally offset from the remaining two on the right.
 You can make this basic step more exciting by adding a number of flourishes. Begin by adding a bouncing movement to each step. Next, pivot your feet in and out on the front half of your foot with each step. Next, make the forward-most foot placement (rather than an outward step) a short kick. You are now dancing a proper Charleston!

, You can dance this alone, as described, or you can dance with a partner. You can dance facing, with the partner mirroring the lead’s movements. You can also dance it back to front or side by side. If dancing side by side, mirror the movements, so that you kick back the inner legs at the same time. Hold hands with each variation.

 For a marriage to work, your current relationship should be high quality. If you are already in a relationship with someone and considering marriage, then you will need to take time to evaluate the quality of your relationship.Some other things you might consider include:


how well you work together
your shared interests and goals
how well you listen to each other
whether or not you encourage each other

, Physical attraction often brings two people together, but it should not be the basis of your relationship.Make sure that you have more than just a physical attraction and great sex before you decide to marry someone. These things are temporary and will not sustain your relationship.
 People do not usually change after marriage, so if you have problems now, then they are probably going to get worse after you get married.Make sure that you love the person as he or she is, even when he or she is having a terrible day! If you cannot accept this person on the good days and the bad days, then you may want to reconsider marrying the person.


For example, you might not be able to stand your partner when he or she is angry and this can make it difficult to work out any problems that arise in the relationship.

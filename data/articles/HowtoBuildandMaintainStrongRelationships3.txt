 This is key, especially when it comes to building new relationships. This was already mentioned previously in this article, but the rise of technology has made face to face communication difficult, especially for younger people. According to a recent Gallup poll, texting is the most common form of communication for Americans under the age of 50.


Because of this, people are less skilled at asking others out on dates or scheduling hangouts with potential friends. However, if the relationship is truly something you want to pursue, start small, but go for it! Every relationship has to start somewhere.
 While common interests shouldn't be the only thing sustaining a long term, deep relationship, it's a great place to start. Broadening the range of activities you choose to take part in increases the chance of meeting someone you connect well with. It also gives you more conversation starters and can cause people to perceive you as a more interesting, well-rounded person.
 Are your relationships missing that “spark” they once had? Lack of enthusiasm is a sign your relationship is in need of a jumpstart. Often times, boredom occurs in relationships because you have grown used to being around the same person all the time. Remembering the reasons you initially chose to pursue a relationship can sometimes put things back into perspective.

 Start at both temples and move your fingers straight back so they meet in the middle of the back of your head. This should divide your hair in roughly half., Use a clear elastic band to put the top section of your hair into a ponytail. Don't pull it too tight against your head, because you need enough room to weave your hair over it.
 Near the base of your elastic, poke a finger up from the bottom side of your ponytail through the hair in the middle of your ponytail. Don't make this hole too big, since that can cause the ponytail to fall apart, Take a section hair from the loose hair on the left side of your head. Lay it over the top of your ponytail and pull it down through the hole in your hair you made on the right side. Pull the section of hair down so that it lays flat.
 Poke another hole up from the bottom on the left side near your ponytail. Then pull a section of loose hair from the right side of your head and lay it over your ponytail. Pull it through the hole you made with your finger on the left side until it lays flat over your ponytail.
 Once you've pulled hair through on both sides of your ponytail, the woven ponytail is finished. But you can use bobby pins to secure it if you want to feel like it has a little more structure. Start with the bobby pin underneath your ponytail, facing the back of your head. Slide it over the end of the piece of hair you've woven over the top of your ponytail up and into the hair behind your ponytail. Repeat this for the other side of your head.

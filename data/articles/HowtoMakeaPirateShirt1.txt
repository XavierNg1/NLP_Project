 Start with a white shirt about two sizes too big. You're going for a loose blouse look, but you can also use a night shirt or a regular button down shirt.;
, These holes should be one inch (2.5 cm) apart, and big enough to put a shoelace through. This way, the cuff can act as a casing for the shoelace in the next step.
 Cut an old brown or white shoelace in half. Push the shoelace through the holes in the cuff, in and out of the sleeves. Tie the ends in a knot on the inside of your wrist, and pull to give yourself puffy sleeves.
 Punch holes in line with the top buttons of the shirt (or down the center of the blouse), about two inches (5 cm) apart. Stop at the second or third button hole, depending on how much chest you want exposed.
 Using another white or brown shoelace, make a loose criss-cross pattern through the chest holes, ending with a knot.
 For a dirty pirate look, stain the shirt by wetting it with coffee or tea. Leave it overnight, rinse out the liquid, and wash the shirt.

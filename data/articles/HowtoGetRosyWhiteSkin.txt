 Skin lightening products with hydroquinone or kojic acid reduce the amount of melanin in the skin when applied.These can be effective, but they come with certain risks:


Skin whitening products have been associated with toxic levels of mercury, and therefore, with mercury poisoning. The FDA regulates the use of hydroquinone in the U.S, and so it's relatively safe. 1 out of every 4 skin whitening agents from China, however, contains mercury, and so should be used with caution.Be careful about sun exposure when using skin whitening agents. Prolonged sun exposure can lead to skin cancer.Always use appropriate sunscreen and other sun protection when exposed to sunlight.
Bleaching agents can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Bleaching agents with steroids, such as kojic acid, may put you at risk for health problems associated with steroid use.

 The citric acid in lemon slowly works away at the pigments in your skin, but this treatment will take a while. Mix equal parts fresh lemon juice and water into a spray bottle and apply evenly over skin you wish lightened. Consider:


Avoid exposure to sunlight. When using lemon and other skin-lightening products, always use sunscreen and avoid unnecessary time in the sun. Lemons and lemon juice can dry out skin, making it susceptible to sun damage.
Try using lemon or lemon juice only every other day. Lightening your skin with lemon juice will take a long time, so it's tempting to try to apply a mask or lemon juice every day. Try to stick to 3-4 applications every week. Lemon juice dries out the skin too much to apply every day.
Be aware of what products you put on your skin. Much of what you put on your skin gets absorbed into your body. If you are using other ingredients in addition to lemon juice as a peel, a wash, a lotion, or a mask, use good judgment about whether you'd want it in your bloodstream.

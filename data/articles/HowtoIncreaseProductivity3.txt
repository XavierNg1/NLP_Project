 This is vital for staying alert and productive throughout the week. Even on days when you're not working, stick as close to your regular wake up time and bedtime as you can.
 Your diet should contain plenty of protein, vitamins, healthy fats, healthy carbohydrates, and fiber. Eating high-carb foods — including fast food, processed foods, and desserts — will cause a crash in blood sugar that makes it difficult to get through the day.


Keep healthy snacks near your work area, especially if you tend to procrastinate by making yourself snacks.
 Coffee or energy drinks can give you a temporary boost to energy, but they will cause a crash in the end. Take these in moderate amounts, or save them for special circumstances. Consuming caffeine daily can make you reliant on it, forcing you to continue drinking it just to reach a basic level of comfort and alertness. If this happens to you, consider quitting for a more pleasant and efficient workday.
 Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day to maintain energy and health. Even just standing while you work or while you're on break can keep you more alert.
 Once you've finished your day's work, give yourself time to wind down. Do whatever it takes to help yourself "recharge," whether that's a night out with friends or a calm evening at home.


Take a personal day once in a while to avoid burning out. Hire someone to watch the kids, or take a day off from work.
 Avoiding relationship issues or problems at home won't make them go away. You bring your emotions to your work, and during tough times you won't be 100% focused. Work to address these issues if possible. In the meantime, free your mind before work with meditation, exercise, or talking to a trusted friend.

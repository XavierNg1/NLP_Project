 The finished product will be quite heavy, so use a piece of craft board or cardstock for the backing of the log cabin if you have the budget for it.
 He was known to have been born in a log cabin and to have worked hard to become president. Ask the children to share any other details they have researched or heard of President Lincoln.
 Ask each child to glue 8 popsicle sticks horizontally on their white craft board or construction paper backing. Show them an example of how it is done.
 They should cut a triangle roof from red or brown construction paper and glue it above the popsicle sticks.
 Ask them to glue their penny with Abraham Lincoln's face forward onto the window, as if he is looking out.



For more advanced ages, you can actually make a 3D Lincoln log cabin. Ask the lunch room to save all their small milk cartons for the day. Wash them out thoroughly. Cut the bottom out and tape the top edge of the milk cartons down so that you have a nice square shape.
Ask the children to cut out newspaper strips and roll them around pencils. Remove the pencil and have them tape the roll down. Have them make 30 of these rolls. Paint them brown with tempera paint and allow them to dry. Once dry, cut them and glue them onto the milk carton until you have a log cabin.

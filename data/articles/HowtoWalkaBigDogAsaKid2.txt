 You may not have the strength or physical presence necessary to control a big dog. While this can be frustrating, it’s important to realize that anyone walking a dog needs to be able to control the animal in the event of an emergency.If, for instance, another dog attacks your dog but is then restrained, you need to be able to restrain your dog as well. If you are not able to do so, you should not be walking a dog on your own.
 The more time you spend with your dog, the better your relationship will be, and the quicker you will learn how to behave around one another safely and lovingly. Petting and brushing your dog are both especially good ways to get to know them., Help train a large dog to be calm and friendly around you by providing treats when the dog is gentle and friendly with you. Talk to whomever trained the dog about whether you can practice talking to the dog, petting them, and offering them treats.Note that this assumes that your dog already knows how to do things like “sit” and “stay,” which are important basics that the dog's adults owners should teach the dog.
 Once you and your dog are comfortable around each other and the dog does not try to take things from you, you can start to train them basic tricks. Shaking hands, for example, is a fun and easy trick that kids can teach a dog once the dog is obedient and well-behaved.Put a treat in your pocket and position yourself in front of your dog and have them sit. Give them the command to “shake” in a clear voice, and hold your hand low enough for them to reach it with their front paw.
When they do, provide them with a treat and verbal praise. If they don’t understand at first, lift their paw gently off the ground with your hand, say “shake”, and pet them. Then try again. As soon as they shake, don’t forget to give them a treat.

 When you're ready to begin weaning your child, start by dropping one breastfeeding session a day. Which one you choose is up to you. For example, you may find that feeding at night soothes your baby, so you might want to keep that one and drop a different feeding.A midday feeding is often easiest to drop, as most babies will just have had a meal of solid food. Morning and evening sessions tend to be harder to drop at first, as they provide comfort to your baby.After a while, you should be able to take away another feeding. However, you should wait at least a week or two before taking away a second feeding.;
, Another way to start weaning is to simply have shorter sessions. Gradually stop a little earlier each time you feed your baby. The goal is to feed less overall each day.Instead of feeding for 15 minutes, try 10, for example. It can help to add a snack after breastfeeding, such as a couple of bites of baby food or an applesauce/fruit pouch., If your child isn't a year old yet, they should still be getting breast milk or formula as the main thing they drink. So if you're dropping a breast milk feeding, you need to giving your baby a bottle or a sippy cup of formula instead. Only use a cup if your baby is over 6 months.You can also offer expressed breast milk in the same way., You may be tempted to replace breast milk with cow's milk. However, before age 1, your child should be mainly drinking formula or breast milk. After your baby turns a year old, it's fine to give them cow's milk, but make the transition gradual.

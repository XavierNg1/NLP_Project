 There are some things that are acceptable to talk about regarding your relationship. However, there are some things you shouldn’t talk about. Personal details about your partner, intimate details, and information about conflicts are things that should not be discussed with anyone but a few close, trusted friends - if at all.Sharing too many details of your relationship can cause problems with you and your partner. It can also make others uncomfortable and reflect badly on you.
 Talking about your relationship isn’t a bad thing, and talking to your friends or family during a hard time is fine. However, sometimes people talk about their relationship just to get attention. Honestly look at your reasons for talking about your relationship.Are you sharing things about your relationship as a funny story, to feel better about yourself, or to get people to sympathize with you? These may be indications that you talk about your relationship too much and for the wrong reasons.
 Another way to decide if you talk about your relationship too much is to evaluate everything you say about it. Are you sharing interesting and important details, or are you just talking about your relationship for no reason? Are you sharing personal or intimate details you shouldn’t? Be honest as you assess what you say.Remember, just because you think it’s interesting doesn’t mean everyone will. Are you sharing things that deserve to be talked about?

, Figure out how often you talk about your relationship. Do you do it every day? Do you find a way to bring your relationship into each conversation? Taking an honest assessment of how often you bring it up can help get a clear picture.


If you can’t remember how often you talk about it, you can start paying attention to how often you bring it up or want to bring it up.

 Pull the leaves off the stalk, and be sure to leave the stems. This will make them easier to handle, and you can always trim the stems off at the end. Rinse the mint leaves in cool water and gently pat them dry with a paper towel.


If you are planning on using these leaves to decorate a cake, choose ones that look nice. Don't use any bruised or torn leaves.;
, If you are worried about Salmonella, use pasteurized egg whites or dried egg whites instead.If you are going to use powdered egg whites, mix them with about 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water first., Make sure that both sides are evenly coated, or the sugar won't stick. If the mixture is too runny after you have brushed it on, wait 1 minute before proceeding. This will allow the egg white to solidify a little.
 You can do this simply by tossing them in a bowl of sugar, or holding them by the stems and sprinkling sugar over them. You can also spread them out, cover them with sugar, flip them over, and cover them with more sugar.
 Make sure that the leaves are not touching or overlapping, or they will stick together when they dry.
 Once the leaves are dry, you can store them in an airtight container or use them as a garnish.
 You can eat them as a treat, or use them to garnish drinks, pastries, cakes, or even ice cream.

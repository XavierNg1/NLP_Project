 Know the face value, interest rate, and time to maturity of any bond you want to buy.


The face value is what the bond will be worth when it comes due ("matures"). For example, you might pay $25 for a bond with a face value of $50.
The interest (or "coupon") rate is the percentage of the face value that is payable in interest each year. Besides annual interest, a bond may make additional payments on a semi-annual or monthly basis.
The maturity date is when the face value of the bond must be paid (in addition to any interest). A bondholder could incur penalties (loss of income) by trying to redeem a bond before its maturity date.
 Let him/her know your financial situation and investment interests. This will dictate the type and number of bonds you should invest in.

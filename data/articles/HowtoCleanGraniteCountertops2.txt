 What happens when a dirty spot becomes a stubborn stain, not capable of being washed away simply with your homemade granite cleaner? Use baking soda for more stubborn stains that won't do away after a rub or two.


Baking soda is renowned as a cleaner. Also called sodium bicarbonate, this versatile cleaner is used for everything from a deodorant and pool cleaner to a toothpaste and fabric cleaner. In addition to these uses, it's an effective cleaning agent on granite.
 Treating water- and oil-based stains with baking soda works in different ways. If you can, try to find out if your stain is water- or oil-based. This will make your job a lot easier when it comes to mixing your baking soda poultice.
 "Poultice" is a fancy word for a soft, moist mixture. Depending on what type of stain you have, here's how you mix your poultice:


Water-based stains: 1 cup of baking soda, 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of liquid dish soap, and enough hydrogen peroxide to make the mixture into a yogurt consistency.
Oil-based stains: 1 cup of baking soda, 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of liquid dish soap, and enough water to make the mixture into a yogurt consistency.
 Cover the countertop with the poultice, cover the poultice with plastic wrap, and let stand for at least a day before wiping off.

 Remove any easily peeled skins briefly before moving on.
 Place the cloves in 1-2 inches of water and let them rest. The water will loosen the skins. Use a metal whisk to beat the garlic and speed up the process.Place the cloves in a covered or watertight container when possible. While the skins will loosen if they are soaked, you can also shake the container to knock the skins off the garlic even faster.
 The skin should be loose and easily removed by hand now. Pinch off the skin by pulling on the clove, and cut the ends off if there is any tricky bits still stuck on the clove.

, While only the Exobasidium vaccinii fungus causes the distinctive fleshy distortion and discoloration, followed by hardening into brown galls, azaleas can become sick with other conditions that affect the leaves.
 Pick them off by hand, or use scissors. Optimally, you should get all the infected parts before they turn white; white indicates spores, which means that the fungus is redistributing itself (possibly infecting healthy plants) for next season.
 Because each part you removed has the fungus on it, leaving it near the plant will just allow it to spread again. If you have space to do it safely, burn the infected bits.
 This will bury any existing spores, which can reinfect the plant.

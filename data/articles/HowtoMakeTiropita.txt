 A pair of forks works well. Beat the eggs.
 Refrigerate this filling mixture for about 30 minutes. The refrigeration step is optional, but it gives you time to prepare everything else.
 You can clarify the butter by skimming off the white solids.

Keep the butter warm in a small crock pot, over a very low flame, or by storing it in a heavy, ceramic pot. You can microwave it for a few seconds now and then to reheat.
 Measure the filo on the short side and decide if you will cut it into two, three, or four strips. It's better to have strips that are too wide than too narrow.
 You can cut a stack of several sheets at once.

Folding the dough back along itself as you go can help to keep the cuts straight and parallel to the edge.
 Roll extra sheets tightly in waxed paper and store them in the refrigerator until you are ready to work with them. Filo that dries out tears much more easily.
, The butter makes the filo bake to a flaky crisp. (In the photo, instead of waxed paper, there's a blue silicone baking sheet, for contrast.)
, You can eyeball the quantity according to the size of the strip.
,, If there is a bit of extra, tuck it in or simply fold it around and stick it to the outside.

This is the same fold used for the United States flag, after it has been folded in half twice.
, If you are making the tiropita before an event, you can stack them between sheets of waxed paper and freeze them until you are ready.
 Frozen tiropita will take a little longer to bake than thawed ones. Serve hot.

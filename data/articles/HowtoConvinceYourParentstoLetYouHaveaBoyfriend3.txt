 Don’t ask to have a boyfriend in advance of finding a guy you really like. You can end up in an argument with your parents, and you will have few details to back you up. Instead, if you have someone in particular, you can think about what you like about them and bring that up. You can also use this as an argument to convince your parents by saying, “I’ve waited until I found someone I really like to approach you about this.”

, Are you actually ready? Or, do you just want a boyfriend to fit in with others your age? Are you willing to set boundaries, even sexual ones, to protect yourself? Are you prepared to handle rejection? Your parents will surely question you, so get ready by thinking through these issues on your own.Ask yourself whether he is a good guy in general or a good guy for you in particular? He may be a great person, but this may be the wrong time due to an age gap, difference in experience levels, etc., Your friends are probably aware of your feelings and they may know your parents too, so it is a good idea to seek out their advice. You might ask them how they think you should approach your parents or how to describe your guy to your parents? You could even invite some of your friends over and let them talk to your parents about the boy, if you are comfortable with that.
 If your parents refuse to budge from their position, then you may need to bring in reinforcements. Meet with your pastor, a family friend, or another relative and tell them about your situation. Ask for their advice. You might say, “What kind of compromises can I suggest that will make my parents happy?”

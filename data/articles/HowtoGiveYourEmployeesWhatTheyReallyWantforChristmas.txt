 Have every employee bake something and bring it in. Offer tea, coffee, soft drinks and juices and some merriment. Switch it to afternoon tea and and early going home before Christmas if you'd prefer. Just don't involve expensive food, alcohol or entertainment.;
, Even $20 per person is better than not having $20 extra at Christmas time.
Give grocery vouchers. Why not help out with each employee's Christmas meal costs?
Give a health care subsidy or gym membership.
Give shares or stock options in your company.
If the employee is deserving, give them a pay raise, in time for returning after Christmas.
 Don't be seen heading out to expensive meals with clients or others associated with your firm. Show your employees your solidarity with the recession-driven environment by eating lean yourself. No doubt your clients will be impressed by your attention to financial savings too.
 Heartfelt, individualized thanks that points to each individual employee's achievements can do more for morale and worker happiness than glitzy parties ever will. Be sure to point out two good things about each employee at your office morning tea, so that the glow of being acknowledged is also recognized by every other employee in the room, in turn. Remember that in a time when people are just glad they have a job, recognition of doing it well is a huge source of reassurance.

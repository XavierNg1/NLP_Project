 Bubbles can be made using any type of liquid soap you have around the house. Some soaps make bubbles that last longer than others, so experiment with different types until you find one you like. Simply mix one part liquid soap and 4 parts water in a jar, cup or bowl. Try these different types of soaps:


Liquid dish soap. This makes a great bubble base, and it's something you probably already have on hand.
Body wash or shampoo. These may not be quite as sudsy as liquid dish soap, but they should still work fine for making bubbles.
All natural laundry detergent. Stay away from commercially-produced detergent, which may not be safe for kids to use. Chemical-free laundry detergent can be found at health food stores.;
, There are a few tricks you can use to make your bubbles stronger and more interesting than typical bubbles. Experiment with these ingredients until you've created a solution your kids will love:


Add a little sugar, corn syrup, or starch to the mixture. This causes the bubbles to be a little thicker, which results in longer-lasting bubbles.
Add some food coloring. You can separate the solution into a few different containers and make different colored bubbles.
Add some fun decorative ingredients. Have your kids find out whether you can make bubbles with glitter, small flower petals, and other tiny ingredients. Which ones make the bubbles pop?

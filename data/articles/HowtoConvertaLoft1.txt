, If a room in your loft is oddly shaped, find out if a designer or contractor can work with you to make it more open and functional. A kitchen, for example, can become easier to navigate if its island is repositioned in a different spot.
 A large industrial loft usually has high ceilings and an open floor plan. Consider adding cabinets or mounting items onto walls and ceilings to store them out of the way of the living area.
 If your large loft has an open floor plan, you can arrange furniture and decorations to help distinguish the purpose of each room. Adding elements such as sliding doors can also create more privacy when you need it.
 Instead of taking out existing flooring or furnishings, try to decorate and/or repurpose the equipment for day-to-day living. If you have original concrete flooring, for example, you can resurface it to add some warmth and style.
 An attraction to living in a large, upper-story industrial loft is the amount of light and beautiful views it can provide. Create a room where natural light would be welcome, such as a home office or dining area, in a spot where such lighting exists.

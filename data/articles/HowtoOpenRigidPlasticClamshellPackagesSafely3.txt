 People do cut themselves frequently, as mentioned in the introduction.
 Do NOT cut across the middle of the package; you could cut through the instructions or a part of the product, and it's the most cumbersome way to go. Start on the right side of the package, cutting up and around the perimeter, if you are right-handed. If you are left handed, start on the left.Be willing to quickly admit it if your favorite scissors or knife aren't sharp enough to allow you to cut smoothly and safely. Your uncut hands will thank you later. Borrow or buy a can opener.

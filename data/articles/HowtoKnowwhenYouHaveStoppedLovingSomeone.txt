 If you no longer have fun or laugh at each other's jokes, this is very telling. Laughter and being part of doing something silly together is usually a great way to have fun when you are in love. If you are no longer experiencing such feelings, it's time to sit down and have a serious talk with yourself. Figure out if this is the kind of relationship still working for––be honest with yourself on this one, as you cannot lie to your own heart and your own feelings, and most of all, you can never lie to yourself.
 Do you fight more often than ever before? When you fight more than having fun these days with each other, it is time to ask yourself the serious question - "Is this really worth it?" Is fighting all the time really what you want out of a relationship than having a good time? No, so why should you keep up with it any longer?, When your lover starts pretending to be something they are not, it is time to think long and very hard if this is the kind of thing you want for the rest of your life. If it seems to you that this person is longer being themselves around you, chances are they might be cheating; it's quite possible that they have someone else in their lives already and they do not feel the need to interact with you in the form of who they once were towards you anymore., Why do you need to be sad all the time when you could be laughing and having fun? If you find yourself in the position where you only cry more than you laugh and the other person makes you feel that way most of the time, it is indeed time to move on. Moving on might not be the easiest thing to do, but in the end it will be better for you, as nothing could be worse than ending up with a broken heart., If you no longer have anything at all to say to one another, it is officially time to move on!

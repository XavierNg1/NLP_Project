 These codes are unique identifiers assigned to mobile phones for identification purposes. To get your G1’s IMEI, enter *#06# on your phone using its on-screen keypad and the IMEI code will be displayed on the screen.
 Open a web browser on your computer and look for sites on the Internet that offers unlock code services.
 These websites will need your phone’s IMEI code, the unit/model of the phone, and the network it’s currently locked on (in this case, T-Mobile). Provide these information together with an active email address.
 Depending on the website you used, you should receive your unlock code in the email address you provided within 12–36 hours. Check your email and take note of the unlock code.
 The SIM tray of the G1 is located at the back. Power off your phone, and slide off the back cover; you should see the SIM tray. Remove the current SIM, if it's still there, and insert the one you want to use.


Don’t forget to place back the back cover.
 Press and hold the Power button at the lower-right side of the phone. The Power button is also the End Call button.
 Instead of the home screen, a message screen will be displayed telling you that your phone needs to be unlocked first before it can use the SIM card you inserted. Simply type in the unlock code you got in your email, press the “OK” button, and your T-Mobile G1 should now be unlocked for use on any network.

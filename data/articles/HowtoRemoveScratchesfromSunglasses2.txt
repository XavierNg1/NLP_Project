 The alkaline properties of baking soda make it ideal for breaking down any acidic residue and restoring the clarity of lenses. When combined, water and baking soda form a thick paste that can be used to remove a scratch while cleaning the glasses. , The amount of water and baking soda you should use depends largely on the size and number of scratches on your sunglasses. Start with a tablespoon of water and two tablespoons of baking soda and add more for heavily scratched sunglasses. , Stir them together until the mixture turns into a thick paste. Make sure the mixture isn’t too watery as it will be less effective in removing the scratches.
 Dip a portion of the cotton ball into the water and baking soda paste. You only need a pea-sized amount of the mixture for each scratch.
 Take the cotton ball and rub it on the scratch in a circular motion for about 10 seconds. This movement will help buff the scratch from the lens.
 Use cool or room temperature water to wash away the paste. Take extra care to remove the paste from the crevice between the lens and the frame, or any other tiny areas where the paste could seep in.
 These types of cloths are crucial to ensure your glasses aren’t further scratched in the cleaning process. Consider picking up a pack of Microfiber eyeglass cloth at your local drugstore or supermarket. Use this to wipe away any remaining traces of paste from the lens.
 Put the sunglasses under a light and carefully look for any remaining damage. Continue to clean the scratch with another cotton ball dipped in the water/baking soda paste if the scratch is still visible on the lens.

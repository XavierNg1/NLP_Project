 To make edible eyeliner, roll out a piece of fondant in the color of your choice. For example, if you want to make a green eyeliner, then roll out a piece of green fondant. If you want a black eyeliner, then roll out a piece of black fondant.








Make sure that the fondant cylinders are about the same diameter and length as an actual eyeliner pencil. You can use an actual eyeliner pencil to help you get the dimensions right.
Cut off the ends of the cylinder so that they are flat.
 Next, make a beige cone that is about the same diameter as the cylinder you just created. Then cut off the tip of the cone and the bottom of the cone so that it has a flat edge on the top and on the bottom.








Attach the cone to the cylinder with a drop of water.
 Next, get a small piece of the same color fondant as you use for the cylinder. Then, shape the piece into a cone. This cone will be the tip of your fondant eyeliner, so make sure that it is nice and pointy.








Attach the tip to the top of the beige cone with a drop of water and set the pencil aside to dry.

 Set the oven to 190 F (88 C). Take a break for a few minutes until the oven gets hot.
 You may use any six chicken pieces that you have, including breasts, thighs, and drumsticks. If you have a whole chicken, separate it into six pieces. Lay these on a baking tray.
 Cut a lemon into six slices. Squeeze a lemon slice over each piece of chicken. Afterwards, place each slice under a chicken piece to add more flavoring.
 You can peel the ginger first by using a spoon or paring knife to get under the skin. Hold the ginger still and scrape off the skin. Dice about two inches (5 cm) of fresh ginger. Add the tiny ginger pieces over and beside the chicken., Obtain two onions. Chop each one into at least three wedges. Set the onion wedges next to the chicken.
 Gather a cup (240 mL) of garlic leaves. Rip them apart by hand and scatter them over and around the chicken.
 Drizzle three tablespoons of olive oil over all the chicken pieces. Follow this by sprinkling a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, a teaspoon of sea salt, and as much black pepper as youâ€™d like.
 Measure out 25 oz (150 mL) of white or pink wine. Add it to the tray and spread it out over the bottom of the tray under the chicken and other ingredients.
 Allow the chicken to begin to cook for about ten minutes. Once the time is up, remove the chicken from the oven., Spread the wine at the bottom of the pan over the chicken with a brush, baster, or spoon. Return the chicken to the oven.
 Turn the heat down to 160 F (71 C). Let the chicken cook. After 15 minutes, the skin should look brown on the ends. If the skin has not browned, you can turn the heat back up to 190 F (88 C) and cook for another three or five minutes. Serve the ingredients together on plates.


Cooked chicken will last in the refrigerator up to four days.

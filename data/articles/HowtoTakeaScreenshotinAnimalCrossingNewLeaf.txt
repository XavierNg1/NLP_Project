 First, you want to start by holding down the L button. This is one of the two required buttons that you will need to be holding down to take a screenshot.


The L button (or left trigger) can be found on the top of the DS (when folded) on the left side. It has an L and a camera icon on it.;
, Continue holding down the L button and now also hold down the R button. These two buttons together are how you take a screenshot.


The R button is located on the other side of the DS and has an R and a camera icon on it.
 Once you are holding down both the L button and the R button, the DS will make a camera noise (much like a beep), and you will see a flash that directly precedes the picture being taken.


All pictures are saved to your DSâ€™s SD card.

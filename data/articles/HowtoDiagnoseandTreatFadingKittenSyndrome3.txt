 The kitten should be separated from the litter, especially if an infection is detected. Kittens rely on huddling with their mother and littermates to keep warm, so you should take efforts to keep a separated kitten warm.Keep the ambient temperature as warm as possible. Keep the kitten wrapped in a blanket or towel. You can use a heating pad to keep its box warm, but be sure to check the pad frequently to make sure it’s not too hot.
 In addition to maintaining a warm temperature, nursery conditions should also be humid. Using a humidifier if necessary, keep the ambient humidity between 55 and 65 percent.Humidity will help prevent fluid loss and dehydration.
 If the kitten cannot nurse, you should bottle feed it every two hours. If it cannot suckle, it’ll require a dextrose solution (a sugar solution), which the vet can administer intravenously.If the kitten is dehydrated, the vet will also have to administer an intravenous fluid line.
 If the vet identified an infection or parasitic infestation, they will likely prescribe an antibiotic or antifungal medication. If the kitten can suckle, a liquid medication can be added to milk. If not, medication will likely have to be injected.

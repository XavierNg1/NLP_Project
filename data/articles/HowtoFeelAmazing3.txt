 When you're feeling a little down, the best thing you can do is to hang out with people who love you.


It could be a group of your best friends, your significant other, your siblings or your parents -- as long as it's someone who knows you well, makes you laugh and can remind you how great you are!

, Spending time with animals (particularly cute baby animals!) can have a calming, relaxing effect on people, lifting their spirits and making them feel happy.


So next time you're in need of an emotional boost, hang out with your dog, cat, bunny, horse, donkey or whatever animal you can get your hands on!
Talk to them stroke, them or just be with them....you'll soon feel amazing.
 Hugs are scientifically proven to make you feel happier, so try to give at least one or day. Although a quick, one-armed hug will do, a nice, tight, ten-second bear hug is even better, if you can manage it!

, If you don't feel like talking to anyone, writing down your thoughts in a journal or diary can be extremely cathartic.


You can burn the pages afterwards if you like -- it's the act of writing something down and getting it off your chest that counts.
 Doing a good deed will make you feel really good about yourself while also making someone else's day a little brighter.


Buy coffee for the person behind you in line, leave an extra chocolate bar in the drawer of the vending machine or donate some money to charity.

 If you're using the mail, you probably don't want to send money to an inmate who is about to be transferred to another facility as it may not follow him or her.


Apart from the postage, mailing a cashier's check or money order typically is a cost-free way to send money to an inmate., Each prison requires the check or money order you send to be filled out in a certain way, and to include certain information to ensure the funds are deposited in the correct account.


For example, if you're sending funds through the mail to an inmate in federal prison, the money order must include the inmate's full committed name and 8-digit corrections number.Federal prisons place a 15-day hold on non-postal money orders or non-government checks.If the prison where the inmate is housed has sub-accounts, you may be able to indicate on the face of the check or money order the account in which you want the funds deposited. For example, if you're sending funds to an inmate housed in a Washington state prison, you can indicate whether you want the funds to be deposited in that inmate's spendable, postage, medical, or education sub-account., You cannot send cash or personal checks to inmates. Prisons also don't accept third party checks such as payroll checks or government benefit checks.Many prisons request that you send funds separately from any other items or letters. If you send a letter with your cashier's check or money order, typically prison staff will throw it away and the inmate will never receive it., Some prisons have a particular form that you must fill out with proof of your own identity, while others simply require information on the memo line of the cashier's check or money order.


For example, a money order sent to an inmate in a North Carolina prison must be accompanied by a JPay deposit slip, which you can download and print at http://www.jpay.com/moneyOrderForms/NC_Money_Order_deposit_EN.pdf.The state of Connecticut has an official remitter form that must accompany any funds available at http://www.ct.gov/doc/lib/doc/PDF/remitter.pdf., The address you use to send money may be different than the address you use to send letters to the inmate.For example, if you want to mail a check or money order to an inmate in North Carolina prisons, you must send your money order to the JPay processing center in Hialeah, Florida.Typically, if you want to send the inmate funds through the mail, you must use the U.S. Postal Service, rather than using a private delivery service such as UPS or FedEx.Typically the outside of your envelope must include a full and correct return address.

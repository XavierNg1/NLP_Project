 Purchase a lint brush from your local drug store. Remove the protective layer and then roll the brush along the desired area of your car. Your petâ€™s hair will stick to the lint brush and can easily be removed from your vehicle.
 Wrap a piece of duct tape or packaging tape around your hand with the sticky side facing outwards. Then pat the area of your car that is covered with hair with your taped hand. The hair will stick to the tape and be easily removed from your car., Check the tape periodically to make sure that it is still collecting hair. Once the piece of tape is completely covered with hair it will lose its adhesiveness. When this happens, throw that piece of tape in the garbage and resume the process with a new piece of tape.

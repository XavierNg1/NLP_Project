 While some tip-ups offer fancy looks and features, you want to look at the materials the tip-up is made of. Although plastics are lighter in weight, they usually do not handle exposure to sunlight and cold weather as well as either wood or metal.


Most tip-ups are designed so that the line spool is underwater when the tip-up is set up. The water protects the spool and line from freezing in the cold air. Some tip-ups, however, use a windlass design that keeps the line spool and most of the tip-up above the water.

, Your tip-up should have a large enough flag on a long enough pole that you can see it from a distance of 100 yards (91.4Â m) (90 m) in most weather conditions. Choose an orange flag over a yellow one, as a yellow flag will appear white as you get further away from it.


Having the rest of the rig be brightly colored as well can be helpful as well to keep you from accidentally stepping on it as you check all your rigs. If your tip-up isn't brightly colored but is made of wood or metal, you can paint it so you can see it better.
 In addition to their cross pieces, line spool, and flag, some tip-ups offer special features to assist ice fishermen in recognizing when a fish is on the line and helping to keep the hole being fished open.

Some tip-ups supplement the flag with an "action indicator" that shows the line movement when a fish has taken the bait and is swimming away with it.






Some tip-ups feature a round cover that fits over the hole being fished to keep it from being exposed to the air and thus freezing over.

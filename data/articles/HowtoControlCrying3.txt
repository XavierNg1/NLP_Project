 Distract yourself away from your oncoming tears by causing a very small amount of physical discomfort to your body. Pinch your arm to redirect your mind from your tears., Try to be gentle so that you donâ€™t draw blood. You can also press your fingernails into the palm of your hand.
 Squeeze your thumb and forefinger on the bridge of your nose, right near your eyes. This will slow down your tear ducts from producing tears., Open up your eyes really wide, which can help dry them out. Looking up while you do this will help any forming tears sink back away from the rims of your eyes.
 Tightening your mouth muscles and focusing on pressing your tongue upwards can help stop you from tearing up.
 Swallowing will help constrict the muscles in your throat. Crying helps open the muscles, so if you can do the opposite, you may be able to restrict the crying response., Taking a drink of water can also achieve the same effect.

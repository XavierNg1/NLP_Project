, Pour the olive oil into the flour and mix it in evenly using your mixing spoon. Gradually add the hot water, a little at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue adding water until a soft dough forms.


Note that the dough should be elastic yet not sticky.
If the dough becomes too thick to mix with a spoon, begin mixing it with your hands.
 Lightly flour a clean kitchen counter or similar working space. Turn the dough onto the floured counter and knead it by hand for 5 minutes or so, just until it becomes smooth.


You may also need to dust your hands with flour to prevent them from sticking to the dough as you knead it.
 Separate the dough into 10 equal pieces and roll each portion into a ball using your hands. Set them aside to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
 Immediately before you are ready to cook the chapati, use a rolling pin dusted in flour to roll each ball of dough into a very thin circle, less than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.


Note that you may need to reapply more flour to your working surface to prevent the dough from sticking as you roll it out.
 Apply a thin coat of olive oil or cooking spray to a large skillet and heat the skillet on the stove for a few minutes on medium heat.


The skillet will be hot enough to cook the chapati once you can see smoke rising from its surface.
 Place one chapati in the hot skillet. Cook it for about 30 seconds, or until the underside has brown spots on it, then quickly flip it over to the other side. Cook the other side for another 30 seconds or so, until it, too, has brown spots on it.


Remove the chapati from the skillet as soon as both sides are done.
Repeat this process with all of the other dough circles.
 Your batch of chapati is now ready to eat and enjoy.

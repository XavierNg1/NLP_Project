 You'll need their permission, help and responsibility for such sales but it can be a good way to get your homemade and unwanted items turned into cash. Some ways to do this include:


Make craft items and list them on Etsy, eBay, etc. You will need to use your parent's account and have them do all the listing and sales but then they can hand the money on to you when done.
Find things you no longer want around the house. Have mom or dad put them on eBay or similar sites to sell. Don't expect too much unless your items are really wanted by people. But do realize that every little bit soon adds up.
You might need to reach a deal with mom and dad on splitting the costs involved. Have a talk with them first.;
, If you are good at making things, consider selling them to neighbors, at indoor markets or to family members.


Try knitting, sewing, crochet, beading, jewelry, blanket making, weaving baskets, etc. Think of things people like to use and wear; check out sites like Pinterest to see what's popular right now, for inspiration.
Make cozy things, like blankets, hats, mittens and warm clothing.
Decorate umbrellas if you live in a rainy winter area.
Make a production line of helpers if you have siblings who also want to make some money.
 Check with mom and dad first that they're okay about paying more for extra chores. Ask them what they'd really like done around the house and get to it! As an added bonus, it'll keep you toasty warm if you're moving around a bit.

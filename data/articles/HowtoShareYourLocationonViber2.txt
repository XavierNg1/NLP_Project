 Look for the Viber app on your smartphone and tap on it to launch.
 From the bottom menu, tap the “Chats” icon. This will display your chats inbox with all your conversations. Select the person you’d like to chat with by tapping on his corresponding name; the chat window will appear.
 If you don’t want to enable location sharing from Method 1, but still will like to share your current location, you can include it in a message.


Tap the plus (+) icon from the left of the “Compose” field. This will bring out a small menu of possible items you can insert with a message on Viber.
 From the menu, tap the “Send Location” button. This will bring out a map, which will automatically pin your current location.
 Use your fingers to navigate through the map. You can also zoom in and out. Set the map to the exact screenshot of what you want to send.


Whatever you set on the map will be sent as it is to your contact.
 Tap the “Send” button at the upper right corner when you’re done. The map with your pinned location will be sent to your contact.br>

 Have students who are struggling to grasp course material do a project that helps build their fundamental knowledge of a topic. The scope of the assignment should not extend beyond the lesson or build on it. Instead, the work should reinforce the basic tenets of a subject and boost a student's confidence in their own understanding.For instance, if a grade school student is struggling with fractions, give them recipes to divide or multiply the quantities for. This assignment will not introduce new material, but it will allow the student to think about fractions in a practical, real-world way.
 Students who have grasped the course material can express their knowledge with more intricate projects and presentations than their other classmates. This will allow them to expand their knowledge of the curriculum into broader themes and contexts. Material can expand beyond the basic outline of what students should learn about a subject.For instance, while other students complete a basic report about the novel “Anna Karenina”, an advanced student can write a report comparing the book to Tolstoy’s first work, “War and Peace”.
 Tiered assignments can hurt student morale if the materials, expectations, and objectives are too disparate. Offset this by telling students that you're aiming to have a variety of unique projects for students to share with each other. Be sure to outline assignments that are equally interesting, and convey equal levels of enthusiasm and excitement about them.

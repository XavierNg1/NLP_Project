 Any cola or soda that includes phosphoric acid in the ingredients can be used to remove rust. Other options include lime juice or vinegar. These mild acids can remove rust without significant risk to the surrounding metal.


Diet cola does not have sugar in it, so the process will be less sticky. However, the sugar does help the acid to adhere to the rust.
Avoid strong or concentrated acids, which can etch and weaken the underlying metal. If these household acids are ineffective, try again with phosphoric acid, but keep a fan on to blow corrosive fumes away from your face.
 Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome it is best to make sure all the dirt and other debris are removed. This helps you to see and access the rust more easily for removal. Use car wash soap to clean painted surfaces on cars, and regular soapy water for other chrome objects.
 Ideally, soak the object for 15 minutes before removing. If you cannot soak the object, then simply pour the mild acid over the surface.
 You may need to use a rough sponge or gentle dish scrubber to remove the dissolved rust. Scrubbers designed for use on glass cookware tend to have the lowest risk of scratching your chrome. To remove heavy rust, rub gently with strips of aluminum foil or scrub with scouring pads.
 If you are cleaning a car, use car wash soap to remove the rust and acid residue. Dish soap should not be used on painted car surfaces, since it may strip the paint. Unpainted surfaces can be cleaned using any ordinary soap and water.
 Remove moisture with paper towels to minimize further rust. If the rust has caused noticeable damage, refer to the section on follow up care.


Apply a coat of polish or wax on the chrome to prevent rust from forming in the future.

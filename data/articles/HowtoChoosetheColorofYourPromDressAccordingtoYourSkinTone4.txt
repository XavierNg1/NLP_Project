 If you're still at a loss for which colors will be most flattering for you, think back to the items in your wardrobe that have earned you the most compliments. Do people comment on how flattering a certain shirt or jacket is on you? Or do you get rave reviews every time you wear a particular scarf or accessory?


Look for common color trends among your favorite pieces – if all your compliment-worthy articles are red, it's safe to assume that this color will be a good pick for your prom dress.
 Now that you have determined your skin’s tone and undertone and have discovered which colors look best on you it is a good idea to try on a variety of these colors to see which one you like the most. Typically one dress and color will stand out among the rest and really make you pop. You will only be able to find this look by trying on lots of dresses!


Avoid having your mind set on one color. It is a good idea to try on a variety of colors. You never know what you will find.
 It is always a good idea to bring someone with you when you are shopping for your prom dress. They can provide their opinion and let you know which dress and color looks best on you. Asking a sales associate their opinion is another great idea. They are very familiar with the products in the store and can help with narrowing down your selections.

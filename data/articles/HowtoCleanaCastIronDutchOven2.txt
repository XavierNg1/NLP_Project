 Expect wet cast iron to start to rust pretty quickly. If you used any water to wash it out, wipe it dry immediately. To really ensure that all moisture has been removed, heat it in the oven or on the stovetop until all traces of water have evaporated.This is only necessary for water, not cooking oil. Cooking oil will actually act as a barrier to water.
 Give your Dutch oven a quick reseasoning. Wipe it down with a light application of more cooking oil. Then wipe up any excess with fresh paper towels. Set the Dutch oven on a burner, set the heat to high, and let it heat up until it starts to smoke a little bit.It should only take a couple minutes to start smoking at high heat.
 Always store your Dutch oven and its lid separately. Allow air to circulate inside it when itâ€™s not in use. For double protection, stuff a few sheets of paper towels inside so they absorb any moisture that might accumulate during humid weather.

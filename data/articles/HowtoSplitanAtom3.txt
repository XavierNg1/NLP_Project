 Place your radioactive material in a gold casing. Use a copper holder to fasten the casing into place. Keep in mind that both the fissile and the metals will become radioactive once fission takes place., With the development of petawatt (1015 watt) lasers, it is now possible to split atoms by using laser light to excite electrons in metals encasing a radioactive substance. Similarly, you could use a 50 terawatt (5 x 1012 watt) laser to excite the electrons in the metal., When the electrons return to their regular orbits, they release high-energy gamma radiation that penetrates the gold and copper nuclei. This will liberate neutrons from those nuclei. Those neutrons will then collide with the uranium underneath the gold splitting the uranium atoms.

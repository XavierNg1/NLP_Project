 Starting with the hair is key to keep the water retained in it from dripping as you dry the rest of your body. If you have long hair, wring it out a couple of times before moving on. Itâ€™s no secret that heat and friction cause damage to our hair. Allowing it to air dry will lead to healthier locks.
 Beginning at the top of your body and working you way down, use your hands to gently whisk away the water from your skin. Do the best you can to get every last droplet. If you have a lot of body hair, it is helpful to swipe the opposite direction of the hair growth the release the water from the hair.
 You can do this with an actual fan, a towel, or a hair dryer. This could take a few minutes if you are doing it by hand.To speed things up, try to release the moisture from the room by opening the door or turning on the bathroom fan. Hair dryers and fans are especially helpful for the hard to reach areas and areas with dense amounts of body hair, like armpits and groins.
 Be sure to step on a bath mat. If your feet are still a little damp, you run the risk of slipping on the bathroom floor and injuring yourself.
 Doing this right after you shower is the key to maintaining the moisture which your skin has absorbed, and is a prime solution to dry skin.

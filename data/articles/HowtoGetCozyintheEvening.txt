 You don't want to be moving around all evening. A comfy chair, couch or your bed are great places to settle in.
 Gather up your favorite things, such as your tablet, smartphone, laptop, e-reader, book, whatever you normally use while relaxing. Have everything at hands reach., If your cozy corner is facing a TV, make sure to have the remote handy. You don't want to be searching for it at the last minute., Even during the summer, it feels great to crank up the AC and get under the covers., For a really relaxing evening, make decaf coffee, tea, or hot cocoa. Add whipped cream, or even a cherry, to jazz up your drink. Pour your drink into your favorite mug, and put it next to your bed/couch!

You can also have a glass of wine, or maybe a beer. Alcohol can help you wind down, but take it easy! You don't want to be hungover the next day, especially if you have to work.
 Don't rely just on the light of your TV/phone. Without another gentle light, it can be bad for you eyes.

It is a fact that looking at bright screens at night messes up with your sleep patterns. Dim the screens of your electronic devices.
 A relaxation playlist on a music app could set the mood. Lay down, and enjoy your comfy evening.

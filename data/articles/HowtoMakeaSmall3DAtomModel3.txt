 You will need 6 wooden craft sticks, strong craft glue, 10 medium-sized Styrofoam blue craft balls, 10 medium-sized Styrofoam red craft balls, and 10 small yellow Styrofoam craft balls., Using the strong craft glue, glue both different colored medium-sized balls (the protons and neutrons) together to resemble a nucleus, alternating between the protons and neutrons as you glue., Leave two of the sticks to stand on the ground so the model can stand itself., On each craft stick, poke the small yellow balls to resemble electrons., You can now show off and display your 3D model of the atom neon.

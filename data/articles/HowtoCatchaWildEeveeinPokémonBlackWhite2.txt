 It is the big city that you can reach by boat from Virbank City. This is the only place you can catch Eevee in the game.;
, Eevee has a low catch rate.
, Bear in mind, if you haven't been here before, Iris will be there and so will Hugh, your rival. So be sure to come here again after that point in the story.
 You should see some stairs, go up them.
 The guy there says that it was the beginning for Castelia City.
 Eevee has only a 5% chance of appearing in the grass.The other Pok√©mon that can be found there are: Audino (shaking grass), Lilligant (White 2), Buneary (Black 2), Cottonee (Black 2), Whimsicott (Black 2), Delcatty (White 2), Lopunny (Black 2), Petilil (White 2), Pidove, Rattata and Skitty (White 2).
 It may take a while but you will eventually find one. Only then will you be able to catch it. You can only find it at level 19.
 Use a Poke Ball on it. You're unlikely to catch it first time, so be patient. An Ultra Ball gives a higher catch rate than an ordinary Poke Ball.

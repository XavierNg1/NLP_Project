 Set the saucepan on your stove over medium heat. Add the butter and allow it to completely melt.
 Toss the minced garlic and whole peppercorns into the melted butter. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.


Use the back of your mixing spoon to gently crush one-third to one-half of the peppercorns while heating them up. Doing so releases more flavor.
 Pour the Merlot, balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce into the saucepan. Stir to combine.
 Allow the contents of the saucepan to reach a steady simmer, then keep the sauce at a simmer for a full 10 to 15 minutes, or until it thickens to your preferred consistency.


Periodically stir the sauce as it continues to simmer. Doing so will distribute the flavors more evenly while preventing the bottom from burning.
 Allow the sauce to cool at room temperature. After it cools, use it for your steak or store it in your refrigerator.


To store the sauce, pour it into a sealed plastic or glass container and refrigerate it for one to two weeks.
Use the sauce at room temperature. Transfer the amount you plan to use out of the main jar, then allow it to sit out on your kitchen counter for about 30 minutes before serving.

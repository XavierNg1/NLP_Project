Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to tour the racing world to find races or other drivers.
 Alternatively, you can click the “Achievements” button (the one that resembles a “D”) at the top of the NFSW window.
 On the Achievements screen, click the drop-down list at the top right, and select “COMPLETED.”This will display a log of all achievements you have completed in the game to that point.
 To show off an Achievement, drag its badge from the log to an open slot at the top right-hand corner of the screen. The Achievement will now be visible on your driver profile throughout NFS World.

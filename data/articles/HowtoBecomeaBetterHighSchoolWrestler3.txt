 Following a balanced diet will help to ensure that you are in your best condition when it is time to compete. Your coach may provide you with specific diet recommendations based on your need to lose or gain weight.


Make sure that your diet includes a good balance of lean protein, fruits, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, and low-fat dairy products.
Make sure that you talk to your doctor before making any drastic changes to your diet.
 Staying hydrated is important for all athletes, but sometimes wrestlers will try to restrict their fluid intake to lose weight. However, this is not an effective way to lose weight. Make sure that you are staying hydrated by drinking at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day.


Remember to replenish the fluids that you lose during training sessions by drinking water while you are training as well.
 After a long training session, your body will need rest in order to repair and restore itself. Make sure that you are getting at least eight hours of sleep every night. If you have trouble sleeping at night, try:


Cutting back on caffeine and avoiding altogether late in the day
Establishing a bedtime routine, such as taking a shower, putting on pajamas, and reading a book
Turn off screens such as televisions, computers, tablets, and cell phones

, As an athlete, you have to take excellent care of your body. Otherwise, it will not perform at the highest possible level. Therefore make sure that you avoid things that might be harmful to your body, such as:


cigarettes and other tobacco products
alcohol and drugs
unhealthy foods such as fried, greasy, sugary, and fatty foods

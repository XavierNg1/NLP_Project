 Wash your hands often. Try to always do it before you eat, before you cook, after using the restroom, after touching bins, after going on public transport. It is very important to wash your hands after touching things that you know others have touched. Here are some examples: Rides at amusement parks, handrails, a principle's hand at graduation maybe? A big one is the phone, and also the flusher on the toilet. And did you know that toilets spread germs up to 15 feet?;
, Ask your doctor about all precautions you can take.
 When you get toilet paper, tear one piece off and throw it away, then take however many sheets you need. If you don't understand, think about how you tear toilet paper. You hold the one just above the pieces right?

, Your nose has small hairs that filter out germs. If you breathe through your mouth, you are breathing in unfiltered air that has germs.
, When people sneeze, their germs may be spread anywhere from 4 to 8 feet (1.2 to 2.4Â m), and these germs can stay on your clothes. So wash your clothes after being around people who are sneezing.

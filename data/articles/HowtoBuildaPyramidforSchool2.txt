 Making a clay pyramid allows you to get creative by making realistic indents and grooves in the pyramid walls to resemble an ancient Egyptian pyramid. You'll need the following supplies for this method:


A large ball of modeling clay (air dry)
Rolling pin
Knife
A piece of cardboard
A ruler
A pencil
Scissors
Paint and paintbrush

, Use the ruler and pencil to draw a square on your piece of cardboard. A 6-inch by 6-inch (15.2 by 15.2 cm) base is fine for a smaller pyramid, or you could make a larger base if you have plenty of clay. Cut out the square when you're finished.
 Place the clay on a dry, clean surface and use the rolling pin to roll it out to 1/2 - 3/4 inch (1.3 - 1.9 cm).
 Use your ruler and pencil to mark out four equilateral triangles with bases the same size as one side of the square. If you have a 6-inch (15.2) square, each triangle should have a 6-inch (15.2 cm) base., Use a knife to cut out the triangle shapes you marked.
 Press your ruler against the sides of the triangles to slant them slightly downward. This will make it easier to press them together so the pyramid won't fall apart.
 Position two triangles so that their edges line up with the edges of the cardboard square. Press the sides of the triangle together. Place a third triangle along another side of the square and press it against the adjacent triangle. Add the last triangle and press it together with the triangles on either side.
 Use the knife to make markings that look like stone shapes in the sides of the pyramid.
 Leave it alone for several hours or overnight to give the pyramid time to dry and harden.
 Pour the paint into a dish and use the paintbrush to spread an even coating on the pyramid. Use brown or sand-colored paint for best effect. You could also use a coating of glue sprinkled with sand if you'd prefer.

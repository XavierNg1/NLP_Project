 Pin the Tail on the Donkey is adaptable to fit the theme of virtually any birthday party or social gathering.


Search online to find examples of different pinning games, or create your own.
Play “Pin the Horn on the Unicorn” or “Pin the Eye on the Muno” (a monster character). Do not feel restricted to using the generic donkey., Note the importance of “hitting the mark," of precision, and of trial and error in daily living.


If a child is struggling to make accurate placement, encourage him or her. You might say, "It can be difficult to get it right every time, but that is what practice is for. You keep getting better and better." Or, "It is just like in life: you practice to be good at this game, and I practice to be good at my job. We want to "hit that mark" so that we can be successful." , Ask the children how they might work together to help make better placements.


If every player missed the mark you might suggest trying again but working together. Ask if it might be helpful to say "no" or "cold" when the pinner is off the mark, and "warm" when the pinner is close to the mark.

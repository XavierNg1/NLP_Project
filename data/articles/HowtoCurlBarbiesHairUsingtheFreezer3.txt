 Lightly brush or comb through your Barbie’s hair if you want a fuller, frizzier hairdo. Use fingers first, then a hairbrush if needed or desired, to separate the curls and create volume.


Note that this method may straighten out curls more than desired, or turn tight curls into more relaxed waves or crinkles.
Go slowly and start with a small section of hair to make sure you like the effect of the curls brushed out before you do the whole head of hair.
 Use just your fingers to adjust curls as they are when you first take out your braids or curlers. You can separate the curls gently for a fuller and more relaxed look, or leave them alone completely to keep tight, defined curls.


To keep tight, smooth curls, touch them as little as possible after you take the braids or curlers out very gently. Don’t run your fingers, a brush, or anything else through the curls and they will stay in place for quite awhile.
To create a little more volume and natural-looking curls, separate the curls just slightly by adjusting the hair with your fingers to pull apart the curls a little. Take it slow so you can make sure you like the look before you do the whole head of hair.
 When you’re ready to give your Barbie a new hairdo, undo the curls simply by rewetting the hair. Brush out the wet hair and let it dry again to return it back to its original straight style.


Avoid using any human hair products like hairspray to keep the curls in place on Barbie hair, as these will only gunk it up over time and make it much harder to create hairstyles in the future.
If your Barbie’s hair is tangled and difficult to return back to normal, try retreating it with a fabric softener and water mixture. Or you can dip it in warm or hot water again to help get it smooth.

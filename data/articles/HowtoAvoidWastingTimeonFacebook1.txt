, Playing games, decorating your profile picture two or three times a day, and rating your friends will suck up your time before you know it. By avoiding the use of games and other apps, you will use your Facebook time more effectively., To further reduce the temptation of Facebook games, you can block game requests from your friends. When you receive a request, simply click the “x” to the right of your notification box, to turn off notifications from that game. You will no longer receive any requests or notifications for the game in question., You're about to log out of Facebook, then a good pal of yours sends you an IM. You'll stay on to chat for a while, and before you know it, there goes another hour. To avoid this, click on the “Chat” button in the bottom right corner and choose "Go Offline."You may also want to either delete the Facebook Messenger app, or simply mute Messenger notifications.
 On your "confirm requests" page, you don't have to click "ignore" on every request individually. Scan the page, see if there's anything of value (e.g. any old friends you're happy to hear from) and approve them. Then click "Ignore all" near the top right, and you’re done.

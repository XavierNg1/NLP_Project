 Pyramid studs or bullet belts are considered very alternative. Plaited, over-sized or metallic belts look good with preppy style. Remember, an overly elaborate belt may be frowned upon by authority figures to the extent that they force you to replace it.
 Black with thick-rims are very alternative. Rockabilly chicks look super in leopard-print. If you are more preppy, go for black/silver/gold half-rimless.
 You could mix up your earrings and wear mismatching ones too. Get several pairs so you can change them every few days. A couple of pretty bangles look nice and accentuate nice hands and arms. Get a (or several) signature necklace(s). Do keep in mind that many schools don't allow necklaces or bracelets.
 It's possible to wear them quite short or quite long, it all depends. Furthermore, a new tie will be a lot wider, whereas a second-hand tie will be a lot thinner and flatter through use. Experiment to find the look that best suits you. There are different knots one can use as well that give them slightly different looks. Long ties with thin knots are cool, as are short ones with fat knots.
 Choose wallets, handbags, backpacks, etc. that express your individuality. Also, you might want to try decorating pencil cases, wallets and purses with stitching. Badge pins are seen as a bit childish.

 This will make the battle much easier. The best powers to have are:


Freeze
Spark
Sword;
, You will spawn on a platform above Whispy. Walk off it and fall down into the fighting area.
 These can hurt you, so watch out.


An easy way to avoid them is to stand up against Whispy's trunk.
 Stand up against him and use it.


If you brought Spark or Freeze, you're safe from the falling apples.
If you brought Sword, you'll have to make sure the apples don't bounce into you.
 Suck them up and spit them out at Whispy to defeat him.

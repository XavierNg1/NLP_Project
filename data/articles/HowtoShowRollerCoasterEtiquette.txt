 If you think you might get sick on the ride, then sit more towards the back, unless this is a backwards roller coaster. If it is a backwards coaster, then sit closer to the front. If you rarely get sick on coasters, then sit in the middle, just in case. If you never get sick on roller coasters, sit in front and enjoy!;
, No one wants your vomit spewed all over them. Lots of raw edge coasters give bags, or have them available for the taking. Take or have one; even if you don't need it, you can give it to someone else on the coaster. It's good to be nice on a roller coaster.
 No one wants to be half deaf when they get off the roller coaster. Roller coasters are supposed to be a thrill, so keep your voice down, but also try to have fun at the same time.
 The passengers around you will probably be close to you and don't want to smell body odor, especially if you plan on holding your arms up at parts in the ride. Apply just enough so that you don't smell too bad, but it won't cover up the entire ride.
 Many people have gotten struck by people riding with their hands up. We all know that it's fun, but be careful! Keep your arms either 90 degrees or slightly bent, and keep them stiff!

, Don't stand up, don't shake the car, don't bring a camera if not allowed, etc. Depending on the point in the ride, and the amusement park, if you are found to be breaking a rule by a ride operator running the ride, they may stop the ride and either ask you to get off, or keep it stopped until you stop doing what you're doing.
 While it does happen, people don't want to choke on a flying lipstick or get up close and personal with your iPhone. Also, for everyone's health, don't spit on a turn, as it will hit someone. It may seem like a cool thing to do, but it's annoying.
 No one wants to be riding next to a screaming and crying person.
 Follow these rules and enjoy your ride! People will be thanking you later if you follow these rules!

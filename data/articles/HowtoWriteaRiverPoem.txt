 Is it calm, still, or rushing and spraying its foam everywhere? Does it have a waterfall at any point? Are there rocks, weeds, flowers? Is the bank muddy? Is the water muddy? Is it cold to touch? It is vital to ask yourself each of these questions.;
, As cold as ice, like the brownest of mud pools.
 Every ideal poem should have at least one metaphor and one simile. It was a raging army of water and foam...for this it is a good idea to look at a river yourself. What does the water remind you of? Does it seem to have a mood of its own?

, Is each verse going to be four lines, or two, or...?

, You can add any more metaphors and similes.
 You can rhyme every other line, or all lines or any other way you see fit. Begin with one verse, and that only.
, Key words for you: fast, water, rushing, foam, tide, river, bank, mud, weed, slope, ripple. Feel free to take any of those.
 You want to make it unique but something that tells the reader what it is about. Here is a technique I use to help find a title. If there is an action in your poem, such as circling the river, allowing the mud to ooze onto your feet...you can use the verb in your title. The subject is obviously the river, but did you use another word more? Instead of Pacing the River, it could be Circling the River Water or something similar. So the noun you use most frequently, any verb you may have. Now if you have a particular adjective in your poem you would like to use (for instance, if you described the water as grimy, foamy ect) you can add that instead of a verb. So you could have something like The Grimy River's Water. Try not to include verb, noun AND adjective since then it will be very long-winded.

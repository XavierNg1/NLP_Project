 If you want to get really fancy, you can print a template paper from a computer. This looks neat because you can give the paper a light design/picture and you can still write over it. Microsoft Word should have plenty of cool templates, ones with lines to write on as well.;
, This could mean starting the letter with the person's name instead of "Dear", or simply using more conversational language. This is not a professional letter.
 "Thanks a lot for the birthday money", "Your generosity is greatly appreciated", or "I just wanted to thank you very much for the money that you left/gave me" should do the trick.
 A relative usually would like to know what the money will be used for and hopes that it is used for a good cause. Something like "I have been saving up for a new car, and this helps out a lot", "John and I have been having trouble making rent lately, this is going to help us out a lot", or "Now I have something to start my savings account with".
 No matter how many times you may have mentioned this before, it does not hurt to say it again. Just a nice "Thank You!", "Thanks Again!", "Thank you so much!", or just wrap up the whole note with "Thanks, (your name)".
 If you haven't talked to the person in a long time, you might want to give a brief update on what you are up to.

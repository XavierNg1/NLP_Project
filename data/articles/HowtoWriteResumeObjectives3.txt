 If you're going through a career change, the experience on your resume may not match up with the job you're applying to. In this case, a resume objective can give an explanation on how your experiences and skills can transfer to your new position, as well as the positive traits that you can bring to their company.You can start your resume objective with something like, "Seeking to leverage my decade of experience in customer service to become an effective account executive."

, If you have little to no experience, a resume objective can help explain how your skills or experiences in school or with extracurricular activities can translate to the job position you are applying to. Concentrate on talking about your positive traits, and how it would help you in your new role.An example would be "A third year engineering student with proven organization and critical thinking skills. Seeking an opportunity to leverage my talents as a research assistant with your organization. I have the dedication and eye for detail that will help me aid the company in their objectives."

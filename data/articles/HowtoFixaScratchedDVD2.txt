 Decide whether your DVD can be fixed, or whether it has irreparable damage. (For more on this, see above.)

, Use a soft cloth and some very clean water. You can also use alcohol, but many cleaning solvents can damage the discs.
 A cloth specialized for eyeglasses would also do., Then, gently wipe the disk from the center to the edges, across the radius, using the jewelry cloth. Continue wiping around the disk, from inside to outside, until the entire disk has been cleaned.
 Try to play it, to evaluate if cleaning the disk solved the problem. If it is not repaired, more extreme measures are required.
 Cover the whole surface, but don't rub it on too thick. The hope is that the vaseline will get into the scratches and minimize their reflectivity.
 Use a method similar to what you did when cleaning the disc. It may be useful to use alcohol (even if you didn't when initially cleaning the disc) to help break up the vaseline. Make sure there are no smudges or evident residue left behind.

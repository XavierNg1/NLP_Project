Lowered and hardened suspension (sport springs, sports shocks) never cut springs!
Rear camber set to full positive
Front camber set to full negative
Brake bias set to neutral (front and rear axle brake at the same time with the same force). In passenger cars and light cargo vans the brake bias is set to front with the purpose of avoiding a drift during in-turn braking
Handbrake actuator cable with no slack
High engine power (over 100 hp). Gasoline engine (diesels are slow and clumsy)
No ECU (Electronic Control Unit,). The absence of an ECU excludes such control aids as the ESP or traction control. You cannot drift a car with any of them
Rear wheel drive
Manual transmission
LSD (Limited Slip Differential) or any other automatically locking differential
No ABS
Power steering (for beginners; pros use direct steering for better control and feedback)
Worn out narrow tires in the back and wide new tires in front
Disc brakes on the rear wheels (drum brakes tend to slip and overheat more easily)
Long wheelbase. With LWB cars you get better control during the drift/spin

 Sign in using your Google account. This app will let you listen to any music you purchase through the Google Play Store and any music that you add to your library with the Music Manager program on PC.
 Start by signing up for a Play account through Google. If you already have a Google account, it uses the same account. Install and run the Music Manager program.

The manager will ask for locations of your music. If you have iTunes music that you would like to add to your Android phone, select the first option when prompted. If you keep your music in other folders, navigate to them when the program asks.
The music manager will begin uploading your songs to your Google account. You are allowed to upload 20,000 songs for free. Once they are uploaded, you can use the Google Music app on your phone to listen to them, or play them through the browser using the Music Manager program on your computer.
You can set music to be available for offline listening by selecting the option through the Google Music app, or by downloading your music again through the Music Manager program on your computer.

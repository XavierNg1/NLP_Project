 You can get a bag of seeds that have already been removed from their shells, but it's more fun to eat the seeds you have to do a little work to extract. Choose from a variety of flavors, like chipotle, pickle or barbecue.;
, Start with just one, so you can get the hang of the technique.
 It's easier to crack the seed in the side of your mouth than the front.
 Use your tongue to get it in place. Position it either vertically or horizontally, depending on your preference. Either way, the outside edge of the shell should be making contact with your teeth.


Use your molars (chewing teeth) to crack the shell. They have an indention in the middle to hold the seed.
It's more difficult to use your two front teeth; you risk the seek slipping and scraping your gums.
 The hull should give easily after a moment of intense pressure. Don't bite so hard you crush it, though.
 Let it fall onto your tongue.
 Use your tongue and your teeth to pull them apart.The texture is the key to this step. The inner, edible seed, will be smooth, while the shell will be rough.
 After practice, the shell will usually break open like a clam, therefore making this step less messy.

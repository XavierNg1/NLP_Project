 For quick and relatively easy verification, a 10x magnifier can be used to verify the microprint on most current IDs or licenses. The microprint that appears to the naked eye as a solid line will appear as text under a magnifier., Most states’ current driver’s licenses make use of special print or images that only appear under ultra-violet light., For a relatively low cost, compared to the cost of getting caught serving alcohol to minors, for example, it is possible to purchase a scanner that will read a variety of IDs or licenses and verify validity.These are often hand-held devices that can be used at the point of admission to verify authenticity.
 There are even some available smart phone apps that will scan bar codes on IDs to verify authenticity.Many of these are free and will turn an iPhone or iPad into a useful scanner.

 This is the requirement to buy Store Permits and Hired Merchants. If you're new to MapleStory, head over to Henesys to train on Blue Mushrooms. You'll earn money from training there because the mushrooms drop Bento Boxes, which can be sold to an NPC for 1k.;
, You can go to the Cash Shop and buy one. If you don't have NX, do some surveys and offers on the Nexon website or sell items on MTS until you have at least 1,800 NX.


Hired Merchants are useful if you are going to get grounded, you have an unstable Internet that is weak, you're going on a holiday, or you don't have access to MapleStory often.You can get it for around 1,000 NX per day and you can buy more than 1 at a time.
Regular Store permits are perfect for new merchants and players with a stable Internet. The permits cost 1,800 NX for 3 months (20 NX per day, have 16 slots). Holiday Store Permits are 3,600 NX for 3 months and they have 24 item slots.

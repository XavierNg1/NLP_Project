 Get out all your clothes and decide which ones you want and don't want. Donate, sell, and a top tip you could host your own boot sale, with anything that you haven't worn in a year, doesn't fit or isn't your style.


If you haven't worn it in a year, you won't miss it. Thinking, "I could need this one day!" will leave you thinking you have nothing to wear for most. Clean it out. Someone else could second-love your things.
If you have loads of items that don't fit anymore, don't keep them all to be hopeful. Keep a few of your favorites, but pitch the rest. A closet full of clothes that don't fit can be very de-motivating.;
, And dress for it. The most fashionable items in the world right now won't look good on you if you don't have the right body type for it. It does not mean you're too fat, too thin, too tall, or too short. You just don't have the optimal shape for that cut.

Dispose of everything that doesn't fit you right. And you'll know. If your silhouette isn't quite what it could be, odds are you don't wear it.
When you go shopping, keep your body type in mind. For most women, it's ideal to draw in at the waist and elongate the leg. If you get stuck, you can always ask a sales professional; it's their job to help you look good.
 Try to look at yourself as objectively as possible. Pick things about your physical appearance that you like and dislike. What do you want to disguise? What do you want to emphasize? What's your coloring?


It's important to figure out the answers to these questions before you go shopping so you know what to buy! If you haven't a clue, shopping for a new wardrobe can be very intimidating.

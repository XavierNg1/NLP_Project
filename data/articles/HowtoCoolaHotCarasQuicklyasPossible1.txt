 Roll down the passenger-side window. Then, stand outside your car and open the driver-side door using the door handle. With the window down, you’ll be ready to create a low-pressure area that sucks hot air out and cool air in., Rapidly push the door toward the car, stopping just short of actually closing it. Repeat six to eight times, then get in your car., Since air conditioning requires air to move over the condenser, running the air conditioning while idling will not cool your car very quickly. Driving around a bit will prepare you to cool your car as quickly as possible., Set the temperature to the coldest setting. Then, turn the air conditioning on to its highest setting. Use the fresh air setting (as opposed to the air recirculation setting).When you first turn the air conditioner on in a hot car, you’ll probably get a blast of hot air. After a few minutes, the temperature will begin to cool.
 Keep the windows down for a minute or two to blast out the initial hot air from the air conditioner and to get the air circulating. Once the air conditioner has cooled the car to a comfortable point, roll the windows up and keep them up.

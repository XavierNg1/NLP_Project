 Having regular conversations can help you stay clued in to what’s going on in your teen’s life. Make a habit of asking your teen how their day went or what they’re working on at school.Be sure to share about your own life too, as long as it is age-appropriate. This can help to build trust between you.


If your teen is used to talking with you, they’ll be more likely to tell you when they’re having a hard time.
Scheduling regular family activities, like exercising or cooking meals together, can provide a good time to talk with your teen about what’s going on in their life.
 Your teen will be more likely to share their thoughts and feelings with you if they feel like you’re actually interested in what they have to say. Pay attention when your child talks to you and avoid interrupting them. Focus on understanding them instead of judging what they say., Finding social support is one of the best ways to battle stress. Tell your teen that feeling stressed now and then is normal, and emphasize that they can come to you for support if they need it. Be on the lookout for ways your teen may be expressing stress already. Do they frequently say things like “I’m never going to get all this done” or “I can’t keep up with everything”? Phrases like these are usually giveaways of stress.
Leading by example is also a good strategy. Try saying out loud when you feel stressed and say what you are going to do about it.

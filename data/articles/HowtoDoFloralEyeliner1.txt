 Start at the center of your lash line. Using your first color, draw an X-shape at the center of your lash line by drawing on two lines. The ends of each line should touch your lash line. Then, add a line going straight down through the X. From there, add additional lines shooting from the center of your X until you have a flower that is as bushy and full as you want.Do not worry if this does not look flower-like yet. The flower shape will become clearer when you add the buds.
The color you choose is up to you, but go for something bright and floral like a vibrant pink or yellow.;
, Right next to your first flower, add another flower. Use the exact same process. Draw an X, then draw a horizontal line through it, and fill out the flower from there., Fill out either side of your lash line with flowers. Alternate between colors. Continue to create flowers by starting with an X and filling out the colors from there. Keep going until your entire upper lash line is covered in flowers., Take a yellow eyeliner. Place a dot in the center of each flower. This will make it clear the shapes are flowers as they will have a defined bud.It can help to use glitter yellow eyeliner. This will pop quite a bit, catching people's attention.

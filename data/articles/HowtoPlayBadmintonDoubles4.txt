 You can force your opponent to do a high lift by smashing the shuttle. The back player, i.e., the defensive player, usually carries out the smash. A smash shot travels downward toward your opponent’s court.Carry out a smash by adopting a forehand grip, i.e., the handshake grip. Raise both arms, and cock back you racket arm. Once the shuttle is at its highest point, swing the racket over your head, and hit the shuttle. Make sure to follow through with the swing. You also want to make sure you have good balance to get the most out of your swing., Front players usually employ net kills. To do a net kill correctly, you will need to change the position of your hand. You will also need to do a short swing as opposed to a larger swing.Place your thumb behind the badminton handle. Only the pad of your thumb should be touching the handle. Make sure your racket is up before the shuttle arrives so you can make a short swing. If not, you will most likely make a larger swing than necessary and accidentally hit the net (called a fault), or hit the shuttle into the net on your side. Before hitting the shuttle, make sure your racket is on top of the shuttle, and you have a tight grip. Then, hit the shuttle downwards., Talk with each other. The name doubles implies partnership. You should maintain an open line of communication with your partner. Try to be aware of where your partner is in the court at all times. This prevents you from having to look back, and getting hit by the shuttle. Good communication will also prevent both of you from rushing toward the shuttle at the same time.


For example, you can tell your partner what you plan to do before you start a rally. Tell them, “Hey, cover me, I think I am going to go for a smash on the next rally.”
If your in the back of the court you can tell your partner, “I’m covering the back left side, cover the front right side.”

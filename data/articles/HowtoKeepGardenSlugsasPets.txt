 For a habitat, you can use multiple things, such as a critter-keeper, a photo storage box, a old container, a mason jar, a old aquarium with a lid, and even clear plastic boxes from the dollar store. However, if you do use a plastic box or container, always remember to drill or poke holes in the lid, so your slug can breath. Don't make the holes too big or your slug can, and probably will, escape. 


Make sure to have a smaller back-up habitat if one of your slugs gets sick or to transfer the slug to when you clean the habitat.;
, For the base of the habitat, add a layer of soil or dirt. It can come from a pet store or even from your backyard. Most snails owners usually layer the tank bottom. 


For example, add a layer of garden pebbles or fish rocks to the bottom of the tank. On top of that, add soil or dirt, then add a thin layer of grass or leaves. 
Always remember to add hide-out places, for when your slug gets scared!

, From daily, weekly, to monthly, slugs almost always need their habitats cleaned. Most pet owners also keep their slug's habitat outside because slugs can get loose very easily.


Hourly/daily: Every hour (or two times a day minimum) use a spritzing bottle to spray down your slugs' habitat. This will keep the moisture your slug needs in the habitat.
Weekly: Carefully clean your slug's habitat every two weeks. Place your snail(s) in your back-up habitat and add fresh soil or dirt, leaves, grass, and food.
Monthly: Most pet owners let their slugs loose after about a month. This is not considered a major deal. 

, Most pet owners typically feed their garden slugs fresh fruit and vegetables. Mostly any will do fine. However, if you do notice anything unusual with a certain food, check a snail or slug site.
,  They don't need as much care as a snail does.

 Conflict starts long before a fight develops. Positive and assertive interaction with the group may off-set any violence. Do your best to minimize conflict by being good-natured, not picking arguments with volatile people you don't know very well, or making off-color comments that could deeply offend the people around you.
 Unless you are a skilled fighter or are in a situation where you cannot escape, your best bet is to run away, fast. Head to somewhere public and call for help. Running is also likely to separate your attackers, making it more likely to be able to confront them individually. Be extra careful when you're running so you avoid getting surrounded or running right in to a trap.

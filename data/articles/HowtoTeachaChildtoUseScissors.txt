 Naturally the child will pick the pair of scissors with their dominate hand.;
, Show the child in your hand how to hold the scissors, and then have them try to copy it. If they aren't able to alone, help move their fingers and thumb into the right position.


Teach them that the thumb always goes in the hole. Draw an eyeball on the small thumb hole and explain that the eyeball will always be on top.
Teach them that two fingers in the larger hole. Help them put their index finger and their middle finger in the hole.
 This practice will help the child build up the strength to control the scissors.
 Start with a paper that's sturdy but not difficult to cut. This will help them cut straight and once again learn to control the scissors.


Use hand-over-hand techniques to help guide the child's cutting, if necessary.
 Draw thick lines with a black marker for the child to trace.
 This will prevent the child from turning the scissors up side down. Show the how to move the paper along with shuffling motions so that they maintain control of both the paper and the scissors.

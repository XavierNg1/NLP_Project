 High speed buffers will eliminate surface scratches and blemishes completely, leaving behind a brilliant shine. However, training is recommended to master a high speed buffer. Improper use of a high speed buffer can strip the paint and damage the finish permanently by leaving swirls and scratches.
 No training is required and the random orbital buffer is easy to use. Not all damage will be eliminated but the end result will be a great shine. Random orbital buffers also use significantly less compound than a high speed buffer, therefore a more cost-effective solution. The results will not last as long as with a high speed buffer.
 However, manual buffing is the most labor intensive option that will give the least effective results. Manual buffing takes much longer than high speed and random orbital buffing and the finish will not last as long with manual buffing. Manual buffing requires the least amount of equipment, but requires the most of amount of product and time. The results are usually an uneven finish that will not last as long as alternative buffing means.
 Compound is needed if there are deep scratches in the finish. Polisher is used if the body paint is in great shape already and just needs an increased shine. Product needs will also vary based on the car model, the car year, and the overall condition of the car. Both products can be used with the buffer.

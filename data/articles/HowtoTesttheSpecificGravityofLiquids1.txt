 Make sure that the liquid in the container is deep enough to allow the hydrometer to float. If the hydrometer rests on the bottom of the container, you will not get an accurate reading. Leave room in the container for the hydrometer to displace some of the liquid, otherwise, youâ€™ll end up with a spill.The shape, and material of the container is irrelevant as long as there is enough liquid present for the hydrometer to float properly.
;
, Your hydrometer will be calibrated to a specific temperature. If your liquid is at a different temperature, the density of the liquid will not match the calibration of the hydrometer. This will cause your reading to be incorrect.A common hydrometer calibration is 60 degrees Fahrenheit (or 15.6 degrees Celsius). You can use a thermometer to check the temperature of your liquid, and then heat or cool as needed.
 The hydrometer is a specialized glass tube that has a weighted end. Place it in the water with the weighted end down. Allow the hydrometer to settle and stop bobbing before taking a reading., The hydrometer is marked with different specific gravity measurements at different intervals. Once it stops floating, the water line will be at one of these marks. The number corresponding to this mark is the specific gravity of your liquid.The reading on the hydrometer is usually a decimal, but it is derived as a ratio of the density of your liquid to the density of water at a given temperature. In other words, if your hydrometer reads 1.1, that means your liquid was 1.1 times as dense as water at that temperature. Note that specific gravity is a unitless measurement.

You can look up the specific gravity of some common liquids. Examples are listed below:

Acetic Acid - 1.052

Acetone - 0.787

Beer - 1.01

Bromine - 3.12

Milk - 1.035

Mercury - 13.633

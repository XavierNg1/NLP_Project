 For the best results, wash and rinse the hair before you begin to cut it. While the hair is still wet, comb through it to release tangles and remove loose hair.


The point cut can be performed with dry hair, but wet hair stands up better and is easier to cut.;
, Hold the scissors in your dominant hand and the styling comb in your non-dominant hand. Comb the hair upward away from the head. When there are about two inches (5 cm) of hair in the comb, pinch the hair between your forefinger and middle finger.Start at the crown of the head, then work around the head in a circle.
If you hold a section of hair that is longer than two inches (5 cm) in your fingers, it will begin to flop over and you can’t point cut it effectively. If there is less than that much, you won’t be creating the desired texture.
 For a traditional cut, you’d hold the scissors parallel to your fingers. For a point cut, angle the scissors downward, perpendicular to your fingers. For the basic point cut, the scissors should be pointing straight down toward your fingers.The idea behind the point cut is to create texture and remove bulk, rather than removing length. This is why the scissors are held straight up and down.
 Cut less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep into the hair you’re holding. Move the scissors sideways one scissors-width (about ⅛ in or .3 cm) and cut again. Repeat this process as you move down the line of the hair. The final result will create a look of peaks and valleys in the hair.For the standard point cut, don’t cut more than an inch (2.5 cm) of hair in this way or the hair will begin to look too jagged.
 As mentioned above, start cutting at the crown of the head. Continue cutting on top of the head staying on half of the head and working toward the front. Then work from the front of the head back toward the crown where you started.

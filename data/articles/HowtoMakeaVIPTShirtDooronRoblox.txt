, Then you must visit your place in Build Solo mode. Then:

Go to View > Explorer, then the Explorer will pop up on the side of your screen.






Click on the plus sign next to Workspace.






Click on the plus sign next to your character's name.






Scroll down to "Torso".






Click on the plus sign next to "Torso".

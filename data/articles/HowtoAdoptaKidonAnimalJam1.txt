 What kid would you like? Will it be a baby, kid, or teenager? What kind of animal is most preferred by you? If you prefer more mature players, choose a kid or teenager, as people who role-play as babies or toddlers may not fit your skill set as a parent. However, if you would love to care for a cuddly baby instead of a kid old enough to talk back, choose a baby!;
, If you are going to choose a baby, get a bed or couch and put it up against the wall. Then secureÂ it by closing it with any kind of fence. Next, make a playroom with plushies, books, and toys put strategically around the room. Make sure to remove or, if possible, hide all dangerous items from your den. If you are going to choose a child, put out a sofa or bed, but do not put up fences. Make the playroom cheerful and colorful, but a bit more grown up. Incorporate a bicycle or telescope if you wish. If you chose a teen, just get a sofa or bed by itself, and decorate with more grown-up items. Instead of a playroom, try to make a game room or lounge. Decorate it so it has a mature color theme,such as grays, purples, blues, and blacks. Avoid pastels or overly bright colors.
 You will find it in Jamaa Township next to the rocket ship.

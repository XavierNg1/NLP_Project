 Nail trimming is another important task. Use guillotine-type nail clippers to trim each nail to just above the quick (the thin vein in each nail) every one to two months. Consider trimming the nails just after a bath, when your Shih Tzu’s nails will be softened by the water.Keep some styptic powder close by when you trim the nails. If you cut the quick and the nail starts bleeding, put a dab of the powder on trimmed section of the nail., Shih Tzu are very prone to dental disease, which can create a lot of pain and discomfort in the mouth. Brushing your Shih Tzu’s teeth once or twice a week will help prevent dental disease.Use dog-specific toothpaste and a dog-safe toothbrush to clean the teeth.If your Shih Tzu won’t stay still enough for you to brush its teeth, ask your vet or a professional groomer to do the teeth cleaning.
When you brush the teeth, look for swelling or redness of the gums.This could indicate dental disease.
 After your Shih Tzu poops, some of the feces may get stuck in the hair around the bottom. Not only would this be smelly, but a buildup of feces could become very uncomfortable for your Shih Tzu. Once or twice a month, wipe around your Shih Tzu’s bottom with a warm, damp cloth to remove the feces.

 Place a wide saucepan on a medium heat and put in the diced apples, along with the sugar. Heat and stir until they start to break down. You can mash them with the back of the spoon to help the consistency break down.;
, Then turn off the heat and add the cinnamon powder.
,, Take one of the peeled apples and cut off the sides without cutting into the core. Discard the core.
, Place the puff pastry circle on a baking tray and spread the apple filling evenly over its surface.
, Sprinkle a little sugar over the top of the tart. Finish up by placing on various small knobs of butter.
 Place the tart into the preheated oven and bake for approximately 25 minutes. After this time, or earlier if browning quickly, remove.
 Put the apricot jam into a small saucepan and add 2-3 tablespoons of water. Heat on a medium temperature and stir together until the jam liquefies. Remove from the heat.
 Using a brush, paint the surface of the tart with the liquefied jam. This will give it a glazed, shiny look, and, of course, adds to the flavour.



Try serving with a little whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, or cool whip.

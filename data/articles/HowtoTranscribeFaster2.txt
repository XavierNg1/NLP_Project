 Transcription is all about typing. If you want to improve your transcription speed, you must be an excellent typist. The first step in learning how to type faster is utilizing all ten of your fingers. Even if you are a pretty good typist, you may neglect your pinky fingers, or favor one hand over the other. Re-familiarize yourself with “home row” finger placement, positioning your pointer fingers on the “F” and “J” keys. Then, review which keys should be governed by which fingers.You can improve this skill by practicing with typing apps. Check out TypeRacer, Typing Maniac, or Keybr.com., “Touch typing” is typing without looking at your fingers. Once you have become familiar with home row and which keys are assigned to which fingers, you can begin practicing your touch typing. You can discipline yourself not to look down, or you may slide a blank sheer of paper into the slot above your keys and let it drape over your hands. Touch typing takes practice, but you will improve exponentially in time.Once again, practicing with typing apps is a great way to improve at touch typing and gain speed.

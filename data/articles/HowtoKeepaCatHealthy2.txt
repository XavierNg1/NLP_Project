 To calculate the right number of litter boxes for your home, add one to the number of cats you have. For instance, if you have two cats at home, you should have three litter boxes., Place the litter boxes in open, clean, quiet, well-lit spaces where the cats can see all around them.A quiet corner of your living room or near the fireplace might be appropriate, depending on your home’s layout.


Do not place litter boxes in places where your cat might feel trapped or could be ambushed.A closet or the end of a long hall with no exit are poor choices for a litter box location.
Don’t place a litter box in a place which is only accessible by going up and down stairs like a basement. If you have a cat that goes up and down stairs, place a litter box on each floor.
 If your cat is peeing in an unusual spot outside its litter box, for instance, take it to the vet. It may be ill and in need of treatment.Similarly, if your cat stops going to the bathroom, or starts going less frequently, contact your vet immediately. Urinary tract infections, constipation, or other illness could be the cause for strange behavior.
 Each week, take the entire litter box and dump its contents into the trash. Wipe the box out with an unscented, nontoxic disinfectant wipe and refill it with new litter.


Make sure that you spot clean the box daily as well and remove any solids, such as feces and clumps of urine soaked litter.

 Run at least 4 times a week: A repetitions session (at least 3 repetitions, distance totalling just under race distance), a hills workout (4-6 hills), a tempo run (15-25 minutes), and a long run each once a week. You should have 1 or 2 rest days per week, and cross-training at least once a week.

 Jog for at least 7 minutes and then stretch both before and after your run.
 You won't be allowed to bring water with you on a competitive cross country race.

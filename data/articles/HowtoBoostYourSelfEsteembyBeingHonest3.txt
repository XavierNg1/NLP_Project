 Look back into your past and ask, “Who was the last person who lied to you? How did that make you feel?” You will most likely recall feeling betrayed, hurt, angry, or even confused. Then, ask yourself, “Do you want to create these emotions in other people?” Repeat this exercise every time you are tempted to lie to someone "for their own sake.", If you look at your thoughts honestly, you will find that many of your observations were taken from other people. Maybe you like the way this outfit looks, but your sister said she hated it on you, so you no longer wear it. By continuing to claim these thoughts as your own, you are weakening your self-esteem., If you can think of a specific person who suffered as a result of your lies, approach them and offer a quick (but sincere) apology. It's best to start your new path with a clean slate. This will also allow you to move away from feelings of guilt, a damaging emotion for your self-esteem.


If you lied to a co-worker, you might say, "I know I said that the project would be completed in two weeks. That is incorrect. It may take up to double that amount of time. I'm sorry I gave you the wrong information."

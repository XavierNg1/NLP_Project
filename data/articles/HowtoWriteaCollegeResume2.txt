 Your name, address, email, phone number(s), high school name, date of birth, and date of submission should be centered at the top of the resume. Make sure that all of the information is current.
 While not necessary for all resumes, consider writing a short paragraph about what you’d like to achieve out of school. This can be especially useful if you are targeting a specific scholarship, major, or program.
 Your college resume should always start with Education first. You will also want to include Extracurricular Activities, Leadership, Volunteer Work, Sports, Employment, and Internships. List them in the order based on strength, with the strongest first after Education. You can also adjust the order depending on where you are applying to.
 In each section, start with your most recent accomplishment, and work backwards. Do not list any activities from middle school and instead focus on showcasing your high school accomplishments.
 Your margins should be set to 1” on all sides. Line-spacing should be wide enough to allow for easy readability, but not so wide as to spread your content out too much.


Font choice will have little impact on your resume, as long as you keep it professional. While a fancy or funny font may seem like it is speaking to your personality, it will cause admissions officers to dismiss it. Stick to business fonts such as Helvetica, Times New Roman, Calibri, etc.

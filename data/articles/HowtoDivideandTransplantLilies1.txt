 Lilies need to be divided if they show an abundance of short and spindly stems.;
, You can harm the bulbs and roots if you separate lilies prior to flowering.
 Work cautiously so you don't cut the bulbs.


Dig several inches (centimeters) away from the lily clumps. Do this at multiple spots encircling the lily clumps.
Excavate to a greater depth than the lilies were initially planted.
Raise the lily clumps from the soil.
 You need to be able to see the bulb formations clearly to divide the lilies.


Shake the lilies very gently to dislodge excess soil.
Use a hose to wash the remaining soil from the bulb clumps.
 As they grow, lilies form clumps of bulbs that are attached to each other. Gardening experts recommend pulling the bulbs apart or gently twisting to separate them.


Break apart the bulb clumps, taking care to allow the roots to untangle themselves. Don't tear the roots apart.
Tug little bulblets, immature lily bulbs, from the stem.
Use a knife to separate lily bulbs if you can't get them apart any other way.

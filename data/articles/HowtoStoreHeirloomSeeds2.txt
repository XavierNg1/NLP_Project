 Do not deadhead or remove flowers, and do not harvest vegetables upon ripening. Instead, let the flowers die off naturally and let the vegetables become overripe. Approximately six weeks after you would normally harvest your vegetables, seedpods should have developed and matured.
 For vegetables, the pods will usually turn yellow or brown during this time. Corn seedpods shrivel and develop a hardened exterior. For flowers, the blooms will lose their petals and the stems will turn brown.
 Pluck them off the plant using your fingers or gently snip them off using clean scissors or shears.
 Lay them out on newspaper and place them in a dry, warm location. Allow the pods to dry for one to two weeks.
 After the pods have become dry, carefully peels the crumpled shell protecting the interior seeds. For flowers, you will need to crumble the flower heads to obtain the seeds.

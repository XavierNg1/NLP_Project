 For those who must work in sub-zero temperatures and take the laptop or computer with them, it is important to buy one that fits the bill. Biologists tracking caribou trails need a laptop that can stand the rigors of temperature changes, along with quite a few knocks. Ask your local computer specialist for advice. Many times, the laptop or computer will need to be specially modified to cope.;
, Keep your laptop in this inner sleeve at all times that you are not using it. If you need it, take it out and fire it up, use it and then return it to its cozy little bag to retain heat. If you have a pet dog, tuck the laptop under the dog where it is sitting as this will help keep it warm. Failing that, use the car heater zone, or the tent heating zone to keep it in a warmer part of your operations.
 Something made from a fire blanket might be a good option provided that is non-flammable (they are supposed to be). You will need to make absolutely sure that the material is non-flammable and it must be cut away from any vent areas of the laptop or computer to allow it to remove any heat build-up (ironically this will still occur despite the cold, as that is the nature of computing hardware).
 Even if you are not an intrepid explorer or a poorly paid biologist on a field trip way up North or way down South, you need to take good care of a laptop or computer being transported in your vehicle during cold weather., If you need to use it en route, only turn it on inside the car with the heating on so that it is in room temperature environment., For computers, just make sure they are well wrapped for both warmth and damage-proofing so that it reaches its destination in good condition.,,

 If you will be using gluten-free flour for a bake sale, cookie exchange, or gathering at your own home, you may wish to test the recipe with your selected flour in a small batch in advance. This will prevent the unpleasant surprise of hard cupcakes, dry cake, chewy bread, an over- or under-baked pie shell, and some of the other challenges certain gluten-free flours pose for certain recipes.
 Certain flours carry flavors and textures, baking times, colors, and characteristics that do not equate to traditional wheat flours.


Taste and test recipes with different gluten-free flours (such as potato or rice flour) and then compare them to the same recipe using another flour (such as soy or bean flour) to get a feel for the influence on the final product each flour has on particular types of baked goods.

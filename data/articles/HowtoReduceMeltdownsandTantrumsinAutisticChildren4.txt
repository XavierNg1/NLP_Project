 If they can communicate the thing that is bothering them, they are less likely to build up stress or resort to bad behavior.Your child needs to know how to say or communicate the following:


"I'm hungry."
"I'm tired."
"I need a break, please."
"That hurts."

, Many autistic children have trouble understanding their feelings, and it may be helpful for them to point to pictures or learn the physical symptoms that accompany feelings. Explain that telling people how they feel (such as "The grocery store makes me scared") allows people to help fix problems (such as "You can wait outside with your big sister while I finish shopping").


Make it clear that if they communicate, you will listen to them. This eliminates the need for a tantrum.
 The meltdown-prone child will need a calm, stable parental figure as well as consistency from all those involved with their care. You will not be able to address your childâ€™s self-control until you have control of yourself first., This is called "presuming competence" and it greatly improves autistic people's social skills. Autistic people are much more likely to open up if they feel that they will be respected.
 If an autistic child is not ready for speech, there are other ways to have him communicate with you. Try sign language, typing, picture exchange systems, or whatever a therapist recommends.

 You could name it after your Minecraft character, or parody a real life space program. For example, Steve, the default character of Minecraft, could name his space program "Steve Space Program". A little boring, but you get the picture. Or he could name it MASA, the Minecraft Aeronautical Space Agency.;
, Do you want it to be an observatory, or an underground lab? A cave, or a treehouse? Build whatever you want, but make sure it looks very scientific and space-y.
 For example, you could build a TNT cannon to launch pigs into orbit, or you could simply build a tower as high as possible. Another thing you could do is build a rocket with TNT in it and blow it up while inside it. Then, you can pretend that you've landed on an Earth-like planet. Or you can go to the Nether. Or you can pretend to have found a cave planet. The possibilities go on and on and on!

, You want a space complex. You can build a rocket-launching building, a dormitory, a storehouse, a museum, a bunch of scientific labs, etc. Build and build and build.
 This could be an unexplored section of the world that you can say is an Earth-like planet, the Nether, the End, a cave system, etc. Think about it! Wouldn't it be cool to have a base on another planet?

, If you're on a server, allow people to view your data, or something like that. If not, you can either open to LAN and invite a friend onto your world, or you can take screenshots.

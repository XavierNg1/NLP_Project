 The Clostridium tetani bacteria enter the body through cuts and broken skin.C. tetani lives in soil, dust, and animal feces. When these bacteria enter a deep flesh wound, the spores may produce a powerful toxin, tetanospasmin, which actively impairs your motor neurons â€“ the nerves that control your muscles. There is an incubation period of 3-21 days before symptoms begin to appear.


The incubation period varies according to the distance the infected wound is from the central nervous system. For instance: an infected cut on the finger will have a longer incubation period than a cut on the neck.
Be quick to treat deep, penetrating wounds. The bigger and more severe the injury, the easier it will be for C. tetani to enter your body., Tetanus infections occur all over the world. However, they are most common in hot, wet climates where the soil is rich with bacteria. Tetanus usually does not spread from one person to another. Nonetheless: be careful what you touch when you are walking around with an open cut or wound. If you are traveling in the developing world, you may not have access to the same caliber of tetanus treatment as you would in your home country.
 Ask your doctor about the "Dtap" booster vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis. You can usually prevent infection through proper immunization with the tetanus vaccine. This is how tetanus has been largely eradicated from the developed world.


In the United States, nearly all modern cases of tetanus occur in adults who were not vaccinated as children, or who have not received a vaccination in the past ten years.

 Holistic medicine holds that people are more than just a group of organs and that the whole body is an interrelated system.For that reason, some ear reflex points are thought to correspond to certain emotions.Learning how to identify these points may also help you as you learn how to read an ear reflexology chart.
 Sympathy, guilt, and self-pity are on the outer part of the ear. This area is roughly in the center of your ear.
 Feelings of depression and being overwhelmed are located on the upper part of the outer ridge of the ear. Consider massaging this area if you have been feeling sad lately or if you have a lot on your plate right now.
 Feelings of anger and fear, as well as problems with self-expression are located behind the ear canal in the center of the ear. Consider massaging this area if you have been feeling angry, fearful, or have been having a hard time expressing your thoughts and feelings.
 The earlobe is the point on your ear that is concerned with love and openness. This is the easiest point to find and perhaps the easiest to stimulate as well. Consider massaging this point if you want to feel more loving and open.

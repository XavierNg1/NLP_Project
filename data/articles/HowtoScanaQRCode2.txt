 There are several programs that are available both for free and for purchase that support reading QR images.
 Some programs will allow you to drag QR image files into the program, or to drag an overlay over your open web browser to highlight a QR code on a website. You may be able to scan QR codes with a webcam as well.
 If you will be doing a significant amount of QR scanning, you can purchase a physical barcode scanner gun that plugs into your computerâ€™s USB port. These scanners are much more responsive than using a smartphone or webcam to scan codes.


When purchasing a barcode scanner, be sure that it can read 2D barcodes, such as QR codes. 1D barcodes are the traditional barcodes composed of lines. A 1D barcode scanner cannot read QR codes.

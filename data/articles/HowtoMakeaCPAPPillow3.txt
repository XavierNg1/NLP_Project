 Choose a fabric that's nice and soft, since you’ll be resting your face on it. You’ll need between a half yard and one yard of fabric to make a bed pillow.Once you’ve selected your fabric, prewash it according to its care instructions.
 Trace a pillow shape with two cutouts on each side onto a piece of tissue paper. It should look like a rectangle with two C-shaped cutouts for the CPAP mask on each side. Using the tissue paper form as a guide, cut the fabric with shears to create the pillow’s front and back sides., Place the front and back sides together right side in, or so what will eventually be the insides of the pillow face out. The pieces of fabric should be on top of each other so that they’re inside out when you stitch them together. Use straight pins to secure the pieces of fabric to each other so you’ll be able to sew them together., As you stitch three sides of the pillow, take care to follow the curves of the C-shaped contours. Before stitching, tie a knot at the end of your thread opposite the needle so it won’t pull through the fabric.If you’re using a sewing machine, try not to yank the fabric too hard to follow the curve. Focus on the area just ahead of your stitching needle and gently move the fabric with your fingertips to follow the curve.
Leave the fourth side open so you can flip the pillow right side out and stuff it., After stitching three sides and turning the pillow right side out, you can stuff the pillow. You can find a foam, cotton, or polyester filling of your choice at your local craft or home goods store. Pull the filling apart to loosen it, then pack it into the pillow’s nooks and crannies., You can pin the fourth side before stitching it closed to test its firmness. Add or remove filling to fit your comfort standards and accommodate your CPAP mask. Once you’ve filled the pillow to your liking, stitch the last side closed.

 Let your electronic device turn off by itself once the battery is "dead". It is important to start the process from this position because what you are really doing here is calibrating your device to know how much "juice" is in the battery. Your device needs to know what an exhausted battery "feels like", to know what the battery's range of charge can be.;
, Four bars on a cell phone, full battery on a laptop, whatever it may say, it is probably wrong - and you should be able to tell because the device will not hold a charge for as long as you would like.
, You should allow a few (5-10) seconds to pass to let any static charge in the device to dissipate before you put it back in.
, In most cases the device will again tell you that it is charging. Depending on the degradation of the battery, this charge MAY take as long as the initial charge did, or longer. Patience is paramount to success. Once the device again tells you it is fully charged.
 Each time you replace the battery and begin charging it again the time it takes for the device to tell you "Fully Charged" should be decreased. This is really where your patience is needed. You should not let the device stand idly telling you "Full Charge" for too long during this process. Try to stay involved with the device and your execution of these steps.
 Once you reach this point your battery should already display new life and last longer than before you started this process. Again it is important to let the battery fully "die" before you reattach the charger. Once your device has "died" and you "Fully Charge" it again, you may repeat steps 3-6 to determine whether or not the device is actually "Fully Charged".

 Don’t ditch your friends in your quest to find a boyfriend. It’s important to have multiple types of friendships in your life. Go out with your friends or spend a night in watching a movie or cooking together.


Don’t turn every friend night into a boyfriend-finding mission. When you’re too consumed with finding a partner, your friends might think you’re not interested in them at all.
 Keep developing yourself as a person. Grow your interests, both personally and professionally. If you want to try a new hobby or sport, go for it. If you want to get a new certification to help you at work, do it. It’s important to bring forth your own goals and pursue them.
 Give yourself time to spend by yourself. This will give you an opportunity to understand yourself better, to develop your own voice, to relax, and to think deeply.Take yourself on a reading date. Bring a good book to a café, order some coffee and a croissant, and treat yourself to an hour of uninterrupted reading.

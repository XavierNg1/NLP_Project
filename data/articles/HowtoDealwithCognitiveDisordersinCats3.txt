 If your cat is demonstrating signs of confusion, or showing signs that it does not remember how to get to its litter box (e.g. eliminating in alternate places), place a second litter box in a more central area. Having multiple litter boxes might help to curb elimination problems by making them easier to find and use. Place the new litter box in the easily-accessible location while leaving the first in its original spot to avoid more confusion., If your cat is suffering from cognitive dysfunction syndrome, it may be more likely to get itself into dangerous situations in its home environment (e.g. getting stuck in a closet or cupboard). Close off any areas of the home that you think might prove problematic for your cat. For instance, keep the laundry room door closed when you are not inside if you suspect your cat might get stuck behind the washer or dryer., If your cat is experiencing a disrupted sleep pattern due to CDS, leave nightlights on around the house so it can navigate more easily. Improved visibility of its surroundings may ease your cat’s nighttime anxiety and help it find its litter box or water bowl with less trouble. Opt for an energy-efficient LED night light, which will last for years and cost as little as 25 cents a year to operate., To reduce disorientation, keep things as predictable and consistent as possible for your cat. Maintain the same food placement and eating schedule every day so that your cat is more likely to recognize when it’s time to eat, and find its food accordingly. Avoid moving around furniture or displacing your cat from its usual surroundings as much as possible (e.g. if your cat spends most of its time in the living room, host your child’s play date with a friend in another room of the house).

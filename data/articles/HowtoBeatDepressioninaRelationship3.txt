 It can either be tougher or you can have extra support, depending on how your relationship works and how you handle it.
 It may be tempting to close yourself off because you're tired or afraid of hurting them. Work on finding ways to spend time together. This shows your partner that yes, you do care.
 Maybe you're too tired to handle amusement parks anymore, but you could snuggle in front of the TV together or take a walk on the beach. Depression will make your life harder, so you'll need to think of new ways to spend time with your partner.
 If you two know each other well, then it's important that your partner understands what's going on with you. Set aside a time to talk and explain your diagnosis. Expect to cry a little, answer some questions, and assure them that it isn't their fault.


Your partner may want to read a little about depression in order to understand it better.
 When you're depressed, there's no doubt you're a different person. We tend to let the negative thoughts misconceive what's going on around us and therefore make inaccurate judgments.


If your partner does something that upsets you, think "Did they really mean it in a negative way, or did I take it in the worst possible context?" It could be that you misunderstood. If you're unsure, ask them.
If you're too upset to speak, try taking a walk or a five-minute break.
 It's okay to be vulnerable, and it's normal to have bad days or minor arguments. This does not mean you're a terrible partner. Depression is difficult to fight, and you are strong for continuing.
 Difficult times may weaken a relationship, or make it even stronger. Allow yourself to be vulnerable. Your partner is with you because they care about you, and they want to help you however they can. Give them a chance to do so.

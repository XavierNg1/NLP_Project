 Place the shower and toilet in the bathroom. Place the sink and mirror in small zone just outside the bathroom, facing toward the beds and the rest of the room. This way, when two people stay in the room, one can do their makeup or shave while the other takes a shower., Locating the bathroom door on a diagonal angle will not only widen the visible space of the main room, it will make the bathroom itself seem larger. A bathroom of four to six square meters should be sufficient.Don't make the bathroom door face the toilet. Instead, make it face the shower and/or sink.
 If you want to include a lot of accessories, tuck them away in retractable drawers or under the sink where they wonâ€™t add unnecessary clutter to the bathroom.


One large bathroom rug is enough.
Hang towels on a rack.

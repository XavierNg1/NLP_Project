 There are a few things that you must ALWAYS remember when dealing with guns. These rules are very basic, but CRITICAL and cannot be stressed enough. Without these, you will get hurt ... it is just a matter of when not if. Guns are NOT toys; there is no room for tom-foolery or games with them. They are tools made to do one thing. Remember that and you will do well. If you are unable or unwilling to always abide by these simple rules, then you certainly should stay away from guns and save yourself a lifetime (possibly a short one) of grief. With that said, here are rules to live by (literally).


"Unloaded" guns kill: How? Consider, "All guns are always loaded." Meaning, removing the ammo magazine does not unload the chambered cartridge. Never assume a gun is safe until you have personally checked the firing chamber for the last cartridge, and verified it is unloaded, as well.






Always keep your finger off of the trigger until you are ready to shoot






Never point your gun at anything you are not willing to destroy ... always keep your gun pointed in a safe direction.






When shooting, always know your target and what is beyond it.

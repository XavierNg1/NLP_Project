 You can change the privacy settings for any album that you have created. This will affect every photo in the album. For "Mobile Uploads," "Profile Pictures," "Timeline Photos," and "Cover Photos," you'll need to change the privacy for each photo individually.You cannot change the privacy settings for albums using the mobile site or the mobile app.
 You'll find this for each album in the Album list, or at the top of an open album.
 This will make the album completely private, including all of the photos inside.


If others are tagged in the album, they'll still be able to see it. You'll need to remove their tags to completely hide the album from view.

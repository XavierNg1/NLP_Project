 You will need this to make the dough.;
, Put these in your food processor and press your pulse button.
 Incorporate these into the mixture. Press the pulse button, and blend these ingredients until the mixture is hard and resembles gravel.
 Add this to the mixture as well, and press the pulse button, allowing the mixture to have a few more "rounds" of blending.
 Set on a flat surface and separate the mixture into 2 disks (these should be rolled). Bring out plastic wrap, which should be used to cover the mixture.
, Then, gather a medium saucepan and place your newly chopped cherries in the saucepan.
 Set your saucepan to medium heat and allow the mixture to heat up, and mix consistently.
 Place in a small bowl. Add some cornstarch and blend well.
 Continue allowing it to cook gently below a boiling point, and be sure to mix together throughout the time. In approximately 6 to 8 minutes, the batter should have thickened very much.
, Thoroughly cover a surface that's flat (and not dirty) with very much flour.
 Continue this process until your dough is still thick (an-eighth of an inch).
 Use it to create squares from your dough through a cutting process. Place some of the cherries (1 1/2 tbsp. of them) on the center of the square.
 Rub an amount of water extending directly over two adjoining sides of each square.
 Do this through a folding process.
, Put them in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastries are completely browned. Allow them to cool before serving; use a cooling rack if necessary.

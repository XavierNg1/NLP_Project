;
, Don't do it and the older ones simultaneously, or else you'll be tempted to omit few topics.
, Concentrate on all subjects equally. If you cannot learn the same subject for the whole day, split topics and include other subjects too.
 Remember they'll only say what they've finished. Not what they've not, and you won't boast about yourself if you follow your timetable correctly.
 For the next 15 days, do the second revision (5 days for each subject if you are a first year. Put anatomy last as it'll be the first exam)

, Before exams you HAVE to get at least 7-8 hours sleep. (again see step 5)

, Don't discuss anything after the exam instead start preparing for the next exam. Don't try taking a nap. You won't be able to do that with your heart thumping like mad.

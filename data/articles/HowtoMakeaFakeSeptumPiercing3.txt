 A paper clip can also be used to make a fake septum piercing. Paperclips are often easier to manipulate than wires or earring hooks. You'll also need a pencil and pliers. You simply need a paperclip, a pen, and a pair of scissors.
 Unbend the paper clip until it stretches into a thin line. Then, bend the clip around your pen to form a loop.








Clip the ends of the paperclip so they're even in length and you have a small circular loop, roughly the size of a septum piercing. Use your fingers to bend it into a semi-circle until it comfortably fits on your nose., If you're using paper clips, consider using different colors. You can make a fake septum piercing in a variety of fun colors, like red or purple.One downside to colored paperclips is that sometimes the paint is cheap and chips easily. If you're using a colorful paperclip, you may have to frequently replace your fake piercing.

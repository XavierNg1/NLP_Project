 Before you try any exercises, make sure to follow any directions that come with your suspension straps. If you don't follow the directions, the straps could come loose while you're working out, which could result in you being hurt. They should be anchored well, usually to a door, a tree, exercise equipment, or the ceiling.You can buy suspension kits that come with what you'll need to anchor the kit into the wall. You may need a drill to install it.;
, While suspension training can work for many people, if you haven't been exercising much, you may want to work with someone who knows what they're doing. They can assess your level of fitness and help you do suspension training properly without injuring yourself. You can likely work with a personal trainer at your gym, if you have one., If you're new to suspension training, you can make it a bit easier on yourself. When you're doing moves standing up, you'd normally have your feet shoulder-width apart. Instead, try putting one leg behind the other, as it will give you more stability. You'll still get a good workout, but you'll have better balance overall.You can also adjust the angle of your exercise. For instance, you can move yourself a bit more upright if going farther down is too hard at first.
 Before trying an exercise in suspension, you may want to try it without suspension first to make sure that you are using the correct form. For instance, try doing a burpee without the suspension training before you use the straps, as it will help you understand the movement better before you make it more difficult.

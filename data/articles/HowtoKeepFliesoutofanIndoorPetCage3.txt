 For larger flies, such as house flies, paper funnel traps are surprisingly effective. To make one, use stiff paper to make a funnel that will sit within the rim of a jar you will use as your trap. Put a ½ an inch of water with a tablespoon or two of sugar into the bottle of the jar.Cut the tip of the paper cone so there’s a hole at the bottom of the paper funnel about one inch in diameter and place it in the jar, making sure that the tip of the funnel is not submerged or nearly submerged in the sugar water.
Flies will enter the funnel, but will be unable to easily leave. Dispose of them as you wish, while leaning towards the more permanent options.
 Put about 1" of apple cider vinegar or balsamic vinegar in the bottom of a glass or jar. Add a couple of drops of liquid dish detergent and swirl to dissolve. Place glass just outside the pet cage overnight. Dispose of the liquid and captured flies and replace the trap if live flies are still present. Remove the trap once there are no longer flies in the cage


Similarly, you can simply put a ½ inch of beer or red wine in a bottle with a tall neck. A wine bottle is actually ideal. Flies will enter the bottle but struggle to leave, perhaps in part because they’ll be drunk., If the infestation persists, you can try using commercially available traps, many of which are also natural and chemical-free. Some even use color to help attract flies, and many simply use glue. Replace these traps as they fill up, and discontinue use only once they are no longer acquiring victims.

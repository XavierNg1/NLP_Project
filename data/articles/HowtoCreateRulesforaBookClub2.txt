 This type of book club gathers a collection of books for its members to borrow. The more people you invite, the larger and more interesting your library. That said, for logistics reasons you may want to start with ten people or fewer.
 There are two common ways this type of club can function:


Each member loans the club 1-3 books each meeting.
Alternatively, each member donates a certain amount of money each meeting. The host for that month (a rotating position) spends the money to buy books for the club to enjoy.
 Unless you have a communal space to store the books, the book club usually only borrows or returns books once every month or two. This is also a good chance to trade recommendations and socialize.


It's usually easiest to have one person store the book collection and host the meetings, so you don't have to transport the books. Consider putting out a donation box to reimburse this host for his time.
 Here are a few suggested rules to keep the club running smoothly:


Each member can borrow one book at a time.
Each book is due back after a certain amount of time (such as two months).
Set a small fine for late books, to be put in a communal fund for snacks or similar expenses.
Set a larger fine for lost or damaged books, to be given to the original owner of the book.
 For space reasons, most clubs won't want to keep their collection growing endlessly. After a book has been around for a certain period of time (say 6 to 12 months), return it to its original owner or purchaser.
 One person should be responsible for a document that lists every book in the collection, with the following information:


Who currently has the book (if anyone).
When the book is due back in the collection.
The original owner/purchaser.
When the book is due to return to the original owner/purchaser.

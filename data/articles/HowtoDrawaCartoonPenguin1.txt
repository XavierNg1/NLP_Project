 It can be taller or stouter than the shape shown here, depending on how you want your penguin to look. After you've decided on the body's size, sketch in guidelines to help you with the features.;
, Above those put very short, very faint eyebrows, which should be hardly noticeable unless you're looking right at them. Add in rosy cheeks if you like, and triangle for the beak.
 Include a small tail if you want peeking out on the side of the penguin's body. Add an oval on the penguin's tummy.
 Add in details, like the tuft of feathers on top of the head. Erase any unnecessary guidelines.
 Use black or grey for most of the penguin's body, with yellowish-orange for the beak and feet. Add in some shadowing/highlights and you are done!

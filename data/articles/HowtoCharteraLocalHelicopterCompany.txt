 Make sure there are no wires because these are the biggest problem for a helicopter trying to land. Alert your chosen company as to where any wires are situated and realize that the company will make the final decision on where to pick up and land. Large fields or parking lots are best. Parking decks are great too, even better are those with lights.

 They can fly around thunderstorms, but not at night, for example.
 When entering the helicopter, the pilot will assist you. Do not slam the doors shut. They work with a simple close and a pin, very unlike a car door.
 Scarves, gloves, sunglasses, camera cases and cellular phones are dangerous when introduced to a tail rotor. Make sure they are under control before you approach the helicopter. In the summertime, just keep them pocketed.

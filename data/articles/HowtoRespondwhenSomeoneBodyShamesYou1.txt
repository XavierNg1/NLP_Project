 If people commonly comment on certain parts of your body, it can help if you practice a response to those comments. For instance, if people often comment negatively about your weight, think up responses you can use later. That way, you won't be caught off guard.For instance, you could say, "My weight is none of your business," or "I like my hair just the way it is, thank you.";
, One way you can deal with body shaming from strangers is to simply call the person out on it. You don't have to take rude comments, even if they are from strangers, and calling a person out may make you feel better about the situation because you're taking control.For instance, if someone says, "Should you be ordering that? Do you really need those calories?" you could say, "I don't appreciate you commenting on my eating habits. My body, my choice."
However, if the person seems aggressive, it may be best to move on to ignoring them, particularly if you're in a secluded place. Safety should always come first.
 One option is to just to ignore the rude comment. You don't have to respond, and responding only gives the person the attention they want. Plus, when you don't respond, you give the person a chance to think about what they said.When ignoring a person, don't even look in their direction. Pretend like you don't even hear what they're saying.
 While it's never okay for someone to comment on your body, you can decide if you want to let their negativity get to you. Remember, it's usually more about the other person than it is about you. Try to detach yourself from their comments and negativity. Don't give them the satisfaction of knowing that they got under your skin.Imagine a window between you and the other person. You can see that they're making a negative comment, but the negativity can't actually reach you.

 Don't bring up politics or religion, and avoid topics that have triggered an argument before. Instead, talk about the person's hobby, the weather, food, or a shared friend.


Parents usually love to talk about their children.;
, If you are forced to have a conversation with someone, make an effort to keep your contributions polite and short. Deliver a small compliment on the person's clothing or house when you join a conversation with him. Ask him short, basic questions about how his day has been going, or whether there's anything new with his family. Listen to the answers without interrupting, even if he talks for some time. The less you say, the less likely you are to reveal your dislike.


If you can't think of anything nice to say, just smile and nod instead.
 Rubbing the back of your neck, crossing your arms, or shifting your weight back and forth can signal that you are bored or nervous. If this is someone you don't want to offend, try to keep your feet still and your arms at your sides.
 Subtle humor can be easily misinterpreted as offensive, especially if you accidentally let your real opinion show through in your tone of voice. Only make obvious, straightforward jokes, or none at all, and don't tease the person you dislike, even in a "friendly" fashion.
 A socially savvy person may end the conversation herself once she sees that you are only giving short responses. If she doesn't, however, politely excuse yourself by saying "It was nice talking to you! I've got to get back to (my errands/my work/my day.)"


Another option in a group conversation is to ask another person questions so the focus shift to him instead of the person you dislike.
If you do not have the option of leaving permanently, give yourself a "time out" by excusing yourself to the bathroom for a few minutes.

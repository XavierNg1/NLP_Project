 For example, one person might count to 3 and both of you make your move. Another way is to face each other with your palms out, and make your moves when you touch hands.;
, You can only make one move per turn. There are three different moves:


Reload: Make the shape of a gun and point it up in the air. You must reload at least once before shooting. Reloads can be accumulated. A certain number of accumulated reloads grants a specific weapon. One reload gives a pistol, three gives a machine gun, and five a shotgun.






Shoot: Pantomime the action of shooting your opponent. You may use any weapon that the number of reloads you have allows for. For example, if you only have one reload you can only fire your pistol once, but if you have three reloads you can either fire your pistol three times (that is, across three separate turns without needing to reload) or fire your machine gun once. Make sure that it is clear which weapon you are shooting your opponent with. You may only fire ONE shot per turn (one pistol shot, one machine gun shot, etc.)






Block: Cross your arms over your chest. This will block all shots. In simple shotgun, your shield can never be compromised.
 Someone dies if they are shot while reloading. If both players shoot each other at the same time, whoever has the more powerful weapon wins (the machine gun overpowers the pistol, the shotgun overpowers the machine gun and pistol). If the weapons are of the same strength, the game is a draw.

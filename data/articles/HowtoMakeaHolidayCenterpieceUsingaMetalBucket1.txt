 Do you want an offbeat, funky centerpiece or are you looking for something more traditional and refined? Having an idea of style will help you best determine what supplies you’ll need.;
, Perhaps where you live you have no access to certain items like pinecones or birch tree limbs. Especially if you want to work with native or found items, you may need to consider what you have easy access to and can be intuitively integrated into your motif.
 In many cases you’ll never know if the centerpiece will really work unless you produce a “pretend” or mock centerpiece. Even if you don’t have the supplies, either sketch or assemble (using other items) a centerpiece that takes into consideration weight, height and girth.
 Craft stores offer an endless number of containers or adorable metal buckets in a variety of colors so once you’ve identified your style, visualize or select the centerpiece bucket.

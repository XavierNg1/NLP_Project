 No matter how old you are, being trashy is never okay! A lot of guidettes can be trashy or inappropriate, but some guidettes are very responsible & classy.;
, It is best to be at least 3/4 Italian. If not, people may look at you as a poser! However, Snooki pulls off the Guidette look pretty well, & she is Chilean!

, Most Guidettes either have dark brown hair or black hair. You can't be a blonde or a red head. It just won't work! Again, you have to be Italian...& most Italians have dark hair. Also, I suggest straightening your hair for an everyday look. If you don't have long hair, try out extensions! Make sure that they don't look fake though. I recommend trying out Luxy Hair Extensions or Hello Gorgeous extensions.
 For school, use foundation, bronzer, eyeliner, mascara, and a light pink lipstick/lip balm.(Snooki uses MAC lipstick.) Also, false lashes are optional, as long as they are natural looking. Nothing too bold!! Don't wear anything too dark or heavy.
 In the summer, tan outside almost every day! If you can handle it, then use SPF 4 or SPF 8. (That will help you get a deeper tan.) Also, use a self-tanner. Just make sure that you do not look orange! Try to look brown.
 You do not have to buy anything really expensive though. Wear Victoria's Secret PINK sweats, Ed Hardy, bebe, Armani Exchange, Guess, Juicy Couture tracksuits, etc. Wear skinny jeans, yoga pants, lounge outfits, bodycon dresses/mini skirts, etc.
 (BIG Hoop earrings, cross necklaces, Louis Vuitton purses, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci hats & purses, Prada, Chanel earrings, so on.) In the winter, wear Uggs almost everyday! Have at least 3 of them. Try to buy some Snooki Slippers as well for lounging around the house.
 & if you are a REAL Italian...remember, it ain't sauce... it's called gravy!

,, Use words like grenade, yo, yous, hon/honey, etc. Do NOT sound fake though.
 You can't be a real guidette without confidence! So Do NOT be shy! You can be sweet, but not shy. For example, Sammi from Jersey Shore is sweet & a nice person, but she's not too quiet.

 If your fabric is prone to shrinking, you'll be thankful you did. Do this well before you start sewing -- the fabric needs to be completely dry.









Follow the washing instructions for that specific fabric. Whether it's machine wash, hand wash, or hang dry, the instructions should be followed.
If you throw your fabric in the dryer and it comes out a little wrinkly, iron it. It'll be much easier to work with when you're sewing.

, When it comes to thread, more is better. Aim for cutting twice as much thread as you think you'll actually need. Taking one end of the thread between your thumb and forefinger, insert it through the eye of the needle. Then, bring the needle to the halfway point by bringing both ends of the thread together. Once there, secure the ends in a knot.









Cutting the thread with sharp scissors and licking the end can make it easier to guide through the eye of the needle. If you can't do it, your thread may be too thick or your needle too small.

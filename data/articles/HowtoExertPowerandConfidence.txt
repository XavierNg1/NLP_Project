 Don't dress shabby - this will give the impression of lacking confidence and no self-worth. On the other hand, don't splash out loads of money on designer clothes. This will show that you feel insecure around them and feel you have to impress them. Wear something you feel comfortable in and shows YOUR style. For example, skinny jeans, flats and a cute top is always a good option for girls, or normal jeans (skinny jeans can lead to others judging you on boys) and a T-shirt with decent trainers (not muddy sports ones!) for boys.;
, That means chin up, a friendly smile, back straight, arms loose by your sides and gently swinging when you walk.
 You must believe in yourself, and think that you are fantastic - but don't be a snob. No one will think you are confident and strong if you don't believe that too.
 Shyness, embarrassment, sadness and general unhappiness are all there, but there is also confidence, strength, joy, and all round good feelings: these are what you need to bring out. Let those shine through - no matter how nervous you are, Just Do It. You will almost always come through feeling happy and proud of yourself. Obviously this rule doesn't apply with drugs or excessive amounts of alcohol.
 Strut. Obviously that doesn't mean the whole hip swing, banging steps and hand on hip fandango, but it does mean know where you are going and get there in style. Girls - slight hip swing but too much, guys, just be smiling confidently.

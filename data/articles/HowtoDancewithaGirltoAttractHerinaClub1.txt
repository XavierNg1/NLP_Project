 When you enter a party or a club, don't waste time. - Just start doing what you intended. This is a crucial step; the more you delay, the harder it would get. So just as you enter the club, push yourself to begin, even if every fiber in your body is against it. You will realize that your mental state prior to pushing yourself was irrational and feel better instantly. Some of the ways to do that are:


Start talking to people around you.
Jump on the floor and dance alone for a while until you feel more relaxed.;
, Night clubs and parties are very high energy environments, so it is necessary to increase your energy to that level if you want to have fun. If you don't, it is likely that you will never ramp your energy and will lag behind while standing at the side watching other people dance. So don't analyze or think - just jump into the lively interactions. This is not only attractive, but also helps you become action centered.
 If you see a girl dancing with another girl or alone, just approach her without wasting time. Use common sense when a girl is dancing with a guy then don't approach her. The more you delay, the harder it's going to be and creepier you will feel about yourself.

 To create a second series, enter the data into your spreadsheet as you did in the first section. The data should line up with the same time values as the first set. After you finish you should have three columns of the same length.
 Select the cells you wish to include in the chart, including the header of the column. Then, press Ctrl+C to copy it., Select the chart box, then press Ctrl+V to paste the data as a new line in your chart. If you do not see the new line appear, read on in this method.

Be sure you are actually selecting the entire chart, rather than the X-axis, Y-axis, or Chart Title.
 Then click Select Data under the Data heading. The Select Data Source window will open again.


Under Legend Entries (Series), click the Add button.
In the Series name field, select the cell with the heading name for your second set of data.
In the Series values field, select the cells that contain your new data. This field needs to have an "=" sign in front of it or Excel will return an error.
Press OK. You will be taken back to the Select Data Source window. Your new line will appear on the chart.
 Then, in the Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels frame, click the Edit button. Select the time column again. This will prevent conflicting X-axis labels from messing up the graph.
 Format it using the steps above to match the aesthetic of your spreadsheet.

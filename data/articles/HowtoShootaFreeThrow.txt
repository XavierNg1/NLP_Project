 First off every shooter has a different routine when they step up to the free throw line, whether it is two dribbles or no dribbles at all. However, every good shooter begins with balance, there is always a nail at the middle of the free throw line, find the nail or dot and line your shooting foot up with it and be on balance this is the B in BEEF, Balance.
Keep your Elbow straight. After you have your balance, have your elbow on your shooting hand line up to make an L right under the ball. Make sure your fingers are spread to insure backspin.
Focus your Eyes on the rim. Keep your eyes on the back of the rim, so you are basically looking through the net. Aim for the back of the rim.
Follow through. After you release the ball, keep your hand up in the air for a second or two after the ball leaves it, as though you were reaching into a cookie jar.;

Step up to the line with confidence. Even if you don't make the shot, it's the experience that counts, right?

, Many shooters in the NBA and other professional leagues do a few dribbles or spins with the ball before they shoot. Maybe it's holding the ball in each hand, or evening out your feet, but find a method that works for you. This method should help you to focus precisely on your shot.

, That means, if you are right-handed, line up your right foot exactly even with the basket right on the line. Vice versa for left handers. This will improve your free throw dramatically.

Point both feet forward, squared to the basket. Your toes should point in the direction of the basket.
Do your feet leave the floor when you do a free throw? Take a step back from the line. Are you more of an ace standing still? Press right up to the line. Left or right handed? Step slightly to the opposite side.

Clutch the basketball firmly in your hands. The last thing you need is for the ball to slip out wrong.
 Remember you need to make this shot. It's the easiest shot. No one gets to guard you. A free throw is basically a free shot.

, How hard will you have to shoot it? Do you have a tendency to hit it right off the backboard? If so, use slightly less pressure. Does your shot make an air ball arch? Aim further out towards the hoop.

Keep it simple. A smooth shot saves the day more than a shot that's not smooth. Right into the net is where you want the ball to go.
 Your dominant hand should stay up once the ball leaves your hand. Your non dominant hand should be down by your side

Know how many shots you get. If it is a one on one foul, you will be given only one shot. Always be alert and prepared. Although the chance may be slight that the ball will come your way, be ready to catch it when it does.

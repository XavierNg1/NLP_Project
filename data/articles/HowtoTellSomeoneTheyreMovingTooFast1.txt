 You might feel nervous or apprehensive about having this conversation with your partner, so choose a time and place that will make you most comfortable. Consider meeting your partner for coffee or lunch at a place where you will have enough privacy to talk.


Try and avoid having the conversation in a place that is very intimate, like your home or your favorite romantic spot. Choosing a place that is comfortable but not too intimate can help the conversation feel less awkward.;
, Being open with your partner is crucial in establishing a strong foundation in a relationship. Clearly communicate to your partner how you are feeling about the current pacing in your relationship. Besides, if you are woman, you might be doing yourself a favor; women tend to have a better view of their relationship quality the longer sex is delayed while dating.You could tell a partner who seems unhappy about your decision, "I really like you, but we're moving too fast for me." Say, "Doing things like the things you're pressuring me to do is a big commitment for me, so I need more time.”

, Your partner might not share your perspective and think the relationship is progressing just fine. On the other hand, he or she might accept and be respectful towards your feelings. Either way, you need to be prepared to respond appropriately.


If your partner says things like, "If you really care about me, you'd have sex with me," you could respond with, "I do care about you. That's why I don't want either of us to get hurt by rushing things," or "If you love and care about me, I need for you to show me that you do by being understanding and respectful of my feelings.”
An empathetic partner might say, “I really messed up by trying to move things along faster than you are comfortable with.” You could offer a response such as, “I know that you care for me and naturally want to be intimate to express how you feel. I want the same thing. I just need more time.”

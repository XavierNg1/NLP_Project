 Obtain a large pot and fill it Â¾ of the way with water. Put the pot on the stove and bring it to a boil. Once the water is at a rolling boil, the jeans are ready to be put into the water., When the pot of water starts boiling, turn off the flame on the stove and add your jeans into the boiling water. Use a kitchen utensil safe for dipping into boiling water (such as a wooden spoon) to dunk the jeans into the water. Let the jeans sit in the hot water until the water cools. This may take approximately half an hour.When the jeans are ready to be taken out of the water, pour the water into the sink and take the jeans out from the pot.
 Place your wet jeans into the drying machine, and change the settings so the dryer dries the jeans on the highest heat setting.Let the jeans dry for one complete cycle.


After the jeans are finished drying in the dryer, take them out and try them on. If you still want you jeans to shrink down more, repeat this process.

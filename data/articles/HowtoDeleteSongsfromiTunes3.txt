 The only way to restore your hidden purchases is to use iTunes on a computer.
 You'll need to be signed in with the account that you purchased the music with in order to find your hidden purchases.
 You'll be prompted for your Apple ID password again.


If you don't see the menu bar in Windows, press Alt.
 You may have to scroll to find it.
 This will display all of the purchases you have hidden from your library.
 You'll see this button underneath each album that you've hidden. You can click the "Unhide All" button in the lower-right corner to unhide all hidden songs at once.
 The songs you've unhidden will appear back in your iTunes music library.

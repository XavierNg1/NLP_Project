 Over time your scars will fade, but if you want to speed up the process by softening them, you can use medical treatments to improve the appearance of the scars. Dermabrasion works by removing the top layers of skin with an electrical machine that abrades the skin. The skin then heals from the procedure, appearing smoother and less noticeable. Dermabrasion should be performed by a dermatologist in a medical setting.Chemical peels are another option to reduce the appearance of facial scars. During this procedure, the top layer of skin is removed with a chemical application, allowing the skin to regenerate and the scars to appear less prominent.
 These two procedures can be effective on fine or deep scars due to acne or surgery. However, they should always be done by a certified dermatologist.Laser resurfacing is done by using high-energy light to burn away damaged, scarred skin.
Punch grafts are small skin grafts that can be used to replace damaged or scarred skin. During this procedure, the dermatologist punches a hole in your skin to remove the scar. The hole is then replaced with unscarred skin, often from the back of your earlobe.
 Collagen is used by dermatologists to treat wrinkles, facial lines, and scars. For facial scarring, your dermatologist might use purified bovine(cow) collagen, which can replace the natural collagen that has been lost in the scars.As well, some cortisone-like injections have been known to soften and shrink hard scars on the body, including the face.

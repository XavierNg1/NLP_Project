 A menorah does not have to be ornate, or even in the traditional candelabra shape. You don't even need to glue the nine light holders into one object. All you need to know are these basic rules:


The eight main lights should be in a straight line, all at the same height or along a steady diagonal line.
The ninth helper light (shamash) should be easily identified. It's usually placed in the center or end of the row, but higher or lower than the rest. If it's the same height as the others, offset it so it's not in the same row.
Ideally, set up the menorah near a window so passersby can see it.;
, Nine small plant pots make a simple but beautiful display, even if you're craft-challenged. Make sure the pots are wide enough to catch any drips from the candles.


Bury small candle holders just underneath the sand for stability, so the openings are at the surface.
 Pick eight narrow-neck bottles of the same height, plus a ninth at a different height. Tear off the labels and wash off the label residue with soap and water. You can now fit candles into the necks, or fill the bottles partway with water, float olive oil on the top, and hang a cotton wick from the neck to the olive oil.


If you use candles, place a non-flammable plate underneath to catch the drips.
 The light should last at least 30 minutes before it burns down. You'll need 44 lights to last the eight days of Hanukkah, but keep a few extra around just in case. The most common option is Hanukkah candles, which should last well over 30 minutes.


To represent the original miracle more closely, you may use glass cups of flammable oil instead, ideally olive oil. See the Tips section below for instructions on making your own wick.
On the last day, the candles are lit before sundown. Many people use larger candles to make sure they keep burning until the Shabbat.

 Search up on emo hair. Find a picture you like. Ask for an opinion from a friend or even people on the internet (use Yahoo Answers). Print off the hairstyle and approve it with your parent/guardian. Show it to your hairdresser. If you don't want it as long as in the picture...or you want the bangs to the left instead of the right or something, make sure you specify that.;
, The basic emo haircut is just long hair cut in layers that are long on the bottom, and as you go up, shorter. Of course, this is optional, like all others, but you need at least a few of these to have emo hair. A traditional hairdresser may strongly advise you to go for less layers because it will become more "poofy" but that's kind of the point.
 It's supposed to 'hide your tears', but most just think it looks cool. Its also a great place to dye your hair.
, It doesn't really make a big difference. Shorter at the back and help get the traditional heart shape and longer at the back is better for sorter overall length.
 Possible colors include black, black with blonde, or black with anything neon (red is the main color). If you aren't allowed to dye, then just pick up some hair pieces from Hot Topic and slap 'em in!

, Remember, you are paying them, not the opposite. Make sure you get what you want.

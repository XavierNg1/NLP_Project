 YouTube is one of the best, most enjoyable ways to spread the word about you. Ask your parent or guardian if it is okay with you having an account before you create it; they'll need to confirm this for you.
 This will give your channel an identity. Record new updates and find things that are interesting on AJ, such as a new party. Record a video of it, then publish and repeat with other videos, such as tutorials.
 Do this once you have a few fans (around 20 to 50). Mailtime is where people send you gifts and you open them up on a YouTube video, as well as give shoutouts to those who sent you gifts. Send gifts back to good gifts, but give autographs or thank you jam a grams back to other gifts. Do not keep all the good gifts you get - people will consider you as greedy if you do not giveaway a lot of your spikes or rares.
 Be active and interesting - just talking while staring at a screen will not get you any fans. Talk about the new gift cards, new parties, upcoming events, drama, who-hacked-who, and other things like that. Keep it interesting, and don't keep it on one screen at a time.
 By now you should have a lot of fans. Do mailtime and updates as often as you can. Host lots of giveaways. Stream whenever possible if you have the time, such as once a week or once every few days. When you have a lot of fans, it can get overwhelming.

 Although there are risks associated with the procedure, such as a mildly heightened risk of developing a future skin cancer (due to increased UV exposure), for many people the benefits and the improvement of their condition exceed the associated risks.
 This optimally prepares your skin to receive the most benefit from UV therapy.
 This, in turn, increases the effectiveness of treatment.


Your doctor may also offer your UV-sensitizing medications prior to receiving UV therapy.
However, the use of these medications may increase your risk of burning your skin.
It is best to follow your doctor's advice, as they will be able to give you the best recommendation.
 Note that, for some, UV therapy can be inconvenient to attend and/or expensive. Look into whether you have any coverage for UV therapy under your health plan.


Alternatively, you can consider gaining actual sun exposure (within safe limits), or trying a home light treatment or a tanning bed.
Ask your doctor for recommendations that they feel will be most beneficial to your skin, while also minimizing the risk that comes with excess UV exposure.

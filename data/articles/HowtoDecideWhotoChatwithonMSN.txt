 Usually the screen name can tell you a lot about the person. Avoid names with offensive words in.;
, See if any of your existing friends know the person and ask what they think of them.
 Lets say their email address was Unknown@example.com. Type this address into a search engine and websites that they are signed up to will come up. This will give you information into their interests and (if forums come up in the search) know how they speak and what they are like.
 Don't take too long on this. This will be the main deciding point, if you don't speak to them your self you will never truly know what they are like.

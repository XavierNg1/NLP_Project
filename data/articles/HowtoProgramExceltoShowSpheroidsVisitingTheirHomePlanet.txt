But if 80% of Normal is the New Goal, say for a Personal Fitness Program, then a little math is required.  ShrinkExpand2 = 1/.80, or 1.25 would be the new input. This is because it was thought the natural trend would be to want to shrink by say a factor of 2, so 2 = 1/.50 and the New Goal is to be 50% of Normal, or shrink by a factor of 2 (as a divisor).

Select cell C6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it "Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))". Expand the comment frame if need be. This formula and the next one form the ring the Spheroids occupy, By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows above the cell it's in, C6, the formula is taking the cosine of 0, which = 1.
MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and with D6 the active high-lighted cell input "=Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell D6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it "Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1)). By taking the sine of the cell 6 rows above the cell we're in, C6, the formula is taking the sine of 0, which = 0. Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell would be {1,0} if nothing else were affecting them. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counterclockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, the factor = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.

This is then multiplied by the Lookup Table SpreadLooker, which either randomizes the data or accepts inputs per the Goal Lookup worksheet. Lastly, it is subject to ShrinkExpand, a variable for normalizing or growing or shrinking its chart relative to the Standard or Goal chart data series of Second X and Second Y."

Go check the DATA worksheet and see that all the errors have vanished. If not, see Tips or Errors below please.


Activate Data worksheet and Edit Go To under Main X and Main Y cell range E6:F2886. Either do Chart Wizard or select Chart on the Ribbon (activated in Preferences) and select All, Scattered, Smoothed Line Scattered. If using Chart Wizard, a new Chart worksheet will be created. Otherwise, copy or cut and paste the chart into the upper left corner of the Chart worksheet you created at the beginning, and hover the mouse over the lower right corner until it becomes a double-headed arrow and then use it to pull the chart into an expansion of a large Square. Format Selection Glow yellow transparency 25% and Line Weight 1 and Bright Blue from the color table. This is the chaotic planet surface.
On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under Second X and Second Y cell range H6:I2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E instead of column H. Click on the second standard ring series, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,Data!$I$6:$I$2886,2). Edit the line of Series 2 to be dashed and 1 point line weight and Foresty Green to Lawn Green to Leafy Green in hue. It's a yellowish-green, not a blue-green with a very light yellow very transparent glow. This is the external planet ring.
The first series, after clicking on it, should read as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$F$6:$F$2886,1). Any other series which Excel creates should be deleted by clicking on it and deleting it from the Formula Bar.
DELETED: Edit Series 1 ( the one with the last digit = to 1 in the series formula, and the one randomized or input by you or spirallic) by double-clicking on it for line weight = .25, glow = canary yellow size 8 point 25% transparent, if you want to start off resembling mine.
On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under RoseX and Rose Y cell range J6:K2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E or something instead of column J and K. Click on this next/center series3, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$J$6:$J$2886,Data!$K$6:$K$2886,3). Edit the line of Series 3 to be 1 point line weight and very light pink to light maroon in hue. It's a very light orange very transparent glow. This is the central heart of the planet and it's a charming radial rose.

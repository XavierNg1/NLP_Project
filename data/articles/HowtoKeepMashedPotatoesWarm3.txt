 For this technique you will need a large saucepan, a heat-safe bowl, and finished potatoes. This method wonâ€™t keep the potatoes warm for as long as the slow cooker.
 Fill your pan about a quarter way full with water. Bring the water to a simmer and then lower the temperature to low., Transfer your cooked mashed potatoes into a heat-safe bowl. Then place the bowl over the pan.
 Place a lid or use a layer of aluminum foil over the bowl of mashed potatoes. Make sure the heat setting is on low.
 With this technique you can keep the mashed potatoes warm for up to two hours. You can only keep them intact by stirring them every twenty minutes. Pay attention as they are on the stove for signs of drying. You will see this if your potatoes become crusted or even discolored., Remove the bowl from the simmering pan at the time they're needed. They'll arrive at the table steaming hot and in fluffy condition after a good whisk with your fork.

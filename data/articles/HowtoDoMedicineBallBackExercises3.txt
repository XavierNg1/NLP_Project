 You will need a mat or another comfortable area to perform this exercise. This advanced exercise requires both a medicine ball and a dumbbell. Do not attempt this exercise unless you consider yourself to be advanced.


Give yourself enough space to stretch out.
The dumbbell should not be too heavy. Always start with a lighter weight and work your way up to something heavier.
 To do this, start in a normal plank position. Next, spread your feet double shoulder width apart while placing one hand on the medicine ball. Hold the dumbbell with your free hand.To execute a basic plank position, get into pushup position on the floor. Bend your elbows so that they are at a 90 degree angle and rest your weight is on your forearms., Keeping your back straight and your core tight, bring the dumbbell to your chest while maintaining the three point plank position. Make sure to keep breathing throughout.
 You’ll want to make sure your core is still tight. This will help you to keep your balance and to work your ab muscles as well.
 You’ll want to switch the dumbbell to your other hand and repeat eight to 10 times on your other side as well. This advanced exercise will work your upper back muscles.

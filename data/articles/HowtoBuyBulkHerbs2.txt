 When buying dried herbs in bulk, look for colors that are very close to the natural color of the herb when it's fresh. Most dried herbs should be green to bright green. Bulk blossoms should be deep in color.
 Smell bulk herbs by taking a small amount from the bin. Fresh herbs should have a strong aroma. Herbs that have a weak smell to no smell are most likely old.

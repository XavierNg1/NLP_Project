 Conditioning bleached hair is the most important thing you can do to restore softness. A leave-in conditioner is an important addition to your routine.

Look for products that contain ceramides. Ceramides are an important, natural lipid that are stripped from the hair during the bleaching process. Color treated hair absorbs and retains these oils better than natural hair, because it’s replenishing what your hair is missing., Straighteners and curling irons are hard on healthy hair. Do not use on bleached hair if possible., If you must use hot styling tools, use hair products that protect against damage caused by high temperatures.There are heat protecting sprays, mists, creams and gels. Find what works best for you based on how you style your hair and what’s in your price range.

 Chorale melodies were sung by a congregation in Lutheran churches in parts of Germany. The melodies are recognisable, and are divided into phrases, which are identified by pause marks. These marks indicate where you should put your cadences.;
, Find the key of the piece and other parts to distinguish possible points of modulation (you will want to modulate at least 2-3 in your chorale)

, This will normally be a perfect authentic cadence (V-I with both chords in root position), though one shouldn't rule out the possibility of plagal (IV-I) cadences though this is extremely rare.
 Each chord must contain the root (which is often doubled), the third and the fifth.
 They should fit into the chorale melody, and have logical chord progressions. Most chorales have similar cadential progressions. The best progressions could include a cycle of fifths (vi-ii7b-V7-I), or a cadential 6-4 ((ii7b)-Ic-V7-I).
 Remember that these must all be prepared and resolved. (Although a 7th does not have to be prepared it it falls on the second quaver of a beat.) Also add in any passing notes, anticipation notes and echappe notes that you can. These add more style and sophistication to the chorale.
 Bach occasionally used parallel 5ths or octaves, but they are rare and hidden with the skill of an expert. Also, check that the Alto part does not go higher than the Soprano part in any chords, and same with Tenor and Alto and Bass and Tenor.
 If there are any chords that sound dissonant or wrong then rework them. This may affect other chords near it so double check for fifths or octaves again.

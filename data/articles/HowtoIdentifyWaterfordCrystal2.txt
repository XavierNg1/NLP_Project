 If your crystal is older or from a limited run, check for a gold sticker featuring Waterford’s green seahorse emblem.Be aware that stickers may have been removed over time, whether intentionally or not., Search online for images of authentic Waterford stickers to verify that the design matches your own. If possible, visit a retailer or collector in possession of Waterford pieces featuring stickers to compare them in person. If you’re in doubt, seek an appraiser to judge your piece’s authenticity.
 Remember that a sticker may be transferred from a genuine Waterford to another piece.Although older pieces may not have had one to begin with, check the crystal anyway for an acid stamp for further verification. If there isn’t one, have the crystal examined by an expert to confirm that it’s a true Waterford.

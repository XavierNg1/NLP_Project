 Practice making others feel valued and respected by “holding a light”. This means giving love, support and prayers to anyone that is sick, struggling spiritually or adjusting to major life changes such as the loss of a loved one, a new move or a new career venture. Be patient with others. Always be truthful, and refrain from judgment.
 Dress and wear clothing that is comfortable, but above all is simple. Steer clear of wearing fancy clothing or flashy jewelry. Be sure not to wear too much make-up, as to look unnatural or disingenuous. Be authentic with the way you look. Opt to wear business casual clothing, at best, when attending Quaker meetings and worship services.
 Seek approval from God in your daily decision-making. Focus on living a life that God and the Quaker community would be pleased with. Pray and meditate before making a life-altering decision, such as when to get married, or whether or not to change careers or relocate. Keep the community up-to-speed with both your personal desires and struggles, as well as anything you feel God has shared with you.

 Rinse the beans first using cool water. Pat them dry, then trim or snap off both of the pointed ends.
 The beans should lie completely below the lip of the bowl. You can also use a casserole dish instead.
 You don't really need much more than that to produce good steam. Green beans already have a lot of water in them, and will produce more water on their own.


For a richer flavor, add some salt or minced garlic. You will only need one to three cloves, depending on how many beans you are steaming.
 If you don't have one, cover the bowl with some plastic wrap instead.
 Once the time is up, take one of the beans out and see if it is done. It should be bright green and somewhat crunchy. If the bean is still raw, cook the rest of the beans at 30 second increments until they are done.
 Carefully take off the lid or plastic wrap. Be careful for any bursts of steam.
 The beans will keep cooking even after you have finished steaming them. This can lead to a dull color and mushy texture. To prevent this, fill a large bowl with cold water and add a some ice cubes. Put the beans into the icy water, and take them out after a few seconds. This is known as "shocking."


Try placing the beans into a strainer first. This way, all you have to do is dip the strainer into the water, then take it out.
 Place the green beans back into their microwavable bowl, and add your desired seasoning. Stir everything together, then transfer the beans to a serving bowl. If you are using butter, you may have to microwave the beans for a few seconds to help the butter melt. Here are some seasoning ideas to get you started:


Try salt and butter for a classic flavor. For a stronger flavor, use garlic salt instead of regular salt.
If you'd like something more mellow, try sea salt, dill, and some butter.
For a hint of spice, try salt, freshly-ground black pepper, and some butter.

 You can find some of those commands by right-clicking a playlist. The rest are contained in the File menu.
 Exporting your playlist creates a text listing of all the songs in the playlist, rather than a backup of the songs themselves. Think of exporting playlists like taking inventory of your kitchen pantry: you're writing down what you have in the pantry, not moving the actual items.


Remember where you saved your exported playlist. You'll need the file if/when you decide to restore the playlist.
 Point iTunes to the location of the exported playlist. Select the playlist, then click Open or press the Enter key.


iTunes restores your playlist exactly as it was when you created the backup copy. If songs on the playlist are no longer stored on your computer, you'll need to download them again in order for them to play.

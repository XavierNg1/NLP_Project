 Follow your parent around during their daily routine to see what problems come up. You may also choose to hire an occupational therapist to visit the house and suggest possible aides for installation.


Install ramps for your parent outside the home, if he or she is confined to a wheelchair. Make sure the rooms and hallways are wide enough to move around in while in a wheelchair.
Create a safer bathroom. Install a walk-in shower if your parent has mobility issues. Place a seat inside the shower to remove the risk of falling. Install grab bars along the walls and shower to reduce the risk of falling. You can install an elevated toilet seat with bars to make using the toilet easier.
Install safety devices in the home. Buy carbon monoxide and smoke detectors, if they are not installed already. A disabled parent may not be able to call in case of emergency, so these devices can alert neighbors or caregivers.
 Buy your parent a cell phone that is easy to use and buy a membership in a medical alert company. Some companies, such as QuietCare, can call you if something is out of the ordinary by employing motion sensors.

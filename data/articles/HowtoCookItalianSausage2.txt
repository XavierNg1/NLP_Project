 Line a shallow baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.
 Line them up side by side, leaving space in between each link. Space the links apart as evenly as possible.
 Place the baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven to ensure even cooking. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.


Note that thicker sausages may need to bake longer. Extremely large or thick links may need to be baked anywhere from 40 to 60 minutes. If cooking them this long, however, you should turn the sausages at least once.
 The tops of the Italian sausage links should be lightly browned, but not charred.

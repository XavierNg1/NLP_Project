 This is in order for the original image to be safe. If you are using windows, the shortcut command is Ctrl+J. For Mac users, the shortcut is Command+J. The default name that Photoshop will give to the duplicate image is “Layer 1.”;
, Select “Render.” Select “Lighting Effects.” You will notice that a box for Lighting Effects will appear containing an area for preview on the left portion and some other settings on the right portion.
 The next step is to choose a style by selecting “Style” on the options tab and then selecting “Flashlight.” The image on left of the preview pane will show a soft spot of light similar to what you see when you shine a flashlight to an image in a dark room.
 Change the position of the light source by dragging it to wherever you want it on the photo. This can be done by clicking on the small circle in the middle of the light and then dragging it to wherever you would like the light source to be. You can also do additional enhancements here such as resizing the light by simply manoeuvring the edges of the light source.
 If you need more light source you can do so by simply copying the original image and then repositioning the same to where you want it to be, assuming you still would like to select “Flashlight” as the light source.

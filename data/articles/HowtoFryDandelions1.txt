 Expect dandelions to cause heavy staining when handled, which may be difficult to wash out. Wear an apron and/or clothes that you don’t mind turning yellow. Avoid placing them directly on your countertops if they stain easily. Have paper towels or another protective covering on hand in case you need them., Place them in an appropriately sized bowl. Fill the bowl with lukewarm water, then add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of salt. Let them sit for approximately 10 minutes. Then rinse them off under running water. Let them air-dry or, to speed things up, spin them in a salad spinner.Unrinsed blossoms may contain traces of dirt, chemicals, or even insects.
 First, place your dandelions on a cutting board. Slice off each stem. Once you do, use your fingers to gently remove the sepals (the dark green leaves on the back of each blossom). If you’ve never prepped dandelions before, keep in mind that:Any part that’s colored dark green will retain a bitter flavor, so it’s best to get rid of as much of this as possible.
Dandelions can be pretty delicate and fall apart quite easily when removing stems and sepals. You may want to prep more than the recipe calls for until you get the knack for it.

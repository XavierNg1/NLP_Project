 For best results, break compacted soil up into a loose, even texture that holds moisture well but drains easily.If you have a large area to cover, buy or rent a soil tiller to break up the soil. If you have a small area to cover, use a garden rake or hoe instead.


As you till, break up large clumps of dirt so that the soil is fine and even.
Remove rocks, sticks, and other debris from the lawn.
If you're adding seeds to a lawn with bare patches, use a tiller or garden rake to break up the soil. Mow the rest of the lawn as short as possible.
Don't wait too long between raking and planting. If the churned up soil hardens into a crusty or lumpy texture, you may need to rake it again., If there are spots in your yard where water pools when it rains, they need to be leveled out. Seed planted there won't survive long. Level the ground by adding topsoil to low areas. Run the tiller over the area to even it out and blend it with the surrounding soil.
 Grass grows significantly better in fertilized soil. Buy a fertilizer specifically made for newly planted grass.

 Outdated or incorrectly installed printer drivers can reduce the print quality of an inkjet printer.


Visit the manufacturer's website for information on downloading and installing the latest firmware and driver updates available for the device.
 A printer's RAM has an impact on the print quality of an inkjet printer. Many inkjet printers are manufactured with on-board memory, which can be expanded.


Consult the user manual or contact customer support to determine if the inkjet printer's memory capacity can be increased to further improve the quality of an inkjet printer.

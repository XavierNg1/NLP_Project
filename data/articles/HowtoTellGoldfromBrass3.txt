 One of the most revered properties of gold is that it does not tarnish. On the other hand, brass reacts with oxygen in the environment. This reaction is called oxidation and it will cause the brass to look tarnished and discolored. If there are any oxidized areas, the piece is brass. However, the absence of oxidation cannot confirm that the piece is gold., When testing the chemical properties of a piece of metal, you should do so in an area that is not typically visible. This will ensure that the piece isnâ€™t ruined by doing the test. Look for a lip or rim with an underside, or a piece of the metal that is otherwise covered or concealed., Apply concentrated acid to the metal. Brass will react with acids and gold will not. If you see bubbling or discoloration where the acid is applied, your piece is brass. If there is no change after applying the acid, you have gold.

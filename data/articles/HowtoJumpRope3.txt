 This rope should be long enough to easily go over the head of the jumper or jumpers while the turners stand a comfortable distance apart.
 Face one of them and place the rope to the right or left of your feet. Have them throw the rope over your head, and jump when it reaches your other side. Get the rhythm of this jumping pattern before moving on.
 It takes some timing, but it can be done. Once you're comfortable running into the rope, you can practice jumping while looking between the turners instead of at them.









One or two other jumpers can join you as you run into the rope, but you should approach the rope one by one. Once one person finds a rhythm, the next person should jump in.
 For double dutch jumping, the two turners have a rope in each hand. The turners should turn one rope, and then turn the other in the opposite direction when the first rope is halfway through its arc.









Once the ropes start moving, you should jump over each rope while still facing the turners. Remember that you'll have to jump twice as fast as you would with one rope, because you'll have to jump over two ropes in each jump cycle.
Double dutch is more challenging and more fun if there is more than one jumper.
You can even sing songs to count how many times the jumpers have jumped. One popular song begins, "Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish?" After those words, you can start counting, "one, two, three..." to mark how many times the person or people jumping have successfully jumped.

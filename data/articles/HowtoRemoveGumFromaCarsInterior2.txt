 Before applying adhesive remover to your carpet or upholstery, you will need to test it on the cloth to ensure it won’t damage or discolor it. Pour a bit of Goo Gone or similar adhesive remover onto a rag. It doesn’t need to be much.A small dab will suffice for testing the effect the adhesive remover has on the cloth.
Do not spray the adhesive remover directly onto your carpet or upholstery.
 Find a spot that is not easily visible and rub the adhesive remover into the carpet or upholstery with the rag. Use a dry rag after to wipe it away and allow it to dry completely.Wait a few minutes for it to dry then look for signs of damage to the carpet or upholstery.
It’s important to let it dry to ensure it does not discolor the material.
 If the adhesive remover does not damage the material you tested it on, pour more of it onto the rag. Depending on the amount of gum and the size of the area, you may need to use quite a bit more adhesive remover.Don’t pour so much adhesive remover onto the rag that is saturates it, as it can cause irritation to your skin.
Be extremely careful not to get any adhesive remover in your eyes.
 Use the rag and adhesive remover to scrub the gum. The adhesive remover will cause it to break up, trapping some of the gum in the rag and possibly creating small bits of gum that have come apart. These bits should be vacuumed up quickly.Once the adhesive remover dries, those small bits of gum will be difficult to remove, so act quickly.
The gum itself should come apart, so try to pinch it with the rag to remove it from the seat or carpet.
 Once all of the gum has been removed, use an upholstery or carpet cleaner of your choice to wash the adhesive remover and gum residue off the area the gum used to be.If you don’t clean the area, a dark stain may persist where the gum was stuck.

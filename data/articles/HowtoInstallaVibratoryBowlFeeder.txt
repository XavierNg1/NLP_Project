 Ensure that the rubber is snug with the screws. However, the screws should not distort the rubber.
 Depending on the base unit, there are three ways to mount the bowl feeder â€“ top, center, or bottom mounting. Generally, center mounting is the most common method. Use between 3 and 8 fasteners provided for the bowl for installation., It is extremely important that the vibrations do not get transmitted through the components. Otherwise, the bowl feeder and the electrical controls will not function properly., Keep a small gap between the discharge and the mating tracks. This is to ensure that there is no restriction to the base unit and the movement of the bowl., For units without the cords, connect the bowl feeder to the base unit via a small hole in the base casting., However, it is always better check this before you begin operations. Ensure that there is a gap between the armature and the coil. Always ensure that the two components never touch each other, especially when the base unit is operating at maximum feed rate., Check that all of them are at an angle. Spring spacers are found between each spring pair. Check that they are present both above and beneath the springs. Align the spacers and the pads with each other. Place and tighten all the spring screws., This also causes the springs to flex. The top springs begin to rotate as they move downwards. The parts are oriented as they go through controlled obstacles and up the tracks. Parts placed inside the bowl will rotate around the inside floor of the bowl, go onto the track and discharge from the bowl.

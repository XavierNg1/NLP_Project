 Ask your trainer to set up cavallettis, or small, slightly raised rails. Trot over the cavallettis. Your horse will have to stretch the length of his stride to make it over. This challenge can help improve a horse’s rhythm. You can also go over the cavallettis at the canter.These do not have to relate to how much you jump or show; it's also good practice to make your horse pay attention to his feet and move with a bigger stride. If you don't want to use cavallettis, you can also put poles on the ground.
 Transition from walk to trot, trot to walk, trot to canter, canter to trot, walk to canter, and canter to walk. Make these transitions crisp and clear. Your horse will have to think constantly about what you want and will be more responsive to your aids. The horse won’t become dull and desensitized to your ride. He will instead be waiting for the next thing you ask for., Speed is not the only indication that your horse is moving well and not lazily. Impulsion, or the horse’s movement from the hind legs, rather than from the front legs, depends on the horse moving from behind. Impulsion is, essentially, how well your horse moves and how much energy his stride has.


To get impulsion, you need to establish light contact with the horse’s mouth, keeping your hands above the withers.
Urge your horse’s hindquarters to come under his body by squeezing with your legs and maintaining contact. Let his head drop forward, more into your contact.

, Any cordless drill will do but the ones with adjustable gears are probably the best. You need 4 of them plus a few more as spares., Then remove the radiator and all the ancillaries., You now have an empty engine bay., Draw the shape of the gearbox (including where the bolts go) on the cardboard. Put this on some thick metal and draw the gearbox shape on it., Take apart an old differential and get 4 small gears and 1 larger gear. These gears will come in on the next step., Fit the smaller gears on the end of the connectors for the drills and fit the larger gear so the small ones engage it. Weld a small case around it but make sure the bigger gear is sticking out at the end with a triangular shape on it., Once you know that, bolt it on and fit the drills., The next step is the hard bit., Now solder them to one complete wire and solder that to the start position of the key barrel., of if you want leave the pedals and disconnect everything from them except the brake of course.

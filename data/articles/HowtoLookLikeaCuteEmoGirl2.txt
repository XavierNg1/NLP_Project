 Think 90’s grunge. Shopping at thrift stores is a great place to find some cute clothing. Fit doesn’t matter, but it’s a great way to spice up an outfit. Find an old rock band tee shirt and make it into a crop top or cut slits in the back of it.
 Skinny jeans should be a staple in your wardrobe. Find some in a dark, dull color to help make your outfit cute. Dark green, maroon, or dark gray are all good options., This is a classic and a great way to add flair to your outfit. You can wear it as-is or add buttons to it to make it look cute.
 As a cute emo, the standard black skinnies with a tee won’t make enough of a statement. Find a dress or skirt and match it with some leg warmers and converse shoes. Make sure the dress is vintage to keep it within the emo style. Or throw on a rock band t-shirt with your skirt. Make the leg warmers your attention piece by wearing colored ones. Remember, black is a popular color but not the only color. For example, emo style typically involves less black than Gothic style. Don’t be afraid to use color to spice up your outfit and show off your cute character.

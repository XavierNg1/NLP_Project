 Presses are simple devices made with wood, cardboard, paper, and either metal screws, heavy weights, or straps that buckle. The idea is to dry the leaf under pressure. They are available for purchase at craft and hobby stores, on-line, or you can make your own.


To make your own press, follow this process:

Buy two pieces of plywood that are 9" x 12," and about ½ " (2.5 cm) thick; or any size that works for you. Stores that sell lumber usually will cut this for you.
Drill holes for bolts in each corner of both pieces of wood. It’s best to measure the placement of your holes to ensure they will line up no matter which way you put it together.
Place bolts through the four holes in one piece of wood, with washers between the bolt and the wood.


Cut clean cardboard and paper to the size of the press. These should be clean, so replace them when needed. Recycle cardboard boxes to cut your own to size. If the press is not square, cut your cardboard so the channels run in the direction of the shorter side for better air circulation.
 For each layer in the press, you will need two pieces of cardboard and several sheets of absorbent paper cut to size.


Put the bottom wood on your work surface. Place a piece of cardboard on it, followed by paper, then the leaves, another sheet of paper, and finally a piece of cardboard.
Repeat as many times as you’d like. It’s fine to let the leaves overlap unless there’s really prominent veining. Don’t let stems lie on top of leaves as this will make ugly lines in the dry leaf.
 Check the leaves after a couple of weeks. Place your hand on the top paper in a layer… if it feels cool, the leaves are not yet dry. Put them back in the press to finish drying. There’s no need to change the paper when pressing leaves.

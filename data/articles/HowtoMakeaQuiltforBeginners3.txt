 Grab the arrangement of fabrics you have placed on the floor and put each row into a pile, going left to right. You may want to grab a piece of tape or somehow indicate which row is which.


Take the square you have on top and lay it pretty side up. Then, pick up your second square and lay it face down on top of your first square. Pin the right sides together.
With your machine, sew the squares together with a ¼” (.6 cm) seam allowance. You'll probably want to line up the edge of the material with your presser-foot. Adjust the needle if need be. Know that a scant ¼” is better than a wide ¼”.
Now open up that pair, pretty sides facing you. Grab your third square and pin it facing square 2. Sew a ¼” seam just like you just did. Repeat for the rest of the row and the consecutive rows after -- but don't sew the rows together yet!

, This may seam tedious and unnecessary, but you'll be glad you did it later. And, yes, there’s a difference between pressing and ironing: pressing is a little more gentle. And if you sew some steam, things will turn out even crisper. Be sure to press your seams to one side – not open.


Press the seams one way for the even rows and press the seams the other for the odd rows. Continue to do that for each row that follows.
Once you have your two rows, match up the seams. Do the pressed seams directly touch? Great. Now pin the seams so the squares match up, too.
 Now that you have all the seams lined up, it'll be super easy to sew the rows. Follow the lines you have just created and get back to your machine.


If it's not perfect, don't fret. This is a skill that is required over time. But the patchwork-ness of your quilt should help disguise any imperfections.

 If you already enjoy thrifting, you'll know where to shop.;
, You can also look on Etsy, eBay, and Amazon but your local sites will be the best indicator as to what prices are like. Decide what you'll be on the look out for and pick your specialty.
 Start shopping on a day when you're not rushed and have the time to browse.
 There's no use in getting your heart set on something only to discover that its about to break.Â When items are donated, they are generally checked for holes (in the case of clothes) or broken pieces (a wooden dresser) or it should be marked accordingly.
 For an example, this article uses finding a dresser. Are there any markings in the wood? Google the name. Do all the drawers move smoothly? To make an easy flip, the better shape its in, the less repair work you will have to do. What is the price? Are you able to make any money if you list it on your local Craigslist site? Consider the time you're going to put into it too - taking it home, storing it, possible meeting with potential buyers, delivery? Check for insect damage too; people won't buy furniture with borers inside.
 If you think you can make some money on it, buy it. Make sure you have the ability to get it home, such as a truck or SUV, if needed. If you need to pay to take it home, this decreases or even wipes out your profit margin.
 What did you look at when you just bought it? You looked in the drawers to see if they were clean. You checked the top surface for scratches. Take pictures of the item in your home vs. the one you took in the thrift store.
 Make sure you post it in the correct category and that you have a catchy headline. Post measurements if needed and keep your description simple and to the point.
 If someone asks 'how long you've had something' there's no need to make up a story that your grandma has had the dresser for the last 30 years. There's no shame in buying and reselling from thrift stores and you'd be surprised how many people do it!

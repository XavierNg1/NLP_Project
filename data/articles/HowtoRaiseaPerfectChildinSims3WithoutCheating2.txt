 The most common way is in a bed by having them both 'relax' and then clicking the other Sim and the 'try for baby' option. Make sure your sound is up so that you can listen for a jingle. If you hear a jingle, then your Sim is pregnant but she doesn't know it yet. The next day, depending what time you tried for baby, she will know she's pregnant and get the 'Pregnant!' moodlet., Read the two pregnancy books 'Totally Preggers: An expecting mother's tale,' and 'Baby Incoming: Preparing With Vigilance,' and seek medical advice at the hospital. It also helps to find a doctor (In Sunset Valley, go to Jamie Jolina) and ask for advice.The harder you try for a smooth pregnancy, the more likely it will be that you get to choose it's traits. Though it is not a guarantee, have the mother eat 3 watermelons to improve the chances of having a girl, and three apples to improve the chances of having a boy., It is also beneficial to give it traits like "Workaholic" or specific job traits like "Handy" or "Good Cook" to prepare for future careers. Bring it home and feed it play with it, snuggle it, and interact with it so you and your baby are best/good friends. Make sure the bar is all the way up on their relationship bar. Put him/her in the crib afterwards if he/she is tired. If not, keep interacting with him/her., If he/she is hungry feed him/her, and if she/he has a dirty diaper change him/her. Never hire a babysitter; they make things worse. For example, they often turn the stereo on while the baby is trying to sleep, or randomly take the baby out of the crib and put them back while ignoring the fact that they are hungry/their nappy is dirty. After all of this, you will have to pay the babysitter money for his/her poor care., You do not want to age up any child prematurely unless it is a baby --> toddler transition.

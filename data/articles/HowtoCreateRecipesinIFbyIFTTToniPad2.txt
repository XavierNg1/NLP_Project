 Locate the app on your iPad. The app icon has a blue background with the text “IF” on it. Tap on it.
 There are a lot of recipes available on IFTTT. These are created by users such as yourself. Most common triggers and actions are already available in existing recipes. You just have to look for them so you don’t have to create new ones yourself. Tap the magnifying glass button on the top right corner. You will be brought to the search screen. Enter your search parameters in the search box, then tap the “Search” button on your keyboard.
 All the recipes matching your search will be displayed. Swipe up and down to browse through them. When you see the recipe you want, tap on it.
 A window will pop up with the details of the recipe. The trigger channel and action channel will be shown, together with the description. Tap the “Add” button to add the recipe to your IFTTT account.
 You need to authorize both channels with your IFTTT account so that IFTTT can automate the actions. Tap the “Continue” buttons for both channels. If a channel requires your account info, you will be asked to log in to authorize or allow the connection.
 Once the connections have been authorized and established, you will get a notification on IFTTT that your recipe has been created. Tap the “Done” button to exit the window.

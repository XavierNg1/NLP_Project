, Put your cashews in a bowl or cup and cover them with water. Many people find it convenient to soak the cashews in the fridge overnight. This helps soften them so they are ready for processing later.


Some recipes recommend rinsing the cashews after soaking and discarding the water, but it is not necessary to rinse them.

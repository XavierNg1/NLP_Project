 Place 3 – 5 grams of dried elderberry flowers in one cup of boiling water. Allow the flowers to steep in the water for 10 – 15 minutes. Pour the mixture over a strainer to remove the flowers from the mixture.You can sweeten the tea with honey or add some spices such as cinnamon and cloves if you like.
If you do not have any dried elderberry, you can use 2 tablespoons of syrup to make the tea.If you do not want to make your own tea, you can purchase elderberry tea bags that you can steep in water.
 If you are sick, drink the tea three times a day. Start drinking the tea as soon as your symptoms start. Again, the strength of homemade tea is unknown, but it should be just as effective as the syrup. Your symptoms should go away faster.
Avoid drinking the tea for more than five days.
 If you do not want to drink a syrup or tea, you can take elderberry pills or lozenges. Read the package instructions before taking them. The pills and lozenges work best if you take them as soon as your symptoms start.Lozenges that contain 175 mg of elderberry extract can help reduce flu symptoms.The amount of elderberry extract will vary depending on the brand that you buy. Read the package to see how much elderberry extract your pills and lozenges actually contain, and make sure they have a USP or NSF seal of approval to confirm that the ingredients have been verified.

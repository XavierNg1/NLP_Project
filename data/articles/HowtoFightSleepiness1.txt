 One great way to fight sleepiness is to take a nap. These naps should be short - 5 to 25 minutes - and well before your bedtime. Try to nap 6-7 hours or longer from your bedtime.


If you can't take a nap, try closing your eyes and lying there while you rest for about 10 minutes.Try not to sleep too long. If you sleep more than 20-30 minutes, you won't get into a deep sleep or mess up your inner clock, both of which can make you feel groggy.;
, One of the main reasons you feel sleepy is because you don't get enough. You need to get 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Get on a sleep schedule so that your body can form a habit.
 Sleep during the hours of 10 p.m. - 2 a.m. The body relaxes the most during those hours.If you stay up too late, your body's natural sleep rhythms can get out of balance. Plus, going to bed late might not give you the 7-8 hours you need.
 One thing that can help you get proper sleep is to rid yourself of distractions in your room. This includes electronics such as cell phones, laptops, tablets, and televisions.You might be inclined to stay on the computer or cell phone too long, which cuts into your sleep time.


Cut off all TVs and radios. If you need to sleep with sound in the background, try soothing music, sleep sounds like rain or thunderstorms, or small water fountains.

 Line a small baking sheet with foil, and set 1 to 2 banana peppers on it. Set them under a preheated broiler, and allow them to roast for 10 to 15 until they become charred on the outside. Turn the peppers every 5 minutes to ensure that they’re roasted evenly on all sides.You can adjust the number of peppers to suit your tastes. If you don’t want your dip to be very spicy, stick to 1 pepper. If you prefer a spicier dip, use 2.
You can substitute any hot peppers that you like for the banana peppers. Jalapenos are a good option.
When you’re broiling the peppers, set the rack in the upper third of the oven so there is approximately 8- to 9-inches (20- to 23-cm) between the peppers and the broiling element.;
, When the peppers are finished roasting, transfer them to a bowl and cover them with a towel so they cool enough that you can handle them. Remove the skins, seeds, and stems, and use a sharp knife to finely chop them.When you’re handling hot peppers, particularly the seeds, it’s a good idea to wear rubber gloves. The oils in the peppers can irritate your skin and eyes.
 Add the chopped banana peppers, ⅓ pound (151 g) of feta cheese, ⅓ cup (95 g) of Greek yogurt, and 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of cider vinegar to the bowl of a food processor. Process the mixture until it has a thick, fairly smooth texture.Be sure to use plain Greek yogurt for the dip.
 Once you’ve processed the pepper mixture, slowly begin to pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil into the food processor while you pulse it. Continue to process the mixture until the oil is fully incorporated and the dip is smooth.You can add more or less of the oil to achieve your desired thickness for the dip.
 Transfer the dip to a bowl, and add salt and pepper to taste. Cover the dip with plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour before serving it.The dip pairs well with grilled pitas, crackers, and chopped vegetables.

 From the window that opens, you should be able to select Download Profile. If you can’t see this option, it means you are signed in with another profile. To sign out, press the X button.
 Enter your Microsoft account information. This is the email address that you used to sign up for Xbox LIVE, Hotmail, or other Windows services. After you enter your account, you will be asked for your password.


The Microsoft account used to be called your Windows Live ID. They are the same thing now.
If the account is a Child account, you will need the parent/guardian’s account information.
 The most common place to store profiles is on the hard drive. The Xbox will automatically put the profile in the correct directories.


Once you select the destination, the profile will begin downloading. This may take a while depending on the speed of the connection.
 By default, the password for the account you download will not be remembered, and will need to be reentered the next time the account tries to sign in. If you are the owner of the Xbox, or it belongs to a trusted friend, you can save the password to make signing in easier in the future.

 One common myth is that soaking a bandana or piece of cloth in certain liquids will make it "filter" or "neutralize" the chemicals in tear gas. This is not supported by scientific evidence.Below are a few such "tricks" that you should not count on:


Soaking a bandana in vinegar
Soaking a bandana in water
Soaking a bandana in citrus juice
Rubbing a wet bandana with crushed charcoal

, Wearing oil or cream-based lotions is a bad idea in a riot. These topical products can "catch" particles of tear gas, pepper spray, and other RCAs, holding them against the skin and making it difficult to rinse them off.If you need to "clean up", instead, use a simple soap-and-water rinse.
 Gear that is explicitly police or military surplus can offer lots of protection, but it's often a bad idea in a riot. For instance, if it's too convincing, it may trick rioters into thinking that you're actually part of the military or police, which, depending on the conditions, can be very unsafe. On the other hand, if the police at the riot are eager to attack or arrest rioters, this sort of gear can also call unnecessary attention to yourself by being perceived as aggressive or disrespectful.
 It should go without saying, but, to be clear, it's a bad idea to arm yourself before a protest. Having a weapon makes you a prime target for the police, even if you only intend to use it to defend yourself. In martial law situations, a weapon may even be reason enough for police to target you with deadly force. In short: bringing a weapon to a riot makes things much less safe for yourself and the people around you, so don't do it.

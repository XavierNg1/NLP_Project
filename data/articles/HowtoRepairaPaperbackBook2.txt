 On the torn page, identify if the tear has a single direction. If it doesn’t, you’ll want to repair only one direction of the tear at a time., Cut your archival tape a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) longer than the tear so the repair will be more stable.

You should be selective with what kind of tape you use. An archival document repair tape will be safest for your book., Center the tape over the tear so the tape will extend beyond the tear in both directions. Then place the tape along the tear and smooth it down with your hands or a stiff folder.If using a stiff folder, use the folder’s edge to smooth the tape down.

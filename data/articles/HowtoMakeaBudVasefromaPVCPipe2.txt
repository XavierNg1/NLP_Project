It's recommended that you test the positioning of the photos first by placing a small piece of tape on the photos and sticking them to the pipes. Perfect the arrangement before adding the photos permanently.
 The images should not be saturated; dip just enough to wet them.
 Make sure every inch is covered and coated.
 Then apply each dipped photo to the pipe.
 This will also help to stick image firmly.


Add more Mod Podge if you feel it is necessary. More Mod Podge can also add an extra layer of coating.
 Drying time will vary but can last up to a day depending on how it is stored (cool, dry conditions are best).

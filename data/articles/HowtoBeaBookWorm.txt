 The library is the heart of a true Bookworm's soul! Spend your leisure time visiting the library and pick up some books that you find interesting or have been acclaimed online, on the grapevine or in book reviews. If you don't like the sound of the book, it doesn't matter! You can always buy or borrow a different one.;
, Go take a seat and read the first couple pages. If you think it's the perfect book, check it out and go home.
 Ever heard the saying, "Never judge a book by its cover"? There are many online and retail book-stores, which hold mind-boggling selections of books. Scan through a couple, and buy ones you think are interesting.
 Sure, your friends might think this is pretty dumb, but if you love books, read them a lot without worrying about others' disapproval.


Bookworms not only collect books that they are going to read in the future, but also keep books they have already read by their beds. In order for the book you chose to be a book you can snuggle up with you have to check these things over. Is the book in my preferred genre / style? Is it too hard / easy? Do I like the first part of the chapter? After you check these things over and they're all answered positively you are now a bookworm with the book you've chosen (not that you should stop with just this book, of course).
 Try making or joining a book club. Did you know that there are many online book clubs to join for free and make new friends and acquaintances? Try Shelfari, a social bibliophile website.
 Say you read for half an hour in the morning, half in the afternoon, and half at night. Also read during your spare time.
 Start chapter books at about six or seven years of age.
 They'll keep you busy if the first book is good.

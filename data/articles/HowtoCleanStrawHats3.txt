 Straw hats can seem more durable than they actually are. However, wetness and dampness can misshape the hat. This means that when your hat gets wet, you should attempt to dry it as quickly as possible.Try to put water repellent on your hat every now and then. Not only will this keep your hat safe from water damage, but it will protect it from stains as well.


When you’re not wearing your hat, place it in a dark, dry area. Put a hat with a curved brim on a mannequin head to keep its shape. You can also simply the tilt the hat upside down and store it in a hat box.
Don’t let your hat get too hot! If your hat is exposed to direct sunlight for a long time, then the straw can be damaged. The heat will make the straw rigid or cause the synthetic material to melt.
 You want to make sure that your hands are clean before you touch your hat. This is an easy way to prevent your hat from getting dirt and oil on it. When you are taking off your hat, try to hold on to the brim. Too much contact with the crown of the hat can destroy the fibers.
 Sometimes the straws in your hat can become discolored. To refresh the colors, wipe your hat with cloth dipped in alcohol and water. After you do this, use a piece of black or red velvet to polish the hat.

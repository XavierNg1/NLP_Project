 The combination of gentle motion from your walking and the baby’s upright position should help them digest and release painful gas. You can also try gently rocking or bouncing your baby as you walk., If the weather is dry and mild, try putting your baby in their stroller and going for a walk outside. The fresh air might soothe both you and your baby. This will also give them access to the motion they may be craving.
 If you’re getting bored with your typical walk-and-rock, try mixing up your motions. Move slowly and mimic the motions the baby felt in the womb, including up and down, side to side, and forward and backward. You can hum, sing, or even put on some light music as you dance., You may choose to sit in a rocking chair while holding your baby yourself. If you want a break, invest in a product that allows you to place your baby in a gently-swinging chair. Some of these chairs even include light massage options.

If you use a swinging baby chair, be sure your baby is fully and securely strapped in.
 Driving slowly with your baby in the car may provide them with the precise motion they need to calm down and relax. Be careful not to overuse this method, however, as it can quickly become a waste of gas.Avoid driving when you’re overtired. This will only put you and your baby in danger.

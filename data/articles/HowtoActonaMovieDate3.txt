 Arrange a meeting place or a lift-share. This will help you get to the cinema on time!








, Being on a date might make you nervous or sweaty, so showering ahead of time is your first line of defense.
 Don't try too hard with your appearance, especially if this is your first date.
, At the very least, you should be able to cover the cost of your own ticket and snacks, but it’s better to bring too much than too little, especially in case you decide to go somewhere else after the movie.









Be prepared for the possibility that you will have to pay for your date – whether as a gesture or because (s)he forgot to bring money.
Having cash on hand is a good idea, since some places don’t accept debit/credit cards.
Consider bringing emergency funds; chances are you won’t have to use it, but if you do, it’ll make you seem reliable.

 Before any reinvention takes place, you should first take a good look at yourself and your reason for wanting a change. Take quiet time by yourself to reflect, daydream, and visualize your reinvention, and how it will help you in the upcoming school year. Ask yourself questions that will help you decide who you want to be, such as:”Is right now a turning point for me?”
”What are my academic goals for the year?”
”What are my social goals for the year?”
”How can I improve myself to better enjoy my school experience this year?”;
, A key step in determining who you want to be is identifying who you admire most. This sort of inspiration can come from friends, family, teachers, or your famous idols; the aim is to learn from the best, by example. For instance, your English teacher or favorite author might be a huge inspiration for you as an aspiring writer., The best way to visualize your ideal self is to write down the changes you want to make and things you want to achieve this school year. Written goals can often provide enough motivation to turn words into action, and can serve as visual reminders of your aspirations. To keep yourself motivated while gearing up for the new school year, write daily or weekly lists of your short-term and long-term goals.E.g. “I will get an A in both math and science this semester.”

 A rhombus has four equal sides, so it doesn't matter which side you choose. Let's say the side is 2 cm long. 2 cm x 2 cm = 4 cm2.
 It doesn't matter which angle you choose. Let's say one of the angles is 33 degrees. Just multiply sine (33) by 4 cm2 to get the area of the rhombus. (2 cm)2 x sine (33) = 4 cm2 x 0.55 = 2.2 cm2. The area of the rhombus is 2.2 cm2.

 T-intersections are where two hallways intersect and there are two separate corners to clear, neither of which grants better cover than the other. You essentially have double the space to clear, and several blind-spots further down either side of the uncleared hallway.
 The reasons behind this will be explained in detail later. The number one rule here is to not break the plane created by the intersecting hallway. Still, you want to see as much as you can before you commit to entering the hallway.
 Make sure nothing is an immediate danger.
 Again, crossing the plane created by the intersecting hallway telegraphs your presence to a possible intruder.
,, Now that you have cleared as much as you can without crossing the line, you must break through the plane.


Enter to the right. The reason the order of the side is important is because you can turn faster toward your support side than your firing side. If someone ends up being in the corner to your left, you can, more quickly, spin to your left than your right. This is all assuming you are right-handed. Everything should be flipped if you are left handed.
 Go through diagonally, spotting the corner you are heading toward, and a look over your shoulder to the other corner. View the images to the right for visual representations.

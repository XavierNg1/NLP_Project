 Break the eggshell carefully in half, without dropping any egg. Transfer the raw egg back and forth between the two halves, letting the white drip bit by bit into a bowl until only the yolk remains in the shell. There are several other methods you may use instead.
 Raw egg yolk will become gelatinous when frozen, making them unusable in most recipes and unpleasant for most people to eat. Prevent this process by mixing it with another ingredient. Use 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of salt for each cup (240 mL) of raw egg if you plan to use the eggs in savory dishesIf using them for sweet dishes such as baked desserts, skip the salt and instead stir in 1 – 1.5 tbsp (15 – 22 mL) of sugar, honey, or corn syrup., Store the mixed yolk mixture in freezer safe containers, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space to allow for expansion. Seal the containers tightly before freezing, and label with the number of eggs used, the date frozen, and the type of mixture (savory or sweet).


Use the egg yolks within several months for best quality.
 Mix the egg whites together to create a more uniform mixture, without introducing too many air bubbles into the mixture. Unlike the egg yolks, raw egg white does not require any additional ingredients to maintain a high quality in the freezer for several months.


If the mixture is still too chunky or uneven for your preferences, strain it through a sieve over a clean bowl.
 As with the yolks, these should be stored in specialized freezer-safe, rigid plastic or glass containers. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space to allow for expansion. Seal tightly and label with number of eggs and date frozen.


Any type of raw egg can be poured into a clean ice cube tray first, then transferred to a sealed container in the freezer. This makes it easier to remove only the amount of egg you need for a given recipe.

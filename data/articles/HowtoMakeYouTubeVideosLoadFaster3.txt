 The connection speed is different with CDNs, so that's why the videos load more slowly. You can watch the videos directly from YouTube, getting a faster loading time, by blocking the IP address ranges used by CDNs. Follow these steps:



Open the command prompt as an administrator.
Copy and paste this command into the window: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=”YouTubeTweak” dir=in action=block remoteip=173.194.55.0/24,206.111.0.0/16 enable=yes

Hit "Enter" to add the rule.
Close Command Prompt.
 The same basic idea can be used to make YouTube videos load faster if you're using Mac OS X. Follow these steps:



Open Terminal.
Enter the following command: sudo ipfw add reject src-ip 173.194.55.0/24 in

Hit "Enter."
Input your admin password.
Enter this command: sudo ipfw add reject src-ip 206.111.0.0/16 in

Hit "Enter."
Close Terminal.
 Follow these steps to make YouTube videos load faster:

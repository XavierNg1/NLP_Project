 Don´t smell of perspiration. Bees don´t like dirtiness and will sting you under your arms if your are dirty., Not everything that buzzes leads to honey. Wasps and yellow jackets make nests, but they do not produce any honey. Also, there are solitary species of bees which don't make honey.
 If you see a hole in a tree or log where there are lots of bees going in and out, you've found their hive.
 (Pine needles are generally good for this purpose.)

, Waft the smoke into the hole. Smoke makes the bees expect a fire, which makes them concerned about their honey. They gorge themselves over the uncapped honey, which makes them less likely to fly around and sting you.
 Try to avoid getting comb that contains larvae. Don't try to take the whole hive, just take a piece.
 She is slightly bigger than the others and probably won't fly. She may also have a greenish-blue spot on her back. Don't meddle with the queen, because the other bees will try to stay wherever she is.
 Then leave the bees alone.

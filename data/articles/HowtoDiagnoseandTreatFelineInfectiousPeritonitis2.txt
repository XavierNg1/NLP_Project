 Most cats develop this disease when they are under two years of age. It is more common if the cat lives around other cats, or if it was in a communal area with many cats. The most common way is by coming into oral contact with infected feces. Humans may transfer the virus on their clothes. If an infected cat comes into contact with an object, the virus may end up transferring to the object.The virus is often shed through feces. The virus will live for up the 36 hours, though it can last longer in colder climates.
In most cats, the virus will cause some diarrhea and then clear up on its own.
Feline coronavirus is only something that cats can get. People and dogs cannot become infected with feline coronavirus.
 FIP is difficult to diagnose, so taking your cat to the vet as soon as you suspect a problem can help them get a diagnosis. Make sure to give the vet as many of the symptoms as you can to help them have all of the facts.Sometimes, FIP can only be diagnosed through ruling out other diseases.
 The first thing the vet will probably do is test the cat’s blood. This checks to see if any coronavirus antibodies are presented. However, these antibodies just mean that the cat has been exposed to the virus, not that they have FIP. Other tests will be performed to give a definitive diagnosis.There are certain abnormalities on a blood panel that may cause your vet to suspect FIP. Your vet may also run a titer test for FIP.
The vet will also check blood counts, along with liver and kidney function.
 The vet may give your cat an x-ray to determine if they have fluid in their abdomen or chest. If the x-ray shows fluid, the vet will tap the cavity to draw fluid out for further testing.This often is enough to diagnose, but in some cases, a definitive diagnosis cannot be given.
 The dry form of FIP is challenging to diagnose since fluid won’t be present in the organs. If a differential diagnosis won’t lead to a diagnosis, the vet may do a biopsy of the affected organs.

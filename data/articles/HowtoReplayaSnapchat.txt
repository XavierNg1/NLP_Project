 If you haven't updated Snapchat in a while, you'll want to check for updates in your device's app store. Snapchat versions 9.29.3.0 and later have a Replay feature, allowing you to replay every Snap once instead of limiting you to one Replay a day. This is a major change, as you can now use Replay for every single Snap you receive.


Snapchat used to sell additional Replays, but no longer offers them for sale. If you purchased additional Replays in the past, you can still use them, but you can no longer purchase them.;
, Before you can use a Replay on a Snap, you'll need to have viewed it once. Tap a received Snap to begin viewing it.


If you have multiple unseen Snaps from that person, they will all play back-to-back, and using a Replay will play through all of them again.
 You're only given the option to replay a Snap if you stay on the Inbox screen after it finishes. If you go back to the camera screen or exit the app, you'll lose your chance to replay the Snap., You'll see the Snap icon refill, and it will say "Tap to view."


When you do this for the first time after updating, a window will appear asking you to confirm that you want to replay the Snap.
If you want to use a Replay for a specific Snap in a group of Snaps you received, swipe right on the Snap to open a chat with the person. Press and hold on the Snap that you want to replay in the chat history. You can only replay Snaps that you just received. Exiting the chat or the inbox screen will remove your ability to replay the Snaps.
 The Snap will replay all the way through again. If you leave the screen before tapping, you'll lose the Replay.
 You can now replay each and every Snap you receive, instead of one per day. The other person will be able to see when you've replayed their Snaps.

 Locate the gear app icon on your home screen or app drawer. This is the Settings––tap to open.
 A list of all installed applications will be displayed.
 Just scroll down the list of installed apps, and tap it to open the App Info screen.
 Look for “Clear cache” button on the App Info screen. You might have to scroll down a bit. Once you find it, tap to clear the application’s cache.
 Go back to the main Applications Manager screen (use the back button of your device), and repeat this process of clearing the cache.

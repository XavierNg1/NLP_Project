 Mix 1 gallon (3.78 l) of hot water with 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of dishwashing soap. Look for a dishwashing liquid that has a grease cutting agent in it and a scent that you like., Dip a sponge or rag into the water and soap solution that you created. Once the rag is saturated, wipe down the inside basin, the top, and the sides of the sink. The solution should start creating suds on your sink.


Do not use steel wool, wire brushes, or abrasive sponge pads because they could damage the enamel coating on your cast iron sink., Run the faucet to rinse down the entire sink. If you are having issues reaching hard to reach places, use a cup to collect some water and then use it to rinse down different areas. Remove all of the suds that you created from wiping it down.
 Use a dry rag or dish cloth and wipe your sink dry. Microfiber cloth is also a very absorbent material that can help you dry off a wet sink.If you do a basic cleaning on your sink at least once a week, it will be easier to clean your sink in the future.

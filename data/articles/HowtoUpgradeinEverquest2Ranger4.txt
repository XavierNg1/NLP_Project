 Many of your skill lines are due for upgrades in the first few levels of tier five.


In this tier, Crippling Blade is your best choice for upgrading to adept III.
Your second choice should be Honed Reflexes, which is the skill made available with the Bloodlines expansion pack. You do not need to own the expansion to purchase an apprentice IV or adept III version of this skill. Honed reflexes are a short duration self-haste so it is well worth upgrading.

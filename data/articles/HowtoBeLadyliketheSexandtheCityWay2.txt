 Charlotte, arguably the most ladylike of all four characters, is traditional, conservative, chaste and demure, mostly... Charlotte knows about etiquette and has impeccable manners. Learn which fork to eat your salad with, write thank you notes and leave the table when you feel the tone of the conversation has reached an unacceptably low level. (Season 3, Episode 9).
 Sit with you ankles crossed, speak well and don't swear. Behave yourself, usually. Charlotte was a prom queen, a varsity cheerleader, and a teen model so know about deportment and posture.
 Charlotte isn't afraid to exploit the chivalry of men to get what she feels she has a right to and what she wants. Expect men to pull your chair out for you, stand when you enter the room and get their hands dirty for you. Charlotte doesn't do DIY, she can arrange flowers, lay a table and choose a colour scheme for a dining room but is happy to have a man fix her cable TV.

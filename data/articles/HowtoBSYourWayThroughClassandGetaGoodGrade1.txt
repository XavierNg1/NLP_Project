 Always lengthen them to It is, They will, etc. This will increase the word count and length.;
, Look like you put a lot of thought in it and researched it. This will also increase the length of it.
 For example, instead of saying Martin Luther King, Jr. fought for no more segregation put: "Martin Luther King, Jr. was a great man who spent many hours putting stuff together; for example, speeches and protests, among other things, and it is very great that he did this, for without it, there would be segregation, which he fought against constantly". Basically, that small sentence was turned into a long, smart-sounding paragraph using the techniques stated.
 For example, if you're writing about computers, or anything that involves technology really, write some intro about how much technology has changed and give examples and a time line (you can do this without even doing research by just putting stuff you've already learned in the past about technology. For example, if you're a video game nut, put a bunch of crap about video game history). This will make it look like you spent a bunch of time researching, when in reality you were just putting stuff you already knew, but making it sound smart.

 Just stroke the bow back and forth across the rosin.


Tighten the bow until it's about the width of a pencil. but don't tighten it until it appears straight. There should be a natural curve to the bow. (Don't touch the bow hair or bounce it on your arm, as this will make the bow hairs greasy, and harder to play);
, (It doesn't matter if you are right- or left-handed, as you always hold the bow in your right hand.)

, Make sure that both the tip and the frog ends of the bow are more heavily rosined than the middle.
 There is such thing as rosining too much.

 Stretching is an important part of almost any exercise routine. Running is no exception. When you stretch, you're warming up the muscles in your body and getting them pumped up for the hard work that you're about to do.


One good stretch is called "the Stork." Stand up straight. Bring one foot up behind you toward your bottom. Gently grab it with one hand (you can support yourself against a wall with your other hand if necessary). Put light tension on your leg until you feel a stretch in your quadriceps (the front of your thigh). Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat with the other leg.;
, Before you run, speed up your heartbeat and get your blood pumping by taking a two minute jog. You'll get a slight boost of energy and it will be easier to focus on running quickly. As long as your warmup isn't too intense, you won't be too tired to give your run your best effort.
 For most runners, going on a run every day or every other day is best. The key here is consistency. To see long-term results, you need to stick to your exercise schedule and slowly ramp up the difficulty over time. If you quit or fail to challenge yourself, your performance may plateau or even decrease.
 Take 10 minutes each day for an interval run. As you run, follow this pattern: sprint for 10 seconds, then rest by jogging for a minute. Repeat for 10 minutes.


To challenge yourself, every week add a few seconds to your sprinting time and shorten your breaks. Over time, you will be able to run faster and longer.
 Try competing with a friend slightly faster than yourself. It will give you the motivation of winning, and it will be much more challenging then running by yourself or with someone slower then you. Don't run with someone much faster than you, or you might consider giving up.

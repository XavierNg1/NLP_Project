 This is an elegant way to finish your handstand. Instead of landing with a normal rollout, you'll move into the splits on the ground.
 Once you've mastered the handstand and you feel confident that you can balance well, try walking around! Do this often enough and your arm muscles will become very strong.
 After those muscles have bulked up a bit, try pushing up into your handstand from the ground.
 If you're an aspiring gymnast, the front limber is the logical next step after you've gotten the hang of standing on your hands.

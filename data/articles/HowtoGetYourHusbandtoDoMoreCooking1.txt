 Many people learn to cook by imitating someone who already knows how. Invite your husband to join you in the kitchen. For example, if you do all the preparation of raw meats and vegetables, your husband can help by stirring the vegetables as they saute.If you label your actions, your husband will learn what different cooking terms mean. For example, tell him that you're dicing the tomatoes, and he will see you chopping tomatoes into smaller pieces. If you tall him you're slicing the onions, he'll see you cutting a peeled onion in half, then into strips by cutting along the same direction as the onion's layers.

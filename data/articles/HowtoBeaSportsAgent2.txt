 You can start your career by working with an established organization.


Look for sports management companies with good reputations, no shortage of clients and an opportunity to work with athletes from all different sports.
 You might prefer to freelance as an agent, or get your own sports agent business established.


Attract clients to you by demonstrating that you are enthusiastic, qualified and ready to give your athletes the kind of attention and care that they might not find with a large sports management company.
Start small. If you are on your own, approach athletes just beginning their careers, coming out of the NCAA program or participants in smaller sports. Heading for the NFL draft as an unknown agent is not the best way to start your business.
 If you want to be an agent for professional athletes, most organizations such as the MLB, NFL and NHL will require you to be certified as an agent.


Earn your credentials by having a client in the major leagues identify you as his or her agent, completing an application with the organization and agreeing to all rules and regulations covering agents.
 Most agents earn from 4 percent to 10 percent of their client's contract. Other agents have an hourly fee or work for a flat rate.

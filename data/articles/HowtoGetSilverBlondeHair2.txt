 Attempting to dye your hair platinum blonde by yourself is a bad idea.The process tends to be very long, and involves a lot of chemicals that can seriously damage your hair if you don’t know what you’re doing. You may be able to go blonde out of a box, but to achieve truly silver hair you should enlist a stylist’s help. This can get expensive, but it’s not something you want to skimp on unless you want to risk ending up with fried, orange hair, and a burning scalp.If you have very light blonde hair to begin with, you may be an exception to this rule. In this case, a quality toner applied to your hair may be enough to get silver hair. Even so, if you have never used toner before, it is highly recommended that you go to a stylist the first time around, so they can show you the ropes., You might be surprised at how many shades of white and silver there are. Bringing in a photograph to show your stylist will help ensure you get exactly what you want., It will probably take a few sessions to get your hair truly silver. This is especially true if you have naturally dark hair or have colored your hair before. You should also be prepared for the process to be painful, as the bleach often creates a burning sensation on the scalp., Don’t expect to be in and out of the salon in an hour. Keep your schedule free on the day of your appointment, and be prepared for it to take a while.Don’t panic if you don’t see ideal results the first time. You may need to lighten your hair to a darker blonde first, then gradually lift to silver.

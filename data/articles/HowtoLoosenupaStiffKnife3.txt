, How successful this will be depends on the type of "goop" it is. If you have no idea, it is best to start with the mildest cleaner available and progress to the strongest. Try cleaning agents in this order (rinsing and drying thoroughly in between): Water, ammonia, light mineral oil, "tape remover" or "goop remover" products from the store.
 This will prevent future oxidation.

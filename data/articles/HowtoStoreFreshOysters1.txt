, The towel should be completely saturated with water, but not dripping or leaking.



Keep the towel wet. Continue to check it, and if it begins to dry out, soak it again and place it back on top of the oysters.

 Run them under cold water and remove them from their shells by scrubbing them with a stiff brush.

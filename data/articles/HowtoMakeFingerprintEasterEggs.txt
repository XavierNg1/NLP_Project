 Create small holes at the top and bottom of each egg with a push pin. Gently blow out the yolk and whites until the eggs are emptied.


Use a thin layer of craft sealer on the entire egg so the shell can last longer.;
, Because fingers are used instead of brushes, add a small amount of each color to different plates.
 Ensure that the pointer finger and thumb is holding the top and bottom of the egg, so it makes it easier to turn as the egg is being painted on.
 Use the paper towels to capture or wipe off any excess paint.
, Make pictures or designs on each egg.
 Set the eggs in an empty egg container until the paint is set.

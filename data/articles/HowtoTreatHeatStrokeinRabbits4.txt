 Be sensible about where you locate the rabbit's hutch and run, taking care to determine how your rabbit will be exposed to the elements. At the least, make sure the rabbit will never be in full sunlight without accessible shade.


The hutch should be protected from all types of weather, including rain, snow, and excessive wind, in addition to sun., This is especially important on hot days. You cold help it keep cool with a large ceramic tile that has been in the fridge and then placed on the floor of the hutch, or with a baking tray containing a shallow depth of cool water for the rabbit to sit in.Another idea is to freeze bottles of water and then place these in the hutch. The rabbit can then lie against the bottles or lick the condensation to cool itself off.
 Air movement helps to reduce the temperature, so the hutch shouldn't be somewhere that has totally stagnant air. If it is very warm out, consider placing a fan on floor level, directed at one corner of the hutch, so that the rabbit can choose whether or not to lie in the breeze.Avoid the rabbit being constantly being exposed to the wind from the fan. It should be able to choose whether it needs to cool off.
 Plenty of water is an absolute essential when it comes to keeping cool. Provide duplicate drinking bottles or bowls in case one gets knocked over or drunk dry.A dehydrated rabbit is extremely vulnerable to heatstroke.
 Moist vegetables can provide the rabbit additional water, which helps with dehydration and heat stroke. A good vegetable to provide is cucumber, as it has a very high moisture content.You can also rinse veggies in water and then leave them wet, so the rabbit takes in extra fluid when eating.
 You may need to relocate your rabbit if temperatures get too high. Consider moving it into the shade, into a cool out building, or even into your home, when the weather is too bad.


This can simply be a temporary measure, just to assure that your rabbit does not suffer from the heat.

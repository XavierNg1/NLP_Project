 If you're the type to get angry or hold grudges, people will not be drawn to you naturally. Try to let go of past treatment and be empathetic of others. If a friend forgot to return a text, this is probably not worth getting upset over. If you're a kind, forgiving person, people will feel at ease around you. They'll be more likely to contact you, as they'll feel comfortable in your presence.However, there's such a thing as being too forgiving. Remember to watch out for one-sided friends. At a certain point, it is appropriate to assert yourself. Letting go of small indiscretions does not mean you should put up with long-term mistreatment.
 A lot of times, people have high or unreasonable expectations of their friends. Consider what you expect from those around you. Is it fair? Is it reasonable? If not, you may want to let go of certain expectations. This will help you relax more, allowing others to feel comfortable and welcome in your presence.Do not pick your friends apart too quickly. Accept that your friends are imperfect and make mistakes. If a friend fails to return a text message, don't jump to accusing him or her of disrespect. It's not reasonable to expect text messages to always be returned. Chances are, you've failed to return a text or two as well at some point.
Understand your friends aren't going to match you all the time. While you may be excellent at returning e-mails and phone calls, other people are less organized. You can't expect your friends to be at your level in every respect. Chances are, there are things about you your friends find frustrating as well.
 Let people know you enjoy being included. Being gracious and kind will encourage people to contact you again. After a night out, for example, text a friend something like, "Thank you so much for including me tonight. I had a great time, and I appreciate the invite."

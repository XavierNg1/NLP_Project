 The key to breeding a Shiny Pokémon is to breed Pokémon from two different regions. For example, if you live in the US, obtain a Pokémon from Japan or Europe. Make sure to obtain the Pokémon that you want to get a Shiny version of.

This breeding method, also known as the Masuda method, is only available in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Black, White, Black 2, White 2, X, and Y.
The easiest way to get a Pokémon from another region is to trade with someone. There are several popular trading sites online that can make this a fairly simple process, such as PokéBay and Reddit's Pokémon Trading subreddit.
The two Pokémon must be able to breed normally with each other. This means they must be the same species or share an Egg Group, and are opposite genders. If the Pokémon you want to breed is genderless, then you will need to breed it with a Ditto.
You can tell what region the Pokémon is from by looking at its PokéDex entry. In the upper-right corner, there will be a three-letter abbreviation for the region the Pokémon is from (JPN, FRE, ITA, etc.). If there is nothing there, then the Pokémon is from your own region.
 You receive the Shiny Charm after completing your Pokédex. Equipping it will raise the chances that the egg that hatches contains a Shiny Pokémon.

The Shiny Charm is only available in Black 2, White 2, X, and Y.
 Depending on their compatibility, the chance of you receiving an egg from the pairing can be anywhere from 70% down to 20%. The game calculates the chance for an egg every 256 steps you take in the world.

You can increase the speed by riding your bike instead of walking.
 Once you get an egg, you'll need to hatch it. This can take a little while, and you won't know what's inside until it hatches. By breeding Pokémon from two different regions, your chances for a Shiny go from 1/8192 to 1/1024 (8x more likely).

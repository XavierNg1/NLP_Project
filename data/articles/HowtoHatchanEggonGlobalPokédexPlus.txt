 If you are not already on that page, click on the tab at the top of the web page which says 'Lab'. Choose an egg.


An alternative is to choose an egg from the shelter. To do this, click on the tab which says 'Shelter' and then change the setting to 'Egg Shelter' if it isn't already. Here, you can actually see what your egg looks like.;
, This is where you can get the HTML, BB and URL codes for your egg. You don't need to do anything with these right now unless you want to add an image/link of your Pokémon to another website.
 You should get a webpage showing your current party.


If you click on the image of your egg, you will be taken to a page where you can warm your egg. You can only do this once a day.
 You have to wait for other people to warm your egg. Once enough users have clicked your egg, you can refresh the page and there will be an option in the drop-down box below your egg to hatch it.



Your Pokémon egg will hatch!

 The low temperature allows a dehydrating effect as opposed to a real baking effect. Prepare a baking sheet by lining with parchment paper or a silicone sheet.;
, Slice the bananas into thin slices. Make sure they're all fairly much the same slice width, to ensure even cooking.
 Arrange in a single layer and do not allow the slices to touch.
 This helps to hold back natural blackening and adds a slight tang.
 Bake for an hour to an hour and three quarters. Test after an hour to see if you like the consistency; if not, continue baking.


Baking times may vary depending on the thickness of the slices.
 Set aside to cool. Most likely the banana chips will be soft and oozing but in cooling, they'll harden up.

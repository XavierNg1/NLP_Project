 Affix the tape to the outer end of your eye diagonally. It should meet in line with the end of your eyebrow.
 Carry on lining the upper lash line., If you choose to do this, then make sure that the gap is only about 2 to 3mm. Once you have the 'stencil' all you have to do is fill it in., Once you have filled the 'stencil' or free-handed the line, remove the tape that you initially used at the beginning. To do this, slowly and carefully pull the tape away from you., You should now have a perfect wing to your eyeliner. If the eyeliner has smudged or leaked under the tape, take some eye makeup remover and a cotton bud and remove what is not needed. Be patient and let the eyeliner dry!

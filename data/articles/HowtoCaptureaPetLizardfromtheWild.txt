, Once you are sure you have the proper permits for capturing a wild reptile, you can focus on its habitat for now.
 Remember some animals never adapt to captivity. Ask around, many experienced animal keepers (usually not pet stores) can advise you on what is "easy" to care for.
 for lizards.
Use the knowledge you have gained from researching to know where to look.
Catch it near home:
To catch a lizard that hangs out around your house, get a 10 gallon (37.9Â L) aquarium, or some other rather large and clear box. It is recommended you use a clear box, so the lizards (and yourself) can see into /through the box.
Make a lizard-friendly backyard. If you don't know exactly what to look for, go in your backyard and lay out boards, plants, old mats, etc. in the dirt. Wait about 5 months.

Tape this to the tank as if it were hinged on, with the 'hinges' at the bottom of the tank.
Take some string or thread, and tie or tape it to the top portion of the foam core.

Place a few live crickets into the tank, and place the tank on its side (long ways) so there is a big opening.
 Never release it back into the wild. You can disrupt social order, introduce at the wrong season, and even spread disease.

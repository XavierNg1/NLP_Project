 When you met a new person, your eyes peruse their face in a zigzag pattern. You glance at one of their eyes, then the other, and finally you look at their nose. Subtle flirts expand the size of this triangle. After looking at both of your crush’s eyes, skip the nose and quickly glance at their mouth or chest.


If your crush picks up on this, they’ll think you’re checking them out (and they’d be right!).;
, Gaze at your crush until they notice your eyes on them. Once you make eye contact, slowly move your gaze around the room before settling your stare back on them. This quick little trick (approximately 15 seconds) will let your crush know that you’re interested in them., If eye contact generates intimacy, prolonged eye contact is incredibly intimate. When you lock eyes with your crush for more than ten seconds, your bodies experience a physical reaction. Your nervous system is engaged, your heart rate is elevated, and your blood flow increases.


When your crush is talking to you, stare into their eyes., When your gaze settles on someone you find attractive, you tend to blink more. As a result, our brains associate rapid blinking with sexual attraction. The reason for this is two fold. Experiencing an intense emotional reaction, like arousal, causes our eyes to produce more tears. In order to maintain appropriate moisture levels, we blink more.Batting your lashes is a great way to let someone know you find them attractive.

 There is a big difference between the message being communicated by a short or a long bark. A short bark signals urgency, while a longer bark is less urgent. A longer bark may signal general displeasure or unhappiness, while a short burst is meant to get immediate attention due to anger or alert.A longer bark can transform into a growl or a howl. This also signals a less acute issue than a shorter bark.
 The strength of the barks, also known at the amplitude, can tell you a lot about what your dog is trying to communicate. In general, the louder the bark, the more important and time sensitive the dog thinks its message is. For example, a dog that thinks there is an intruder coming into your home will bark very loudly to get your, and the intruder's, immediate attention.When judging the amplitude of your dog's bark, keep in mind that you are judging its strength only on your dog's usual barks and not the barks of other dogs. Is the bark you are assessing your dog's normal volume or is it loud and more persistent? This can tell you about how serious the dog thinks its message is.
 Pitch is another part of your dog's bark that can give you a lot of information. This aspect, however, can be harder to identify, so it may take you some time to be able to differentiate between a low and a high pitch, especially if you do not hear very well.A low pitch will usually indicate fear or aggression in a dog. This pitch signals strength and that a trespasser should fear the dog.
A high pitched bark signals excitement or joy.

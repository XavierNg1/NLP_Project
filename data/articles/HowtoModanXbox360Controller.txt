 You will need a Safety-TORX screwdriver to do so or a flat headed screwdriver. There are 7 screws in total. 6 visible, another, hidden behind a sticker near the bottom under the battery pack. Carefully take the front off the controller and set the buttons and other things down somewhere.;
, If you lose them you can't put your controller back together.
 Look to the far right. there should be three little silver pins; one on top another in a line.
 Be careful not to get the solder on the circuit board. This could cause problems with the controller.



This only works with some guns and increases accuracy.

Where the party is going to be held? At a house, at a club, in the garden?
A nightclub is a good choice, because you can lighting effects.;
, Invitations are going to be the guests' sneak peek on what the party is all about.


Use blues and greens for theme. If you choose to make them yourself use plenty of glitter make it look beautiful.
If you don't have time to make the invites yourself get them made for you. Card, paper and party stores often make invitations, and you can also buy custom invitations through the Internet.
Send the invitations about 4 weeks before the party, so the guests have plenty of notice.
 Here are some ideas:


Barbecue outside with a fire pit for roosted marshmallows
Party punch
Champagne
Wine
Beer
Cakes
Ice cream
Snow cones
Soups
Chocolate
Fondue

,, On the table put streamers on them, as well as glitter etc.
 Hire entertainment like a fire magician. For props you could hire a giant pretend polar bear and even a sleigh.
 you could put out a patio heater to warm up guests when getting food or smoking.


For entertainment buy fireworks so they are entertained.
, Winter mostly revolves around Christmas so get out the old Christmas records and play them all night long.

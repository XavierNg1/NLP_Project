 The standard form of a linear equation is Ax+By=C{\displaystyle Ax+By=C}.In this form, A{\displaystyle A}, B{\displaystyle B}, and C{\displaystyle C} are integers, and x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} are the coordinates of a point on the line.

For example, you might be given the equation 2x+3y=6{\displaystyle 2x+3y=6}.
 The x-intercept is the point on the line where the line crosses the x-axis.At this point, the value for y{\displaystyle y} will be 0.So, in order to find the x-intercept, you need to set the y{\displaystyle y} to 0 and solve for x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, if you substitute 0 for y{\displaystyle y}, your equation will look like this: 2x+3(0)=6{\displaystyle 2x+3(0)=6}, which simplifies to 2x=6{\displaystyle 2x=6}.
 To do this, you need to isolate the x variable by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient. This will give you the value of x{\displaystyle x} when y=0{\displaystyle y=0}, which is the x-intercept.

For example:2x=6{\displaystyle 2x=6}2x2=62{\displaystyle {\frac {2x}{2}}={\frac {6}{2}}}x=3{\displaystyle x=3}


, Remember that an ordered pair is written in the form (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)}. For the x-intercept, the value of x{\displaystyle x} will be the value you calculated previously, and the y{\displaystyle y} value will be 0, since y{\displaystyle y} always equals 0 at the x-intercept.For example, for the line 2x+3y=6{\displaystyle 2x+3y=6}, the x-intercept is at the point (3,0){\displaystyle (3,0)}.

 Smaller servings of microwave brownies can be made directly in a mug, but because you are working with such a large amount, you'll need to mix it in a separate bowl first.


If you are vegan, mix 2 tablespoons (14 grams) of flaxseed meal with 5 tablespoons (74 milliliters) of water in a small dish. Wait 5 minutes for it to thicken, then add to the recipe.If you are using the vegan option, consider adding ½ to 1 teaspoon (2.5 to 5 grams) of baking soda as well. This will help make the brownies more tender.;
, Melt ½ cup (115 grams) of butter before adding it to the bowl. The melted butter will help the ingredients mix together better, giving you a denser brownie in the end., Use a fork to break up any lumps, clumps, or chunks. Mixing these two ingredients separately will help them mix into the rest a little more evenly.
 There should be no lumps, clumps, or chunks when you are done. Be careful not to over-mix, however, or your brownies will end up too tough and chewy.


Consider adding 1 cup (125 grams) of chopped walnuts for a meatier texture.If you don't like walnuts, you can try another type of nuts, such as pecans or pistachios.
 The ideal size to work with is 8 by 8 by 2 inches (20.32 by 20.32 by 5.08 centimeters). For extra texture, scatter ½ cup (90 grams) of chocolate chips or chunks on top of the batter after you have poured it., After every minute, you will want to pause the microwave and rotate the baking dish. Keep cooking until there is a 1¼ inch (3.18 centimeters) wide moist spot in the center.


Cooking times will vary depending on the strength of your microwave. A 1,100-watt microwave will cook brownies in about 3 to 4 minutes., Don't worry if the top looks moist. The brownies will continue to cook on the inside even after you take them out., You can serve them as they are, or with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or hot fudge. If you love coffee, you might like your brownie with a scoop of coffee ice cream.

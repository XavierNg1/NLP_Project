 Reiterate all of your concerns, tell them you're giving them an opportunity to come clean. Tell your significant other that you deserve honesty and you are hurting. If they still lie, right to your face then you have a few options. Calmly present the evidence, make sure they know that you know. Then tell them you're done. "You hurt me, you lied to me and you played me, I'm moving on." If you followed the tips of how to legally attain the information then you shouldn't have to worry about legal backfire.


You can also choose to not present the evidence and tell them that you know. You can quote directly from the evidence (ensuring that they know, that you know.) Let them know you're done. You deserve happiness.
 You now have proof of adultery. Again, if you followed the tips of how to legally attain the information then you shouldn't have to worry about legal backfire.

 One of the easiest ways to hurt your muscles is to jump right into your exercise. Whether you're jogging up a hill, bursting into a sprint, or heading straight to the court, you need to stretch. Your muscles need time to literally get warm, which allows them to elongate and contract without tearing. Try the following warm-up before stretching.


Jog lightly for 10-15 minutes.
Jump, skip, shuffle, or high-step for 5-10 minutes to activate specific muscles.
Swing your arms in small circles at your sides, gradually getting larger.
Do 10-20 lunges, push-ups.
 While everyone has heard how important stretching is, there is actually some debate about its effectiveness in preventing muscles soreness. That said, light stretching after a warm-up will elongate your muscle fibers and increase flexibility.Hold each stretch for about 10-15 seconds.


Stop stretching if you feel pain–stretching should never hurt.
Focus on the muscles you are going to work out. If you’re going to run, stretch your quads and hamstring. If you’re lifting then stretch your arms, shoulders, and back.
 While this is a disputed topic amongst sports scientists, some studies have shown the glutamine and protein supplements can aid in muscle regeneration that prevents soreness. Pick them up at your local health store or online and have one 20-30 minutes before working out.Always drink plenty of water with supplements.
 Omega-3s are a natural anti-inflammatory agent, reducing swelling and damage around your muscles. Some good sources include:


Salmon
Flax and chia seeds
Avocados
Walnuts, Even professional body-builders get muscle soreness. While it is uncomfortable, it will go away within 2-3 days. The more frequently you work out the less likely it is that you will get sore. Most muscle soreness occurs because of:


Changes in workout intensity.
Starting to work out after long periods on inactivity.
New exercises or working new muscle groups.

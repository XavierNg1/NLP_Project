 Probably, if it's something like Webkinz, that website doesn't allow you to type what you want, so he probably isn't in to you, since he cannot state it himself. Omegle, Facebook, Twitter and Facebook are more helpful. He can say whatever he wants to say, therefore, he may not lie to you. Keep in mind that some websites are more protected than others.;
, He doesn't have to be wearing a tux, but most guys use a thing called 'swag' to impress you. If he seems like a trying too hard guy, too cool type of guy, he is probably just trying to impress you.
 Type of things like, "Do you have any siblings? Are you adventurous? What is your IQ?" he is just getting to know you more, not being nosy. But if he is being too personal, don't answer. Often guys want to know more about you do if they can decide how perfect you are.
 Guys like this will pretty much take up any girl who accepts this offer, you are nothing special to them.
 Again with the impressing.
 Again with the horny loser! (SEE WARNINGS)

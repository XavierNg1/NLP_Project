If you just go ahead and pick a game without following these instructions, you will not be able to play as Luigi, so do not choose a game yet.

If you let go of the L and R buttons before you press A, you will not be able to play as Luigi, so press A whilst holding L and R.



If you hear Luigi saying his name in the background, you have done the task correctly. If not, try again until you hear him.

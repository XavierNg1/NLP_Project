 Whatever their problem is, it is not your fault. They've constructed a false image in their head about who you are based on their own preconceived notions on homosexuality and what it means to be a homosexual, and they are acting that way towards you based on their false image.;
, These people are only posting to get a rise out of the community, and aren't really serious about what they're posting. Don't let them get a rise out of you.
 Sometimes, people are so set in their ways, that they will just refuse to see your side of things. They refuse to see that you do not fit their image of what it means to be a homosexual, and arguing with them won't do much but spur on more hateful remarks and make you angry or hurt.
 If someone is trying to change their feelings of homophobia, try to be patient with them. Remind them when they're falling back onto their stereotypes, and if they're willing to listen and see your side, explain your side using calm language.
 Most online communities have rules against personal attacks, and they also have features that allows users to block or ignore another user.
 When things get too heated, just log off and do something else. Get your mind off it, and don't let those words follow you.
 People who support you can be a tremendous help when it comes to keeping your self-esteem intact in the face of personal attacks.

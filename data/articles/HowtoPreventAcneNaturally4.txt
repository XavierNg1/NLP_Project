 Keep dirt and oil at bay by creating a washing routine, where you clean your face twice a day and your body at least once a day. You can use a plant based oil cleanser or a commercial cleanser than is non-comedogenic. Avoid products that contain alcohol, as it can irritate and dry out your skin.


Always use your fingertips to apply the cleanser to your face and massage, rather than scrub your face. Scrubbing can cause permanent scarring on your skin.
You should also wash your face and body after any heavy sweating, such as after a workout.
 Avoid touching your acne and do not irritate it in any way, especially with your hands. Irritating your acne can cause breakouts, scarring, and a longer healing time for pimples or whiteheads.
 This includes direct sunlight without sunscreen on or tanning beds. The UV rays from the sun can damage your skin cells.

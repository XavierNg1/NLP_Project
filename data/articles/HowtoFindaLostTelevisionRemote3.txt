 If you keep a closer eye on your remote in the future, you may be less likely to lose it. Try to be engaged and aware each time that you set your remote down. Take a mental snapshot of the device so that you remember where it is.
 Don't ever put the remote anywhere other than this place. It might be the coffee table, or next to the television, or in a dedicated "remote control holder" that is attached to your couch or table.


If you regularly lose the remote, consider buying a remote control holder so that you have a set place to put it.
Apply a Velcro strip to the back of the remote, then attach the matching "opposite" Velcro strip to the TV. Keep the remote firmly attached to the Velcro strip on the TV when not in use.
 Attach a strip of brightly-colored tape, or a reflector, or a long, fuzzy tail. Tie a ribbon to the device, or give it wings, or glue plastic legs onto it. Add anything that you think will make it easier for you to notice and remember your remote! Try not to add anything that will impair the function of the device.
 It's easy to find yourself using separate remotes for your television, your DVD player, your sound system, and other devices. You may find that it is easier to keep track of one remote than it is to keep track of, say, four.
 Several companies now sell small, relatively inexpensive tracking devices that link up to a smartphone app.Clip the tracker to your television remote in case you ever lose it again. You can set your smartphone to beep when the remote is close. Some apps will even try to find your remote when it is far from you.

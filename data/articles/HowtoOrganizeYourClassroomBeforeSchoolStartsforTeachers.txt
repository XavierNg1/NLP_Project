, Your desk should be at the back or middle of the classroom and lined up in front of the chairs. Make sure all of the students will be able to have their eyes on you while they are teaching you.


Do not put your desk next to windows. It can lead to blaze, which can cause people's eyes hurt. It may even cause eye strain.
Ensure that all your students are able to see things that are for learning, including the boards that you'll be writing on.
 Get as many chairs as you need. It depends on how many people you want to sit at each table.


You can also have people sit in rows, each person sitting in one chair by themselves.
 Put them in different areas of the classroom. It is recommended that papers are stacked neatly on your desk, and pencils, pens, and other stuff like that are put in your supply closet (which most classrooms have). You can also put some supplies on extra tables (if there are any).
 These folders are where students are going to turn in their due homework (and other assignments, such as school projects).
 You will be explaining these flyers to your students on the very first day of school.

 To do so:      


Open the case and take out the tefillin. Lengthen the strap by the knot so that you can fit the tefillin around your arm
After rolling up your sleeve, slide the tefillin up your weaker arm. Your weaker arm is usually considered to be the one that you do not write with. If you write fluently with both hands, consult your rabbi for which hand you should use
Place the tefillin on your bicep muscle. The tefillin should be on the muscle; if the tefillin is too low or too high on your arm, it is not considered to be worn properly
Before you tighten the strap, say the blessing for the tefillin shel yad that is found in the Siddur. The tefillin should be adjusted to be facing upwards, leaning slightly inwards, to be closer to the heart.     
Once situated correctly, wrap the strap once more around your upper arm. After that, wrap the strap seven times around your forearm, ending above the wrist;
, To do so:


Just like for the tefillin shel yad, unwrap the leather straps from around the casing
Put the tefillin on top of your head, with the ‘box’ sitting in front and the knot on the back of your head. The "box" should be situated between your eyes, and the knot should be centered in the back of your head. Most people use a mirror to make sure that the box is centered
At this point, say the blessing for the tefillin shel yad which is found in the prayer book.
Make sure that the straps coming out of the knot are in the front of your body. One should be on the left side, and the other should be on the right
The tefillin box should be no higher than the middle of your head, and no lower than your hairline. If it is, the tefillin is not considered to be worn properly

 Assuming you have it installed, you'll find this program on your computer either in your Start menu or on your Start screen.


On Windows 10, you can type "Access 2013" into the Cortana search box in the bottom left corner of the taskbar/screen to the right of the Start menu icon. Click "Access 2013" when it pops up.;
, If the program was closed before, you'll see an area that says "Recent"; you can click the "Open Other Files" button in the maroon-red bar on the left of the screen.


For quick access to other areas to open Access database files from, you can press the keyboard shortcut for Open by using the shortcut Ctrl+O.
 Access 2013 makes it easy to peruse your file structure, and gives you one-click access to OneDrive files separate from local database files. You can select your search folder and single-click your file from the menu. You can highlight the file, but don't open it all the way just yet.
 You'll notice that the word Open isn't the only thing on this Open button. There is also a drop-down arrow on it, to the right of the vertical bar that splits the button off.
 Don't click where it says open, but do click the area to the right of the vertical bar.



You can't make changes to database information in "Read-Only" mode, but can make security changes that will stick after saving.
"Open Exclusive" is used for those who want to make high-end security changes and edit the data or tables, at the same time.

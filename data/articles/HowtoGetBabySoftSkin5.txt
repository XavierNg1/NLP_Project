 For particularly rough dry areas such as feet, knees and elbows, slather on some lotion or cream before you go to bed. When you wake up they will feel a whole lot better.


To prevent transfer of the moisturizing product from your body to the bedding, you can wear clothing. The clothing will also help keep the moisturizing product right on your skin, where it is most needed. Put on tights/pantyhose (for legs), gloves (for hands), socks (for feet), etc., and leave it on overnight. Shower when you get up in the morning.
Use plain white cotton gloves, available from places such as department stores, beauty salons and cleaning supplies distributors.

 If you have more than one chore to accomplish within 30 minutes, you need to be conscious of how long it takes to complete each chore. If you have six chores to do in that time, find six songs lasting five minutes each and make a playlist. Play the playlist while you work and as soon as the song changes, switch tasks.Make sure you’ve completed each task to the best of your ability before moving onto the next one.
If you have less chores, choose longer songs or set a timer for the amount of time it takes to do each chore.
Use fun as motivation. If your favorite TV show comes on at a certain time, start your chores thirty minutes before that time. That way, you’ll be motivated to finish your chores within those thirty minutes in order to catch your show.
 Doing the same tasks over and over can be boring, so switching up your routine keeps things fresh. Ask your sibling if you can trade chores for the week; if they usually empty the dishwasher, ask if you can swap your laundry chore for that task. However you want to mix it up, switching chores will make the work more challenging and interesting.If you’re going to trade chores, make sure you both hold up your end of the bargain. The work still needs to get done.
If you’re spending time cleaning their room, be respectful of their property. If you betray their trust, they may not want to trade chores again.
 Just because you have work to do doesn’t mean you can’t make the work fun. Turn your chores into a race with your siblings or parents to see who can get their work done the fastest. Turn on some music and have a dance party while you work. Whatever it takes to make your chores more enjoyable, do that.You can’t win the game if your work is done sloppily, so make sure to be thorough.

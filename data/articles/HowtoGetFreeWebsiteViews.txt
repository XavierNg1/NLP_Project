 Go to your website by finding it on google, or entering the HTML and look over your site. Make sure that the overall design of the website is good. ( the font should be dark and the background should be light colour). The reason it should look good, neat and organised is because it will attract the reader's attention, but if it is too bright (orange font and light green background) the readers eyes will hurt and they will not want to stay;
, Paragraphs and pictures make the website organized and it looks good. Make sure you stay on topic.
 One thing that a lot of people who start a website do wrong, is that they do not write the correct title. If you are making a website about how to repair a certain part of a car, do not make the title something long and confusing like "repairing the silver part near the middle of the car, because it is rusted". This will be hard to find on google and the reader will be confused. Write something clear and short like "repairing a car's motor"

, In order to get more views on your site, you must advertise it. In order to get free views, you must do your research and find out ways to advertise for free. You should consider making an account on Wiki how and advertising the website on your profile, recommending it on the forums, or writing articles about cars, so people know you are knowledgeable and they will see your website. Also check out "free advertising" on google and look at the results.
 If you are willing to spend some money into advertising your website, you should look for 1) Where it will be advertised 2) Is there a time period? 3) What time it will be advertised 4) How much it will cost and 5) Are there cheaper alternatives?

, DO not advertise for one day and let it go. Try advertising for a week, and spread the message. Tell your friends too and the word will spread.

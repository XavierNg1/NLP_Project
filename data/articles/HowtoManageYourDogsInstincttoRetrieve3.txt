 If your dog does not seem receptive to training at home, you may want to speak to your vet about their retrieving issue. Set up an appointment with your vet where you can discuss the issue and ask for guidance or advice. Your vet may ask you questions about your dog’s retrieval habits to get a better sense of the issue. Try to answer their questions as clearly and honestly as possible.For example, your vet may ask you, “What types of items does your dog tend to retrieve?” “How often does your dog retrieve these items?” “Do you notice any patterns in your dog’s retrieval habits?”

, You may also decide to work with a certified dog trainer to help your dog learn the “leave it” command and to manage their retrieval habits. Get a referral for a good dog trainer from your vet. You can also ask other pet owners for a referral to a trainer they have worked well with before.When you speak to the dog trainer, make sure they have experience working with dogs on their retrieval habits. You may also ask the trainer for referrals from other clients they have worked with in the past and their resume to ensure they are certified and experienced.
 Another option is to enroll your dog in an obedience class that focuses on managing retrieval habits. You may ask your vet to refer you to a good obedience class or speak to your trainer about a class you can try with your dog.

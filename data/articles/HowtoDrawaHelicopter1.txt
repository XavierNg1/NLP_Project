Start by drawing a slightly skewed trapezoid.
Add a long triangular shape at the base. This will be your helicopter’s tail boom.
Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat.;
,


Draw an irregular egg-shaped figure. This will be your helicopter’s cockpit.
Since helicopters come in different shapes and models, you can actually make this into a slightly different shape. In this figure, I used a slightly pointed oval.



To define the copter body shape; go back to the trapezoid you made on Step 1. Add some lines to make it look like a trapezoid-cube.
For the skids, add two horizontal parallel lines below the cockpit.



For the tail, add two thin right angles at each side of the end of the tail boom.
The rotor base would be added at the top of the trapezoid cube. To make things easier, just make a really thick and wide lowercase “i”.



Add three (or four) straight lines on the rotor base. It doesn’t matter if the lines are the same length. Just keep in mind the angle of the view.
Unknown to most people, helicopters also have tail rotors to help make manoeuvring easier. To do this, make two thin triangles. The triangles’ apex should meet in the middle.



To draw the wing, just add a small rectangle on the narrow part of the tail boom.
You can add windows at the side and the big window for the cockpit pilots.
Also, don’t forget to add the headlight in front of the cockpit.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
the line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



you can add details like light bulbs, small windows and doors.
you can also add screws and metal sheets for added rugged effect.



Helicopters could go from boring gray or white to camouflage or even in bright colors. You may also want to add symbols or insignia to make your helicopters look more real.

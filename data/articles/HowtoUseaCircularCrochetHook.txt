 Keep in mind that, once you start to build on this chain, your stitches will all be on the circular hook at one time.
 Yarn over, pull through, and leave that loop on the hook. Repeat to the end of the chain. The tail of yarn A should be at your working hook. Let go of yarn A.,, Yarn over and pull through the first two loops on the hook (both will be color A). Yarn over again, pulling through the next two loops (the first is color B, the second color A). Repeat until all the loops are off of the hook., Insert the hook under a vertical bar, yarn over, pull through, and keep the loop on the hook. Repeat through to the very last vertical bar, remembering the last bar will be yarn B, not yarn A., Pick up yarn A and work as you did in step #4., Repeat to the end., Continue this until you've reached your desired length., Insert the hook under the first vertical bar, yarn over and, this time, pull through both loops on the hook. Do this the entire way across, then tie off the yarn and weave in your tail.

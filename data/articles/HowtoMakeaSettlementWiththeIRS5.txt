 If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 in taxes, penalties and interest and you do not have the financial means to repay your debt, you should consider filing for a PPIA. , If you can afford monthly payments to the IRS but your monthly amount cannot discharge your debt within ten years from when the tax was assessed then you may qualify for a PPIA. A PPIA is an agreement with the IRS whereby you make monthly payments for a certain amount of time. When that time is complete, even though you did not pay the IRS your total debt owed, the IRS waives your additional debt. , In order to qualify for a PPIA you must:


complete IRS Form 433 setting forth your financial information
have no equity assets or assets that have minimum equity so that you can not sell or borrow against
unable to secure a loan or liquidate an asset
make a good faith effort to sell assets
file and paid previous IRS taxes
be subject to financial reviews every two years , Once your PPIA has been approved, you must continue to make on-time monthly payments and file all required tax returns or your PPIA could be revoked. Additionally, if you have a change in your financial situation and the IRS determines you are able to pay more than agreed, they can revoke your PPIA.

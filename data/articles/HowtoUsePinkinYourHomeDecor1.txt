 Pink can be an intimidating color to use in home decor. Some people feel that pink is too bold to use on walls and it reminds them of childish or overly feminine decor. As a result, use pink as an accent colour to brighten a room and add a pop of color. To do this you can buy a statement piece, such as a sofa, appliance, table, headboard, or large piece of artwork, depending on the room you are decorating.Use subdued colors on the walls in order to allow the pink statement piece to act as a focal point in the room.;
, If you want to use pink in a more subtle way, try adding pink throws and pillows to your living room. This allows you to incorporate pink into your decorating pallet without breaking the bank on a large statement piece. You can also change your throws and pillows seasonally to mix things up in a fun way.


For example, you could use pink pillows and throws during the spring and summer months to brighten up your home.
 Another way to incorporate pink into your home decor is by painting one accent wall pink. This will allow the color pink to stand out and make a statement without feeling overdone. Try using a bright pink in a small space such as a front entryway or powder room. You could also create a pink accent wall in a bedroom, using a softer more romantic shade of pink, such as a blush or rose., Wallpaper can also be a great foundation for your color scheme. Patterned wallpaper will help to add texture to a room. You can try wallpapering the entire room, or just one wall depending on your preference. If you choose to use wallpaper on only one wall, you should paint the remaining walls in the room to match the background color of the wallpaper. This will create a seamless transition between the accent wall and the rest of the room.For example, if you choose a pink wall paper with tiny white flowers, pull out the pink background color and paint the remaining walls to match that shade of pink.

 A common way to prank someone is by messing with their food, so it’s best to bring your own food to school or make your own food at home. That prevents anyone from having the chance to mess with it.


If someone who is a prankster offers you food, refuse it. It’s likely they did something to it before they handed it to you!
Check condiments that you might use, too, like ketchup and mustard or salt and pepper. Loosening the lid so the next person to use it gets a whole lot more than they wanted is a classic prank!, Keep your gym clothes in a bag locked in your locker so no one can take them. Keep your phone in your pocket when you’re not using it so someone can’t take it and change the language in settings., If someone gives you a direction that sounds overly specific – like asking you to sit in a very specific chair – avoid it! This usually means they’re trying to set up a prank.

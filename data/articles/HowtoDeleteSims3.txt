 Ever since the Witches & Wizards update, you can delete Sims in the middle of playing the game.If you have an old version of the game (before October 2014), the delete button is a menu option in Create a Sim instead.
 Find the red circle with a line through on the right of the Sim portrait. Tap this to delete the Sim.
 In the popup menu, confirm that you want the Sim to "move out of town." This will remove the Sim from your game.

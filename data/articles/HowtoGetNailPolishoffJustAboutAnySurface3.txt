 Grabbing a towel and rubbing the excess nail polish up may be your first instinct, but don't do it. This will only push the nail polish deeper into the carpet fibers and spread it around. Instead, you want to scrap it up with a plastic putty knife, spatula or knife edge, and blot the area with a clean cloth.
 This works best with medium to dark colored carpets. Saturate the area with glass cleaner and then blot the nail polish with a clean cloth until the stain lifts.
 This is the best method for light or white carpet and should not be used on dark colors because it could remove the dye from the carpet. Pour a little non-acetone clear polish remover on a clean cloth and blot the area until the stain lifts.








Be sure the polish remover doesn't contain any dye as that could further stain the area.
 Pour rubbing alcohol on to a clean cloth, and then blot the polish up. Don't give up if the polish just seems to keep coming, you want to get every last bit out.
 Vinegar works great to remove nail polish from carpet. Simply pour some vinegar into a spray bottle and spray the affected area. Then, blot the area clean with a clean wash cloth and warm water.

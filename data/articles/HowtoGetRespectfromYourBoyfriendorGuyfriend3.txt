 Remember, respect is a two way street. If you want your boyfriend or guyfriend to respect you, show him respect as well.Make sure you listen to your boyfriend's boundaries as well. If a certain behavior bothers him, for example, do not engage in it.
Know and support your boyfriend's needs. If he's more introverted and needs alone time on occasion, for example, make sure to back off and let him be by himself when necessary.
 Think of you and your boyfriend as two unique, interesting individuals. Your relationship should be about teamwork. Your boyfriend and you each bring your own skills to the team and work together to solve problems and deal with obstacles.Be willing to compromise. A big part of teamwork is compromising on occasion. If you and your boyfriend don't see completely eye-to-eye on something, figure out a mutual solution that works for both of you., Everyone has a different sense of privacy. You may not mind your boyfriend looking at your phone or computer, for example, but he may want to keep his electronic devices private. Make sure you both understand and respect one another's need for privacy.Talk about issues with privacy as they come up. For example, "I need to look something up. Is it okay if I use your phone or would you prefer I stayed off of it?"

, You should never let resentment simmer in a relationship. If there are differences or disagreements, talk them over respectfully as they come up.If your boyfriend has complaints of concerns, listen to them without judgment and apologize if you hurt his feelings. You should also expect this kind of treatment in return.

If you don’t have this app yet, download it from your Windows Phone App Store.
 Once the app interface opens in the phone, you can find the home screen with four different options towards the bottom. Click the “Flight Search” button, which is the third from the list, above “Hotel Search.”

Select the type of trip—Tap the arrow beside “Round trip” and two options will drop down: “Round trip” and “One way.” If you want to check for to-and-from flights, select “Round trip.” If the flight you want is just one way, tap the other option.

To add the number of passengers, tap the arrow beside “1 adult.” Six options will drop down, ranging from 1–6 adults. Choose accordingly, depending upon on the number of adults that are travelling. As of now, there are no options for selecting the number of children travelling in MSN Travel.
 Enter the boarding station’s name in the “From” field and the destination station’s name in the “To” field, and then tap “Depart” to select the departure dates. Set the respective departure date by tapping the calendar. If you are going to search for a round-trip, enter the return date by tapping “Return.”

, Once you’ve entered all the necessary information, tap the “Search” button. This will give you a list of flights arranged according to Airline, Duration, Stops, and Price. Browse through the list, and decide accordingly which flights you believe make your journey economically feasible.

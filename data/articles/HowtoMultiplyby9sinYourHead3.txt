 This is true of the product of any number and 9. Knowing this can help you check your work as you multiply in your head.For example:9×2=81{\displaystyle 9\times 2=81}; 8+1=9{\displaystyle 8+1=9}9×5=45{\displaystyle 9\times 5=45}; 4+5=9{\displaystyle 4+5=9}9×12=108{\displaystyle 9\times 12=108}; 1+0+8=9{\displaystyle 1+0+8=9}


, Notice that the tens digit starts at 0 and goes up to 9. The ones digit works in reverse, starting with 9 and moving down to 0.For example:9×1=09{\displaystyle 9\times 1=09}9×2=18{\displaystyle 9\times 2=18}9×3=27{\displaystyle 9\times 3=27}9×4=36{\displaystyle 9\times 4=36}9×5=45{\displaystyle 9\times 5=45}9×6=54{\displaystyle 9\times 6=54}9×7=63{\displaystyle 9\times 7=63}9×8=72{\displaystyle 9\times 8=72}9×9=81{\displaystyle 9\times 9=81}9×10=90{\displaystyle 9\times 10=90}
, In this formula b=a−1{\displaystyle b=a-1} and c=9−b{\displaystyle c=9-b}. The expression bc{\displaystyle bc} does not indicate multiplication in this formula; rather, b{\displaystyle b} equals the tens digit in the product, and c{\displaystyle c} equals the ones digit in the productIn other words, to find the tens digit of the product, subtract 1 from the number you are multiplying by 9. Then, subtract that difference from 9 to find the ones digit. Note that this method only works when multiplying a single-digit number by 9.

For example, to calculate 9×7{\displaystyle 9\times 7}, you would first find:b=a−1{\displaystyle b=a-1}b=7−1=6{\displaystyle b=7-1=6}Thus, 6 is the product’s tens digit.Second, you would find:c=9−b{\displaystyle c=9-b}c=9−6=3{\displaystyle c=9-6=3}Thus, 3 is the product’s ones digit. So, 9×7=63{\displaystyle 9\times 7=63}

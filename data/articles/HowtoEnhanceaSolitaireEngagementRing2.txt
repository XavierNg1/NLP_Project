 The stack style is built with a solitaire ring along with a number of bands. You can choose what to add to the stack, how to stack the rings as well as the way the stack will look. From eternity bands studded with gemstone to multiple bands studded with gemstones or diamond, the choices are numerous.
 There are no specific rules to choose the number of rings to stack with the solitaire ring. You can stack as many rings as you are comfortable wearing.
 The solitaire ring here will be the focal point, and the stack is going to be built around it. Choose the placement of the solitaire ring; is it going to be at the top, bottom or the center in the stack?

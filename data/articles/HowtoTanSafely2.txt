 These are lotions, creams, and sprays that dye your skin to give the illusion of a tan.


Sunless tanners use a chemical called dihydroxyacetone which dyes the dead skin cells on your body. This means that it is only temporary, as it will last only until your body sheds the dead skin.
For an even tan, use an exfoliant to rub off dead skin cells prior to applying your sunless tanner.
Give your body an all-over even coating to avoid streaks and spots of color.
Self-tanners may not contain sunscreen. You can still get skin damage with a sunless tanner if you spend prolonged periods of time outdoors. Be sure to apply a sunscreen in addition to your self-tanner to keep your skin healthy.
Be sure the self-tanner you choose does not require time in the sun in addition to the lotion. Some self-tanners blend in with the other sunless options, but are not sunless at all.
 These contain a chemical dye that, over time, can turn your skin orange and damage your liver. , Apply lotion regularly to reduce the number of dead skin cells you shed, and increase the longevity of your tan.

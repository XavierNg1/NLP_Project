 The number’s square root is a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the first number. Another way of saying this is: “What can we multiply by itself to get the number in question?”


For example, the square root of 1 is 1 because 1 multiplied by 1 equals 1 (1X1=1). However, the square root of 4 is 2 because 2 multiplied by 2 equals 4 (2X2=4). Think of the square root concept by imagining a tree. A tree grows from an acorn. Thus, it’s bigger than but related to the acorn, which was at its root. In the above example, 4 is the tree, and 2 is the acorn.
Thus, the square root of 9 is 3 (3X3=9), of 16 is 4 (4X4=16), of 25 is 5 (5X5=25), of 36 is 6 (6X6=36), of 49 is 7 (7X7=49), or 64 is 8 (8X8=64), of 81 is 9 (9X9=81), and of 100 is 10 (10X10=100).;
, To find the square root of a whole number, you could also divide the whole number by numbers until you get an answer that is the same as the number you used to divide the whole number.


For example: 16 divided by 4 is 4. And 4 divided by 2 is 2, and so on. Thus, in those examples, 4 is the square root of 16, and 2 is the square root of 4.
Perfect square roots do not have fractions or decimals because they involve whole numbers.
 Mathematicians use a special symbol called the radical to indicate square root. It looks like a check mark with a line across the top going to the right.N equals the number whose square root you are trying to find. It goes inside the check mark symbol.Thus, if you are trying to find the square root of 9, you should write a formula that puts the "N" (9) inside the check mark symbol (the "radical") and then present an equal sign and the 3. This means the “square root of 9 equals 3.”

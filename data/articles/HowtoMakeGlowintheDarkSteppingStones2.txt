 You can place the whole bag of concrete into a wheelbarrow. Use a spade to break the bottom of the bag open, and lift the bag up. The concrete should spill out into the wheelbarrow. You may have to shake the bag a bit to get it all out., Glow powder is a special chemical that is designed to absorb energy from the sun through the day. You can find powders that are made to be compatible with concrete at your local hardware store. While the ratios vary, most manufacturers recommend that you create a dry mix of 85% concrete and 15% glow powder.For example, if you had a total of 10 gallons (38 L) of mix, 8.5 gallons (32 L) would be concrete and 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) would be glow powder.
Choose a powder with earth illuminate versus one with a zinc base for the best illumination.
 Consult the concrete bag to know how much water is needed. Pour the water in slowly, mixing as you go. When you are finished, your concrete should be a wet sludge-like consistency., Find or make a mold that is the size and shape that you want your stepping stones. Consider marking a level off point on each mold so every stepping stone is the same thickness. You should also have as many molds as you wish to have stepping stones. The concrete in the wheelbarrow will dry up before you get to pour a second round., For the fastest dry times, leave the molds in a dry, relatively warm place. It can still take 24 hours or longer for the concrete to completely dry. If you disturb the concrete before it is dry, you can cause cracks and other imperfections in your stones., If you used a reusable mold, use a knife or other prying tool to loosen the concrete. If your mold was disposable, you can just break the mold away from the concrete. Now, your stones are ready to set wherever you want them.

 You can get creative with the entrance, like setting the door farther back and closing it off with a fence and gate.
, Black paint is available on The Sims 2 IKEA Home Stuff Pack, but you can also download black walls that come with houses (see How to Download Stuff for The Sims 2).
 You can have it black, then add a dance floor with bright colored flooring varying in colors.
 Put neon flamingos or the Rave Against the Machine Lamp (or both!) everywhere! Add a home theatre, a few bars with stools, tables, pool tables (available with The Sims 2 University Expansion Pack), and speakers to make your club really awesome.

 It can either be black floor, or a basic roof. Whatever you like best.

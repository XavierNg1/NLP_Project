 Try to stick to a color-scheme of grey and silver (silver is her symbolic color). Add moon accessories (for example, a necklace).;
, Artemis is supposed to be beautiful so take care of yourself (she is not vain, though). If you wear makeup, do it naturally or try a little silver eyeshadow. Otherwise, simply be clean or be natural.
 Artemis is very mysterious and quiet. This doesn't mean that you can't have any friends but make sure they are close and you can trust them. She enjoys solitude; learn to enjoy being alone without feeling lonely.
 Artemis is not afraid of anything and has a tough attitude. She is pretty intelligent as well.
 Naturally, get involved with environmental organisations. Try joining Greenpeace, for example. You can also get a pet, like a dog. Also respect nature (don't trample on plants, don't throw trash on the ground, take your bike instead of the car etc.).
 Artemis' weapons are her bows and arrows so you should definitely take it up. Maybe you can even get your own bow and arrows but don't tell other people that they are "mythical" or anything like it. That is not a very Artemis-like thing to do.
 Artemis was quite hostile towards males. However, this is not recommended; do not be unnecessarily rude to men, seeing that you're not actually an all-powerful goddess. Instead, be respectful and simply keep your distance and don't be fooled by their wiles.


Artemis is chaste, so at least consider not having any male friends or a boyfriend.
If you are a teen, remember that teenage boys are still immature and they are not worthy of your time. Focus more on yourself and more important things in life.
 Know everything there is to know about the moon, for Artemis is the goddess of the moon. Study all the constellations' it's not impossible to learn all of them. Learn a lot about stars, their cycles, read quick facts, watch documentaries to help, etc. Basically. know a lot of facts about the night and embrace your love for it.

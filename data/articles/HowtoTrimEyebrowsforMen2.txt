 Plucking is generally painful, so be aware of that when you begin. If you pluck partway along the hair it will break rather than pluck cleanly out. Be cautious that you don’t start plucking hairs that are part of the main shape of your eyebrow. There’s a risk of over-plucking if you get caught up in it., Use the comb to line your eyebrows up as they usually grow, outward toward your temples. Pluck hairs whose root is clearly past the end of the main portion of the eyebrow. Only pluck hairs that grow alone, separate from the rest of the eyebrow.
 If your eyebrows tend to meet in the middle, you may want to reduce this extra growth. Start plucking at the center and work outward toward one eyebrow first and then toward the other. It is personal preference how much you want to pluck, but less is usually better.








Use your thumb as a guide for how far apart your eyebrows should be. Place your thumb directly centered between your eyebrows and pluck the hairs that fall under your thumb.
If you over-pluck your eyebrows, you’ll start to affect the natural shape, which is not usually what guys want to do.
 With your tweezers still in hand, look for hairs that are growing significantly above the main eyebrow. Pluck those strays. You’ll also want to look below the eyebrow, toward your eyelid. Pluck these hairs as well.

 A weight loss between 1/2 to 1kg per week is considered healthy.;
, The biggest factor in weight loss is diet. For a female to lose weight they need to stick to a diet of 4200-6300kj per day. It is also important to consider the types of foods that are being eaten. A small amount of lean protein such as egg, grilled chicken or fish should be eaten with each meal. Vegetables, fruit, whole grains and low fat dairy are also important.
 Hunger is often a conditioned response to eating. Learn to ignore it. When people think they are hungry they are often only thirsty or eating out of habit. Most hunger in overweight people is psychological.
 The next most important factor in weight loss is cardiovascular exercise. To really lose weight you should aim to do 45-60 minutes of running per day. If you can't run due to lack of fitness or health problems you should consider swapping this with cycling, rowing, walking or swimming.
 To look really toned and fit you should also consider starting a pilates, yoga or weights class. By doing 1-3 classes per week you will not only be thin but flexible and toned.

 Use a sharp kitchen knife to separate the florets from the stalks.


The florets should be cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces.
The stalks should but cut in half crosswise, and each half should be chopped into slices that are roughly 1/8-inch (3.175-mm) thick.
The stalks are more dense, so they must be cut into smaller pieces than the florets in order to cook them within the same amount of time.
 The pan should be able to hold 2 1/2 to 3 quarts (2 1/2 to 3 liters).. Top the stalks with 1/4 cup (70 ml) water


Do not use much more water than 1/4 cup (70 ml). Adding too much water will only cause the broccoli to boil. You need just enough water to create steam.
 Throw in the broccoli.
 Place a lid on the saucepan and cook the broccoli on the stovetop over high heat until steam forms.


It is crucial that you cover the saucepan securely in order to trap the steam inside.
 Turn the heat down to simmer the broccoli for another 3 minutes.


By turning the heat down, you ensure that the inside of the saucepan will remain hot enough to cook the broccoli but not so hot that it causes the water to boil the broccoli, instead.
 Carefully remove the lid and stir in the butter before serving.


Remove the lid so that the steam points away from your face. Otherwise, you may get burned.
Once finished, the broccoli should be tender-crisp. Mushy broccoli has been cooked too long.

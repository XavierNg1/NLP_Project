 Mid lane is especially good for soloing since both runespots are near and the river can protect a hero from harassment here.
It is possible to have two solo lanes if someone levels up in the forest by killing neutral creeps. This can only be done by heroes with special abilities, i.e. Lycan, Furion, Axe, etc.
A second solo lanes means that probably one hero has to lane against two heroes. Again only some heroes are capable of doing this. Lich is especially good at this.
 This means the late-game carry will be protected by a babysitter.

,, There are three ways to perform the next step - the method will depend on your preference:


Pour the boiled water into a teapot that you have already placed the freshly sliced ginger into. Put the lid on the teapot to stop the pot cooling down too quickly and to keep the aromatic ingredients in the tea. Steep for 10 - 15 minutes.
If you boil the water in a saucepan rather than in a kettle, you can add the ginger to the saucepan and simmer for 15 - 20 minutes. Let it sit for 5 minutes before pouring after simmering.
Use a tea ball to hold the sliced ginger and steep in a cup for 15 minutes. Make sure to use a saucer to cover the top of the cup to prevent the aromatic elements from escaping.
 Add sweeteners or flavour if desired.

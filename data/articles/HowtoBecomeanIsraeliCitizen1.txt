Citizenship will likely be granted when you are born in this case.;
, Even if you were not born in Israel, it is possible to become an Israeli citizen by birth if one or both of your parents is also an Israeli citizen.Your parents’ Israeli nationality can have been acquired by birth, by naturalization, by residence, or by the Law of Return.
To prove that your parents were Israeli, you’ll need to go to the Israeli consulate and bring any documentation you have attesting to their Jewish heritage. This can include passports, identification cards, birth certificates (if this info is listed on the document), marriage licenses, letters from Orthodox rabbis, etc.

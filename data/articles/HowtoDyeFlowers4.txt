 Fabric dye will successfully dye any type of flower, but because it involves boiling water and harsh chemicals, it will ruin fresh flowers. If, however, you have dried flowers that you are wanting to brighten up, you can use fabric dye to accomplish the task. Select any powder or liquid fabric dye; they all typically use the same process of mixing the dye with boiling water. Keep in mind that you can choose how light or dark your flowers will be based on how long you leave them in the dye.
 Flowers that are dyed tend to brown, making them a bit more difficult to dye. As a result, you should look for light-hued flowers, as dark color flowers will be too dark to dye effectively. White, cream, and light blue flowers are the best for this. Popular dried flowers include hydrangeas, baby’s breath, and roses. Keep in mind that your flowers need to have been fully dried for at least 2 weeks prior to dying them.


Avoid flowers that are damaged or discolored, as this will still show even when dyed.
 Each brand of dye will differ slightly in terms of instructions, but will involve mixing the packaged dye with a proportional amount of boiling water. While the dye is boiling, set up drop cloths or newspaper in the work area to avoid getting dye on your clothes or countertop.
 Hold a single dried flower by the stem so the bloom is pointed downwards. Slowly dip the flower into the dye, and hold it for 5-10 seconds. Pull it out and examine the color; if you’re happy with the hue, remove it completely. Otherwise, put the flower back in the dye until you reach the desired color, checking frequently.
 Using a clothesline or a drying rack, hang each of your flowers upside down to dry completely. Put them in a warm, dry room for the fastest drying time; leave them for at least 24 hours before using them as decorations.

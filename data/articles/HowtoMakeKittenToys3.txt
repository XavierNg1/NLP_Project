 Remove any labels from the bottle by soaking them in hot water and then scrubbing or using products like Goo Gone. Once the labels are removed, clean the inside of the bottle with soap and water to remove any powdery residue that may have accumulated.
 Use anything from beans to corn kernels to create rattling sound as your kitten bats the bottle across the room. While most pill bottles will have childproof (and kitten proof) lids, it’s always a good idea to fill the bottle with edible items just in case your kitten manages to open it., Secure the top tightly before letting your kitten play with the bottle. If your bottle doesn’t have a locking lid, you may consider gluing or taping the bottle shut to prevent the contents from spilling out.
 It’s always important to keep a close eye on your pet when it plays with toys—especially homemade ones. You may also need to retrieve the bottle toy if your cat happens to bat it under a sofa or somewhere it can’t reach.

 Head to the westernmost side of San Andreas, towards the beaches, and from there, take the Great Ocean Highway all the way north for a couple of miles until the road goes over a delta (where a river meets the sea).


Make a right turn on the last corner you’ll see before the road crosses over the delta. Keep following this road, and make a left turn around the first corner that lets you go left. This will lead you straight to Fort Zandcudo.;
, Just like with previous versions, military bases are restricted areas. The moment you set foot inside, your wanted level will rise up to 5 stars. Head towards the gates of the fort at full speed and ram through the gates. This will make it harder for the guards to shoot at you, increasing your chance of survival.
 Once you’re inside Fort Zandcudo, press the B button (for Xbox) or Circle button (for PS3/4) on your controller to bring up the phone. Select “Lester” (one of the non-playable characters that assists you through the game) from your contacts and choose “Cops turn a blind eye” (costs $5,000 to use) from the available options on the menu screen. This will stop the military guards inside the base from hunting you for 3 minutes.


This step is optional. You can simply take on the military guards inside the base, but this is not recommended as the soldiers here are equipped with heavy artillery, which can kill you with one shot.
 Once you spot a P-996 Lazer, found everywhere inside the base, press the Y button (for Xbox) or Triangle button (for PS3/4) to board the aircraft. Once you’re inside, press the UP button to take off and fly away.
 If you’re still inside the base once the 3 minutes has lapsed, other Lazer jets will start coming after you. To avoid these attackers, simply fly all the way up as far as your aircraft can reach. The pursuing jets will eventually stop chasing you and de-spawn once you’re high enough.


Congratulations! You just got a military jet in GTA Online.

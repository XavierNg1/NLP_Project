 Avoid stiff materials or starched fabric. Ideal materials would include: cotton prints, lawn cotton, gingham, soft linen, calico, etc. Even ribbon will work nicely. If you don't have any fabric spare at home, rummage through a sales basket at the craft shop; you only need enough to cover the rings. Some things to consider:


Whether you will have a mixed color theme or a single color
Whether you will have patterns or color merges around each ring;
, The size of the rings is up to you but it is advisable not to make them too large for your body size. The image above shows 6 rings being used to form the circle; you will need as many rings as form a circle suited to your wrist size.
 The width of the strips should be about 1–2"/2.5 centimeter (1.0 in)–5 centimeter (2.0 in); test the width on your rings for suitability. Whether you cut or tear the strips is up to you - it affects the finished look and either look is stylish. The length of the strips should be enough to wrap around each ring but if you run out, or want to intermingle colors, that's not a problem, as you can simply glue a new strip into place.
 When you meet the end, or join in a new piece, simply hot glue the strip into place.
, Hot glue each ring side by side to form the circle shape as seen in the image above. Leave to dry. Once dry, the bracelet is ready to wear.

 Bandanas are generally inexpensive and can be purchased at stores that sell clothing, beauty supplies, and household goods. Bandanas tend to be a standard size, which should work on most people's heads.Most bandanas are 24" x 24".
 Fold one corner of the bandana down, so that it points toward the opposite corner. If you have a very large head, you'll want to fold only a small piece of the bandana down. If you have a smaller head, you can afford to fold down a larger piece.You can experiment with different folds to see what fits your head the best.
 Grab the two far corners of the bandana. These are the corners on either side of the folded corner. Hold one in each hand. Holding the bandana this way, place it on your head so that the crease you folded sits above your eyebrows, going across your forehead.Pull the corners in your hands around to the back of your head.
 With the two corners behind your head, tie a snug single knot at the base of your skull. Hold the knot with one hand so it doesn't slip. Then, grab the corner in the middle that's on top of your head. Pull it down toward the single knot.Tie another knot with the two corners you were holding. This time, tie the knot above the middle corner you just pulled down.
You can adjust the tightness by pulling down the middle corner or retying the knot above it.

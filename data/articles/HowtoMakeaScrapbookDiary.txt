 It could be an old fashioned leather-bound book, or maybe it's a 3 ring notebook from the dollar store. It doesn't matter what it looks like as long as you're comfortable using it.;
, You could cover the outside in tinfoil and glue on pictures out of magazines, or you could cover the whole thing in paper and draw your own cover. You could even glue pictures or put stickers right on the notebook. It's up to you.
 Write about yourself. Include perhaps a picture of yourself, your family/pet, or something that represents you. After you've finished writing a bit about yourself, start looking around in magazines and on the internet for pictures you'd like to include once you really start your journal.
 Write about work/school, life, your thoughts and emotions, your friends and enemies. Write lists (of favorites or least favorites, such as food, songs, colors, people, things to do, etc). You could even write a master list all about yourself. Include everything that is your favorite (T.V show, movie, actor, food, type of pop, sport, book, animal, and get creative with your list!)

, Glue pictures in your diary that correspond with what you write-your family, your favorite animal, a trip you went on last summer. Paste in pictures you've printed from the internet, of favorite actors, singers, places...even embellish your diary with stickers, quotes, different colors of writing, there are no limits!

, Begin to glue in things from your daily life, or things that bring you good memories. Good things to start with are tickets from that great concert you just went to, bills or cards from your favourite restaurants, plane tickets from your most recent trip, and anything significant to you.
 You can draw pictures, glue in colourful symbols, diagrams and glitter, whatever you find appropriate for your diary. No one else is going to see it (unless you choose to show it to them) so be as imaginative and strange as you wish. Have fun with it!

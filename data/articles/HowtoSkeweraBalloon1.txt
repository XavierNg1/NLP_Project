 For this party trick, you’ll need a balloon, a wooden kabob skewer, a small amount of oil or dish soap, and some patience. All of these items should be easily purchased at your local grocery store.


The oil or dish soap is just for lubricating the skewer so you don’t need more than a teaspoon.
Metal or plastic skewers will also work for this trick.;
, For this trick to work properly, you don’t want to overfill the balloon. Blow it up until it is about two-thirds full. If you overfill it, just let a little bit of the air out before you tie the knot.You’ll know that you have the right amount of air if the top end of the balloon is a little bit darker than the sides.
 Oil serves as a lubricant for the skewer and helps prevent the balloon from popping. Soak the pointy end of the skewer in oil or simply rub a bit on the end with your fingers.While this step is not strictly necessary, it is recommended to increase the success of skewering the balloon.
If you use your fingers, watch out for splinters from the wooden skewer.
 While twisting the skewer, gently push the pointy tip into the darkest part of the top of the balloon. Continue to twist and push until the skewer penetrates through to the balloon., Push the skewer slowly through the balloon to the opposite side. When it comes into contact with the bottom near where the balloon is tied off, start to spin the skewer again. Don't push too hard, but use a little pressure as you push through. Don’t go through the knot itself, but next to the knot instead. Continue to spin and push the skewer until it breaks through the other side.If the balloon popped, try again with more spinning and gentle pressure. Practice makes perfect!

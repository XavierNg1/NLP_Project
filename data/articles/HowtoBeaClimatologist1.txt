 To be well-prepared for university studies in climatology, you’ll need to have a strong background in math and science subjects.In high school, sign up for and do your best to excel in the most advanced courses in chemistry, biology, physics, calculus, geography, and computer science.;
, Counselors are excellent resources to help you decide what to study and what universities to apply to according to your interests. Set up a meeting to discuss a plan of study with your assigned counselor. Discuss how best to prepare for the rigorous math and science demands of climatology coursework at the university level.


For example, ask your counselor something like, “To be accepted to a climatology program, how much math, science, and computing coursework do I need?”

, Look into after-school clubs and organizations that focus on science, math, and computing activities. In addition to improving your chances for college acceptance, taking part in these groups can expose you to ways in which your studies can be used outside the classroom.


Ask your counselor about joining a local club sponsored by 4-H,which is an organization that provides after-school professional development programs to middle- and high-school students.

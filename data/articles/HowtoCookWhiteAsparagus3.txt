 Prepare a rimmed baking sheet by covering it with parchment paper or a thin layer of nonstick cooking spray.

Alternatively, you could use a shallow roasting dish instead of a baking sheet. Glass and nonstick cookware do not need to be covered.
Avoid using aluminum foil. Minerals in the asparagus may react with aluminum and cause some unwanted discoloration.
Continue with the next step while the oven preheats.
 Cut roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the stem end of each spear and peel away the tough outer layer of skin.

For spears more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, you may also wish to cut each spear lengthwise to reduce the overall cooking time.
Peel the skin using a standard vegetable peeler. Hold each spear flat against the counter or table instead of holding it upright, and peel from top to bottom, starting about 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the tip.
 Place the white asparagus on your prepared baking sheet and lightly brush the spears with olive oil. Evenly sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Arrange the spears into a single layer to promote even cooking.
Lightly toss the spears using a fork or spatula after coating them to help spread out the oil and seasonings.
 Place the asparagus into the preheated oven and cook them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they turn tender and slightly browned.

The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the spears.
Consider stirring the asparagus halfway through the cooking time to help the spears cook evenly.
Note that the asparagus should be tender enough to pierce with a fork but firm enough to retain its shape.
 Remove the finished white asparagus from the oven and let it cool slightly for several minutes before serving it.

When prepared in this manner, you may not need to serve white asparagus with any accompaniments. Even so, hollandaise sauce or browned butter are popular garnishes worth considering.

 This is a very common cause of oil-based stains on leather purses. When doing a routine wipe-down, check the handles and clasps particularly, since the natural oils from your hands may also cause oily stains., Dust can settle on the white leather and affect its appearance. If your leather bag came with a dust bag (many designer purses do), store your purse inside it when you aren’t using it. If you don’t have a dust bag, an old pillowcase or garment bag will work., The sun’s rays can damage the leather's surface. Make sure you store it in a non-humid area with no direct sunlight. Stuff the bag with newspaper while in storage. This will help the leather bag keep its original shape., Wipe the leather down first with a dry microfiber cloth to ensure there’s no lingering dust or dirt. Rub a small amount of the conditioner onto the surface of the purse. Allow it to sit for several minutes, which allows the leather to soak up the hydration. Gently wipe the conditioner off with a clean microfiber cloth.Regular conditioning will keep the leather supple and prevent cracking.
Leather conditioner products can be purchased at shoe and department stores.

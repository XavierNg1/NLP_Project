 You will need some friends that are in on the surprise, so e-mail them or give them a special invite out of school. Here's an example:


Dear ______,
Come to my surprise party!
We'll have lots of fun! I hope you can come! The date is ________. Please meet me at (venue) ______. It would be nice if you could please wear black robes or clothes, and maybe green, red, blue or yellow ties. Please bring a stick or a wand too, and maybe a pocket watch! See you!
Love, ______

, If you are a girl, you need 2 boys. If you are a boy, you need a boy and a girl. This will be so you can make the Harry Potter trio, but this is optional. Some other choices are below.


3 girls - Hermione, Luna and Ginny
3 boys - Harry, Ron and Malfoy
2 girls, one boy - Hermione, Ginny, Ron/Harry

,,,, Make them be teachers. Grandparents and siblings can help as well! Older siblings can be prefects (make sure they choose their house), younger siblings can be the first years/ teachers' kids, Mom can be Professor Sprout (especially if she's a little bit chubby), Dad can be Snape, Granddad could be Dumbledore and Grandma can be McGonagall.
 Like for Dumbledore, "I have great pleasure in welcoming you to Hogwarts." Or for Professor Sprout, "Careful with those Mandrakes!" Prefects can stand outside the venue, guiding people in small groups to go up.
 Put maroon, green, blue and yellow balloons outside.
), a room filled with plants can be Herbology, and if you have a basement with lots of little bottles and collections, there's your Potions room.
 "Hallo!", they say, and off you go.
 Explain to them that the prefects and teachers will give out points, and the house with the most points wins. Tell them that they're going to get sorted.
 Put a magician's/witch's hat on their heads, and from behind somewhere, have someone secretly shout their house. Have siblings sorted too. For example:


Brown, Zoe? (a parent or grandparent)
"HUFFLEPUFF! (backstage person)

, Guide people around and then, sit down where you're going to have your party. Some cool things to try:


Hogwarts Disco Night!
Pin the Wand on the Wizard
Reading HP books or watching the movies
A Harry Potter trivia quiz (have a representative from each house, and award points/take away points for every answer.
 A little bit through the feast, have a professor or prefect come in screaming "TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL! Uh, I thought you wanted to know. *faints*" A professor (preferably Dumbledore) will tell everyone to not panic and evacuate to the basement, while they stay upstairs and banish the "troll."

, Some people will get panicky, but if they want to go home, whisper to them "Snape and Dumbledore will get this sorted out in a few moments. Now ssh." Give prefects the signal, and have a professor come out and say "All clear."

, Have people go in threes, and the people who find it get 60 points for their house. But remember to include 1 challenge, that the people who find the stone have to defeat a monster (you dressed up in a dragon suit).
 Have Dumbledore go announce it. "Hmm... may I have your attention, please? Thank you. In last place, with __ points, (house)______. In third place, with ___ points, _____. In second place, with a close to first finish with __ points, ____. And the winner, with an astounding ___ points, is.... _______!"

, Be a good host. Make sure everyone got one! And for the house cup winners, have a special little treat. Maybe a little chocolate.
 Normal shop-bought invites may be convenient but they don’t really have that Hogwarts feel. Instead, make your own invites by hand. Write out your invites by hand on some parchment, tie the envelope with a red ribbon and give the invites out. Don’t forget to print the Hogwarts crest on the envelope! Also, it might be fun to address people by their Harry Potter character names.


If you want your invites to look perfect, you can make the paper look old by scrunching it up and staining it with a tea bag. This will make the invites super cool!;
, That’s not a bedroom, it’s Albus Dumbledore’s office! Your house is literally waiting for you to turn it into Hogwarts. You garden could easily be the greenhouse or Hagrid’s monsters and mythical animals lesson. Your dining room would make a nice grand hall, don’t you think? Oh, and don’t forget Snape’s potion mixing class, along with all the common rooms!

, Add some sound effects from the movie like the sound of moaning myrtle in the bathroom or the mandrakes crying loudly in the greenhouse. You can even include Ron's car being crashed by the whomping willow. Most of these sounds can be found cheaply and sometimes freely online.
 It can’t be a real Harry Potter party if you don’t go searching for the Basilisk in your basement (which, of course, looks a lot like the Chamber of Secrets). You don’t need to use a real snake for this, just use your imagination. Somebody could dress up like Lord Voldemort while the others try to defeat him. There’s lots to be done so be sure to try everything.


It doesn’t all need to be fighting though. You can try having some potion mixing classes, joining a wizard chess club or even having a magic duel. Remember that no physical fighting or deadly spells are allowed though!

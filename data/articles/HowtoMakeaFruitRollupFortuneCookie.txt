 Cut paper into thin, 4-inch strips. Cut one strip per cookie.


Write your fortune on the strip of paper. Be creative and consider adding flourishes such as hearts or happy faces.;
, Consider mixing and matching your rollups--lay a red rollup on a flat surface, top with a pink rollup and then add another red or color of your choosing.
 Center your cookie cutter, making sure you donâ€™t cut off any ends and the result will be a complete circle.
 Lay fortune with message side facing upward. No need to fold it, unless the length is so long that paper hangs from the sides.
 The result will be a half moon shape with the fortune contained inside.
 This will form the fortune cookie.

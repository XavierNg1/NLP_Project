 Leave 3 to 4 inches to hang down at each end.


Coordinate the ribbon color with the dress and the flower.
 Make a small slit in the center for the flower stem.
 This flower should be able to stand on its own.


Lilies, Sunflowers, Gerbera daisies, Hydrangeas, etc., are the right size.
 Leave about 2 1/2 inches (6.35 cm). Wrap the stem with floral tape to protect it and to keep it from slipping out of the slit after it's been inserted.



Use floral glue or tape to keep the blossom from moving.

, Immediately after the dog has been sprayed, wash it outside using a garden hose and the following homemade solution:


1/4 cup of baking soda, 2 teaspoons of a dish washing product, and two pints of hydrogen peroxide. Mix these in a bucket that you can dispose of after use.
Change into old clothes that you don't mind getting rid of, and wear a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands.
Use a sponge or washcloth to scrub in the solution. Be sure to keep the solution out of your dog's eyes and nose, as it can cause irritation.
 You may need to repeat this process a few times to eliminate the odor completely.


Be sure to thoroughly rinse your dog with lukewarm water to completely remove the solution, and dry your dog when you are finished.

 If you suspect that you are having menstrual pain because of secondary dysmenorrhea, then make an appointment with a gynecologist right away. Secondary dysmenorrhea can indicate that you have a serious medical problem that requires prompt treatment.
 Your gynecologist will take a thorough health history and ask questions about your current condition as well. It is important to provide honest answers to these questions. Some of the questions your doctor may ask might include:When did you have your first period?
When did your symptoms start?
Does anything make your symptoms worse or better?
How is the pain affecting your daily life? Is it interfering with your normal daily activities?

, After taking a thorough health history, your doctor will also need to do a physical exam. As part of this exam, your doctor will examine your vagina, vulva, and cervix to check for masses and abnormalities. Your doctor will also examine your abdomen for signs of swelling.Depending on the findings of the exam, your doctor may decide to run blood tests or imaging tests. These tests can provide your doctor with additional information to help him or her make a diagnosis.
 Some symptoms may indicate a serious problem and you should share these with your doctor right away. Call or visit your doctor right away if you have had:a sudden onset of pain
pain that does has not gone away
a fever

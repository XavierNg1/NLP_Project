 Cold porcelain clay is a great alternative to polymer air dry clay for craft projects like clay candle holders, jewelry and other small sculpted items. It's a delicate clay that shrinks up a bit as it dries. Here's what you'll need:


1 cup cornstarch
1 cup school grade white glue
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons canola oil
Plastic wrap
Microwave-safe bowl
Extra oil so the clay won't stick to your hands

, Add the wet ingredients first: the glue, vinegar and canola oil. Then stir in the cornstarch until the mixture is completely smooth with no lumps. The texture will be gooey.
 Remove the bowl and stir the mixture, which will be hot and still gooey.
 Remove the bowl and stir the mixture. The surface should now be slightly firm instead of gooey.
 Give it 10 or 15 more seconds, then remove the bowl and check the mixture. The clay should have pulled together to form a sticky, lumpy ball.









If the clay still looks gooey, microwave it for another 15 seconds. The finished clay should still be sticky and pliable; if it seems dry, you've overcooked it.
 After it has cooled for a few moments, oil your hands with cooking oil and knead the clay for about three minutes, until it is smooth and stretchy in texture. Form it into a ball, then pull it apart to test it. The dough is ready when it stretches and forms a peak when you pull off a piece. If it breaks into bits, it's overcooked.
 If you're not going to use it right away, store it in tightly-wrapped plastic wrap to keep the moisture content high.

 Cutting laminate to width is necessary on the last piece used before you get to an obstacle like a wall, fireplace, cabinet or pipe. Take a full sheet of laminate and lay it on top of the second-to-last piece. Line the sheet up so that it fits snugly against the wall.


Leave the sheet there while you create your template.
Carefully measure the amount of overlap with your tape measure.
 Use a scrap piece of laminate to create a template. Make sure to cut the scrap to be the same width as the overlap. Then place the template on top of the laminate sheet you need to cut, which should still be lined up closely against the wall.


Push the template snugly against the wall, as well.If you’re cutting laminate flooring, add ¼ inch to account for possible expansion.
 Use the template to mark your cut line onto the laminate's surface with the non-permanent marker, then put the template aside. Use your cutting tool to saw along the marked line. Since this is another straight cut, a circular saw, jigsaw or handsaw will work best.


After you make the cut, use a damp cloth to wipe away any remaining ink from the laminate’s surface.

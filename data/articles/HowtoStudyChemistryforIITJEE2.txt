 The chemistry portion of the IIT JEE covers physical, organic, and inorganic chemistry. It is multiple choice (30 questions) where each question will have four possible answers and only one will be correct. For every correct answer you get +4 marks, but for every incorrect answer, you get -1 mark. Unanswered questions are marked as zero (no points added or deducted). The exam can be taken either on paper or on a computer.Because there is a penalty for guessing, make sure you are confident with your answer before marking it.
 Topics within physical chemistry that you will be tested on include: atomic structure, chemical bonding, equilibrium, electrochemistry, chemical kinetics, solid state, states of matter, solutions, redox reactions, surface chemistry, stoichiometry, and thermochemistry.The physical chemistry portion of the exam accounts for about 30-40% of the whole exam and is considered the most important section.
 The essential topics covered for organic chemistry are: purification and analysis of organic compounds, general organic chemistry, hydrocarbons, isomerism, alkyl halides and aryl halides, alcohols, phenols, and ethers, carbonyl compounds, amines and nitrogen-containing compounds, biomolecules, and environmental chemistry.Like the physical chemistry portion, the organic chemistry section is about 30-40% of the exam.
The majority of the questions will be related to general organic chemistry (9%) and alcohol, phenols, and ethers (7%).
 For inorganic chemistry, you need to know about the properties of S, P, D, and F block elements, coordination compounds, polymers, general principles and processes of isolation of elements, and hydrogen.This portion of the exam is about 25-30% of the questions. It is generally considered to be the easiest section.

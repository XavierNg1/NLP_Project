This is especially important if you are using it while on a boat or around water. If your monocular falls into the water, it can sink.
 While you can buy a waterproof monocular, these are often more expensive. If you are on a boat or kayak, you can protect your monocular by keeping it in a zipped freezer bag while it is not in use. Make sure that it is completely sealed to ensure that water does not get inside.You can even double-bag the monocular for even more protection.

 Hang your laundry to dry on a clothesline outside once they’ve finished washing. Freshen your clothes with more sunlight and air circulation than a dryer allows. This is an especially good idea if any articles were particularly stinky to begin with.Of course, this is only a good idea if outside is smelling nice and fresh. So if your neighbor is smoking meats for a barbecue or something like that, stick to the dryer instead.
 Choose a strongly-scented bar of soap to store with your clean laundry to make them smell fresh and clean long after they’ve been washed. Simply place the soap in a cotton muslin bag or stitch together a pouch for it using a similarly light fabric that will allow the scent to escape. Then place one in each drawer to your dresser, as well as your closet., If the smell of soap isn’t something you want to carry with you, try filling cotton muslin bags with your favorite herb(s) instead. Store these in your drawers and closets to scent your clothes. Additionally, fill some bags that are small enough to fit in the pockets of whichever clothes you wear the least to keep smelling nice for longer periods., Keep your clothes smelling sharp with a scented fabric spray. Use a store-bought product like Febreeze if that suits your fancy. Or, make your own by filling a spray bottle with water and adding some drops of your favorite essential oil.Some essential oils may stain white or light fabrics. Before spritzing your whole wardrobe, do a test spray on an article that you don’t care about to make sure it won’t do so., If your closet or dresser has its own distinct smell that you’d like to keep out of your clothes, open a box of baking soda and keep that inside to absorb the closet or dresser’s odor. Alternatively, try filling an open container with coffee grounds and use that instead. Either way, replace it periodically (about once a month) since these can only absorb so much.

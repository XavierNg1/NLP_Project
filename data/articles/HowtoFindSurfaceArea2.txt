 Like a cube, a rectangular prism has six sides, but unlike a cube, the sides are not identical. In a rectangular prism, only opposite sides are equal.Because of this, the surface of a rectangular prism must take into account the various side lengths making the formula SA = 2ab + 2bc + 2ac.


For this formula, a equals the width of the prism, b equals the height, and c equals the length.
Breaking down the formula, you can see that you are simply adding up all of the areas of each face of the object.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.
 All three measurements can vary, so all three need to be taken separately. Using a ruler, measure each side and write it down. Use the same units for each measurement.


Measure the length of the base to determine the length of the prism, and assign this to c.

Example: c = 5 cm

Measure the width of the base to determine the width of the prism, and assign this to a.

Example: a = 2 cm

Measure the height of the side to determine the height of the prism, and assign this to b.

Example: b = 3 cm


, Remember, there are 6 faces of a rectangular prism, but opposite sides are identical. Multiply the length and height, or c and a to find the area of one face. Take this measurement and multiply it by two to account for the opposite identical side.Example: 2 x (a x c) = 2 x (2 x 5) = 2 x 10 = 20 cm2


, Like with the first pair of faces, multiply the width and height, or a and b to find the area of another face of the prism. Multiply this measurement by two to account for the opposite identical sides.Example: 2 x (a x b) = 2 x (2 x 3) = 2 x 6 = 12 cm2


, The final two faces of the prism will be the ends. Multiply the length and width, or c and b to find their area. Multiply this measurement by two to account for both sides.Example: 2 x (b x c) = 2 x (3 x 5) = 2 x 15 = 30 cm2


, Because surface area is the total area of all of the faces of an object, the final step is to add all of the individually calculated areas together. Add the area measurements for all the sides together to find the total surface area.Example: Surface Area = 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 12 + 30 + 20 = 62 cm2.

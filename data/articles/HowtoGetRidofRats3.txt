 Remember to identify these areas by paying attention to where you notice rat droppings or areas that have been chewed. If the rats were in the area before, they probably will be in the area again. If they are living in your attic try to find the entrances they are using and set the traps there.
 Experts consider this the most humane way to get rid of rats. Set a cage with a little bit of food inside of it. The spring release door will trap the rat as soon as it is inside the cage. You will then have to pick up the cage and release the rat somewhere.
 Bring them out into the woods somewhere a good distance from your house. You don’t want to worry about them finding their way back to your home and returning. They’ll find a new home somewhere, hopefully not where a person is already living.

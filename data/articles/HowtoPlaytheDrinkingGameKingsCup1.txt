 To play, fan out a deck of cards, face down, around an empty cup (the "King's Cup"). Make sure everyone has a full drink of some sort. Players take turns drawing a card, then acting out the action described in the cheat sheet. For example, if someone draws a 3, that player must take a drink. If they draw a 5, all the guys playing must drink, etc. Continue until the final King is drawn or there are no more cards to turn over, whichever you prefer.;

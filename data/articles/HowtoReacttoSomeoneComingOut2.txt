 Reassure them that you care about them and want them to be happyâ€”whether that means following the "traditional" path or not.
 Express thanks that they trusted you enough to open up to you about something that is still hated by many people.
 Make sure they know you're accepting and supportive. The LGBTQ+ community faces a ton of prejudice, which is why many live in fear to come out. Let them know that you aren't to be feared, that you're an ally and support them no matter what.

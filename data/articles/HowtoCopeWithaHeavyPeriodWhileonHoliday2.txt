 You probably already know to take a pain reliever, but you’ll enjoy your time at the beach or pool more if you take extra precautions to avoid cramps.Sit near a bathroom, and use it regularly. This is not just because staying hydrated is so important both in the sun and on your period, but also because not going to the bathroom frequently can exacerbate cramps.
Sit with your legs elevated or lie on your stomach — both positions that can alleviate cramps.
Limit your intake of caffeine, which can make cramps worse.
 Don’t think you have to avoid the water. Your tampon or menstrual cup will not fall out, and you will be perfectly safe. There is virtually no way anyone could know that you are getting your period. Moreover, getting in some activity can mitigate your period symptoms, especially if you are experiencing a heavier-than-normal flow.


The same goes for volleyball, badminton, or whatever other activities are happening. Feel confident joining in!

, If you absolutely cannot stand tampons or menstrual cups, you can wear a pad to the beach or pool — as long as you’re willing to stay out of the water. Look for a very thin one without wings, and be extra safe by wearing shorts or a sarong over your swimsuit.
 You already know that it is imperative to wear sunscreen every day, and to up your coverage when you are at the beach or pool. But being on your period brings other considerations into play.


Since many women break out during their periods, make sure you are using a sunscreen that will not make this worse.
Look for products with labels like “oil-free,” “non-comedogenic,” “won’t clog pores,” or “breakout-free.”
Remember that even skin-friendly products can lead to breakouts if you are not washing your face regularly, which is especially important when you are both on your period and exposed to lots of different elements.

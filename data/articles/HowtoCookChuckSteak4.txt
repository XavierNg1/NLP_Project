 If you're buying steak to feed several people, try to choose smaller steaks that are about the same size. If you can't find any, you can purchase one or two larger steaks to cut into smaller portions. This way, the steaks will cook evenly.


Chuck steaks can be irregular since they include a lot of muscle from the shoulder area of the beef. Look for a chuck steak that doesn't have too much fat and seems to be an even thickness., Try to use your fresh chuck steaks as soon as you bring them home. If you can't use them immediately, you can refrigerate them for up to 2 or 3 days. To store them, remove them from the plastic wrap covering and place them in a non-plastic dish. Cover the dish loosely so there's some air flow. Put the steaks in the meat compartment of your fridge or put them on the bottom shelf so any juices don't drip onto other food.When handling and storing raw meat, it's important not to place, touch or store raw and cooked meat together. Keep them in separate compartments and use different cutting boards when wrapping and handling them.
 For a classic meal, serve the chuck steak with cooked potatoes (mashed or roasted) and a side salad. For more adventurous sides, consider serving the chuck steak with coleslaw, roasted vegetables, a vegetable gratin, or sauteed mushrooms. You can also serve the steak with almost any kind of sauce (barbecue, pesto, hollandaise, or a flavored butter).You can also thinly slice the chuck steak and serve with stir-fried vegetables and rice. Or you can fill a tortilla with the thinly sliced chuck steak to make fajitas.

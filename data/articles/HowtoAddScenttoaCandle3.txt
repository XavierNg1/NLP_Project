 Scented cubes are small wax cubes with a powerful scent. Most large retailers carry scented cubes and there are hundreds to choose from. While most people place them on a warmer,causing them to melt and emit a smell, they can be used alongside candles.
 Using a candle of your choosing, let it burn for several minutes or until about an inch-deep pool of melted wax has accumulated around the wick. Once this happens, place the scented wax cube into the melted wax. The flame will help the scented wax continue to melt down and emit a strong smell that will fill up the room.


Sense the wax cubes are so strong, consider cutting them in half using a butter knife.
 The scented wax will melt to form a layer of wax. Every time you light this candle, the scented wax layer will continue to emit a smell for quite some time.

 Investing in the tools of the trade can become expensive, so you should try it and have a desire to continue before you buy too many tools.


You can take cake decorating classes from local culinary schools, cake decorators and caterers. Keep an eye out for Lifelong Learning classes. If you know a cake decorator, ask for a private tutorial, and pay them for their materials and time.
If you want to become a professional, the standard for cake decorating courses is taught by The Wilton School of Cake Decorating & Confectionery Art. You will find some kits and products made by the Wilton school. You can go to their website to find class locations and other information.;
, The following are a few things you will want to have to get started:


You will need featherweight piping bags . Get at least 3 washable bags or a larger package of disposable bags, so that you can use different colors. Make sure to get couplers for changing the tips on the piping bags.
Decorating tips are important for using pastry bags. You will need a leaf tip, writing tips, border tips. Get approximately 5 tips to practice on, unless you find a good deal on a large set. You will also want to buy a rose tip, in order to learn how to make frosting roses.
Find a lazy Susan. A turning base is necessary to create an even look on a round cake. You will learn the art of turning the lazy Susan as you apply frosting.
Buy several stainless steel spatulas for spreading frosting. Find a medium and large spatula, because they will be useful with different sized cakes.
Buy gel food coloring. Although liquid food coloring will also work, the pros prefer gels for their intense colors and ease of use.
Make sure your kitchen has a balloon whisk, a pastry scraper and tweezers. These will help you make whipped toppings, transfer frosting and set small details, respectively.
 If you are interested in saving some money, then comparison shopping at stores and websites is necessary. Take notes as needed.

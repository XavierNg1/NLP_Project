 Show them the written record. This is useful because it has details you may no longer remember, and it spares you the need to retell every painful instance.

Focus on the facts, and how you felt, like you did in your log. This way, instead of the person writing you off as biased or name-calling, they will be more likely to believe you and see you as fair and in need of help.
 There are several hotline numbers you can call to tell someone about the abuse., Explain the abuse to the emergency dispatcher. From there, get the police department to help you:

Stop the abuse long enough for you to escape or be brought to a safe place.
Arrest the teacher for being abusive.
Report the abuse by being interviewed, having pictures of yourself taken, and talking to possible witnesses, such as other students and teachers.
 Some people will not believe you if you tell them, which means you'll need to go to their boss or the local police station and get someone who's willing to listen., You can also consider suing the school board if they did nothing to help you through the abuse despite your pleas, or perhaps even backed the teacher's actions. If you live in the U.S.A., its ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) are good people to go to for help in suing. They'll help you file a lawsuit against your teacher and take him/her to court. This should only be done if none of the above has helped.

Talk with your parent(s)/guardian(s) about the decision. They will be helping you if you decide to go through with it.
If possible, gather people who have also been abused in the past or are currently being abused by the same teacher, and see if they're willing to serve as plaintiffs with you in your lawsuit against the teacher, who'll be named a defendant.

 Because they are relatively easy to fly, these two types of kites are great for beginners. They fly well in light to medium winds, about 6 to 15 mph winds., Choose one of these kites if you want something a little more challenging than the delta or diamond kite. They need stronger winds to fly, about 8 to 25 mph winds., Because they are easier to control, single line kites are recommended for beginners. Single line kites are most suitable for light to medium winds. However, if you want to fly your single line kite in stronger winds, then add a tail to it.When choosing a tail for your kite, choose one that is made of lightweight materials.
 Dual line kites, also known as sport or stunt kites, require more experience to fly. You can fly dual line kites in light, moderate, and heavy winds. Additionally, with two lines, the flier has more control over the kite.You can also do maneuvers and tricks, like loops, with dual line kites

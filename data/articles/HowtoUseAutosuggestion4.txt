 Pick a specific time to visualize your autosuggestions. Setting a schedule will help you maintain a consistent schedule, which will help the autosuggestions succeed.


The moments before you sleep and when you awake are the best because you are more prone to suggestion.
 While you sit comfortably, try to relax and let go of your thoughts. Breath deeply and regularly. Visualization and autosuggestion work best when you are relaxed since you mind is more open to suggestion.
 You can stand or sit during this method with your eyes closed.
 As you repeat your autosuggestions, visualize yourself experiencing them. Attach as much meaning as you can to what you imagine. The more emotion you put into the visualization, the more efficient it becomes. , Try to involve every sense as you imagine your autosuggestion coming to life. Try to see, hear, feel, smell, and touch the scene your picture.
 Imagine how the autosuggestion would make you feel. Attach that feeling to what you picture. For example, if you see yourself getting a promotion, imagine how you would feel if that happened: happy, successful and self-assured., Visualize scenes in which you are using your autosuggestion. Slightly move your body and use hand gestures as you would in a situation where you would use your autosuggestion. For example, if your autosuggestion is “I am a good public speaker,” then picture yourself giving a wonderful speech in front of an audience. Imagine yourself doing hand gestures and emphasizing your point.
 Try to visualize two or three times a day. Make sure you practice the visualization consistently. Visualization and autosuggestion only work if you repeatedly do them.

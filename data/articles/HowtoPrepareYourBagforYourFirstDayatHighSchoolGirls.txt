 If you want to have a lunch from the cafeteria, don't forget your money. Most schools differ in how much the food costs, but it's better to be safe and bring $10-15.

Maybe a granola bar? It's important to eat and keep hydrated so that you can stay focused during your classes.
 Perhaps a book for the bus ride, some aspirin, your phone, etc. These things will come handy throughout the year.

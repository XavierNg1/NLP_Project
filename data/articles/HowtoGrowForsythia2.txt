 If you have gone a few days to a week without rain, your forsythia could use a drink. Spray it down with a garden hose until the soil feels and looks damp. The shrub does not like frequent drenching, but it can tolerate a little excess water better than it can tolerate a long period of dryness.


Note that extra watering may not be necessary during spring, autumn, and winter, when you are likely to receive precipitation regularly. If you have a particularly dry summer, though, extra watering will likely be needed.
 To promote all around strength, use a light fertilizer with a 10-10-10 formula, meaning that it has equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Alternatively, you can use a 10-20-10 fertilizer, which contains a higher dose of phosphorus, to encourage brighter, more vibrant flowers.
 Forsythia is fast growing, so even if you prune a lot at once, the foliage and blooms grow back quickly. New flowers grow on old growth, rather than new, so you should cut the branches down as soon as the flowers begin to wither. Cut at least 1/3 of the oldest branches down until they are about 4 inches (10 cm) from the ground. Try to prune according to the shrub's natural shape to keep the forsythia looking its best and fullest.
 Forsythia plants are not prone to many problems, but a wayward pest or fungal disease can strike if the conditions are right. Treat the plant with pesticides and fungicides only when needed, however, since you do not need to worry about taking preventative measures.

 The focus box is the small square bordered by white lines on the minimap that shows the section of the map that is currently being viewed on the game screen. Using the left mouse button, click, hold, and drag the white focus box to move to different parts of the minimap and hence the game world.
 To move to a different part of the minimap, just drag the focus box to that particular location again.
 Like navigating to other locations, you can navigate back to your town by dragging the focus box to it. You can also use the hotkeys (H for AoE1 & 2, or T for AoE3) to quickly focus on the Town Center.

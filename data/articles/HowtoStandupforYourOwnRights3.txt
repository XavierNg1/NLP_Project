 Before you can take any action to protect your rights, or to respond to a violation of your rights, you must be aware of which of your rights is being violated. Think about the situation carefully, as your case will be much stronger if you can point to a specific right that you possess as a citizen that was clearly violated by another.


For example, if you believe that a police officer violated your rights by searching your car during a traffic stop without cause or consent, this would represent a violation of your fourth-amendment rights.
 Once you have identified the specific right in question, make sure you fully document the circumstances surrounding the violation. After you have assembled your evidence, write out a full statement of the incident.


While you are writing this statement, think about the answers to the basic questions of who, what, when, where, and why.
 If your rights were violated by a member of an organization, you can try contacting that organization to see if they have a process by which you can report the violation of your rights. If your rights were violated by the government, contact the agency that employs the person who violated your rights. If your rights were violated by a private citizen, you will likely turn to your county court for relief.
 Depending on the nature of the violation, the agency, organization, or individual responsible may not be forced to answer for and correct their violation either on their own or by order of their superior. In this case, you will have to resort to the legal system to protect your rights, and talking with a lawyer is the best way to get started. This person will be able to advise you on a wide variety of issues, like how to argue your case, where to argue it, how long the lawsuit might take, and your chances of success.


If your fourth-amendment rights were violated, any evidence against you obtained via an illegal search or seizure will be inadmissible in court.

 If you want to exfoliate outside of the shower, you can use circular motions with a long-handled, natural bristled brush.


This brush is available in the cosmetics section of most box stores, like Target and Walmart, as well as in natural food stores.
Start with your legs and move slowly up your body. Always brush in a circular motion in a small area before moving onto the next area. Work up toward your chest, then brush your back and arms.;
, These products are made with natural sponge and help to exfoliate the skin in the shower.


These products are not suggested for use on the face.
 It should say "body scrub" or "cleansing scrub." (Do not buy products with beads - these are now illegal in the US due to environmental damage.)


Allow the shower to run over your skin for a few minutes, if you are using an exfoliating scrub or a loofah. Choose warm, not hot, water. Water that is too hot will dry the skin.
Rub the loofah or the scrub over your moist skin in a circular motion. Rinse well. Perform this exfoliation process every 3 to 7 days, depending upon your skin's sensitivity.

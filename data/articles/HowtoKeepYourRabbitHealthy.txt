 Feed your rabbit a timothy-based pellet (Oxbow or Nature's Promise are great), with no colorful pieces, along with timothy hay (even for young rabbits as alfalfa has too much calcium and can cause a urinary tract infection or U.T.I.) free choice. Make sure your rabbit is eating the hay, and is not eating too much of the pellet portion. Don't feed your rabbit fruits or veggies before they are at least 3 months, and even then, slowly introduce them.;
, The bedding with larger pieces can cause harm to the rabbit because it can block the intestines. Change the cage at least once a week, and do spot cleaning when needed. Try to litter train your rabbit,as the cage would need to be changed less frequently.
 Place a box or a tunnel so the rabbits can hide but make sure that the tunnel or the box is secure to rain and heat. and make sure that your rabbits can get out of the box or the tunnel.
 If your solid bottom cage is dirty, you must clean it to avoid urine scald.
 Do this at least once everyday.
 This will make your rabbit feel more confident., Check your rabbits bottom for material, and if there is something stuck to your rabbit's bottom you may need to increase fiber in the diet (ie. add more timothy hay, or a better pellet). Check the rabbit for any bumps, or sore areas and monitor the rabbit's behaviour. If the rabbit's behaviour changes dramatically, bring him/her to the vet.

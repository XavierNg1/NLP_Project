 Before you begin, it’s important to put a primer over your entire lid. A makeup primer will help smooth out and conceal any imperfections in your eyelid, and it will also create a smooth base for your makeup to stick to. It will prevent smudging and creasing in any look you create. Apply a dot of primer on your finger, and then gently dab it over your eyelid.








After applying the primer, make sure to let it sit for a minute and really sink into the lid.;
, You certainly don’t need to wear eyeshadow with this look, but you can. If you want to wear eyeshadow, choose a neutral color so that your candy cane liner is the star of the show. A taupe color or even a soft gold shimmer can look gorgeous with this liner. Blend it over your entire lid before moving on to the liner.
 Liquid liner is the best type of liner to use for this look, because it will create the sharp, ultra-pigmented strip above your lashes that you need. Begin in the inside corner, moving carefully to the outer corner. Go over this line a few times until it is opaque, and make sure it is thick enough so that you have room to add red stripes. Then, create a wing. Adding a wing to your eyeliner will help highlight the candy cane effect that you’ll be creating.








You can find white liquid eyeliner at your local beauty supply store.
 The best way to do this is either with a red gel liner and a small eyeliner brush, or with a red liquid liner. You can find both of these at your local beauty supply store. With your small eyeliner brush, start creating little stripes along the white band you created. Alternate between thick stripes and thin stripes, just like the pattern on real candy canes. Add stripes along the entire lash lines as well as the wing.

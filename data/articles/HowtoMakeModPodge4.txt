The homemade version is less-adhesive, and lacks varnish or sealer.To make your homemade Mod Podge more durable, consider spraying your project with an acrylic sealant after the Mod Podge has dried., Store-bought Mod Podge comes in all sorts of finishes from glossy, to satin, to matte. It even comes in glow-in-the-dark and sparkling varieties. Unless you add varnish or glitter, your homemade Mod Podge will be matte.

 When you play, the angle of the violin will fluctuate from left to right depending on the type of music and your comfort level. However, the angle should not deviate too much more than 20 degrees. , The violin has a tendency to drop with bad posture, so check your posture if you notice the violin dropping constantly. To help with this, tie a rope from the ceiling and attach it to the scroll of the violin. Make sure that the rope is short enough that it is taut when the violin is in the proper position. , Hold the neck between your left thumb and forefinger, as if you are pinching it. You don’t need to hold it too tightly or you will cramp your hand.
 The remaining fingers should not touch the violin. The violin should rest on that knuckle lightly. The weight of the violin should be distributed evenly between this knuckle and your collarbone. , Do not twist your wrist. This positioning will change depending on the type of music being played and which strings you are using. This is the basic 1st position.
 You need to hold the bow at the end of the bow. Don’t choke up on it like a baseball bat. Hold it with your right thumb and fingers. Your forefinger should rest on top of the bow's pad and your pinky finger should sit on a screw. Now you are ready to play.

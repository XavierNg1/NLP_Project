Strictly speaking, since the fruit has not been cut open and the cell membranes have not been cut, it is not essential to place the avocado in a plastic bag or storage container. Doing so may extend the life of the fruit by another day or so, but this is only debatable.
 Place the avocado in a fruit drawer or at the back of a shelf in your refrigerator.


Do not keep ripe avocados out on the counter at room temperature, even if the fruit is whole and intact. The cold temperatures of the refrigerator can slow down the ripening process. As a result, an avocado stored in the refrigerator will take much more time to over-ripen and turn bad when compared to one kept out on the counter.
 A ripe, whole avocado stored in this manner should last for about three to five days.


If the avocado begins to feel mushy, or if the fruit bruises or gets a permanent indentation when pressed, it has become over-ripe and may no longer be good to eat.

 Get some tights or leggings that are bigger than your size. Make sure the legs are longer than yours. Youâ€™ll also need swimming fins/monofins, scissors, and duct tape.


Use brightly colored leggings, that are slightly thick so you can't see your legs., Put both of your legs through one of the leg holes. This may be hard if you use tights. Make sure your waist fits into the leg hole. This will be your tail. Make sure some of the fabric covers your feet.Tuck the extra leg hole into your tail by wrapping it around your waist to make it look fashionable. Then simply tuck it into the back or side of the tail.
 Put on swimming fins or monofins that fit your size onto your feet. These will be your mermaid fins.


If you are using leggings, cover the connection between the tail and the fins.

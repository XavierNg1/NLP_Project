 Even if you have used vegetable or coconut oil to season and restore a non-stick pan, it’s still a good idea to do a quick seasoning of the pan before each use to lubricate it and protect the non-stick surface. Make sure your pan is clean and completely dry before seasoning., Pour about 2 teaspoons (9.46 ml) of a neutral-tasting oil such as vegetable or canola onto a paper towel. You can also use butter if you prefer by placing a few shavings of butter inside the pan.You only need a small amount of oil, which is why it’s best to apply it first to the paper towel instead of putting it directly into the pan.
 Use the paper towel to rub the oil or butter around the bottom of the pan and absorb any with the paper towel so that what you are cooking isn’t affected. Then use your non-stick pan to cook as usual.

 You’ll need a flat paddle brush and a wide and narrow nozzle for your blow dryer. The nozzle will direct a concentrated blast of heat towards your hair. Which hands you use to hold the blow dryer and brush will likely be determined by what feels right to you, and whether you’re left-handed or right-handed. It is best to hold your brush vertical and your blow dryer horizontal to achieve a “modern wave., Creating tension will help you achieve a smooth blowout. Place your brush at the root of your hair, grip the handle of the brush, and turn it slightly to get a firm, but not painful or hair-breaking, grip on your hair. Slide the brush through your hair from root to tip at a downward angle. As you get towards the end of your hair, you can angle in whatever direction you would like for your ends to go.
 Once you finish blow drying the back section, move on to the section above it. Use the same method to straighten this new section of hair. Continue to divide and straighten one-inch sections until each larger section is straight.
 Once you’ve straightened all of your hair, apply a finishing serum to put any loose strands in their place and shine your hair. Then style as desired. You can choose whether you’d like to show off your new look by wearing your hair down or pulled back. You can also now part your hair how you like, either on the side or down the middle. Other style suggestions: slick your hair straight back, pin a portion in the front, or pull your hair into a ponytail.

 If this measurement is not given to you, you will need to measure using a ruler.

On a standard American ruler, millimeters can be measured with the smallest lines on the metric (cm{\displaystyle cm}) side.

Make sure you measure millimeters (small lines) and not centimeters (numbered lines).

You will know a measurement is in millimeters because it will be labeled mm{\displaystyle mm}.

For example, the length of a pencil might be 155mm{\displaystyle 155mm} long.
 Place your pencil on the decimal point. To convert millimeters to meters, you need to divide. Since the metric system is based on multiples of ten, the easiest way to do this is by moving the decimal point to the left.For example, if you are converting 155mm{\displaystyle 155mm}, write 155.0{\displaystyle 155.0} and place your pencil on the decimal point.
 Since there are 1,000 millimeters per meter, you need to divide by 1,000 to convert from millimeters to meters.For example, if your pencil is 155.0mm{\displaystyle 155.0mm} long, you would move your pencil three decimal places to the left. This gives you .155m{\displaystyle .155m}.

You could also use a calculator or use the standard division algorithm to calculate 155รท1,000{\displaystyle 155\div 1,000}.

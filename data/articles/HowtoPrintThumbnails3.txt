 Picasa is Google's free picture application that works with their "cloud computing" system, meaning that you can store all your photos on the Internet and access them when you need them.
 Then either choose to print that album, or create a folder with chosen pictures. Go to either the "Folder" or "Album" menu on the horizontal toolbar.
 Either the Folder or Album menus have this option. Your images should be sent straight to the printer, printing 7 columns across and 6 rows down.


You can also print a contact sheet using the Collage feature in Picasa. Click on the "Collage" tab next to the "Library" tab. Select "Contact Sheet" from the list of settings. If you choose this option, the thumbnail size is based on the number of pictures you choose to include in the collage contact sheet. The more pictures you have, the smaller the thumbnail size will be.

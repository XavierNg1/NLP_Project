 Squat or sit on the floor. This will get their attention. You will talk with your child instead of at her. Also, she will be able to see your mouth and get visual cues on how to say certain sounds.;
, Make sure you slow down your rate of speech and simplify your sentences. Use short phrases with a clear voice. Your child will pick up on how you say words and learn new vocabulary at the same time.
 Many parents do not wait for their child to respond before asking another question or offering another comment. Your toddler takes longer to process speech and language. Give him or her some time and let him or her respond. If your toddler doesn't get to talk, how will he or she learn?

, Make sure you hear all the great things your child says so you can respond appropriately. If not, a great communication opportunity will be lost. Also, children do become frustrated and give up if no one is paying attention to them.
 Repeat what your child says and then expand on it. If your child repeats your expanded phrase, say good job and repeat again! For example, your child says "car." You say "yes, car, it is a fast car." Your child says "fast car?" You say, "yes! It is a fast car."

, Offer lots of praise for all communication attempts.

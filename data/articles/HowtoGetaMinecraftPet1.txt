 Depending on your success rates and skill in catching ocelots, you will need anywhere from 4-16 raw fish.;
, These are located in most jungles, however these can be located far away from your home, so build some temporary shelters along the way.
 Even if you go at the player's normal speed, it will run away from you. Approach it while holding the fish and slowly. if it creeps toward you, don't move. If you don't move, you can right click it and after an unknown amount of fish it will soon switch colors to either orange with stripes on it, tuxedo, or a Siamese pattern. The same will apply for cats.
 After all that hard work, you don't want your investment going down the drain due

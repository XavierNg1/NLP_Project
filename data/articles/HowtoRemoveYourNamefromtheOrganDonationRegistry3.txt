 Although there are a number of ways to craft an advance directive or living will, using the services of the US Living Will Registry is by far the simplest. It is also cheaper than using the services of an attorney.Advance directive and living wills are legal documents that make a formal declaration about your wishes for end of life care (should you be unconscious), including life support and organ donation.
The US Living Will Registry keeps a record of your advance directive or living will and puts it in a national database that health care providers across the country access.
 The Living Will Registry maintains a list of advance directive forms for all fifty US states. You can find them at http://uslwr.com/formslist.shtm. Pick the form for your state, fill it out according to your wishes, and have it notarized., Although the advance directive you filled out is perfectly valid all by itself, it will be a much more effective document if it is uploaded to the Living Will Registry's database, because health care providers across the country will access it in the event of your death or incapacity.The cost to purchase a spot in the registry is $59. It gives you a place in the registry for five years, meaning that it's just a little more than $10 per year.

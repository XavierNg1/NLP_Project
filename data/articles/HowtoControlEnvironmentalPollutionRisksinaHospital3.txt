 When constructing or renovating a hospital, choose materials that are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These may cost a bit more, but they will reduce the levels of toxic chemicals in the air inside your hospital. Keep this in mind when selecting materials like:Carpet
Paint and other finishes
Caulk
Adhesives
Cleaning products, particularly floor waxes and strippers, Hospitals should invest in a proper particle filter to maintain an acceptable level of air quality in their buildings. The correct type of filter for your hospital will depend on a variety of factors, including the existing ventilation system and the location.If you are not sure what kind of filter your hospital should have, hire a consultant.
Be sure to maintain your filtration system and change the filter regularly in order to prevent air from bypassing the system.
 In order to improve indoor air quality, it is important to have a system that allows clean air to circulate into the building. A system that provides 100 percent outside air with no air recirculation offers the best improvement., Incinerating waste can cause the air inside your hospital to become contaminated with toxic chemicals like dioxin. For this reason, seek out alternate methods of waste disposal if your hospital still relies on an incinerator.Recycling and reducing waste will help you greatly reduce the costs associated with properly disposing of waste.
 Be sure to take all reasonable precautions to reduce the transmission of germs that are spread by contact and by air from patients to visitors, staff, and other patients at your hospital.Have negative air pressure in hospital rooms.
Use single rooms whenever possible.
Keep the doors to patients' rooms closed except for entry and exit.

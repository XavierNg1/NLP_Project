 If you’ve recently washed your hair, there’s no need to wash it again. You can wet it by spritzing it with some fresh water.


This look will give you a straight hairstyle that may appear to be slightly rounded from the back.
 Part your hair in the middle back to the top of your crown. Behind this point, comb back your hair straight. Be as exact as possible as you part your hair. Use a fine-toothed comb to comb your hair on either side of the part.
 Using the fine-toothed comb, ensure that your hair is smooth and firm against your head as you pull it back into a tight ponytail.









Comb your hair all over to ensure that there are no bumps before you pull it into the ponytail.
Ensure that the ponytail is directly in the middle of the back of your head, and that it sits very low at the nape of your neck.
 This ponytail should be just above where you want to cut your hair. It may be a few inches below the other one.
 Do this without loosening it from the nape of your neck.
 Do this in small, incremental snips. Don’t try to cut the entire chunk of hair in one go. Make sure that the end of the ponytail is as even as possible.
, Comb sections straight up or forward to check for evenness. Adjust the cut as you would like. If the cut is not as even as you’d like it to be, you can try putting it in a ponytail and trimming it again. Do not cut it any shorter; just put it back in the ponytail, hold it firmly in one hand, and clip any stray hairs that aren’t even with the others.

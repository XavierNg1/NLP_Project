By working out your muscles every other day, you're giving them a chance to recover. Strength workouts daily will just continue to fatigue your muscles without any of the benefits that come from allowing muscles to heal. Either workout every other day, or do strength exercises on 1 day and aerobic exercise the next. Staggering your workouts like that will help you recover faster.;

Eating a snack that is high in lean protein after a workout will help give your muscles the fuel they need to recover more quickly. Egg whites, lean chicken or turkey and low-fat or skimmed milk are all high protein choices that are low in fat. Better yet, grab an ounce of raw nuts or add some beans to your salad.



Taking 10 minutes at the end of your workout to cool down will help your muscles recover faster. A cool down should include some walking or slow jogging, plus plenty of stretching to relax your muscles.



Heated wraps and pads have proven effective in reducing the pain from workout soreness, especially if it is localized. Heat wraps won't help you much if every muscle is aching. Heat has been proven to reduce inflammation and reduce the soreness.
 Taking an anti-inflammatory medicine as prescribed can aid in reducing muscle soreness. If using an over the counter product, be sure to follow the dosing guidelines.



A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine reported that drinking cherry juice before and after a workout could reduce muscle soreness. Cherries have long been rumored to have beneficial effects on muscles, but this study was the first of its kind.



The best way to avoid intense muscle soreness after a workout is to not overdo the workout. Listen to your body; if you begin to feel soreness and muscle fatigue, then stop. The more you push your muscles, the more they will be sore and the greater the risk of causing real damage to your muscles.

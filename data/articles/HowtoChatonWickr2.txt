 Tap the “Login” button on the welcome screen. Enter your Wickr ID and password, then tap on the “Log in” button.
 Tap the messages tab from the top menu bar. You will be brought to your inbox where all your messages are stored.
 From the Messages screen, tap on the chat button on the top right corner. A new screen will appear containing your contacts list.
 Tap the contact or contacts you want to talk to. Their names will be added to the To field at the top. You can also search for them by typing their Wickr names in the To field.
 Wickr destroys all the messages exchanged after the time limit has passed. You set this destruction time for every new message you send. Tap the Wickr logo or button at the bottom of the screen, then tap on the timer icon. Use the slider bar that will appear to adjust the destruction time. You can set it from days to seconds.
 Type your message in the message box right beside the Wickr logo at the bottom of the screen, then tap the arrow button right beside it to send your message to your recipients.
 Your message will appear on your conversation screen with the recipients. Once a message is received, it will appear here, along with replies from the recipients.

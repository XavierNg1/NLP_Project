 You must lay the caprisun on the silver side. The straw is now pointed in front of you not at your face or to the side. Upon curiosity, you might tap the pouch with your entire foot. And as you can see, your toe end of the shoe traps the air in.
 Your heel should be about 1-2 inches over the edge of the bottom side of the caprisun (clear bottom side). Your toes should be trapping the air from the hole where the straw goes.
 If you super stomped it, then the caprisun will blow so hard, that it either splits the pouch bottom into sectional strips or split right down the middle of the back side. (Side on the floor)

 Both brass and copper develop a patina with age, usually green but sometimes other colors.If none of the original metal is visible, try brass cleaning techniques. These typically work for both metals, but to be safe you could use a commercial brass and copper cleaning product.;
, If the metal is highly polished, you may see false colors due to reflected light.Look at it in sunlight or under a white fluorescent light bulb, not under a yellow incandescent bulb.
 Copper is a pure metal, and always has a reddish brown appearance. A modern US penny is plated in copper (and was almost entirely copper from 1962 to 1981), so this is a good point of comparison., The word brass refers to any alloy that contains copper and zinc. Different proportions of these metals produce different colors, but the most common types of brass have a muted yellow color, or a yellow-brown appearance similar to bronze. These brass alloys are widely used in machined parts and screws.Some brass has a greenish-yellow appearance, but this alloy, called "gilding metal," is only used for a few specialized purposes in decoration and ammunition., Many other common brass alloys can look orange or reddish brown, when they contain at least 85% copper.These types of brass are usually found in jewelry, decorative fasteners, or plumbing.Any hint or orange, yellow, or gold means the item is brass, not copper. If the brass alloy is almost entirely copper, you may need to compare it side by side with a copper pipe or item of jewelry. If you're still not sure, it's either copper or brass with such a high copper content that the distinction may not be important.
 Brass with high zinc content can look bright gold, yellowish white, and even white or grey.These alloys are not common, since they are not machine workable, but you may find them in jewelry.

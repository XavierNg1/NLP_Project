 Original models have touchviz UI. If it has slightly different UI, don't buy it. If this step is not helpful, try the next step.


Original 'S' series models come with android 4.2.2 ROM pre-installed in them. Go to Settings >> About Phone and verify the ROM version. However, this method may not help you always as fake models with 4.2.2’s name (But, actually working on 2.3 Gingerbread!) are there. Therefore, hold volume down + power button and see whether it takes a snapshot. Original Jellybean has this feature while Gingerbread doesn’t.
Higher Galaxy models have some unique features like air command. Check these features and you can find the fake one easily. If you don’t know which the special features are, watch Samsung commercials.

 There are plenty of good swim classes at a good price.;
, Make sure that you trust them and don't be shy.
 While not being able to swim at a pool party sounds scary, you are a strong individual who can enjoy a party without the water part. Have faith in yourself. Moreover, be aware that other people, even those who can swim, may choose to not swim but still go to the party. It's not essential to get into the water.
 Who says you have to go in? Always stay at the shallow end, with your feet dangling into the water. You might even sit on a step. This can be sufficient to convince others you're participating.


Ask a friend who can swim to sit with you. He or she can rescue you if someone drags you in and takes you into deeper water.
Be honest. Tell people you can't swim but that you're happy to sit poolside or simply wade.
 This can give you the opportunity to practice swimming different ways if you've started learning. If you haven't learned yet, do not do this unless someone is there to supervise at all times.
 For people who swim regularly, this is a custom. What does it accomplish? Theoretically you'll know how cold the water is, in reality it is a symbolic gesture.
 The best way to do this is to go slowly. With each step, there may be a rush of fear as you submerge yourself in your nemesis, the water.
 Do not let go unless you're sure you're safe and confident. If you want to move around the pool, scale the side wall horizontally.


Think of it like climbing a mountain sideways.
If you're afraid of heights, think of something else.
 You can now enjoy the party from inside the pool instead of at the snack bar.


Hang around the pool wall and socialize.
You don't even have to swim, just hang out with friends and socialize.

, Then add a divider. Separate the cage with wire mesh that they are not able to get through. (This works best with an aquarium).
 Ensure that they both have all the necessities; for example, food, water and toys.
 Leave them in their separate spots in the cage for a week or so. Change their water and food when needed.
 After the week is up, take the mesh divider out and let them explore around with the other hamsters.



Hamsters are very sociable and normally enjoy the company of others.

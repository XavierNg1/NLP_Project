 Unlike in most cars, you do not jump start a Prius by connecting jumper cables to the battery. Instead, Toyota installed a positive lead in the fuse box, under the hood.The fuse box is located on the driver’s side near the headlight at the front of the engine bay.
It is housed beneath a black, plastic cover.
 Release the clips on the side of the fuse box cover and remove it so you can see the fuses and terminals housed below. Set the cover aside, as you will need to replace it after you finish jump starting the car.Be sure not to damage the clips as you release them.
The terminal in the fuse box is marked with a positive (+) symbol and is surrounded by red plastic.
 There is a positive terminal within the fuse box that you can connect the red lead from the jumper cables to. Connect the other end of the red cable to the positive terminal on the vehicle you are using to jump start the car.Be sure the jumper cable has a strong connection to the positive terminal in the fuse box.
 There is no ground terminal inside the Prius fuse box, so you will need to ground the black cable on a bolt that is attached to the body of the car. Locate a bolt that is not painted so it will provide a strong connection.Connect the other end of the black cable to the negative terminal on the other vehicle’s battery.
Be careful, once both cables are connected to the other vehicle’s battery, touching the two ends of the cables will create sparks.
 Wait a few minutes for the other vehicle’s running engine to charge the Prius’ battery then get back in the car and attempt to start it once again. If the Prius won’t start, you may need to wait for it to charge a bit longer.Leave the other vehicle connected to the Prius until you get it to start.
Make sure the connections are secure if the charge doesn’t seem to be working.

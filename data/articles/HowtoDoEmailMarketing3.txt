 Introduce the company and let them know what to expect from future emails. Provide an opt-in form that allows them to confirm that they want to receive further emails from you. To give them incentive to opt-in, provide an attractive offer in the welcome email.For example, you could offer a free product or discount with their next purchase.
An opt-in option can help prevent you from spamming people and get your relationship with that person started on the right foot.
Every email you send should also have an obvious unsubscribe link in it. This allows the person to opt-out at any time.
 You can’t make corrections or change any of the content. Before you send an email out to your entire email list, send it to a few key people in your company. Have these people review the email content, confirm that all the links work, proofread the text, make sure the formatting looks right, etc.


You will feel a lot more comfortable and confident about sending the final email out to your list if you do a test send first.
 Most email service providers include free analytics when you use their programs. These analytics provide a great deal of information about the email’s effectiveness, but the three most important metrics are the open rate, click through rate (CTR), and unsubscribes. Knowing this information can help you tweak your content for more successful email marketing in the future.


The open rate tells you how effective your subject line was by showing you how many people opened the email and how many people didn’t.
CTR shows you how many people heeded the call-to-action, which essentially tells you how successful your content was.
Unsubscribe information lets you know when you’ve created ineffective content because it tracks how many people opted-out of receiving future emails from you after seeing the current one.

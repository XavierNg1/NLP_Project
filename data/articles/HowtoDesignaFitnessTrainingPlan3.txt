 Once you have developed the length of time and type of activities you will complete each day, record it on a piece of paper divided into the days of the week. Be sure to include the expected time and place of your workout in the written plan.
 When you get bored of a particular routine or when results slow (typically within 2 to 3 weeks), replace a cardio or strength routine with an option from your list of substitutes. This will allow you to use your muscles differently and can jumpstart your metabolism if your body has grown accustomed to your prior routine.


A list of substitute activities will also be useful for working out while traveling, trying to include friends in occasional workouts, or for inclement weather.
 Keeping a fitness journal will allow you to identify trends in your workout habits or fitness accomplishments.


Track whether you completed entire or only partial planned workouts and examine how your endurance or ability to complete the activity effectively improves over time.
Track running times or distances for each workout, weight loss once per week, and waist or muscle diameter once per month to get an idea of your progress.

 When you first arrive on the eighth floor, you will find 9 platforms that light up when you step on them and a book in the back of the room which will tell you how to solve the puzzle. The book will read, "The way was lit when you ascended. Return to see the light.";
, If you did not notice before, there are shields next to the doors leading to the next level. On each floor, one of the shields will be lit and the others will be dim. Remember the order of the lit shields and what's on them. You can write it down if necessary. You should first see a snowflake, then a bird, the third should be a puppy, and the last will be a moon.
 Step on the platforms with the pictures of the lit shields in order by floor. They should light up when you step on them - and you can't make any mistakes! If you accidentally step on another platform, you have to restart.
 The text, "You hear the gears of the clock start to move." should pop up. If not, you have not done it correctly. You must reset the platforms and try again.

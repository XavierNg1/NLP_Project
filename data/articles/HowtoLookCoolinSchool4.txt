 Almost everyone thinks playing a sport is cool. However, just being on the basketball or football team doesn’t immediately make you cool. You have to earn peoples respect by being good at it. Make sure you practice your talent. It’s not cool to sit on the bench the whole time.


Physical sports are often considered cooler.
 Find and instrument and learn to play it! Once you get better you can join a band or start your own. People will think this is very cool, and you can even play in concerts or at your school’s talent show.

 Find something that you’re passionate about and join the club. If you’re really into politics, you can join your schools political society. Try getting into student government. People will think you’re cool if you are active and involved in the school community. Making your face known is a huge part of being cool. Being an active member of a club could help you accomplish that.

 You have 60 minutes to delete a message after it is sent. After that, the "Remove" option goes away. You can only delete messages that you have sent.
 Release your finger after a moment. A menu will appear.
 You will not be asked to confirm. The message will be deleted for both you and the recipient.


If there is no "Delete" option, then you have waited too long to delete the message.

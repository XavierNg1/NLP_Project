Sew the bedsheet and lining fabric together along the bottom edge of the skirt (the wider part of the semicircle) with the bed sheet fabric facing inward.
Remove the pins and flip the skirt inside out.
 Unpin the bottom 2 pins from the zipper so you can match the edges of the skirt to the edges of the shirt. Sometimes there will be some excess skirt material, so simply cut the excess fabric off of the skirt.
 Make sure the pleats are small so they don't make the flow of the skirt look boxy.


Make sure the pleats are evenly spaced around the skirt. User your vinyl tape measure to double-check.
Grasp the fabric and fold it over to the right as though you were starting to make a fan. Pin the folded section of fabric down so that it will stay in position.
Iron the pleat to make it precise.
Sew the pleats using downward stitches. Stop at the point where you want the skirt to twirl freely.
 Make sure that the dress is folded inside-out to make your seam less visible.
 Sew the back seam of the skirt up to 1/4" (6 mm) above where the end of the zipper would fall. Pin the zipper's final few inches down the back of the skirt, and sew it into place.

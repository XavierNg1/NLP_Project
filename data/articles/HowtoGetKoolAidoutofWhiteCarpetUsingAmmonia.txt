 The minute the drink hits your carpet, grab a white towel to soak up as much as possible.

Apply pressure with a dry, white towel to the area. Don’t rub (never rub a carpet), but instead firmly blot the area until you’ve absorbed as much Kool Aid as possible.



 


Dab the area with a clean, wet cloth. Dilute the Kool Aid with clean warm water by rinsing a clean white cloth under the water, wringing it out and then applying pressure on the area. You may absorb more Kool Aid in the process.

, Perform this task as quickly as possible, as you will want to get the solution on the carpet immediately.


If you don’t have ammonia, using window cleaning solution can be a decent substitute. However, make sure you use window cleaning solution that is clear and not blue (the blue coloring could discolor the carpet).






Stir carefully to ensure the mixture is fully combined (use a wooden spoon or rod).
 Avoid over soaking, as this can lead to either the solution or the stain bleeding onto other areas of the carpet.

Pour a little amount of solution onto the stain at a time. This lets you control how much is dispensed on the stain. If the stain is large, consider pouring the solution in stages by fully soaking one area and then moving onto the next.






Don’t over-pour the solution so that you have too much cleaning fluid on the carpet and need to soak up more fluid than Kool Aid. This will only create a bigger mess.
 You will be placing a white towel (preferably not a good one) over the stain and then using the heat from the iron to transfer the stain to the towel.

Dial the iron to its hottest setting. Use the setting designated for cotton clothing.






Consider adding some steam to the process. For extra stubborn Kool Aid stains, adding steam while ironing the stain may help lift them onto the towel.
 Make sure the iron is very hot before attempting this step.

Press the iron down onto the towel and hold it in place for approximately 10 seconds. You should hear a sizzling sound, which means the liquid is being absorbed by the towel.






Move the iron to the next area and repeat the motion until you’ve traveled around the entire stain.






Repeat the entire process until the stain has lifted. You may need to make several passes over the stain until it fully lifts.[[Image:Get Kool Aid out of White Carpet Using Ammonia Step 5Bullet3.jpg}}
Allow to dry before walking on the area just cleaned.

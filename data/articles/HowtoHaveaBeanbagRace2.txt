 The distance between your start and finish can be adjusted to suit the ages of those playing. For younger kids, you may want this to only be 10 ft (3 m). For adults, you might lengthen this to 30 ft (9.1 m).There are many items you can use to mark your starting and finish line. Common markers include tape, cones, unused balls, rocks, or personal items, like shoes.
 An even number of teams works best for this activity. If you have uneven teams, after dividing players, have the team with one less player choose one player to go twice., Once the cue is given, players should race toward the finish line and back to the starting line. You might say something like, "Ready, set, go!" or use a noise from your cell phone, like a siren, a bell, or a whistle., Each player must, one at a time, carry a beanbag from the start to the finish and back again. They may only touch the beanbag once when placing it at the start line. They should place the beanbag and ferry it by either:


Balancing the beanbag on their backs.
Squeezing the beanbag between their knees., When a beanbag falls on the ground, the player who dropped it must start from the beginning. The first team that has all players complete the race is the winner.

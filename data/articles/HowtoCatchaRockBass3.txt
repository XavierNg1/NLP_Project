 Some signs include spawning beds, weeds, gravel, or even the fish themselves.


Try to locate a drop-off from the dock. If you are fishing at night, this can be key to catching big fish.
 By doing this, fish that are nearby will spot the moving worm on the bottom as they swim.


If you are using a small spoon, its best to let the spoon drop to the bottom and jerk it up while you retrieve.
 Usually, curious fish will nibble the end of the worm to see what it is. You can see the vibrations in the line if a fish nibbles.
 Make sure you don't set it too hard, or you can rip the hook out of the fish's mouth.
 Usually, you can just flip the fish onto the dock, but it does help to carry around a small net, just in case.
 It's good to have your stringer or live-basket handy, just in case you want to keep some fish. Some people also like to put their fish into coolers while on the boat.


Make sure the fish are completely in the water while on the stringer.



This easier because the people who work at the lake will sometimes clean the fish for you.
It is also easier because you can just wrap up the fish instead of driving home with fish smell in your car.

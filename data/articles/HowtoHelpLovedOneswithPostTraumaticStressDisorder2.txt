 When you discuss the trauma or your loved one’s condition, you should always be mindful of what you say. Try to avoid giving your loved one trite phrases or platitudes to make them feel better. Those kinds of statements don’t help someone with PTSD and can make them feel worse.For example, don’t tell the person “everything is going to be okay,” “you should move on,” or “you were lucky that it wasn’t worse.”
Try not to make them feel bad for not coping as quickly or having trouble getting over the experience. Don’t say things like, “You should move on” or “The sooner you stop thinking about the trauma, the sooner you can get over it.”

, When you talk to your loved one, you should be clear, concise, and to the point. Speak clearly and make sure you say what you mean. Don’t imply things or beat around the bush. Use your words to communicate how you feel and don’t expect your loved one to know how you are feeling.For example, you may say, “I am feeling frustrated today.”
Encourage your loved one to also speak clearly and directly. This makes communication easier.
 You may feel like you need to help your loved one, give advice, or tell them what to do. Don’t try to control your loved one or make them do something that you think is good for them.People with PTSD have trouble when they feel out of control due to their trauma. Let them maintain control of their actions. You can suggest things, but don’t try to make them do anything.

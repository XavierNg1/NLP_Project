 Find the center of your boat by drawing an X on it, from corner to corner. Use a craft blade to cut a small slit in the center of that X. The slit needs to be big enough so that you can slip the end of your balloon through it.The thicker the sponge is, the better.
Make sure that the sponge is smooth on both sides and does not have a scrubbing pad.;
, Find the center of one of the narrow ends. Use a pair of scissors to cut both of the corners off towards that point so that you end up with a ^-shaped point. This will make the front of your boat., Keep pulling until the body of the balloon touches the top of the sponge. The tail should be on the underside of the sponge. Don't blow up the balloon just yet!, Find a short piece of plastic tubing, about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) long and Â¾-inch (1.91 centimeters) wide. Stick the tube into the tail end of the balloon not not into the sponge. You want the sponge to be pinching the balloon shut.It's okay if the tube is a little flexible.
You can find such tubes in your local hardware store, aquarium store, and pet store (fish section).
 Hold the balloon firmly by the tail and tube. Blow into the balloon through the tube, then quickly cover the opening of the tube with your finger. Keep holding the tail end of the balloon., You can use anything, from a sink to a bath tub to a swimming pool. Keep your finger over the tube; you're not ready to release the boat just yet!, Hold the sponge steady with one hand. Angle the tube towards the back of the boat with the other. Release the tube, and watch the boat propel itself forward!

, This is the number of the person, business, or cell phone that you are trying to reach. Phone numbers are generally nine digits long, including the area code. For example, if you were calling Fukuyama, the whole phone number would be (84)-XXX-XXXX.If you are trying to reach a cell phone in Japan, you would dial 90 after the country code and before the area code. For example, to call a cell phone in Fukuyama from the United States, you would dial 011-81-90-XXXX-XXXX., It is important to remember that it is most likely not the same time in Japan as it is in the place you are making the call from. Japan’s time zone is Japan Standard Time, which is nine hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time.Keep in mind that you may be charged for your international call even if no one picks up on the other end. This should serve as an incentive to make sure that you are calling the person you are trying to reach in Japan at a time that he or she will actually be awake.
 To demonstrate, let us say that you are trying to call your friend who lives Fukuyama, Japan and you live in San Francisco, CA, USA. You would dial:


The United States exit code: 011
Then the country code for Japan: 81
Then the area code for Fukuyama: 84
Then the seven digit local phone number: XXX-XXXX
The full number would be 011-81-84-XXX-XXXX.
 You have successfully called Japan.

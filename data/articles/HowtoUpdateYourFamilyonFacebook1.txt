 Visit Facebook’s home page from any web browser.;
, Use your Facebook account and password to log in. The login fields are found on the upper right corner of the page. Click the “Log in” button to proceed.
 Click on your name on the header toolbar, and you will be brought to your Timeline or wall. Click on the About tab, right below your cover photo, and you will be brought to your page, with all your details.
 You will be brought to your Family and Relationships page where your current relationship status and a list of family members can be found.
 Select from the list of family members the one you’d like to update. Hover over the name, and a small taskbar will appear. Click on the “Edit” button on the taskbar.


Changing relationship status—Under the name of each family member is a drop-down list. Select the relationship of the person you’re updating. You can choose from Grandmother to Stepdaughter, Uncle to brother-in-law, or even a Pet. Facebook maintains a huge list of possible family relationships, so you should be able to find one that fits.
Adding a family member—At the top of the “Family Members” section is a link “Add a family member.” Click on it, then type in the name of the family member you’re adding on the field provided. He or she should already be connected to you on Facebook in order for his or her name to appear. Select your relationship with that person from the drop-down list.
Deleting a family member—If you’d like to remove a family member, click on the “X” button instead of “Edit” from the taskbar. A confirmation box will appear. Click on “Confirm” to remove the selected family member from your profile. The person is still your friend on Facebook, but he or she will just not appear under your profile as family.
 Your family will receive a notification about the change you’ve made. He or she should accept, and once he or she does, this will be posted on both your walls, making it official.

Rinse the beans until the water running from the strainer is clear., Add two tablespoons of olive oil to a large, ovenproof pot. Heat the oil over medium or medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook for 4-5 minutes. The bacon should begin to brown by this time., Once the bacon begins to brown, add the carrots, onion, and fennel to the pot. Cook for around 7 minutes, while stirring occasionally, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Add the garlic at this point, and then saute for an additional 1-2 minutes., Add these ingredients to the pot, but do not add salt at this time. Adding salt will make the beans tough.

Bake the beans at 300 degrees Fahrenheit or 150 degrees Celsius for 45 minutes., After baking the beans at 300 degrees Fahrenheit or 150 degrees Celsius for 45 minutes, turn the oven up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 175 degrees Celsius. Bake the beans for an additional 30-45 minutes.

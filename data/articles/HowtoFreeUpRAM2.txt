 Press Ctrl+Alt+Del and select the Task Manager from the list of options. The Task Manager window will open. Click on the Processes tab.
 Windows Explorer is the user interface for the Windows operating system. Restarting it clears it from the RAM and reloads it, potentially freeing up some memory. Look for explorer.exe and hit End Process. You can sort by program name by clicking the Image Name category. If done correctly, your taskbar and desktop icons will disappear.
 Click on the 'Applications' tab, and then click the 'New Task...' button. In the window that opens, type “explorer.exe” into the text field and click OK. Explorer will open and your taskbar and desktop icons will reappear.

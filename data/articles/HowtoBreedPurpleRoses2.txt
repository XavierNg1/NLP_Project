 Although it is possible to grow purple roses from seed, it is a slow way to get new rose plants. In addition, garden roses aren't always fertile, even if they grow hips.


It’s also possible to get very disappointing results when growing from seed, as the child may not match the parent (that means that the new plant may not grow purple flowers, even if the parent plant did).
Although this isn't the surest or the fastest route to take, here’s some advice if you want to try growing purple roses from seed:

, After the growing season, avoid deadheading your purple rose plant and allow the plant to develop rose hips. From the point when the hips emerge, wait about 4 months before harvesting them. At this stage, the seeds should be ripe for planting

, Use a knife to cut the hips in half, then pick out the seeds – tweezers are pretty useful for this fiddly task.


Rinse the seeds in a cup of water to which a dash of bleach has been added, then soak the seeds overnight in a solution of 3% peroxide.
Finally, use a brush to agitate the seeds and remove any remaining hip pulp which may cause them to rot later.
 Once the seeds are ready, scatter them over moist compost, cover with a clear plastic bag, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 weeks.


Remember to sow far more seeds than you need in case the resultant plants are a disappointment, or fail to grow.

 Flying is enabled by default in Creative Mode.
 This causes you to start flying, though you may not notice it yet. If it doesn't work right away, try tapping a little faster.
 You will continue to rise as long as you hold the jump button, or until you hit the maximum height. You can also move around with the usual controls.
 The default sneak controls are Left â‡§ Shift on PC, R on Xbox, pressing down on the right joystick on Playstation, and D-pad down on PS Vita., If your feet touch the floor, you will stop flying. You can also turn off flying by double-tapping the jump button again.

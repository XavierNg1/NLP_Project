 Also known as a setup disc, it provides a guided optimization process that can improve your picture quality on a professional level. This is convenient if you don't know how to adjust certain settings in order to make the picture look good. All you have to do is to play the disc in your DVD player, follow the instructions and complete all the steps in the setting process. Disney WOW: World of Wonder DVD ($18) provide tutorials and guides on picture optimization., Making use of built-in presets designed by professionals is a great way to get the picture you like through fewer manipulations. These are designed to enhance your experience depending on lighting you are watching your TV in or media and genre of content youâ€™re watching:


Standard (normal brightness, contrast, and sharpness levels)
Vivid/Dynamic (increased contrast, brightness, and sharpness)
Cinema/Movie (best for movies, image intended by creators)
Sports (sharpens image of quick movements)Game (for playing games with reduced input lag (delay in signal), reduced picture quality), The balance between two basic settings like Contrast and Brightness can immediately improve picture quality. When setting contrast choose a bright image with white elements in it, like clouds in the sky. Contrast should be started at just 50% of the available Contrast. Keep in mind that the higher you set your Contrast, the shorter the life of the TV, particularly if you set your contrast above 75%. At this point your clouds may appear as white blotches, which means your contrast is set too high.
 In order to set your brightness just right choose a dark image with dark elements in it, for example, a black jacket on a dark background. If you see just the silhouettes in a dark picture try increasing Brightness. The low brightness settings can deprive dark images of detail and nuance making the picture look flat.

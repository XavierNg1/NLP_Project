 Bantu knots are many tiny buns that you space out over the entirety of your head. As a result, it is necessary to make sure that your hair is totally free of knots and completely smooth. Brush through your hair, and then mist it with a bit of water in a spray bottle so that it is slightly damp to the touch.
 Depending on the thickness of your hair, the number of sections you use will vary. Brush your hair into sections 2”-3” wide, and separate each of them with a hair clip or ponytail. These should cover your whole head with not much of a pattern.
 Take a single section of hair, and twirl it around several times to make it rope-like and more spiral shaped. Then, loop the twisted strand onto itself several times to create a small bun that sits on your scalp. Use 1-2 bobby pins to pin the ends of your hair to your scalp, thus securing the bun in place.
 Work around your head twisting each separate strand of hair into a rope, and then spiraling this into a small bun to be pinned to the top of your head. The end result may look kind of silly, as you will have close to a dozen small buns spaced out over your head.
 Being a no-heat style, bantu knots take a bit of time to form curls. Therefore, it is best to do this at night and then allow your hair to set while you sleep, so that you can wake up with the curls you want. Otherwise, plan on waiting 5-6 hours with your hair like this in order to get your curls.
 Work around your head from the bottom up, and take out each tiny bun. Unpin it and allow the spiral to unravel, but do not begin brushing through the curls yet as this will make it harder to take out the other knots. Continue this process until you have all the knots removed.
 When your hair is down and loose, you can use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to brush through the curls a bit. The more you brush through them, the more volume they’ll gain. Finish the style with a bit of hairspray to hold it in place, and pin back some of your hair if desired.

 In the United States, the NADA Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide is the “blue book” used to determine the value of mobile homes.Go to your local library and see if there is a copy.


Look in the book for your type of manufactured home, and then follow the step-by-step guide for calculating the retail book value. Your calculation will depend in part on the condition of the mobile home.;
, Alternately, you can submit an online request for a value report at the NADA website. Go here: http://www.nadaguides.com/FAQ/manufactured-home-value-reports#q21. However, you must pay in order to get a report.


A Basic Used Home Value Report will cost $26. You can use this report if there are no unique features to your mobile home.
A Professional Used Home Value Report will cost $50. This report will give you a more in-depth analysis and accurate estimate of the home’s value.A New Home Price Report will cost $35.
 The NADA guide will estimate the value of your home based on the following factors:year the home was manufactured
manufacturer
size of the home (width and length)
where you are located (state and region)
condition of the home
other features, such as granite countertops, hardwood floors, garages, etc.
 After submitting your online request, you will instantly receive your report. Click on the “View Your Report” button, which is located on your payment confirmation page.You can print off your report or save it.
 The book value does not take into account the value of your land, which is often more valuable than your mobile home.For this reason, you should also do your own research if your mobile home is fixed to a piece of property.

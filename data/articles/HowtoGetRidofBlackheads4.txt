 Before you think about squeezing or pulling them out, you need to really loosen the pores. Blackheads are very sticky and won’t come out easily, but by loosening the pores you give yourself the best chance of success. An excellent way to do this is to carefully hold your face at least a foot above a bowl of steaming water for ten to fifteen minutes. Getting any closer can cause burns.


Place a towel over your head so the steam can't escape.
You will feel the steam beginning to loosen your pores.
You can also soak a washcloth in hot water and lay it over your face.
 A comedones extractor is a tool used by dermatologists and licensed aestheticians to remove blackheads, but you can use one at home, too. It is easy to use and there is far less risk of damaging your skin than if you try to squeeze out a blackhead with your fingers.


After cleansing your skin, place the loop over the blackhead and apply gentle pressure, then pull the tool down. The blackhead should pop out of your pore.Do not press too hard. If the blackhead doesn't come out with gentle pressure, treat it with a topical cream. Pressing too hard may damage your skin.Make sure you clean your skin and the tool after use to avoid the spread of bacteria and possibly clogging other pores., You can use special blackhead strips to pull out your blackheads. This technique is less likely to irritate your skin. It is only a temporary fix, but it could be exactly what you need in an emergency.Combine occasional use of strips with a good cleaning and exfoliating regime.


For the best results, it’s a good idea to use a treatment cream for a few nights in a row to loosen your pores before you try using a blackhead strip., Never squeeze, pick, or pop blackheads. Squeezing blackheads can cause inflammation and infection, and will certainly not stop the blackheads coming back.

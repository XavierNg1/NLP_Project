 Generally, Spanish adverbs go immediately after the verb they modify. If they are modifying an adjective or other adverb, however, they go before the word they modify. For example, if you wanted to say "you play well," to a Spanish-speaking teammate, you would say juegas bien (HOO-gahs BEE-ehn). Note that the adverb follows the verb in that sentence, just as it does in English.
However, unlike English, you can't put an adverb between two verbs. In Spanish, the adverb must follow the last verb, as in "vamos a jugar aquí" (VAH-mos ah HOO-gahr ah-KEE), which means "let's play here."

, Sometimes you'll want to use two or more adverbs to describe an action, rather than just one. When you use two or more Spanish adverbs in a series, only the last one gets the -mente suffix.For the first adverb, the one that doesn't get the suffix, you still use the feminine, singular form of the adjective, regardless of the gender or number of the subject of the sentence.
For example, if you wanted to say "he speaks slowly and clearly" in Spanish, you would say "habla lenta y claramente" (AH-blah LEN-tah ee CLAIR-ah-MEN-tay). Notice that lenta is the singular, feminine adjective form – it does not take the -mente suffix.
 Just as in English, you can ask questions in Spanish using only one word, such as who or when. These adverbs that stand alone are punctuated as a complete sentence, and don't have to agree with anything.For example, suppose someone was inviting you to a party, but you didn't quite catch the date and time the party was starting. You could simply ask "when?" by saying "¿Cuándo?" (KWAN-doh).

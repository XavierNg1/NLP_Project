 Wear leather gloves to protect against rabies. Open your door or window. The bat is looking for a way out. Open a door and leave it open to give the flying bat a clear path. The bat may sense the fresh air and fly out of your house.;
, Stay out of its way and watch for it to land.
 If the bat lands low, toss a towel carefully over the bat. It will not be able to take off again. The towel should cover the bat without causing injury.
 Keep the bat wrapped inside. You should expect to hear clicking noises when the bat is frightened. It is best to presume that the bat might try to bite through the towel, so put on gloves or oven mitts to be safe.
 If the bat lands high on your wall or ceiling, place a coffee can or plastic container over the bat. Slide the lid of the container cautiously between the bat and wall. Keep the container as close to the wall as possible. Do not pinch the bat.
 Set the trapped bat on the ground some distance from your house. Close your door so that the bat does not accidentally fly inside again.
 Walk away and watch. The bat will attempt a few hops, then become airborne. Bats have some difficulty taking off from the ground.
 If the bat is too tired or scared to take off, you may want to place it near a tree. The bat will climb the tree where it can drop into flight.
 You should wear a leather glove. Do not squeeze too tightly. Place the bat on the trunk of a tree. It will grip the bark and climb away.
 The sound waves will help the bat see the outline of the door and it will fly out on its own. The bat was probably just chasing bugs when it flew into the house.

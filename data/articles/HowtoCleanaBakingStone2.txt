 In a small bowl, pour ½ cup (170 grams) of baking soda and 3 tablespoons (15 ml) of warm water. Mix the baking soda and water vigorously. The mixture should resemble a paste-like substance after a little mixing.

You should only use cooking grade baking soda. Avoid using laundry baking soda or baking soda with any sort of scent., Spread the baking soda paste over the entire surface of the baking stone. Make sure to pay special attention to dirty spots. Allow the paste to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.

The paste might appear to dry after 5 minutes – this is okay., After you let it sit, take a clean cloth and scrub in small circles. In addition to the chemical reaction created by the baking soda, its abrasive character should help remove debris and stains.

Use a toothbrush if you need more abrasive power., Take the plastic or nylon scraper and work systematically to remove the paste from your baking stone. Make sure to get as much as you can, as you’ll need to remove it all before you use the stone in the oven., After you've scraped off any remaining paste, you'll need to rinse and wipe the stone again. Do this by running the stone under cool water and wiping it with a damp cloth., You'll need to let the stone sit out and dry for at least one night before you use it again. This is important as the stone could crack if you put it in the oven when it is still wet.

Think about patting the stone with a dry cloth before letting it sit overnight.

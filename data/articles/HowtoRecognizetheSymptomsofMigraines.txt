Unilateral (one side of the brain)
Pain that is throbbing or pulsating in quality
Associated with nausea and vomiting
Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
Phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)
Allodynia (sensation of pain from normally non-painful stimuli, such as brushing hair or shaving)
Migraines are usually moderate to severe, and can last up to three days for adults, and typically only a few hours for children.
 This can last several days and includes symptoms of difficulty concentrating, mood changes, and weakness. This may also include transient pain in the same area as the headache with quick head movements.

 Whenever you are feeling down, think of something that makes you feel happy and calm. It can be an ocean wave, open sky or a guy/girl that you like.;
, Replace anger. Know that you have an inability to control things and other people. So stop trying to.
 Relax & or meditate. Remember- what we now have was once among the things we wished for.
 When you compare yourself to someone else, you'll always find someone who has it better than you. ALWAYS. So- why do it? Sometimes it's better to enjoy the moonlight than to reach for the moon.
 Since there's always someone who has it better, there's always someone who has it worse as well. So just enjoy life, let things go, & do whatever makes you happy.
 Addictions are a sign that you're not focusing on the world around you but are trying to seek an escape. Don't ignore reality, find the good things & make your reality as good as your dreams. It can happen. Just believe.
 So that others may simply live goes the adage... but the truth is, have too much stuff just becomes clutter and weighs us down. Realistically, how much of that stuff in your house do you really need and use regularly?

, Be thankful. Being grateful is healthy for you. Whatever you already have- be it health, loved ones, a good career, interests, hobbies, a car, clothes, a home, great views, talents, etc., make the most of it and be grateful for it. We take it all for granted, and many people would kill for what we have.
 This is all free but deeply satisfying.
 Much of our own unhappiness stems from the fact that we focus on the negatives of our life more than the positives. Having a confident attitude will help you to focus on your strengths. Try walking away from a situation and dwell with contentment on what went right, instead of what went wrong or what could have gone better.

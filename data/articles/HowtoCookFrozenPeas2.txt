 For more tender peas, sprinkles 1-2 tablespoons of water over the peas before cooking.


All microwaves are different, so sample the peas after two minutes and cook them longer if needed.
 These peas will steam instead of boil, and are usually firmer. Before you cook them you can also add some water or 2 tablespoons of butter for richer peas.
 Some frozen peas are made to be cooked directly in the bag. Simply remove the bag from the freezer and put it in the microwave, cooking for the required time. The package will need to cool off for 4-5 minutes after it has finished cooking. They usually fill with steam that can burn you if you try to open the bag immediately.


If the packaging does not specifically indicate that it can be placed in the microwave, don't.

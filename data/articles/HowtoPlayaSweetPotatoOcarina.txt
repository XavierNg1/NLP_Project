 Ocarinas can be difficult to find locally, so it is best to search the internet for one. You can find them on many shopping sites, such as Amazon or Ebay, or you could go to a specialized ocarina site that sells them.;
, Since you have a sweet potato ocarina (named after its shape), you hold it by placing your thumbs on the back holes and putting each of your fingers on the front holes. Your left hand should come from under the ocarina, and your right hand from the top.
 You will alter the sounds if you blow harder or softer while you are playing. Although doing so can be used to produce different sounds, you first have to learn to primarily use fingering while controlling your breath. Ultimately, fingering controls the notes and breath controls the octave.
 To raise the pitch, remove your fingers from the holes. The more holes you uncover, the higher the pitch. The only hole you may not cover is the hole on the back between the back holes. This hole is where the sound comes out, and covering it will not allow your ocarina to produce sound.
 Since you just began your musical journey with your new ocarina, you may want to begin with tablatures. Tablatures, or tabs, are pictures that show you which holes to cover to produce a song. You can play using sheet music, but ocarinas use a different type of sheet music that may be difficult to learn at first.

 Deep, measured breathing can calm your mind and your body considerably. If you’re sitting somewhere with privacy, place your hand on your abdomen and breathe in deeply for five seconds. Breathe deeply enough for your hand to rise visibly. After a pause, slowly exhale until you don’t have any breath left.Focus on breathing in through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.
If you’re in the presence of others, simply mentally count to five while breathing in, and count to five again while exhaling.
Try to think only about your breath, pushing other thoughts away without assessing them.;
, If you’re unable to leave your work area, stand and stretch for a moment. You can also roll your head, shoulder, and ankles while sitting. Muscle tension exercises can help you calm down too.Focus on one particular muscle or muscle group at a time. For instance, start by scrunching all of your face muscles as tightly as you can for twenty seconds and slowly releasing them.
Then move down to your neck, and so on, all the way down to your toes.
 Getting your heart rate up for short periods of time can help you better cope with stress. While it won't make your stress disappear, exercise can help you manage and control your emotions. Exercising and being active for at least 10 minutes at a time is all that you need to do to see positive changes.


Being active can help clear your thoughts, which will allow you to better reflect on the issues you're having at work.
You can incorporate the activity into your lunch break.
If possible, sneak off to the stairwell for one or two sets of jumping jacks. The endorphins that your body releases when exercising can have a potently relaxing effect on your mood. Even better, step outside for a brief, brisk walk.A short walk outside offers the opportunity to breathe, move, and stimulate many of your senses all at once.

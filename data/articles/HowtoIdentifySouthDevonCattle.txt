Colouration: South Devons are a light red in colouration, though this can vary in shade and can sometimes appear mottled. The skin around the eyes and nose tends to be a lighter shade, though often not as obvious as in other breeds with the same characteristics.

Body type and characteristics: South Devons are the largest British beef breed, being quite robust and muscular with a large frame.  Bulls average between 2600 and 3300 lbs in body weight, cows being a few hundred pounds lighter.  South Devons have a strong curly coat and thick, loose mellow skin.

Head characteristics: The head of a South Devon tends to be broad, with more naturally horned individuals than polled, though the polled characteristic is also becoming more popular in this breed.  Some of you may think that the head of a South Devon looks quite similar to a Limousin, when in fact this is not entirely true.  This is because, for one, South Devons are much larger than Limousins, and secondly, South Devons lack the characteristic flat lip of a Limousin.

Other characteristics: South Devon cattle tend to be late-maturing, with some heifers being able to calve out by the time they're around 2 years of age, but most not until they're around 2.5 to 3 years of age. Bulls reach puberty around 15 to 18 months of age in which they are ready to be used for breeding. This breed is known for its docility, good mothering ability and milking ability,, longevity (cows can be productive to an average of 15 years),  great forage convertibility, good hardiness and adaptability, and good carcass characteristics.

South Devons originated in southwestern England around 400 years ago in an area of Devon called South Hams.  Originally they were a triple-purpose breed, being used for beef, milk, and draft work until the 20th century.

 This set uses a trap placed along the traveling paths of the mink. The mink will unknowingly step into the trap while making its nightly rounds. Unlike pocket sets, a blind set does not use bait or a lure.
 Look for tracks, scats, and other signs that minks move through the area. For a wet blind spot, this area is probably near a bank, under a leaning log, around a rock, or at the water’s edge. For a dry blind set, look for where the mink made an overland trail.


While the overland trail might be hard to see, you can find it by looking for bent grass, mink smell, and tracks.
 Place and set a foothold trap in a shallow hole and make sure it’s firmly embedded into the mud. Cover it lightly with leaves, grass, and soil. If it is a wet blind set, push the trap into the waterbed, keeping the trap near the surface of the water.


A No. 110 Conibear trap works well for a dry blind set.
A No. 1½ coil spring works well for a wet blind set.
 You can conceal the trap by lightly covering it with vegetation from the ground. It's important that the area looks like it has not been disturbed.
 Use rocks and sticks to narrow the mink’s travel path to your trap. This will help ensure it walks into your trap.


Look for natural bottlenecks along the mink's path. This will make it easier to ensure the mink crosses your trap.
 While mink are naturally curious, they are also cautious. Minks have a very strong sense of smell. You want to eliminate all human scent from the trap to make it effective. Pour mink urine around a set to eliminate human odor.

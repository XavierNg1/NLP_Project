 Macadamia nuts are known for being difficult to remove from their shells. Wear safety glasses or goggles to shield your eyes from any bits of shell that may go flying during this process. Basic protective equipment can be purchased at nearly any drug or grocery store.
 A device made specifically for the task of cracking macadamia nuts will assist you in shelling these difficult nuts. The device is made to crack the shell while preserving the integrity of the nut inside. These may be difficult to find in local stores, so order one online through Amazon or another online seller if you cannot find any in a store near you., Using your nut cracker, begin cracking the shells. Most crackers will have you pull or turn a crank that will put an immense amount of pressure on the nut until it finally cracks. Once it has cracked, peel away the rest of the shell to expose the nut inside. Throw away the bits of shell and store the nut in a bowl or container nearby.

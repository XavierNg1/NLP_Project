 Pick up your hair dryer, or if you have one, a heat gun. Blow hot air directly onto the dent. Give it a good minute or so under the heat. You need to really heat up the metal. This process will cause the metal to expand. Once you let it cool, the metal will contract, and it may pop back smooth., As you probably know, dry ice is very, very cold. Because it's so cold, you may be able to get the metal to contract with it, fixing the dent. All you do is hold the ice to the dent, though you may want to wrap the ice in a soft cloth to protect your refrigerator from scratches. Keep it in place for a good minute or until you can see the metal is cold.Be sure to put on protective gloves. Dry ice will burn your fingers as surely as a hot stove.
 Pick up that can of air next to your computer, the one you use to blow off your keyboard. Now, the fun part. Ignore the directions that say don't turn it upside down. Blow the air at the dent with the can upside-down, which will cause a cold condensation to blow out. Give it a few good blasts. It's cold enough that it may cause the dent to contract, fixing itself.Keep your hands back. You don't want to get that condensation on your skin. It'll burn as quick as dry ice will.

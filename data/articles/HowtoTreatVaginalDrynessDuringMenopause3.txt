 Washing your vulva with soap can be irritating and drying. Stick to water only or, if you must use soap, a plant-based oil soap like glycerin soap. Make sure you rinse your vulva in the shower once a day using water, washing your vulva and genital area.When you are wiping your vulva after using the bathroom, make sure you use white, unscented toilet paper. This will ensure your vulva is not being irritated whenever you wipe yourself.
 Cotton underwear will allow your genital area to breathe, especially if you tend to sweat throughout the day or are doing strenuous activity. Avoid underwear made of synthetic material, like silk, nylon, or rayon.When you wash your underwear, only use detergent that has no added perfumes or dyes. You should also avoid using any additives like fabric softeners or anti-static dryer sheets.
 Personal hygiene products like deodorant sprays for your genital area or douching products will only irritate this area further. Your vagina contains bacteria that helps to keep it clean and healthy. Using personal hygiene products will only disrupt the balance of bacteria in your vagina, an essential balance for keeping your vagina infection-free.

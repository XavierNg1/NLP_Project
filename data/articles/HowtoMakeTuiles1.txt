 Cover a baking tray (sheet) with parchment paper. Or, you can butter a tray.;
, Add the eggs and whisk together.
 If using, add the almonds now.
 Place on the baking tray. Repeat across the tray, leaving plenty of room between each biscuit to spread.
 Shake off the water. Use the back of the fork to press down gently on the batter dollops to help them spread a little.
 Bake for around 4 minutes. The tuiles are ready when the edges turn a golden brown. The centre should stay white.
 While still hot, bend each biscuit over the rolling pin (or a clean bottle).


Biscuits will probably break while you attempt this. You need to learn the fine timing of leaving the baked biscuits on the tray for a few seconds, then quickly turning them into curled biscuits.
The biscuits can also be pressed into little moulds for different shapes, such as a basket to be filled with berries.
 When cooled, they will harden into the curled shape. Serve with dessert or as a treat filled with whipped cream.

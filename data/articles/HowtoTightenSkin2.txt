 One of the best forms of exercise to treat tight skin is weight training. Doing deadlifts and bench presses tightens skin in the stomach, arms, back, and thighs. Starting at about one or two pounds, lift regularly at the gym or at home. Aim for five sets of six to eight reps and make sure to engage in some light lifting and cardio to warm up.Make sure to ease into a routine. Start with only light amounts of weight and work your way up. If you feel strained, take a break.
It's a good idea to talk to a doctor before engaging in weight resistance training.
 If you're not already drinking plenty of water, start. Aim to drink roughly two liters of water a day. This will promote skin elasticity and help tighten up loose skin., If you smoke, even only occasionally, quit. In addition to having a poor effect on skin elasticity, smoking comes with a range of risks to your health. Talk to a doctor about quitting smoking if you're looking to tighten your skin.As quitting any addictive substance is hard, seek support. Join a support group in your area or online and let friends and families members know you would appreciate support as you try to quit smoking.
 Protein-rich foods are vital to tighten skin. Go for healthy protein choices, like cottage cheese, tofu, milk, legumes, beans, seeds, nuts, and fish. These contain nutrients that help your body form collagen and elastin.

 If you'd like to, you can clip or tie the hair on one side of your head out of the way. You will be making two identical braids on each side of your head.
 Try to leave a small gap between your front hair line and the section of hair.
 The strands should be perpendicular to the center part.
 Cross one strand over the other, then pull it through the formed loop. Gently pull on the strands to tighten the knot.








Twist the strands slightly to catch any flyaways. You can also lightly mist them with water instead.
 Take some hair from the left side of the knot, and add it to the left strand. Take some more hair from the right side of the knot, and add it to the right strand.








The amount of hair you are adding should be thinner than the strands themselves.
 Once again, give the strands a light twist to make them smooth, then tie them into a knot.
 You can continue the braid to the back of your head, or you can stop just behind the ear. Try to keep the braid centered as you work.
 When your braid is the length you desire, gather the two strands into a mini pigtail and secure them with a clear elastic or mini hair tie.
 Unclip the hair on the other side of your head. Gather a small section of hair from the hair line and split it into two strands. Chain-braid the two strands until you reach the back/side of your head. Secure the braid with an elastic when you are done.
 If you ended the braids on the back of your head, gather both mini ponytails, and secure them together with an elastic to make a thicker ponytail. If you ended the braids just behind your ear, gather all of your hair into two high pig tails. Secure them to the braids with hair ties.
 Secure the bun with another hair tie. Then, pin it to your hair using bobby pins so that it lays flat.

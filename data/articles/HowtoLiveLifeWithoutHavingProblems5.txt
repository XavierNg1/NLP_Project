 Use some helpful websites or get some extra help; for tests, ask your teachers if you can go into a quiet room. Try getting a tutor also.
 After you've received your test and thought that marks were unfair, privately talk to them. Tell the teacher with strong reasoning why you deserve a better mark.
 If, for example the teacher is being rude, you can always try to listen, be good in class, do your homework, and get to class on time; listen and complete your work and don't goof around. If you're already behaving and that teacher is being mean to you, then you can try telling other administrators why the teacher is being rude.

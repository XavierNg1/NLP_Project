This can be easily done with the Ambassador, a gun that when you shoot a headshot, it becomes a Critical Hit.
 Stab 1 engineer, sap a sentry, and pull your Dead Ringer up. Repeat.


Remember that if you are disguised, enemy Dispensers can recharge your cloak, and a L3 Dispenser can keep you cloaked with Dead Ringer, taking only 10% of damage forever
If possible, go for engineers and sentries that are hidden from other sentries (e.g. behind a wall). That way, you won't have to take as much damage.
Use the knife Your Eternal Reward to slowly take down each engineer. The silent kill and instant disguise will ensure that you are safe.
, Try new loadouts constantly so that, as a spy, you can handle any situation.


Practice your trick stabs. A walkway is a very good place to do so.

 Lay out craft paper on the floor. Place each piece on the paper and cut out a template. Make sure to trim the paper to the size of the art piece when it is framed., Tape your templates using painter’s tape. Start with the centerpiece and place it at eye level, i.e., about 57 inches (144.8 cm) from the floor. Then arrange the rest of the pieces around it in the exact way that you want them. Step back and see if:The space is filled appropriately.
The arrangement is too close or too far from nearby furniture.
Play with the arrangement until you are happy with it.
 With a pencil or pen, place a dot on the craft paper where the frame’s hanging attachment is. This is where you will hammer in your nails., Do this with the paper still on the wall. After you have hammered in all of your nails, un-tape the paper and tear it away from the nail. Make sure to use weight-appropriate nails.Use monkey-hook picture hangers for art up to 35 pounds (560 ounces), i.e., lightweight art.
Use nails or hollow-wall hangers for art up to 79 pounds (1,264 ounces).
Use wall anchors for art up to 143 pounds (2,288 ounces).
 Start by hanging the centerpiece(s) first. Use a leveler to make sure each piece is straight. Then step back from the wall and assess it one more time. Make sure the paintings are level and the arrangement is cohesive.

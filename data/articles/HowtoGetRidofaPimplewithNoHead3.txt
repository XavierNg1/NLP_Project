 The best way to prevent blind pimples is proper face hygiene. This means you should wash your face and areas with pimples twice a day. You may want to take a bath or shower once a day to remove dirt and oil from your entire body.Always wash your face after any activities where you sweat a lot.
Avoid touching your face as well because this can introduce bacteria to the skin on your face.
 If you are having trouble with blind pimples under your skin, cleanse your face with a gentle, plant-oil based product. When choosing a face wash, look for one labeled non-comedogenic. Non-comedogenic products do not lead to the formation of pimples.Examples of non-comedogenic products include Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Olay. Many store-brand products or generic products are also non-comedogenic. Always check the label to make sure.
Use alcohol-free products on your face because alcohol irritates and may damage the skin.
 When you wash your face, use your fingertips to wash. Washcloths and sponges may irritate the skin, which can lead to more problems. Massage the face wash gently in a circular motion.


Avoid scrubbing your face. This can cause scarring.

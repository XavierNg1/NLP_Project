 In the US, romantic partners are ten times as likely to seek counseling as sibling partners. Siblings often live far apart, and they don't need to find ways to deal with things together on a daily basis, like money or children. Siblings don't always invest as much in their relationship as they do with their significant other, simply because it is easier not to.While few adult siblings sever ties with their family completely, as many as one-third describe their relationship as “rivalrous” or “distant.”
Counseling for siblings can be just as effective as marriage counseling, if both partners are genuinely willing to work things out.
Experts say the number one cause of rifts between siblings is an inheritance or family assets – money is also a leading cause of divorce., If the rift with your sibling is causing you emotional distress, but your sister or brother is not willing to try therapy, consider going on your own. One-person family therapy is based on the idea that family dynamics can be affected, and eventually altered, by changing the behavior of just one family member. Learning to understand the underlying problems in your family may help you change the way all of you relate to each other., If there is a family member or good family friend whom you and your sibling both feel is a neutral party, consider asking them to mediate your discussion. An outside party who is able to listen to you both – without taking sides – may be able to spot the root of the problem when you can't.


A caring mediator will offer support for both of you, which may help you get through a potentially unpleasant, emotionally-charged conversation.

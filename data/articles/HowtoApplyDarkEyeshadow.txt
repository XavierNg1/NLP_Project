 Always start with a newly clean face before putting on makeup.;
, This includes foundation, blush, concealer, lipstick, lip gloss, etc. This also includes doing your eyebrows.
 This eye shadow color should be neutral, not an exotic color.
 This serves as a base color for the rest of the shadows.

Try to go for a medium colored brown. Don't choose a brown color that is too light, or else it doesn't work as good for a base color. On the other hand, don't choose a super dark brown, or else it will show through the rest of your eye shadow.
 This will make your eyes appear larger and clearer.
 For example, black, navy blue, or another darkish color. If you decide to use black, don't pack it on too heavy.
 Split your shade a little to the under the eyebrow. Then brush a little on the lower eyelid.
 If you want, you could do a wing.
 Several layers of mascara will produce a more intense look for your eyes, but don't over do it, or your eye lashes will be all clumpy. You can also apply fake eye lashes if you want.
 Once the eye shadow is done for both eyes, you are ready for the day!

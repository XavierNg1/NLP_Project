 There are many online ticketing websites, such as Fandangoand MovieTickets.com.Some of these websites even have special perks for those who sign up and use their service regularly so if youâ€™re a film buff, consider signing up as a member.


Be aware that not all of the theaters in your area will have online ticketing available. Smaller theaters in particular are less likely to use online ticketing services. Luckily, these websites will tell you if that is the case so you can call the theater directly or go to their website.
 This step will show you all the theaters in the area and you can browse to see which are showing the film you would like to see.
 Once you have chosen the movie and location, you can enter in the date and time you want to see the movie. Depending on the film and theater, you may be able to buy your ticket far in advance or you may have to wait until it is closer to the actual showing date.
 Most online ticketing services accept a variety of credit or debit cards along with online payment services, such as PayPal.
 Most theaters will allow you to simply show your receipt on your phone and print out your tickets just before entering the movie. You can also print your ticket at home if you have a printer. Just be sure to save the email confirmation that you have bought your ticket as this will serve as your proof of purchase.

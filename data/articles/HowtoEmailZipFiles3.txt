 A drop down menu should appear with a variety of options.


If you are creating a ZIP file or downloading a ZIP file, save it in an easily accessible location like your Desktop or Documents folder.
 Depending on what operating system you’re using, your computer will open up your default e-mail program and attach the ZIP files to a new blank message.



Mac: Right-click on the file and rollover to the option, “Share”. A menu should appear. Click “Mail”.

Windows: Right-click on the file and point to “Send to”. Then click, “Mail Recipient”., Be sure to include the recipient’s e-mail address, a subject for your e-mail, and a message.


It may take a while for your message to send, especially if the ZIP file you are sending is quite large. Check your outbox and sent mailbox to ensure your e-mail has been successfully sent.

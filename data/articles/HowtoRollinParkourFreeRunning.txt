 Practice on soft ground first, such as a mattress or grass.;
,







Put your hand on the ground, a little to the opposite side you are rolling.






Now, tuck your head to the opposite side and push forward rolling on your shoulder, diagonally across your back (left shoulder to lower-right back or right shoulder to lower-left back).






Try to curl into a ball while rolling.






After that, put your knee on the ground or stand up directly with two feet.
 Again, begin with a soft surface.
 Try with something about three feet tall. Make sure that you can launch yourself off of it though; it's safer to try small, but going fast will apply what you'll feel from a higher fall.
 After you jump, make sure to plot out your landing.
 Once the balls of your feet hit the ground, bend your knees (not more than about 90 degrees), crouch and lean forward as quick as possible . Make sure to push off of your feet to propel yourself forward.
 Be careful not to land on your neck, or mid back, as you might get hurt. Perform the movements explained above; curl your shoulder and land on it, but be sure to roll diagonally.

Blow the dirt and dust from the Plexiglas surface using an air hose powered by an air compressor. Point the air hose so it can blow the dirt to one side or another of the Plexiglas surface, instead of pointing the air directly at the surface.
Wipe the Plexiglas surface with a cloth dampened with warm water. Do not apply pressure as you skim the dirt from the surface.;

Mix a solution of 1/4 c. (59 mL) laundry detergent with warm water in a gallon (3.78 liters) bucket. Stir with your hand to completely mix the soap and water.






Wipe the Plexiglas surface with a clean sponge or microfiber cloth that has been immersed in the bucket. Apply pressure to stubborn stains like grease or oil.






Dry the Plexiglas by blotting it with a dry, soft cloth. Do not rub with the cloth, as this can create scratches.



Apply automobile wax to the Plexiglas using the pad provided or a soft cloth. Put the wax on in a thin layer. The wax should not be a cleanser/wax combination. Automobile wax helps deflect dirt and dust.
Buff the wax into the Plexiglas with a chamois, t-shirt scrap or a flannel cloth. If you notice any dust or dirt residue on the Plexiglas, do not rub in that area, as your rubbing motions can scratch the surface.
Remove static electricity from the Plexiglas surface by wiping it with a dry, soft cloth. Do not apply pressure as you run the cloth across the Plexiglas. Static electricity, unless grounded, attracts dust and other particles to the Plexiglas.

 The best indication that a fig is fully ripe is when it falls to the ground. Rinse the figs to remove dirt and other debris. Trim off bruises and broken parts. Pat them dry with a dishcloth or paper towel before proceeding.;
, Use a sharp paring knife to cut the figs in half from stem to tip. Cutting the figs in half will help them dry more quickly.
 You may use a drying rack intended for this purpose or purchase screening with plenty of ventilation holes. Line the rack with a layer of cheesecloth before setting the figs on top, cut side up.


Don't try to dry the figs on a solid sheet. In order to dry properly, they need airflow from below and above.
Use a double layer of cheesecloth if you have a rack with very large holes.
 This will protect them from insects as they dry. Tuck the cheesecloth tightly around the drying rack, securing it with tape if necessary, to make sure it won't come loose.
 This method works best when it is very dry and hot outside. Don't place the figs in the shade, or they won't dry as quickly and may spoil before they're properly preserved.
 Each evening, take them inside - unless the temperature where you live does not drop more than 20 degrees at night. In the mornings, turn the figs over, so they dry evenly on all sides. The figs are ready when when the outside feels leathery and no juice can be seen on the inside when squeezed.


If the figs remain a little sticky, you can finish them in the oven.
Store the dried figs in a cool, dry place or freeze them to make them last even longer.

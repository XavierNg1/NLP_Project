 If there are a number of Bravo players alive (at least 2-3 or even more) you will die soon enough by running around. Instead try to take out a couple of players so there are less people that can bother you while you are planting and later camping the bomb. If you play with your clan and has Vent/Skype, try getting some help from them on where the enemy was last seen.
 Regardless of whether you managed to kill some enemies you need to plant it before time runs out or your team will lose. Carefully approach one of the bombsites and make sure it's clear/take out any enemy before planting. If you are up against only 1 or 2 enemies and are wearing speed gear it can be a good idea to approach a bombsite, spray a little against the enemies and then run another way to the other bombsite and plant. That way they will probably stay at the other site until they realize you planted it which prevents you from getting killed while planting. After you planted it the same thing as mentioned before applies, camp and distract enemies from defusing. If you brought mines and still have them it's a perfect opportunity to use them. Carefully plant them around the bomb before leaving the site - if you are killed and get lucky the defuser will trip on them. If not, they still have to waste couple of extra seconds to blow them. Be especially careful for backreapers when you are solo.

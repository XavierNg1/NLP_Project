 Establishing a moderate exercise routine can help you be healthier overall.That increased health both boosts your natural immunities and can help you get over illness more quickly.


Try going for a brisk walk for at least 30 minutes most days.Find a walking buddy to keep you motivated and accountable. Even an enthusiastic dog can be a great walking companion.
If you don’t like exercising, try getting involved in a recreational sport or finding an active hobby that will “trick” you into exercising while you are having fun. Some examples could be racquetball, rock climbing, roller skating, kayaking, hiking, or even bird watching in the wilderness.;
, Many Americans have a vitamin D deficiency,which has long-ranging effects on human health. The best way to boost vitamin D levels is to have moderate exposure to direct sunlight. The fresh air won’t hurt either!

, Sleep deprivation can leave your more susceptible to pick up illness.Getting an adequate amount of sleep at night can help your body become refreshed and build its natural defenses. Additionally, getting extra sleep at the first sign of illness can help you bounce back more quickly.
 You should certainly avoid smoking yourself for many health reasons, but even being around other people who are smoking can decrease your immune function.If you are a smoker, you should quit.
If your friends or family members are smokers, try encouraging them to quit. If that doesn’t work, avoid the smokers during times that your immune system needs to be strongest (like during cold and flu season).
 Caffeine and alcoholmay be fine in moderation, but excessive consumption of either can compromise your immunity.Remember that water is the best source of healthy hydration, and if you follow other immune-boosting steps like reducing your stress levels and getting more sleep, you may find that you don’t feel like you need caffeine and alcohol as much.

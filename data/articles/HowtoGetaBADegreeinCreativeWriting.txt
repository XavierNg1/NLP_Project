 While it is true you will take the traditional liberal arts courses required for the degree, a concentration in creative writing will require you to take a series of courses that:


Don’t require traditional testing methods.
Include writing workshops.
Track your progress on a particular piece of work, such as your novel or script.
Encourage you to critique your classmate’s work.;

 For example, take a look at Minnesota’s State University comparison of required courses for a BA in English vs. a BFA in creative writing., Creative writing programs are designed to make you a better writer. As such, there will be heavy emphasis on writing skills, such as grammar, punctuation and sentence structure. (A highly creative story line is pointless if the basic writing is poor and confusing.)

, Artists don’t become good unless they paint every day, pianists can’t play Beethoven’s Ninth unless they practice every day. And you won’t become a good creative writer unless you write every day.


Keep a journal. Write in it every day, even if it is just a few paragraphs.
Always carry a small notebook with you. Jot down story ideas, character sketches, details about trees, birds, and the person in the next booth; in short, observe and make detailed notes about everything.
Commit yourself to a daily practice writing routine. For at least 1 hour a day, use writing prompt to do some free flow writing. You can get a free writing prompt for every day of the year at The Teacher’s Corner.

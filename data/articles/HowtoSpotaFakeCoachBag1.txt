 There should be little wear to the bag and the material should be sturdy. Coach products are made from expensive and authentic materials. For example, they use real, high-quality leather. So if the bag appears overly smooth and plastic-y, it's likely to be made from a synthetic like pleather, which would make it a fake.


If the bag is flimsy or it appears to stretch a lot, these are also red flags.;
, The seams and stitching of Coach bags are even and clean. Each stitch should be the exact same length. They should also be straight and not over-stitched. This means you will see only one line of thread, not multiples stitched over each other.
 Most Coach purses will have a solid-color, satin lining. However, bags without the ‘CC’ print on the exterior may have it on the interior instead. This may not always be the case, though, as some bags may not have the CC pattern on either the outside or the inside.


Keep in mind that a Coach bag should never have the CC pattern on both the inside and outside.

 This can be for the year, the month or the quarter, but all data should be gathered over the same period of time to achieve accurate figures.;
, This is your receipts from all sales in the period.
 This may include production costs, if you make the products in-house. It may be the purchase price of the goods sold, if you buy them from a supplier.


Do not factor in taxes, interest or general business expenses. These are not accounted for in gross profit margin, but they are later used to figure out net income derived from the business as a whole.
If you want to figure out the profitability of several products, you can separate the total revenue and the total cost of goods sold for each product and find individual gross profit margins.



For example, if you made $200 selling 100 cans of soda and the cost of the goods sold was $100, then your gross profit would be $100.
 Multiply the number by 100 to get a percentage, rather than a decimal.


For example, divide $100 by $100 and the figure is 1. If you multiply it by 100, you get a gross profit percentage of 100 percent.
, Subtract it from the selling price of an individual can.
 $1.00 is your gross profit.
 Multiply by 100 to get the percentage.


In our example, the gross profit margin is $1.00 divided by $1.00, so we get a profit margin percentage of 100 percent.

 For helping them exercise, provide them with a solid wheel in their cage. Do not use wire or mesh wheels as it can cause bumble foot. Make sure the wheel is big enough so that your hamster's back isn't arching when it runs in the wheel, as that can cause back problems. If you want to bring your hamster out of the cage, provide a hamster ball or a playpen. Don't leave your hamster out for too long, because it can get stresses.
 A hamster's teeth really grow fast, especially dwarf hamsters. Provide them with chew toys such as wooden chews to help trim their teeth.

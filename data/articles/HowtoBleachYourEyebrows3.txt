 If you don't want to use bleach creme, or you want to just try out what lighter brows would be like, try using 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Dip a cotton swab into the liquid solution, and apply it to the areas of your eyebrow you'd like to lighten.Hydrogen peroxide is an easily obtained, inexpensive product that's available in drug stores, pharmacies, or with first aid products.
Leave it on for a few minutes the first time you apply it, then wipe it off. If you want, reapply every day, which will result in a gradual lightening of your eyebrows.
 If you prefer using natural products over chemicals, try combining chamomile tea with lemon juice. To make the tea, pour a cup of boiling water over a chamomile tea bag and allow to steep for 1 hour. Mix in an equal portion of lemon juice, and stir well.Apply with a cotton swab to your eyebrows.
Repeat every day to gradually lighten your eyebrows.
 A brow pencil a few shades lighter than your current eyebrow shade will make your eyebrows appear lighter. If your eyebrows are dark brown, try penciling in a warm light brown.You can also use lighter colored eyeshadows around your eyebrows to maintain a lighter look.
Brow gel that's several shades lighter than your current shade can also create the effect of a lighter eyebrow.

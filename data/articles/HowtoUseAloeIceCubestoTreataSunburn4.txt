 Rub the cube directly over your skin till you feel numb and the cube melts. Try to work with only one or two cubes if possible, to avoid having them melt all over the place.


Consider holding each cube with a clean washcloth. As the cube melts, it will be absorbed by the washcloth, reducing further mess.
 Do this for a while after you've noticed the burn. The cubes will slowly melt, but provide longer relief. Keep a dry towel nearby to catch the melting liquid.
 Once you've used your aloe vera cubes and treated the burn, avoid rubbing your burn with a towel. Instead, let your skin dry naturally.
 If you plan to use the entire tray, dump the cubes into a separate bowl you can maintain in the freezer. Then refill the tray and freeze so you have another round on hand.

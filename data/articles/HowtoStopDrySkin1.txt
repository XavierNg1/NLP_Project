 A hot shower or bath can be soothing, particularly in cold weather, but the hot water can be very drying. That’s because it washes away the skin’s natural oils. Keep your skin more hydrated by washing with warm or lukewarm water instead.When it’s possible, such as during hot summer months, try to wash with cool or cold water. It’s actually the most beneficial when it comes to stopping dry skin.;
, Even if you’re washing with warm or lukewarm water, long or frequent baths and showers can strip away your skin’s oils so it becomes dehydrated. Limit your bathing time to 5 to 10 minutes a day to put an end to dry skin.If you need to stay in the bath or shower for longer, such as to treat sore muscles, be sure that you’re using a moisturizing bath oil or cream to combat any extra dryness.
 Soap may get you clean, but it can strip away your skin’s natural oils and leave it dry and itchy. Wash with a soapless, alcohol-free, fragrance-free body wash that can help keep your skin hydrated.Avoid using too much body wash. Wash with just enough to remove dirt and oils, but not so much that it creates a thick lather.
If you must use a soap, be sure to choose a moisturizing formula rather than a deodorant or perfumed version.
 Removing the dead, dry cells that sit on the surface of your skin can help put an end of dryness and itchiness. Use a scrub designed for the body two to three times a week, and a scrub with fine, gentle grains designed for the face one to two times a week to keep skin smooth and hydrated.If your skin is sensitive, exfoliating once a week is enough.
Avoid scrubbing your skin too hard when you’re exfoliating. You may wind up irritating it, which can leave it even drier. Apply your exfoliator in gentle circular motions.

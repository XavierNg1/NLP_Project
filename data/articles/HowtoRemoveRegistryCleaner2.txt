 All versions of Windows have a built-in utility called System Restore, which allows you to restore the configuration of your computer to a previous date. So, if you installed the registry cleaner a week ago and it began causing problems, you can restore your computer to a date over a week ago to remove the software. To open the program, type "restore" into the Start menu search field and click on the "System Restore" icon when it appears in the search results.
 In the opening screen of System Restore, select the radio button that reads, "Choose a different restore point." Click the "OK" button to continue.
 In the next window, you will see a list of possible restore points. Each entry will show a date and the action you performed on that date. Each time you install a new piece of software or make changes to the registry, Windows automatically creates a restore point in case something goes wrong. Find the date on which you installed the registry cleaner and select it. Click "OK" to continue.
 Click "OK" on the next screen to confirm the system restore. Allow your computer to complete the restoration process and then check to make sure the registry cleaner has been removed.

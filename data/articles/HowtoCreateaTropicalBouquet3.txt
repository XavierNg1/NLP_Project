 This gives your bouquet a focal point. It also allows you to use larger blooms to frame the flowers in the middle.If you don’t want to arrange by size, you can choose instead to place your favorite flowers in the middle.
 Once you have your center flowers arranged, use the next largest flowers to frame the center. You should add these flowers in a balanced way.For example, if you put a larger flower on one side of your center arrangement, you should place a matching flower on the other side of the center. This gives your bouquet a clean, symmetrical look.
 Accents like tropical grasses will give your bouquet some extra style. You can also use things like seashells or brightly colored plastic jewels on pic sticks. Don’t add too many accents - you don’t want them to overwhelm the bouquet.Tropical grasses and leaves that you can use as accents include monstera, ginger foliage, and virions.
 Once you have the flowers arranged how you want them, twist floral wire around the stems to hold them in place. This will prevent your bouquet from falling apart and also make it easier to hold.
 This gives the bouquet an extra bit of strength. It also prevents the wire from rusting – which can happen if it gets wet. If that happens and the rust gets on your clothes, they can be ruined. Floral tape helps prevent this from happening., This will cover up the floral tape. It also gives you a chance to bring more of your theme into your bouquet. You can use any type of fabric that matches your theme or bouquet: ribbon, burlap, cotton, or even strings of gems or pearls.

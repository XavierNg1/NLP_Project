, The switch-off is in equivalent amounts. Most baked good recipes need a little bit of fat. Consider substituting half the fat at first and experimenting from there with the percentage of fat you switch out.
 The replacement of 1/4 cup of egg substitute per each egg called for in the recipe lowers the fat in the recipe but does little to effect the texture or flavor of your baked goods.
 Use water or stock to cook food with to keep things from sticking to the bottom instead of the butter or oil a recipe calls for.
 Replacing with yogurt works well also in cakes and most baked goods.
 When mixed in with other ingredients, some items respond the same in the recipe without carrying all the fat with them. In recipes, use low-fat cheeses, yogurts, mayonnaise, salad dressings, sour cream, cream cheese and cream soups.

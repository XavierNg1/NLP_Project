 If you are unhappy in your current employment situation, consider that the other party to the contract may be unhappy as well. If both parties agree, they can rescind the contract and let each other out of the agreement. A mutual agreement to terminate the contract early is often the best-case scenario for getting out of an employment contract.
 Once again, you will need to go back to your contract to determine how much notice, if at all, you owe the other party before abandoning the contract. A typical timeframe is two weeks, but the required notice can vary from contract to contract. Take into account any accrued vacation time into your calculation, if applicable. Failure to give the required notice can lead to you being financially liable to the other party for breaking the contract.
 If your employer is not as eager to end the contract as you are, you may be able to negotiate terms of the contract in order to persuade the other party to allow you to end it early without negative consequences. For instance, you could agree to give your employer time to find a replacement, you could offer to stay on in order to train a new employee, or you could offer an employee a severance package. These sorts of negotiations may help end the contract on good terms for both parties.
 Sometimes, the assistance of a mediator or another neutral third party can help you negotiate the terms of ending the contract. This is much less expensive alternative to going to court and litigating your dispute. Plus, it can help you reach a mutually agreeable settlement that will end the contract in a way that you both can live with.

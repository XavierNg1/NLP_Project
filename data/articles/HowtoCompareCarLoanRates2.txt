 The size of the down payment affects the amount of interest that you will have to pay. A larger down payment may qualify you for lower interest rates, so it is in your best interest to pay as much as you can upfront., If you are considering loans only from banks or credit unions that you are already familiar with and have had dealings with in the past, this may not be necessary.


However, if you are considering using a smaller lender or online lender with whom you are unfamiliar, you should learn about the company history with auto loans. Contact the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to learn about any complaints that have been lodged against your potential lenders and to insure that the company is in good standing with the BBB., Loan applications can be made either on the Internet or in person at financial institutions in your area. When you get loan offers from more than one place, you will have a basis for comparison.


Loan offers may be similar. Still, there are times that a one percent difference can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the long term.
Keep in mind that making loan applications beyond a 30 day period from first to last may adversely affect your credit score.

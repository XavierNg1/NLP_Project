 When caught early, Toxic Shock Syndrome is usually highly treatable. However, undetected TSS can progress rapidly and result in lengthy hospital stays and (in rare cases) irreversible organ failures, amputations, and even death.Play it safe. If you have symptoms of TSS, or if you have possible symptoms plus risk factors for TSS (like ongoing nosebleeds or extended female contraceptive use), get medical assistance right away.
Unless otherwise instructed when you contact medical assistance, immediately remove the tampon you are using (if relevant in your situation)., Although TSS can almost always be treated successfully when detected early, hospital stays of several days (sometimes in the ICU) are not uncommon. In most instances, the frontline treatment involves the use of one or more antibiotics.Symptom-based treatments will also occur based on the particulars of you case. These can include the provision of oxygen, IV fluids, pain or other medications, and sometimes kidney dialysis.
 Unfortunately, once you have had TSS, you are approximately thirty percent more likely to get it again in the future. Therefore, you need to make some lifestyle changes and keep a keen eye out for symptoms if you want to avoid a severe recurrence.For example, if you have ever had TSS, you should not use tampons (rely on pads instead). You should also find alternate means of female contraception other than devices like sponges or diaphragms.

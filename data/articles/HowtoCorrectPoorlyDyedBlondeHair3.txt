 Chlorine in either pool or bath water can cause blonde dye to turn green, so using a chlorine removal shampoo should restore your hair back to the intended blonde hue.Look for chlorine removal shampoos containing thiosulfate.Apply the shampoo as you would apply any other shampoo when washing your hair.
If you don't have chlorine removal shampoo, try rinsing your hair with club soda, tomato juice, or lemon juice after exposing it to chlorine-heavy water. These natural remedies may remove most of the green tint., If you don't have access to a chlorine removal shampoo, or if your blonde hair turned green due to sun exposure rather than chlorine exposure, try applying ketchup to your hair. The red in the tomatoes can actually neutralize the green tint.Additionally, the acid in the tomatoes can strip away minerals responsible for the adverse reaction.
When working with ketchup, massage 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) into your hair using your fingertips, then rinse it out with cool water after 20 or 30 minutes.You should then be able to shampoo your hair like usual.
 Regardless of whether you use chlorine removal shampoo or ketchup, you need to follow your shampoo ritual with a moisturizing conditioner. Hair dye, clarifying shampoos, and acidic tomatoes can all strip your hair of its natural, necessary oils. Applying a conditioner can help restore the moisture that would otherwise be lost.


The exact conditioner needed may vary by hair type and damage. If your hair is otherwise healthy, any standard conditioner should probably be fine. If it feels dry or brittle, however, a leave-in conditioner would be better.

 Gerry and his band may be attempting to destroy the settlement in order to get to you, but this isn't always the case.
 If you must come out of your shelter during nighttime, taking along swords and guns and knives is the most effective way of defending both you and your home. Throw rocks at Gerry and his band to scare them away., Fighting back is the most complicated thing to do, but it saves you. Try to wound one band member using a sword, and another using a gun. Kill the leader somehow, and this will prevent the band from attacking back.

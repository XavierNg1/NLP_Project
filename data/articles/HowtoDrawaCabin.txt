 Draw a slanted triangle for the roof.Â Draw a diamond shape for the wall and an arrow shape for the front of the cabin. Remember, your drawing should end up looking three-dimensional, so don't draw these initial shapes too flatly.
 It should be taller than the house itself, going all the way down the front with another parallel line to provide the right perspective.
 Be sure to extend one of the sides to make a cover. At this point your cabin should really be starting to take shape.
 Draw in the windows and the door. These can be wherever you like, but you can always just follow the example image for a solid guide.
 Sketch in a floor/porch for the cabin, again adding extra lines to indicate depth.
 Try to make all the supporting posts about the same size, and the horizontal section as straight as possible.
 Use various shades of brown (since it's mostly made of wood and timber), although you can color the chimney grey or red to make it look like stone or brick.
 Draw an equilateral triangle over the right half of the line.;
, Below each of the triangle's corners, draw a long skinny rectangle.
 Then, connect the horizontal lines at the top and bottom of the triangle. Finally, draw a horizontal line under the left rectangle from the previous step.
 Connect the two skinny rectangles with a horizontal line. Then, add a small rectangle intersected by a cylinder.

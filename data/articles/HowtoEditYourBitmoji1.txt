If you want to change your Bitmoji’s outfit without having to scroll through face and hair options, tap the Outfit button (the icon of a shirt at the top-right corner of the screen) instead.
 Choose either Bitmoji Style or Bitstrips Style for your avatar. If you don’t want to change the style, select the style you were already using.



Bitmoji Style looks very cartoonlike, with large eyes and exaggerated features (sort of like Manga). The drawings are simple and customization is somewhat limited.

Bitstrips Style is still pretty cartoonlike, but definitely more customizable (and slightly more realistic). You can edit the hair length and add facial lines with this style.
 The options differ depending on the style of Bitmoji you selected, but you’ll be able to select facial features, hair options, and body types. As you make selections, tap the arrow at the top-right corner of the screen to save your selection. When you’re finished, you’ll see “Save and Pick Outfit.”

,, Tap an outfit to see how it looks on your avatar. If you don’t like it, tap the back button to return to the list.
 This saves the edited version of your Bitmoji character. Next time you use Bitmoji in a chat or app, you’ll see your edits in action.

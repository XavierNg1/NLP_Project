 Bonding screed to the concrete base reduces the risk of cracking or curling. The concrete must be strong and uncracked.This approach is best for thin layers of screed:A screed layer 35mm (1.4") thick is ideal, if the concrete base is flat enough to ensure the screed is at least 25mm (1") thick at all points.
If the concrete is not flat to those tolerances, add screed 40mm (1.6") thick instead.
Increasing the thickness beyond this requires modifications to the mix to prevent debonding.
 You must expose the aggregate in the concrete so it can bond with the screed. You can do this by hand using a chipping hammer or pick, or rent a floor scabbler or shot blaster.Make sure the entire surface is roughened, and no paint or other material remains on the surface.


Wear respiratory protection to protect against silica dust., Vacuum up all dust and debris, sprinkling with water to reduce airborne particles.Remove grease stains if present.
 Two common options are a slurry made from PVA glue, water, and cement; or SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber), which is recommended for areas that will be exposed to water.Follow instructions on your product label to prepare the concrete and apply. Alternatively, you can make your own cement bonding agent. This doesn't require any special ingredients, but it can fail to bond if you don't work quickly and accurately:Dampen the cement the day before and let stand at least four hours. Remove all excess water, then wait until the surface looks dry.
Mix sand-cement grout (in a 1:1 ratio). Add enough water to form a slurry the consistency of PVA paint.
Stir continuously and apply within 30 minutes of mixing.
Do not delay before adding the screed. If the grout dries, the screed will not bond.
 You are now ready to mix and add the screed. Continue on to the next section below.

 Depending on how festive you want it, there are many different types of beautiful ornaments to choose from when you're creating a Victorian style tree. Some that look beautiful are miniature fans, lace hats, parasols, flower cones, mini tussie-mussies, and very elaborate ball ornaments.;
, It is very easy to fashion hats, fans, and parasols from poster board and then cover with lace or fabric, ad some tiny flowers and bits of ribbon. Raid your craft drawers and sewing supplies for left over notions that lend itself to the theme.
 You can get cheap faux pearls from the craft section of most stores. You can also use the rope or beads to make small rings to hang from branches.
 Add lots of sparkly stuff to catch the lights of the beads and reflect itself all over. You can achieve this look with sequined or glittered ornaments and balls or with tinsel.
 Take some ornaments or anything you may want and hot glue lace over it to create a Victorian ornament. You can add flowers too.

 Toddlers are like little monkeys. They love to climb. Discourage your child from climbing on furniture from a young age. Keep your child’s windows closed. Keep furniture away from windows to prevent your toddler from opening them and leaping out.Window screens will not prevent a child from falling out of a window. Unless a window has safety latches that keep it from opening more than a small amount (not enough to fall out of), you shouldn’t leave a toddler alone in a room with an open window, whether it’s screened or not.
 Be sure to bolt all the furniture to the wall to prevent it from toppling over. You should use the straps included by the manufacturer to do this, but if you’ve lost or misplaced the straps, you can buy furniture wall straps online or at your local home and bedroom store., Toddlers put almost anything they can find in their mouths. For this reason, remove small coins, toys that might get lodged in the throat, and similar objects. Anything that can fit inside a toilet paper roll does not belong in your toddler’s room.Check toys for removable or fragile parts that might break off.
 If your toddler room is on the second floor, prevent access to the stairs by using a safety gate at the top of the stairs. If your toddler room is on the ground floor and you have a basement, place a safety gate at the top of the basement stairs. Without a safety gate, your toddler might tumble down the stairs and become injured., Place outlet covers over all electrical outlets in the toddler room. It is unlikely that your toddler will get into mischief involving an outlet, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.There are many types of outlet covers. Some are a solid piece, some flip open, and some have rotating faces that swivel to allow access. Get whichever you believe is best for you and your toddler.

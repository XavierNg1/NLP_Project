 You can use any two names, but short names tend to work best for this method.


This method is most commonly used for names other than the given names of both parents.
Use this method once you narrow down your selection to two names. If you attempt to use more than two names, the result will usually seem unreasonably long and clunky.
Additionally, this method works best when you narrow it down to names from one gender. It isn't as easy to use when combining names from both genders.

Example: If the child will be a girl, the father of the baby might like “Sarah” and the mother of the baby might like “Elizabeth.”

If the child will be a boy, the father might like “Samuel” and the mother might like “Luke.”



, Put both names side-by-side, then separate them with a hyphen. Doing so should give you a new, mixed name.Combine the names in both orders to see which order sounds best.

Example: For “Sarah” and “Elizabeth,” the two options would be “Sarah-Elizabeth” and “Elizabeth-Sarah.”

For “Samuel” and “Luke,” the two options would be “Samuel-Luke” and “Luke-Samuel.”



, If one or both names seem too long, consider using the shortened form of the name instead of the full name. After shortening the names, hyphenate them again in the same manner as before.


You can combine a shortened version of one name with the full version of the second name, or you can shorten both names (when applicable) and use both shortened versions instead.

Example: For “Sarah” and “Elizabeth,” the name “Elizabeth” can be shortened to “Beth,” giving you the new option of “Sarah-beth.” In this case, you can even remove the hyphen and the “h” after “Sarah,” leaving you with “Sarabeth.”

For “Samuel” and “Luke,” the name “Samuel” can be shortened to “Sam,” giving you the options “Sam-Luke” and “Luke-Sam.”

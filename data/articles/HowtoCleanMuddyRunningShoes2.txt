 Even if they're not filthy, taking care of minor stains as they appear can keep your shoes looking cleaner longer. Try a cleaning pad like the Mr Clean Magic Eraser to remove scuffs and dirt stains., When bacteria is allowed to grow in the fibers of your shoes, you end up with some seriously smelly trainers. Plus, the longer you leave a stain, the more time it has to set, and the harder it will be to remove., Unlacing your shoes and pulling the tongues forward will allow your shoes to air out and dry before your next run.If you don't have time to unlace and re-lace your shoes after and before every run, at least loosen the laces and lift the tongue a little to increase the air flow.
 Keeping cedar in your closet will do double duty of neutralizing stinky shoes and also keep moths away from your clothes.Win/win!


If you keep your shoes in a gym bag or a locker, try using mini deodorizers (like Sneaker Balls) to keep nasty odors at bay.

 Maybe you’re convinced that someone with a bias against beets would really love them if they had no idea they were eating it. Or maybe you just want to switch up its color for the sake of it. Either way, if you want to avoid regular beets’ distinctive color, use golden beets instead for a warmer hue., If you have a container of plain hummus in the fridge but don’t feel too excited about it, or just want fewer dishes to wash afterward, use that as your base. Roast a beet or cook it in water as you would when making hummus for scratch. Then chop it up, toss it in the blender, and add 8 ounces of the plain hummus. Blend it up and enjoy your spruced up hummus., Wash your blender or food processor after you make your hummus, or use a second one if you have two. Place all your ingredients inside: fresh basil, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic, salt, and pepper. Pulse until they mix evenly, pausing every so often to push any bits that are crawling up the sides back down with a spoon or spatula. Then spoon it on top of your hummus before serving., Toast some sandwich bread. Spread the hummus over one side of each slice. Layer some greens like spinach or arugula on top of that. Then top it off with some slices of avocado and sprinkle some crumbled goat cheese over it, and enjoy., Enjoy your hummus with soft pita bread, pita chips, or crackers. Or, cram even more vegetables into your diet. Serve with sliced carrots, celery, or cucumber for dipping instead.

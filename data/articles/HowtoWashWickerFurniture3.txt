 Apply water to your furniture only when strictly necessary, sticking to dusting and vacuuming regularly when dust and dirt appear.


A more thorough hose-down cleaning should only be needed about once a year, if that.Do wash away spills and stains as soon as possible with a damp cloth and mild soap, as wicker will absorb any spilled moisture.Use as little water as possible when you do need to use it, as more moisture will only damage the wicker further over time.
 Protect your furniture from damage by using a varnish, lacquer, or wax meant for use on wicker. Apply it in a thin layer with a brush or cloth, or in a spray form if possible.


Try linseed oil or lemon oil as a natural method to help protect the wicker and boost its shine.
Use a lacquer specifically meant for weatherproofing if you intend to start or continue using the wicker furniture outside.
 Apply a small amount of wood glue to any slats of the wicker that appear broken or fraying.


You can also trim pieces of wicker that are frayed or broken and sticking out by using a pair of scissors to cut them away as cleanly as possible. Avoid pulling at any errant pieces.If damage is more extensive, you may need to take the furniture in to a professional, or replace it completely.
 Avoid direct sunlight, rain, snow, or heavy wind on your outdoor wicker furniture whenever possible.


Cover or place your wicker furniture under a roof, deck, or canopy while not in use. You can also bring wicker furniture inside, if possible, to help preserve its life.
Care for indoor furniture should also be taken by controlling humidity as best as possible. Use a humidifier in dry climates to avoid drying and cracking wicker, and use a dehumidifier or place wicker furniture in a room with good air circulation if in a very humid environment.,

 When you have connected your device, launch the iTunes program on your computer.Make sure you have the most updated version of iTunes on your computer.
This method will work best for a newer device updating to the most recent iOS available.
 Then click Summary > Check for Update or Update. Note that if you are trying to install iOS 6 on an older device, you may not be able to do so via iTunes, as there are more updated iOS versions available.
 If thereâ€™s an update available for your device through iTunes, it will inform you. To download now and install later, click on Download. You will then have to install it on your device at a later time.
 Don't disturb your device and don't disconnect it. Allow your device to reboot when it's finished, or restart it yourself if you're prompted.

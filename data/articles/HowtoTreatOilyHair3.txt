 Cornstarch (or cornmeal) can act like a dry shampoo and help reduce greasiness. Simply put it in something that you can shake (like a salt shaker), and use it to apply a light coating to your hair.Apply about 1 tablespoon at a time.
Make sure to get it on your scalp, too.
Let it sit for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, brush it out.
Another option is a basic powder, such as baby powder., A light, household acid has helped some people with oily hair. Some acids that you can use on your hair include vinegar and lemon juice, both of which are readily available and not so strong they'll damage your skin.In a cup of water, add either 1/4 cup of lemon juice or 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Stir to combine.
Apply it to your hair, massaging it in, and then rinse it off.
Another option is adding a couple of tablespoons of alcohol, such as vodka or even rubbing alcohol, to the cup of water instead.
 Astringents can also help with oily hair. One common astringent is tea. Brew a cup of tea at about half strength. Apply it to your hair, massaging it in, and then rinse it off.Another astringent you can use is witch hazel. You can find this product in the drug store. It comes in a bottle much like rubbing alcohol. Simply apply some to your hair. Rinse it out after you have rubbed it in.
 Another way to help cut down on oil is to mix something hydrating with something acidic. One option is mixing 6 tablespoons of coconut oil with 2 tablespoons of grapefruit juice and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (or just all lemon juice if you prefer).You'll likely need to lightly heat the coconut oil to make it liquid enough to mix in with the acid.
Rub the mixture in to your scalp. Massage it for at least 5 minutes, but 10 is better. Let it sit for another 20 minutes before rinsing it out with your shampoo.

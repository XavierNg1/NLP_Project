Some offers will be of better value to you than others, depending on what youâ€™d like to purchase and what you have to trade in. Read the offers carefully and try to find the best one.
 GS already pays down on trade ins (about 30 percent of used price) and if you choose cash, you get 20 percent less, so only 24 percent if you choose cash, so any bonus definitely helps. Fifty percent extra trade in value is equal to about 45 percent of the used price.

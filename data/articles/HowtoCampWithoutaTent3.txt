 Although not true camping, you're still roughing it to some extent and you get the benefit of a stronger shelter, which can be handy if the weather is bad.
 It really depends on how you define "camping" - some of these buildings are so rudimentary that there is very little difference between these and tent stays. Be sure to take the appropriate supplies, such as sleeping bag, etc.
 This is like a "permanent" tent and many resourceful accommodations companies will provide these for outdoor stays. The yurt will allow you to feel comfortable but still "in the wilds".
 From the back of your car to a recreational vehicle, caravan (travel trailer/mobile home), refitted buses, etc., taking a vehicle into the wilds can serve as both transportation and accommodation.

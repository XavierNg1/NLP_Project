 Make sure you have a way of reaching your entire back. If you're using your hands, you may want to get the help of an assistant., Make sure all of the hair is covered. Have an assistant help you if you're even a little worried about not being able to reach the middle of your back â€” you don't want to miss any spots. You don't need to vigorously rub the cream into your skin. Just apply it gently over all of your hair.


Wash your hands after your have applied the cream. The cream can irritate your skin if it's allowed to dry (not to mention that it will remove any hair on the backs of your hands it is allowed to work on).
 The cream's packaging will tell you how long to let it sit. Usually, this will be somewhere in the neighborhood of about three to six minutes.


After waiting, use a damp cloth or towel to wipe a small area of your back. If the hair does not come off easily, wait another couple of minutes.
 When the hair comes off easily, use the damp cloth to gently wipe it off. Again, if you can't reach the center of your back, get an assistant to help.
 This is a quick, convenient way to rinse all of the cream (and the dissolved hair) off. You can rinse your back with water from a towel, but it's much easier to miss spots and allow the cream to sit for too long this way.

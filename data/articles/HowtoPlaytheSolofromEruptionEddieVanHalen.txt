 It is very challenging to learn this piece without the audio aid.;
, The steps in this article are based on that tab. Understand that the measures are divided by a dotted line, not a solid line. I assume that this is because, for the first half of the piece, Eddie doesn't really follow any definable time signature. There are some parts of this tab which are a bit off, due to the extreme speed of his playing. A friend of mine and I know this to be true, because we used a program named "Sony Acid Pro" to slow it down to half speed, where we could listen to and distinguish every note being played.
 This is the tuning he uses, and it really does help the speed, because the strings are looser.
 This is not optional.



In measure 1, ignore what they say, and start with a slide down from fret 7 on the A string. Measure 2 is authentic, but you can ignore the palm mutes if you want. If you don't want to, palm mute LIGHTLY.
Measure 3 is a bit more challenging. Up to the point where you play fret 5 on both b and high-e strings, it is authentic. After that, the publishers made a mistake. Each sequence of -8-5-0- on the b string followed by -8- on the g string followed by open e string is actually -8-5-0- followed by -8- on the b string the first time through, only you leave the open e string out, and hold the -8- on the g string for emphasis. After that, it is actually -5-8-5-0-, with no g or e string at all. (Note the different sequence on the b string. This is the correct way to play it.) The exact same rule applies to the beginning of measure 4, where the sequence is repeated one more time.
Measure 4 is literally almost half wrong. After the already corrected sequence, he doesn't play -7- on g, -5- on b, and then -5- on e. He actually plays open d, -7- on g, and -5- on b. He doesn't play the following -8-5- pull-off on b, the -7- 1/2 bend on g, or the -5- on b, so skip 'em. From then until the end of measure 4 is correct.
Measure 5 is correct up until the slide from -3- to -15- on the (a) string. But this is easy to correct...simply play the -3- and leave out the slide. Note the dive-bomb with the whammy bar on open e. Do not play the little -15- (on a) to open-a pull-off. It is incorrect.
When you play the chord progression in measures 6 and 7, have fun with it. This is usually where he does the scissors 4 feet (1.2Â m) in the air, so play it nice and slowly with a lot of emphasis.
At the end of measure 7, the slide is not from -3- to natural harmonic at -19- on the b string. It is actually from -2- to natural harmonic at -19- on the g string.
In measure 8, do not bend the last -20- (on b) of the -20- (on b) to -17- (on e) sequence. Leave out the -20- that comes right after you play the open g.
In measure 9, do not bend the second -19- (on b) 1 1/2. Instead, bend the -20- (on b) one full bend. Also, when you have just finished the full -20- (on e) bend, and you have pulled off to -17- (on e) do not play the -17- (on e) after you have played the -20- (on b). Just go into the next sequence.
In measure 10, do not play the whammy bar from -20- on b. Move on to the slide.
Until measure 18, the tabs are correct. Polish your picking skills. You will be picking very, very quickly from measure 12 to measure 17.
Measures 18 and 19 have some faults. Ignore the -7- to -8- slide on the d string, and, right after that, instead of what they say, play -5-0-4- (on g) followed by -6-0-5- (on b) followed by -7-0-5- (on g) followed by -8-0-7-5- on (on b) first bending and then trilling the last -5-. At the end of measure 19, leave out the open d string, and slide from open e to -7- on e instead of -5- to -7-.
Measures 20 and 21 make up the exact same tune of measures 18 and 19, only transposed. Instead of playing the -7- (on a) after you do the second -5-0- pull-off (on d) hammer on a -4- (on d) and then play -5-0-4- (on g) followed by -7-0-5- (on d) followed by -7-0-6-4- (on g) and trill the last -4- half a step.
At the end of measure 21, through measure 22, repeat the same sequence that you played in measures 18 and 19, and it's easier to transpose the -11-9-11-9-and so on (on g) in measures 22 and 23 up to the b string, where you would start with -7-5-7-5-.
Measure 24 through measure 39 is totally two hand tapping. Eddie actually plays it on the b string, not the g string, so if you transpose (which is advisable since it's actually easier the way he does it) then you would start with -14-2-5- (b string) and then go into -9-2-5- (also b string).
In measures 31, 32, and 33 where he starts his decent, the (transposed to b string) the notes are actually -17-12-15--17-11-14--17-11-14--17-10-13--17-9-12--17-9-12--17-12-15- -12-15--17-11-14--17-11-14--17-10-13--17-10-13--17-9-12--17-9-12- and so on.

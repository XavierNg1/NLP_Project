For a round lamp, leave the shape as it is but raise the rim edge with more clay in a circle around the top.
For a star shaped lamp, pinch the sides of the top of the bowl with your forefinger and thumb. This will indent the top, creating a star shape. Six indents will create a six-sided star, five indents will create a five-sided star.
 Try to keep this as even as possible.
 These allow the light to shine through. Decide where you will place the holes evenly around the bowl, marking each spot with a small nick in the clay to check for evenness all the way around the bowl. Then press the holes out with the end of a paintbrush or pencil. Use the tool to make each circle evenly rounded.

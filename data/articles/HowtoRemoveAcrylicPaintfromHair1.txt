, No special shampoo is required – you can just use your normal product. Let the shampoo sit for about 10-20 minutes before washing off., Try to comb out the sections of paint that have now softened. You may want to clean the comb periodically with your fingers and set aside the bits of paint so that they don’t clog the drain.

 Lie down on a carpet or an exercise mat. Put your arms on either side of your torso. Tense your toes for ten seconds, and then relax them completely. Gradually, work your way from your toes to your head, tensing and relaxing each muscle group in your body.By learning to relax, you can improve communication with your horse.
Progressive relaxation can help reduce anxiety after a fall.
 Although you may not be ready to get back on your horse yet, you can prepare by doing some strength training. Work on strengthening your core muscles and legs, so that you feel strong and confident when you get back on your steed!, Ask your trainer for advice on how you could have avoided falling off the horse. If your fall was partly due to a technical mistake, you may benefit from visualizing yourself performing the riding skill correctly. However, you should only use visualization if you know specifically what you could have done to ride better and avoid the fall.If you know what went wrong but not how to fix it, you should skip visualization.
Don’t try to visualize yourself “not” doing whatever went wrong, since it is very hard for your brain to process a negative visualization.
 One way to get over a fear of riding again is to practice falling. Once you are completely recovered from the fall, you might want to sign up for a class on how to properly fall off a horse. You’ll learn how to bend properly, keep your head tucked in, properly absorb the impact, and avoid injury to the head and neck.See if your local equestrian center has an upcoming workshop on how to fall off a horse.

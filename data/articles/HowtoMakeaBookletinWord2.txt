 At the bottom of the Word 2007 window are a few options for viewing your document. Click the “Print Layout” option so you can see your margins and page breaks.
 On the Ribbon, click Page Layout -> Margins -> Narrow. You can set your margins to whatever size you need, but Narrow is a good place to start.
 Rags are extra white space that can be cleaned up by hyphenating a word or by justifying the text. Scan through the document to be sure your text looks the way you would like and fix any rags you might find.
 Booklet pages are not always printed in the same order that the pages are viewed. For example, you may print your booklet on 11x17 paper so you can put four pages on one sheet (two pages on the front of the paper and two pages on the back). Go to the Office Button -> Print -> Print Preview.
 In the Page Setup on the Ribbon, click Size and select Tabloid. You can use other paper sizes, but for this example we want to print two pages on one sheet of paper.
 On the Page Setup button, select Landscape as the orientation and “2 pages per sheet” in the Pages -> Multiple Pages option.
 In our example, we are going to print to a PDF file so we can double check our work or upload it to a brochure printing company. Depending on the software you have installed on your computer, you can either print as a PDF or Save As a PDF. We will save as. Just go to the Office Button -> Save As -> PDF or XPS.
 Make sure the PDF is optimized for “Standard” so your images do not get compressed. Give the booklet a name and then click Publish.

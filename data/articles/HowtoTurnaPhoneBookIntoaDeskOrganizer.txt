 You may even want to glue the pencil to the spine to hold it in place as you roll. When you have finished rolling you should have the spine surrounding the pencil with 5 distinct page sections pin wheeling outward, each one held by a binder clip.
 To make this process easier you can use an empty toilet paper roll to guide your pages. Make sure that the pages are all flat against each other and put back the binder clip on that section. Because the ends of the pages don't line up now, use scissors to cut off any excess paper making them line up again. Do this step to all 5 sections.
 Hold it in place for several minutes until the glue dries. Repeat this step to the other 4 sections.

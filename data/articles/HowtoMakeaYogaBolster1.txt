 To make a bolster, you will need some old blankets (to use as stuffing) and a sheath for the stuffing.If you want to make a temporary bolster that can be taken apart at will, use a pillow case and string or safety pins. If you want a permanent bolster, you can use 3/4 yard of the fabric of your choosing and sew it shut.You can also use old towels instead of blankets, if you prefer.No matter which materials you choose to use, make sure that the final product will give you sufficient lift and support as you practice your yoga positions. Blankets may be bulkier than towels, but ultimately either material should work well in a bolster.;
, There are a number of options when it comes to binding the bolster together. One popular option is to use safety pins.However, these may be uncomfortable during certain yoga poses. Another alternative is rubber bands, which can be stretched around the width of the bolster to hold everything in place. Yet another option is to use yarn or string to bind the bolster. Use whichever materials you prefer, or whatever you have on hand.
 If you intend to take your bolster apart and use the blankets or towels inside, you may want to secure the open end of the bolster with string or a rubber band. If you will be using the bolster as a permanent addition to your yoga practice, you may wish to sew the opening shut for greater stability and durability.

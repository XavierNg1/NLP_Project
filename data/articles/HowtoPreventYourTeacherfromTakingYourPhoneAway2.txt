 To avoid getting your cell phone taken away, put it on silent mode. If you are expecting an important text message or call, check your phone at certain intervals during the class. Avoid looking at your phone for more than a few seconds each time, and try to be as discreet as possible; place your phone out of sight, but easy to reach (e.g. in an otherwise empty sweater pocket.)If you are expecting a call, program in an auto-reply message beforehand to send to the caller – for example, write, “I am in class and can’t take your all. I will call you back when class is dismissed.”

, Let friends and family know when you will be in class. Offer an alternate time for them to contact you (e.g. “I will be in class from 8:30am until 2:30pm, but you can reach me during my lunch hour from 11:30am - 12:30pm.”) Try to avoid texting people right before class begins, as they will likely text back you during the first few minutes of class.


To be safe, let friends and family know that it is better to avoid texting you during the daytime altogether.
 If you don't mind getting texts a bit late, turn your phone off entirely while you are in class. This guarantees that you will not receive any disruptive calls or texts, and it removes the temptation to use your phone for texts, email, or social media during dull moments. If for some reason your teacher sees the phone and tries to confiscate it, show them that it is in fact turned off to prove that you were not using it during class.You can also opt to put your cell phone on airplane mode so you will not receive any calls or texts, or have access to the internet.
 Keeping your phone in your locker during the school day will ensure that you don’t have it taken away in class. If you opt to keep you phone locked away, advise your family beforehand to prevent worry if they try to contact you. Be sure that you have a strong lock on your locker, and that no one else knows the combination to it.

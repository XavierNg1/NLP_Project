 Look for the Google Earth app on your mobile device and tap on it. The app icon has a blue sphere with white lines on it.


Once the app is open, you will see a beautiful 3D rendition of the world.
 Tap the menu button on the upper left corner to display the app’s menu. Under the Layers panel, tap the 3D Buildings option to enable 3D rendering for your results.
 Use the search field on the upper right corner and enter the address of the building you want to view. Tap the “Search” button on your keypad to proceed.


Just like in Google Maps, Google Earth will bring you to the location you’ve entered. At first, the area view may be too far up to be able to focus on the building.
 Before you can view the building, you have to focus to it first. Your fingers act as your navigation tools.


To move around, use a finger and touch any point on the map, then drag it until you’ve reached the view that you want.
To rotate, use two fingers and touch two points on the map, then rotate your fingers until you’ve reached the perspective that you want.
To zoom, use two fingers and touch two points on the map. Move them away from each other to zoom out and move them away towards each other to zoom in.
 Wait a few moments for the screen to focus. Once it’s done, you can see the building very clearly, as if you’re hovering over and around it.


The quality of the pictures will depend on the size and capacity of your mobile device though, so results will vary.

 It is the most commonly used tool for Google Earth Modeling. SketchUp 2016 Make is recommended (It is completely free, unless you upgrade to Sketchup Pro);
, A window will appear with satellite imagery.
 Then adjust your view until you get a full view of the building you want to model.
 This will take a "screenshot" of the imagery.
 To make it easier to model, outline your building with the "Line" tool. If any, move the preloaded person out of your way.
 Google Earth does not view the inside of buildings, making it easier on your part. You won't be adding textures yet.
 Click on the "Materials" tool (signified by a paint bucket), then click on the "Dropper" tool on the right of the new window that appeared. With that tool selected, click on the satellite imagery. Finally, click on the roof of your model. The roof will look like the top of the real building.
 Go to "Window", then select Photo Textures. Click a face on your building, then click, "Select Region". When you match the photo with the face, click "Grab"; that side will be photo textured. Do the same to the rest of your model.
 Make sure it is accurately and entirely photo textured.
 While entering in your model information, make sure "Google Earth Ready" is checked.
 Reviewers will look at your model and see if it meets the criteria for entering the Google Earth 3D Buildings layer.
 If it was accepted, you should see a ribbon next to its name, signifying it was added. If not, you should see a ribbon with a red symbol across it.

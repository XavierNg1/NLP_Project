 Combine the ingredients in a bowl and rapidly whisk them together until evenly combined.


Since this is such a simple salad dressing, you do not need to use a blender or food processor. In fact, the heat from the machine could melt the sour cream as you blend it, causing the dressing to turn soupy and gloppy.
 Stir the sour cream into the existing ingredients until it is thoroughly blended.


You will know the sour cream has been blended in based on the color of the dressing. Once there are no longer any red or white streaks, the color is even, and solid, the ingredients have been blended sufficiently.
 You can use the dressing immediately, but if you made it ahead of time, place the poppy seed salad dressing in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator until ready to serve.


Store the dressing inside the refrigerator when not in use. It should stay fresh for a few days to a week.

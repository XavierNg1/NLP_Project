 Look for Google Chrome on your computer and open it. The web browser will load.
 Type in “chrome://history” on the address bar and press Enter on your keyboard. The History page will load.


On this page, you will see all the sites or URLs you’ve visited, together with the dates and timestamps. Scroll through the list to see the earlier entries, from earlier today and from the previous days.
 At the top of the History page is a “Clear browsing data” button. Click it, and a small window will appear with the list of browsing data, namely browsing history, download history, cookies, cached images and files, passwords, form data, app data, and content licenses. Tick on the checkboxes for the items you’d like to remove.


You can tick all of them to really clear out your browsing data on Chrome.
 You can set how far back in time the browsing data will be removed. A drop-down list is located at the top of the small window. Click it to see the options. You can choose among the past hour, the past day, the past week, the last 4 weeks, and the beginning of time. Select one from these.


If you want to remove all your browsing data since the time you started using Chrome, select “The beginning of time.” Your browsing or search history will be reset to a clean state.
 Click the “Clear browsing data” button on the bottom of the small window, and all the selected data will be removed. It may take a few seconds to clear up everything.

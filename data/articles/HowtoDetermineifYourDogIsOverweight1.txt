 By doing a simple rib check, you can determine if your dog is at a healthy weight. Place both of your thumbs on your dog’s backbone. Then, spread your hands across its ribcage as if you are holding it. You should be able to feel your dog’s ribs easily, without applying too much pressure. Your dog’s ribs should also be slightly visible.If your dog’s ribs are not visible and/or if you have to apply pressure to feel its ribs, then your dog might be overweight.;
, You also need to assess your dog’s profile. Have your dog stand up, and get on the same level as your dog. Look at your dog’s underside, particularly the abdomen, i.e., the section just above the hind legs. A healthy dog will have an abdomen that is tucked up behind its ribcage.An abdomen that sags is a common sign that your dog is overweight.
 The final test to visually determine if your dog is overweight is to look at your dog from above. From above, dogs at a healthy weight will have an hourglass figure where the dog’s abdomen is slimmer than the chest and the hips.When viewing from above, you should see a noticeable reduction in circumference from your dog’s chest to its hips.

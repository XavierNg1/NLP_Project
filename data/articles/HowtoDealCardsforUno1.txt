 Before you play, make sure that you have a full deck of Uno cards. Count 108 cards. There should be 25 of each color: blue, yellow, red, and green. In addition, there are four Wild cards and four Wild Draw Four cards.Each color "suit" contains:


One 0 card
Two 1 cards, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s and 9s
Two "Draw Two" cards; two "Skip" cards; and two "Reverse" cards.
Four blank cards of each color, if you're using a new deck. Do not use these cards except to replace cards that you lose.;
, If you have fewer players, you'll deal more cards apiece; if you have more players, you'll deal fewer cards apiece. For 2-4 players, deal seven or eight cards per person. If you have 5-8 players, deal six or seven cards apiece. No matter how many players you have, make sure everyone has the same number of cards.If you have more than eight players, you may want to split into two games, or play with teams. The game does not work as well when each player only starts with four or five cards.
 Place the shuffled deck face-down on the table. Have each player pull one card from the top of the deck. Whoever pulls the card with the highest number gets to go first. Power-up cards (e.g. Draw Two, Draw For, and Wild) are worth zero at this stage.Once you decide who goes first, put the drawn cards back into the deck. Reshuffle once more before you deal the cards.
You can also roll a die, if you have one handy, or use any other method to do decide who goes first. Try letting the person with the next birthday go first, or the youngest person at the table. The method doesn't terribly matter as long as you all agree.

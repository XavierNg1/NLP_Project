 When you notice the first signs of fatigue react promptly. Try to reduce the intensity of the events and games they are participating in as soon as possible. This will allow the child to be quiet and prompt them to go to bed.
 Schedule your obligations and make a routine to get the child accustomed to sleeping at a certain time. Creating a regular sleep schedule will ensure that they are ready to go to bed on time and get enough rest. This routine should include a meal, calming activities before bed, such as a bath and perhaps reading a picture book or storytelling.


If the overtired scene repeats itself every day, you probably need to change the childâ€™s schedule, and give him dinner earlier and put him to bed earlier.
 Toddlers can seem tireless, and when they are overtired they can be very demanding regarding their bedtime routine. Perhaps they need water, they need to go to the toilet, they want one more story, one more kiss. Set limits on these demands to avoid the infinite prolonging of nighttime rituals.
 If your child is too tired, he or she will probably refuse to sleep. Calm him or her down before bed by reducing the intensity of what is happening around him or her.


Reduce the light by hanging window shades and turn on the lamp instead, because it emits less light. Lack of light increases the levels of melatonin and sends the child a signal that it is time to sleep.
Remove toys and replace them with other games like puzzles, which do not require a lot of physical involvement. Toys can frustrate tired kids, so it's best to not play with them directly prior to sleep.
Talk quietly to calm your child. He or she will probably begin to imitate you and will calm down.
Play slow and soothing music that has a calming effect.
 Toddlers need 12-14 hours of sleep at night and 1-2 hours sleep during the day. Be sure to put your child to sleep during the day even when he or she refuses, to avoid tiredness.

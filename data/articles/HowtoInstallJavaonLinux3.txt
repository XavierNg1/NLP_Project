 You can use Synaptic or Adept Manager.
 Java JDK and JRE are not available for installation through GUI Package Manager. You'll need to install Open JDK instead.


Perform a search for openjdk-7-jdk.
Select openjdk-7-jdk for installation. Depending on the package manager, you may be asked if you wish to install the required dependencies or it will automatically select them without confirmation. For example, the "openjdk-7-jre" was already selected by Synaptic Package Manager. If you want to use Java as a plug-in in your browser, then also select to install "icedtea-7-plugin".
 Click the button to apply the changes. Depending on the package manager, a pop-up window may appear asking for you to confirm the changes.

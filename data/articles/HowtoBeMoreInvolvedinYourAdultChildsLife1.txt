 Your adult child has less available time than they had as kids. This may lead them to cut back on visits and get togethers. One way to include more family time is to do things that you always enjoyed doing together. This will incentivize their visits with you.For example, if you and your child always went on scenic hikes, offer to go out on a hiking adventure.;
, Most adult children are more likely to make time to visit if you create a family event, as opposed to just inviting them over. Invite all of your children (if you have more than one) to come over for a dinner or family gathering. If there are other relatives (e.g. grandparent, aunts, uncles, cousins) that your child is close to, invite them as well.For example, you could plan a family dinner once a week. If thatâ€™s too much, aim for once a month.
 Your grown child may have different preferences than they did as a teen. If they have taken on new hobbies or activities, show interest in them and be supportive. If you can, try to do these activities with them sometimes.For example, if your adult child has started learning to play a musical instrument, ask them to show you how it works.

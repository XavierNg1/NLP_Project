 Forcing a Blue Screen on your computer will cause you to lose any unsaved changes, therefore it is very important for you to save anything you were working on before continuing.
 This method will only work for Windows 8 and lower. You can open Task Manager by right-clicking on the taskbar at the bottom of your screen and finding "Start Task Manager" in the drop down menu that appears.
 If you are prompted for an administrator password, enter the password and click OK.
 Once you have done so, select "End Task." (be sure you press processes from all users)

, In this dialog box, tick the box next to "Abandon unsaved data and shut down" and click "Shut Down."

, You can get rid of the blue screen by restarting your computer.

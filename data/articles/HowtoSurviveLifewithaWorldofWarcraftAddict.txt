 This will be better achieved not by trying to seek his attention while he is playing, but by being straightforward about the problem at a time when he is not distracted. So, instead of interrupting his game, talk to him when he is ready to pay attention to you.;
, Don't let your resentments build up inside without addressing them out loud. Give him specific details about how his playing has impacted your time together.
 It can take some time to change hobby habits. Not being patient will drive you and of course him crazy, leading to pointless arguments.
 Read a book, draw something, try a new video game out, or go out with your friends. Do whatever pleases you so that you're not waiting around for him and so that you don't resent his playing as much.
 Watch your partner play, and ask him to teach you how to play, too. Who knows, maybe you'll like it. You may able to develop a shared hobby through World of Warcraft, but even if not, being willing to try it shows him you care.
 For example, he may agree to setting a limit on his playing hours each day, or he may be willing to set aside a certain amount of time with you each day before he goes back to the game. Find a plan you can both agree on.
 Have some fun, go out, and remind him that the real world can be just as engaging as a video game.

 Finding out the time is crucial. You cannot prepare to stay warm if you don't know when the drill will take place. Listen to morning announcements, look on bulletin boards or wherever you school announces important events. It also helps to know what subject you'll be in. Bear in mind you may not be able to find out the exact time (e.g., 9:00 AM) but only the date (e.g., October 5th).;
, Even a tank-top under a shirt can help you stay much warmer. Wear several layers of clothing, and bring a hoodie/sweatshirt to put on the back of your chair. It could be slightly large to use the "Staying warm with a sweatshirt" technique below.
 As you evacuate, you can grab the gloves without having to go to your locker (good if you're not allowed to go as you evacuate.)

, Conserving body heat is a good way to stay warm. It is also a good source of entertainment. You can talk in whispers.

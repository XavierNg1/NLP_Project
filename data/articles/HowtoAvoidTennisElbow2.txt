 To avoid stress on your elbow and tendons, you should invest in a lightweight racket that is comfortable and has a flexible shaft. Look for a mid-size or oversize racket with flexibility, as the flexion will help to absorb some of the shock of the ball as you hit it and put less stress on your elbow., Your strings should be strung at a tension of less than 55 lbs. Tight strings can increase the stress on your arm as you hit the ball.If possible, you should also opt for thinner strings, rather than thicker strings, on your racket. Thinner strings are more elastic and will absorb more shock caused by hitting the ball.
 Avoid playing with old, wet balls as they can require more force and effort to hit, leading to higher stress placed on your arm. Go for new, pressurized tennis balls whenever possible.

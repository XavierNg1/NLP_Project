 After a hard day of basketball, be sure you give your ball a proper wipe down. Cleaning it periodically will prevent grime and dirt from settling into the ball. Use a damp cloth and allow it to dry., This depends on how often you like to play basketball. If you play often, keep your ball well inflated and store indoors at room temperature. If you donâ€™t play too often, keep your ball slightly deflated. This will increase the longevity of the ball.


Never leave a ball outside and avoid direct sunlight for too long of a period.
 A good way to ruin your basketball is by kicking it around like a soccer ball. It is a common misconception that any inflatable ball will work for anything. The construction and design of a basketball is very different from other balls. It was designed for the court, so bring it to the court not to the field.

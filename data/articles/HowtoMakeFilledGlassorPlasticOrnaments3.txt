 Place tiny pine cones, sprigs of spruce trees or rosemary, faux snow and holly sprigs into the ornament. Give it even more of a terrarium feel by adding craft moss at the bottom of the ornament, then nestling the other items on top., You could do something simple, like filling each ornament halfway up with faux pearls, which looks quite elegant. For a little more color, use the beads from cheap costume necklaces. Just take the necklaces apart and fill the glass ornaments with the baubles of your choice.Mix it up by varying the color, size and shape of the beads.
 Continue a holiday theme by filling glass ornaments with mini gift wrap bows. Use bows that are all the same color, or mix it up by using red, green, silver and gold. You should be able to fit several into the ornament and the result is very festive.

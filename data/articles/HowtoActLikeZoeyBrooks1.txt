 Zoey has two hairstyles and either one will do. One is from the earlier seasons of Zoey 101, and it is shoulder-length beach blonde. The second style is the most recent, and it is brown with a few blonde streaks, layered. Both styles are rather low maintenance. If your hair isn't naturally one of these colors, dying it is optional. Just don't go too extreme.;
, Zoey wears tank tops, mini-skirts, and sneakers. She has a typical Southern California Girl style and is really cute. Don't show too much skin - Zoey doesn't.


If you live in a cooler climate, make sure you have fall and winter clothes. Try wearing a bright sweater or thermal, dark jeans, black all-purpose boots and a parka.
Whatever the weather, the key is to appear laid back and along the lines between girly and tomboy.
 The necklace is not much more than her dorm key painted with a cute design an on a neck chain. Odds are, you're too young to live in a dorm, so you can use your house key or apartment key instead. Better yet, do something original and get your own trademark accessory like a charm bracelet or special ring.
 Zoey is very tanned. Don't go to a tanning salon, it ruins your skin. Use a good-quality self-tanner.

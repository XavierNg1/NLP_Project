 Many tattoo supply companies have pigment powder available for purchase. You’ll need to decide which color or colors you want to use and purchase those colors.It's best to purchase pigment powder from a tattoo supply company since you can be sure it's safe. You don't want to accidentally use pigment ink used in car paint.
 When using pigment powder, you’ll need to add it to medical grade liquids. Mix together 2 pints (32 ounces) of witch hazel (which you can get from most holistic health stores or online), 2 ¼ teaspoons (0.38 ounces) of medical grade glycerin and 2 ¼ teaspoons propylene glycol to form a liquid base., Once your liquid base is mixed, add your pigment powder. The amount of pigment powder you use will depend on how bright or subdued you want the color to be. Add the pigment powder slowly – again, you can always add more but you can’t take any out., To mix your ink together, put it in a blender at low speed. If you find your ink is too thick, add a bit more liquid. If it’s too thin, add more pigment. Once your ink reaches your desired consistency, turn the speed up to medium and mix your ink for about an hour., Once your ink is finished, store it in a sterile, airtight container. You should place the container in a cool, dark place.

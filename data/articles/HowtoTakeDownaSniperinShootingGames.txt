 Always move behind shelter. This is important since snipers rely on sight to have a good shot.;
, Think of where they could be (Usually in places most people don't look/go to) and try to avoid their line of sight. If two players are in one room screen peek if you are playing local.
 Take a route where the suspected sniper can't see you. If you are behind them shoot them in the head, but if you are not take cover quickly and keep searching.
 In some sniping games like COD the snipers lens will give out a glare which can help pinpoint where the sniper is.

 Purchase 40 large sheets of poster board (one for each year of your honoree's life). Decorate each poster board with copies of photos, schoolwork, news clippings, high school sports letters, or whatever memorabilia you can find or collect from each year of the honoree's life. Alternatively, you could just have 4 sheets of poster board (one for each decade) or 8 sheets (one for each 5 years). If you had 40 guests coming, you could assign each guest a poster board and a year rather than doing all of the boards yourself.;
, Ask each guest (or couple) to bring two 8.5 by 11 inch signs on heavy paper (matte photo paper is recommended). The signs could be hand printed or made on a computer using, for example, PowerPoint. The first sign would be a serious, sincere happy birthday sign signed by the guest. The second sign would be a humorous one.
 If your honoree is adventuresome, make a nice blindfold that is attractively decorated with the honoree's name and happy birthday on the front or get a nice happy birthday bandana.
 Make a sign with all the invitation details (date, place, time, RSVP, etc.) Blindfold your honoree with a plain blindfold. After your honoree is blindfolded securely (so that the honoree will not see the special blindfold, the sign or anything else for that matter), position the special blindfold over the plain one for photos. Have the honoree hold the sign with all the invitation details. Take photos of your honoree with the happy birthday blindfold holding the invitation sign. Hide the sign and special blindfold and photos prior to removing the plain blindfold. The photos can be printed or emailed as your invitation.

 All of us have children that we interact with. If you’re a parent, or a teacher, of course, you do so almost constantly. If you don’t have children of your own, you still might have youngsters in your extended family, or you may have friends who have kids. You may think you know nothing about children. But this is simply not true.;
, If you think you don’t like kids, it's possible you're dealing with pain from your own childhood. Wess Stafford, in his book Just a Minute, writes: "The truth is, you deserve an honorary doctorate in 'childhood.' You have already done a minimum of eighteen years of ‘field research’ in this complex subject. Having been a child yourself, you’ve experienced firsthand all there is to know about childhood.” Use this reassurance to give you the confidence to help children.

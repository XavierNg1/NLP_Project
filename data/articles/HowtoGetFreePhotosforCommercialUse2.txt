 Some free photo websites have specific policies in place regarding the ways in which you can use the photos you obtain. For example, some websites may require you to attribute the image to the photographer, or creator.


Search for links on the photo website that list the website's policies, procedures, terms of use, and copyright restrictions, if applicable. For example, if you use Flickr, click on the link at the bottom of the website that reads "Terms of Service" to access "Community Guidelines" and the "Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy."

, Although you may be able to use certain photos for free, there are often additional restrictions in place, such as whether or not you have the creative freedom to alter or modify a photo.


Click on a particular photo to determine if it has any specific copyright restrictions. In most cases, the landing pages that host certain photos will notify you about the creative rights you have for using, altering, or distributing that particular photo.
 Photos with Creative Commons licenses usually have fewer copyright restrictions than most other free photos, and are labeled with Creative Commons acronyms accordingly. For example, you may be allowed to modify any image or photo that has a Creative Commons license.


Go to the "Daily Blog Tips" website provided to you in the Sources section of this article to access a link to the Creative Commons website, or to review a list of relevant acronyms. For example, photos on any website marked as "Creative Commons" and "Attribution: CC BY" indicates that you can alter or modify the photo for commercial use, but only if you credit the photographer or creator of the photo.

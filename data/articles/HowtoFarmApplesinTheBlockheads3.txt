 To speed up a season, meditate.
 Your Blockhead character will climb the tree and collect the apple to your inventory.


You don't need a special tool to collect but if you use a machete, your harvest will be bigger.
 If you no longer want the tree where it is, chop it down with an axe. Any apples already on it will drop on the ground. Tap on the dropped apples to add them to your inventory. Also tap on sticks if they haven't already gone into your inventory.

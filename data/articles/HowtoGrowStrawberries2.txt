 This is what looks like the base of the plant before the roots start. This crown cannot be covered when planting the strawberry plant, either in garden beds or containers. However, it should not be left too exposed either––always check to ensure that the crown is sitting just above the soil.
 This is a fairly unusual placement for seeds in fruit but it is part of what makes the strawberry such an interesting fruit. If you do intend to grow from seed, a section has been provided below to help you do this.


Be aware that growing from seed can be tricky and it'll be a year before the plant bears fruit.

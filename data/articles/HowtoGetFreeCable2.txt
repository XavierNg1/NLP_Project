Call your cable company and tell them you are canceling your service and switching to a competitor. They will likely offer you incentives to stay.
Ask for free cable. While you might not get ongoing cable for free, you may be able to talk them into a few months of free cable in exchange for keeping your business.



Call competing companies to explain that you are thinking about switching. Ask if they are offering new customer specials.
Ask for free cable even if it is not offered. A company might be willing to give you the first month free if you agree to join.
 People who are happy with their cable service are often willing to talk about it. Find out if anyone gets free cable when they also use a companyâ€™s Internet or home phone services, for example.
 For example, if you agree to a 12-month contract in exchange for three months of free cable, you might get a shock when your first bill shows up after you have enjoyed not paying for it.

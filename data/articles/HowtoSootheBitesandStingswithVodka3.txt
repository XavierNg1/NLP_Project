 Also, try to determine that it is a jellyfish that has stung you, before acting. For some types of marine bites and stings, vodka may not work as well (or at all).
 Remove any debris or sand from the affected area and examine the area for any stingers. If you see a stinger embedded in your skin, take care removing it, so that you donâ€™t break off the stinger and leave a portion lodged in your skin.


Shaving cream or sand can be used to remove stingers., Allow it to sit on top of the skin. The vodka will not only relieve the burning sensation, it will also clean the area.

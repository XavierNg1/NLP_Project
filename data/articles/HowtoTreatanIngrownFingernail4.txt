 An ingrown fingernail is a fingernail where one edge of the nail grows and curves into the soft skin around the sides of the finger. The resulting pressure causes redness, pain, swelling, and sometimes an infection.


If ingrown fingernails get infected, there may be pus and the swelling may extend along the finger.
The ingrown nail can grow into the soft skin on either the inner or outer corner of the nail., Ingrown fingernails are rarer than ingrown toenails; however, there are a few things that lead to them. Causes of ingrown fingernails include:Injury
Nail biting
Cutting the fingernails too short or unevenly
Fungal infections
Having curved or thickened fingernails, which may be due to genetics, but can be a problem in older people

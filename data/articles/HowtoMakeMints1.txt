 You can grease the baking sheet using cooking spray or some cooking oil (such as canola or vegetable).
 You can get one at any cooking supply store or online. Some arts and crafts stores may also sell them in their baking department. If you absolutely cannot get one, don't worry; you will still be able to make hard mint candies., Add the sugar, light corn syrup, and water to the saucepan and turn the heat to low. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves.Make sure that you are using light corn syrup and not dark. It will show up nice and clear, which is important if you wish to color your candy.
 The temperature will rise slowly at first, but then it will jump very quickly to the necessary temperature.If you do not have a candy thermometer: Wait until the mixture has been boiling for a few minutes, then place a small drop of it into cold water.If it has reached the hard crack stage, it will form hard, brittle strands that snap when bent. Let the candy cool before trying to snap it., At this point, you can also stir in the food coloring. Blue or green make great colors for mint candy!, If you need to, use a rubber or silicone spatula to help spread the mixture across the baking sheet. You don't have to spread it from edge to edge or be perfectly neat, but you want the sheet to be somewhat thin., Aim to make the squares about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) big. You might also find it easier to lightly score the lines first, then cut them using a pizza cutter., If you need to, separate the squares or rectangles using a knife or your fingers., This is very important. If the container is not airtight, moisture will get into the candy and make it sticky.

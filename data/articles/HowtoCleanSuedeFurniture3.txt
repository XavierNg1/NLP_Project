 Dust your suede furniture every few days or every week. Use a duster or cloth. Go over the entirety of the suede portion of the furniture., To remove stains and keep the furniture smelling good, sprinkle some baking soda over the suede. Allow the baking soda to sit overnight. Vacuum it up in the morning., Look for a water and stain repellent made especially for suede, which should be available at most supermarkets. Spray it over all of the suede. The repellent will keep the suede from staining when food and liquid is dropped and keep the suede in good condition for longer.

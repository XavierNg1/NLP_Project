 You may be able to somewhat speed your nail growth with soaks and vitamins, but you'll still need to wait for the nail to restore itself. If you stub your toe and the toenail looks funky, don't worry: it will grow back. It just takes time! Don't disturb the nail, and don't chip at it. It may be tempting to pull off unneeded bits of nail – but you shouldn't mess with it unless it's a hangnail or an ingrown toenail.;
, If the skin underneath your nail is exposed, it's a good idea to put on a band-aid during the day and let it breath during nighttime. The band-aid can help prevent infection, and it may keep the sensitive skin from rubbing painfully against socks and shoes.
 If you try to wear shoes that are too small (especially high heels), you can easily bruise your toenails. Your toes will only have a small space to move during a long period of time, which can slow the process of regrowing the nail.


Also refrain from making sudden stops. When you're done running, for instance, steadily slow to a walk so that you don't pitch forward, and your toes don't hit the tips of your shoes.
 If you can't wait, visit a nail tech and have them do an acrylic overlay on your broken toenail (which usually costs no more than $3-$5). This is similar to an acrylic fingernail – there must be at least a small amount of toenail for the acrylic to adhere to. While this won't make your real nail grow any faster, it will camouflage the broken toenail while it grows back. You can polish and pedicure this acrylic overlay just like a normal toenail, and nobody will know the difference. If you do decide to go with an acrylic overlay, make sure to remind your nail technician that it's there before they perform any services on you!

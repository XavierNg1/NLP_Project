 You can find this in the Start menu or by pressing âŠž Win+R.
 This will open the History folder for the current user.


It is not possible to view the contents of another user's History folder, even if you are logged in as an administrator.
 The History folder contains four folders: 3 Weeks Ago, 2 Weeks Ago, Last Week, and Today. Everything older than three weeks will be found in the 3 Weeks Ago folder.
 All of your history entries are sorted into website folders. Each folder will contain the links to the specific pages you visited.
 It will load in your default browser, which may not be Internet Explorer.
 Right-click a link in one of the folders and select "Add To favorites" to add it to your bookmarks. You'll be prompted to select a location and give it a title.
 You can delete entries like you would any file in Windows. You can right-click one and select "Delete," or select multiple entries first. You can also drag entries to other locations or the Recycle Bin.

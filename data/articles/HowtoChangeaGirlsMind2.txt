 Being friends with her will give you access to what she's looking for in a guy. You could even casually ask her if she thinks Jim Smith is attractive, and then find out why. Talking about her attraction to other boys may remind her of your feelings.
 If she has put you in the friend zone, you have one thing going for you: she doesn't mind being around you. Don't mess this up by annoying her and pestering her for a romantic date. This will take time if it's even possible.
 Sometimes a girl will act like she put you in the friend zone, but sometimes she's interested in you. Friends can become big influences on how she acts towards you. Notice her actions, gestures, and hints such as smiling and laughing when things aren't that funny. Pay attention if she is noticeably worried about her appearance around you., This can be tricky because you don't want to appear too attached or engrossed by her. Acting somewhat disinterested will make her more interested. Create a strange balance of cute gestures and slight bullying in a playful way.Do not go overboard with bullying her or else she won't want to be friends at all.
Being sarcastic can go a long way.
 Open yourself up to her. Sometimes you really need to put yourself in the spotlight. Try to say it casually and to her face.Try something like:


"I know we've been friends for a while, but I've started to develop feelings for you."
"her name, I like you"

, She probably won't tell you she likes you back. Once the seed of your feelings has been planted in her mind, invite her out. See if she wants to go to the movies, play laser tag, or bowl with you over the weekend. This will make her think of how she sees you. She'll decide if it is a date or not. The decision is always hers.


You should know what she likes to do. Pick something to do where you can both let loose and have fun.

 You can use henna powder to bring out your hair's natural brunette shades. However, how you prepare a henna mixture depends on the specific shade of brown you're trying to achieve.


When used alone, henna can produce an orange-red shade. Unless you're looking for a particularly bold color, it's a good idea to mix henna with other herbs or roots. However, if your hair white, gray, or another very light shade you may be better off using henna solo.If you have dark hair already, mix henna with some chamomile to lighten its effects. Use one part powdered chamomile and two parts powdered henna., Once you've decided how dark you want to go, prepare your paste. Take the henna powder, with whatever additives you're using, and throw in enough boiling water to produce a paste. Then, add a tablespoon of vinegar. Blend well and allow the mixture to sit until lukewarm to the touch., First, run your hair under clean running water to get it damp. Then, slip on a pair of rubber gloves. Massage the paste into your scalp and hair. Brush your hair using a fine-toothed comb to make sure the mixture is evenly distributed throughout your hair. Then, place all your hair under a shower cap or swim cap. Leave the paste in for 30 minutes to 2 hours. If your hair is darker, wait longer., Remove the shower cap and rinse your hair under clean running water. Rinse for as long as it takes for all the paste to come out. The water should run clean when leaving your hair. Allow your hair to air dry. Dry your hair in the sun, if possible, to increase the dye's effects.

 This is a must have. As well as upgrade your TMP so it holds about 150. Hit all the barrels you can find after you go up the ladder.;
, get all the stuff there as fast as you can and go up the ladder. He will be right behind you. Go for shooting his legs, but don't overdo it. You need to knife him as much as possible till he flash bangs you and leaves.
 Run down, but he will shoot at you so run fast and dodge. In a room there is some goodies. Take it and keep going.
 Do so, but the gate will close behind you. When at the top he will talk some more and there is another fight. Do the same as b4. He will flash bang and leave. 1st key is here. There is a puzzle you have to do to get out.
 Best bet is to just shoot them and keep going. He will stop to talk and then more robots. Kill and keep it moving.
 He will not come at you yet so go to the goodies first. Reload and then go to the next key.
 His arm will change and this will make you say what the ****. Dodge him and run to get more room. When he is ready to come at you shoot his legs and get the rocket launcher. If you time it right then you will hit him in the chest and he falls to the ground. Get the last key and jump down to the door with the pictures. If this is all done right then you have more than enough time to get out b4 the blast.

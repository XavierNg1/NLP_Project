 Mix 1 cup (236.6 ml) warm water, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) borax, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) oxygen bleach and 3 drops lavender essential oil (optional, or use any other scent) in a bowl. Soak a washcloth in the mixture. Put the comforter and the wet washcloth into your dryer and dry for about 30 minutes.This method does not “clean” a comforter, but gives a freshening effect similar to home dry cleaning kits.
 If your comforter is starting to get musty, treat it with a steam cleaner. Steam cleaners for clothes are filled with distilled water, which heats to steam. Run the steaming wand over the surface of the comforter to release bad odors and refresh the fabric., If your dry clean only comforter is heavily soiled, a professional dry cleaner is your best option. Your other option is to wash it in the washing machine as you would any other garment or linen and hope that the comforter holds up to washing. Use cold water and low heat if you wash it at home.

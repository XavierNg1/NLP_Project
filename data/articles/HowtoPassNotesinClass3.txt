 Just in case your teacher sees you and asks to bring the note up, have an extra note handy that is about something relating to class but not cheating. For example: "Is the project due on Thursday or Friday?" or "Did you understand the last chapter?"

,, Obviously, if you've already been called up you should have both notes handy and the hiding would be obvious.

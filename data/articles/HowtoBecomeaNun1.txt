 We're already assuming you know you have to be Catholic and a woman, but you also have to be single. If you are married, an annulment recognized by the Catholic church must be obtained. Widows are viewed as single in the eyes of the church.When you become a nun, you will receive a ring to denote you as God's bride. Because of this, you may not have another relationship distracting you from God's call.;
, Back in the good ol' days, most nuns were straight out of high school or college. Now just about anything goes -- from 18 to your 40s. In certain circumstances, older women will be accepted -- it depends on the community you choose to enter.


In general, most religious communities encourage their members to have some type of college education. Having at least a BA is preferable, but not necessary. Life experience, including professional experience, is also a plus., If you do have children, that is. You must not have any dependents upon entering. Many nuns have children -- they're just fully grown., That is to say, be debt-free and healthy. Most institutions prefer candidates that aren't overwhelmed by other issues and can fully devote themselves to God.


If you have debt, don't let it stop you. If you find a community you'd like to join, address the issue with your director. They may be able to help.

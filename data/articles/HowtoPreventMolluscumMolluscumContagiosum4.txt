 Research has not indicated that treatments for molluscum are any more effective than just letting the lesions go away on their own. However, you should discuss your personal situation with your doctor to find out what they recommend., The Molluscum contagiosum bumps or lesions can be removed using cryotherapy, where the lesion is frozen with liquid nitrogen, and laser therapy. Your doctor may also recommend piercing the core of the lesion and scraping out the pus like material inside, a process known as curettage. These treatments may be done under local anesthesia and may result in some skin irritation or scarring.You should never try and remove the lesions or the fluid inside the lesions on your own. Doing this can lead to spreading the disease to other parts of your body and to others. It also puts you at a higher risk of a bacterial infection.
 Your doctor may also recommend oral therapy for the lesions to avoid scarring and pain. Children are often prescribed oral therapy as it is safe, painless, and easy to administer. Your doctor may prescribe oral cimetidine for your lesions, to be taken at home according to your doctorâ€™s dosage recommendations.Keep in mind oral cimetidine may not work as well on facial lesions as it will on lesions elsewhere on your body.
 Your doctor may prescribe podophyllotoxin cream for your lesions, which must be applied on each lesion on your body. This is a good home therapy for men but it is not recommended for pregnant women.Your doctor may also prescribe other medicated creams that contain iodine, salicylic acid, potassium hydroxide, tretinoin, cantharidin, and imiquimod.

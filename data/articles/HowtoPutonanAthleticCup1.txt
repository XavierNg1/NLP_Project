 The style of cup protector a man prefers to wear - the banana curved cup or the traditional triangular and flatter shaped cup - is a matter of personal preference. With both styles the testicles fit into the lower part of the cup. With the banana shaped cup, the penis hangs down. With the traditional triangular shaped cup, the penis can be lifted up and placed across the inside top of the protector cup. Some men think a curved cup is more anatomically correct and ultimately more comfortable. Make sure your cup doesn't pinch or anything; if so you will have to get a larger cup.

 Jim is liked because he doesn't have to be the center of attention. Everybody loves someone who listens, even if it's to the ramblings of a mad man (Michael Scott).
 Jim's romantic success came for his patience. If you truly love someone, wait for them. Forever if that is what it takes.Â On a different note, Jim's pranks are often effective because of his incredible patience. Don't force your pranks, or they'll be sloppy and ineffective.
 If you drink, make sure you get extra pranky.
 Jim is known for being laid back. Modeling this is wise because getting worked up is rarely a solution. Stay calm, and relax. It's just a job.
 Jim does not like to be frazzled. This only happens several times a season, but when it does, we see just how much Jim cares about certain things (ie Pam giving birth).
 Jim makes lots of pros and cons lists. He is also often the voice of reason. Make wise, informed decisions, and you will limit your regrets.
 Jim can turn a boring moment into something exciting in the blink of an eye. The trait is charisma, and he has it. If you're in a group looking for something to do, don't be afraid to start a topic or group game. Jim also makes spontaneous decisions in romance, too. He kisses Pam on casino night, proposes in the rain, and elopes with her after cutting off his tie before the wedding. Be spontaneous in romance. Like Jim, you won't regret it.
 Jim is not fake. Mean what you say, and people will respect you for it. A corollary to this is: be honest. Honesty is a beautiful thing, and Jim isn't known for being a liar.
 Jim is kind and respectful to everyone, even Ryan and Toby. Everyone deserves respect, so this is a great model to follow.
 Jim refers to himself as a goofball; so should you.

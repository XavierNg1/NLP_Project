 One option is to just back off a bit to let the person figure out his or her feelings. If you back off, the person may realize one of two things. First, the person may miss you, making them decide that they really want to be with you. The second option is the person may not miss you, and they may find it easy to move on. Either way, you've got an answer., If you're getting mixed signals from your boyfriend or girlfriend or even someone you just may like but haven't approached, the best way to deal with it is to bring it up with him or her. The person may not even realize they're giving off mixed signals.Consider how far along you are in the relationship. If you've only been on a couple of dates, having a serious commitment talk is going to scare the other person off. In that case, you can still bring it up, just keep it more lighthearted.
Similarly, if you're just trying to see if someone likes you, you're going to approach the conversation a bit differently, by feeling out whether the person is into you or not.
 Start by bringing up the conversation. Use "I" statements to describe what you've been feeling, rather than "you" statements. "You" statements can come across as accusatory, making the other person feel defensive, while "I" statements focus on the problem and what you're feeling.For instance, you don't want to say, "You are so wishy-washy. You should make up your mind."
Instead, you could say, "I feel like I've been getting mixed signals from you lately. I can't tell if you really want to be with me or not."
If you're still new to a relationship, you could say something like, "I know we've only been on a few dates, but I like you a lot. I'm just curious if we're on the same page."

, Another option is to simply end the relationship. If you feel like the other person is playing with you, it's entirely appropriate to move on. You deserve to have someone who wants to be with you and will tell you that openly and without reservation.

 Take four heads of garlic that have been cut in half horizontally, and place them on a piece of foil. Drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil over the garlic halves, and sprinkle a pinch of a salt over them.You can omit the salt if you’re trying to limit sodium in your diet.
 Once the garlic halves are covered with the oil and salt, put them back together to form a full head. Tuck four sprigs of thyme among them, and fold the foil up around the garlic to create a sealed pouch.If you aren’t a fan of thyme, you can substitute rosemary or omit the herbs entirely.
 Place the foil pouch with the garlic inside your slow cooker. Turn the heat setting to low, and allow the garlic to cook until it is caramelized, which should take approximately six hours.

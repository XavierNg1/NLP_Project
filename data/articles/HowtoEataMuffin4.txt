 You can place it on a plate or leave it on top of its wrapper, to collect crumbs.
 Take note that using utensils works best on muffins that are on the moister end of the spectrum. Drier muffins are more prone to crumbling into pieces, making utensils more work than necessary.


Cutting the muffin directly in half allows a flat surface on each slice that is great for applying butter or other toppings.
Cutting the muffin into smaller, bite-sized sections allows for easier dipping in coffee or icing.
Using a fork is helpful when eating a muffin that contains large pieces of fruit, such as strawberries or blueberries, even if the muffin is dry and crumbly. The fruit makes a great anchor point for your fork and can allow for easy pickup of large pieces of muffin.
 If you find the remainder of the muffin has fallen apart into smaller chunks, use the knife to scoop the crumbs onto the fork, or use a spoon. This method is typically only possible at home, or when eating at a restaurant or bakery.

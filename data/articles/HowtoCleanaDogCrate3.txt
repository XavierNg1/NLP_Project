 Club soda is effective on acidic stains, like urine. Use the soda cap to measure a small amount of club soda. Pour it directly on the stain, and let it soak for a few minutes. Once it has soaked, you can blot it with paper towels and let it dry. Do not rub or scrub; this will only drive the stain deeper into the fabric., Using warm water, dilute a dish detergent with water before scouring the fabric with a rag or paper towel. You can scrub difficult stains with a sponge or bristle brush.


Crates for smaller breeds can be washed in the sink.
Medium and large-breed crates will need to be washed outside with a low-powered hose.
 Check with the manufacturer to see if the crate can be machine washed. You can look on the manufacturer’s website, on the crate’s tag, or on the crate’s packaging. If you can, collapse the crate so that it fits into your machine. Use cold water and your normal detergent. You can add a box of baking soda to remove odors., No matter if you hand-washed or machine washed your fabric crate, you should allow it to dry in a ventilated room or outside. Do not place it in a dryer. Make sure that the crate is completely dry inside and out before allowing your dog to use it again.


If the inside is taking too long to dry, you can use a hair dryer to speed the process.
 Baking soda is a dog-friendly substance that can remove unpleasant smells from fabric. Sprinkle a handful of powder inside the crate, and let it sit for fifteen to twenty minutes. Vacuum it up when you are done. Baking soda can be used after you’re finished cleaning or between cleaning sessions to keep the crate smelling fresh.

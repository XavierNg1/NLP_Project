 If none of the techniques you've tried appear to be working, buy special leather cleaner. These can be used to remove oil or grease stains from suede shoes and garments.


If possible, use a cleaner made of natural ingredients. Some leather cleaners actually do more harm than good.
 It may be expensive, but sometimes turning to an expert is the safest and most effective way to take care of suede items.


If you have suede clothing, take it to a dry cleaner that works with suede. Ask a dry cleaner if they also handle suede purses and other accessories.
If you have suede shoes, take them to a cobbler. Cobblers have the appropriate skills and supplies to tackle the toughest stains.

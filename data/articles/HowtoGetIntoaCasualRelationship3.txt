 Even though there are no strings attached, you should not disappear and ignore your partner’s attempts to reach out. Ignoring text messages or emails can hurt your partner’s feelings. Be respectful and mindful of their emotions. Although there was an agreed-upon casualness to the relationship, it may insult your partner and damage their self-esteem., If you become too emotionally invested, if you meet someone new, or you are no longer interested in pursuing a casual relationship, talk to your partner. It is important to be honest; after all, the casual relationship was founded on open, honest, upfront communication. Don’t lie in an effort to spare their feelings, but do be kind and forthcoming.
 Perhaps you both agree for a clean break and agree to end all communication. Or, perhaps the two of you formed a great bond and wish to continue to keep in touch as friends. Recognize that the transition from a casual relationship to friendship can be complex and take time. Listen to your instincts and decide what would be best for you as you move away from the casual relationship.


Be sure that you are really interested in maintaining a friendship. Ask yourself if you would mind seeing your partner with someone else.
Consider if you or your partner ended things because romantic feelings got in the way. It may be too complicated to maintain a friendship as it can could cause romantic feelings to grow stronger.
If you do decide to be friends, give yourself some time away from one another. Reach out when enough time has passed, and make plans to catch up in a public place.

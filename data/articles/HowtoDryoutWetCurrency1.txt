 Make sure the bills are kept in a room with good air circulation to lessen the time it takes for the bills to dry. Keep the bills in an area where they won’t get blown away or easily lost. Avoid putting the bills near open air vents or next to tight crevices where the bills could fall. Try arranging them on the edge of a sink so the water will drip to the ground.;
, Place the fan at a good middle ground where the air won’t blow the bills away while still drying them from a distance. Put the fan at a low wind speed to ensure your money won’t fly off the table.
 Place absorbent paper towels between every 5-6 bills to soak up the moisture. Change the paper towels when they become too saturated with the liquid.
 This step is important to ensure both sides are adequately dry. Continue turning the bills over until they become crisp and dry again.
 If you have some time, skip setting the fan up and blow dry the bills from above with a basic hairdryer. Again, make sure you’re not setting the air speed too fast where the money is blown away. , This often takes up more time than using a blow dryer or fan, but it requires the least amount of effort. Find a sunny spot like a windowsill or the dashboard of a car to ensure the bills are getting enough warmth.


Close any windows and try to minimize air circulation so the bills aren’t getting blown away.
Divide the bills. In order to get each bill as dry as possible, you need to separate each one and arrange them next to each other in your sunny location.
Leave the bills out for a few hours. The time varies based on how sunny it is and how soaked your bills are. In most cases, it only takes 2-4 hours for the sun's warmth to cause the water to evaporate from the monies, leaving them crisp and dry.

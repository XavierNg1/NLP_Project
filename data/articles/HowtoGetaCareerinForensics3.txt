 After you have chosen your desired focus and program, study well and take the time to learn everything you can about the field. Seek a mentor in your school’s science department. Meet with the person regularly and if possible, design a research project related to forensic science with him or her.


If you would like to seek employment in your field without a master's degree, choose your undergraduate courses very carefully. For example, consider taking criminology courses, graphics course, such as 3D modeling, organ chemistry or toxicology, and human physiology.
You can also do forensic anthropological or archaeological fieldwork, which will prove you have experience in the field.
 Consider doing an internship during your first summer break or an early semester in your educational career. This will dispel any romantic notions you might have about the job and help you obtain real-world skills. Trying out the career before you spend a lot of time and money on courses is a good idea. Use your networking contacts to find internships as well as applying online and through local law enforcement agencies.
 While not necessary for all forensics careers, getting a graduate degree might be essential if your undergraduate degree did not acquaint you with the wide array of subjects you need to study, or if your chosen specialty requires it. For careers in the hard sciences, subjects include human anatomy, organ chemistry, toxicology, evidence analysis, and criminal justice. Obtaining a master’s degree or PhD can increase your employment chances too.

 Most train rides are fairly long, meaning that you'll have a lot of time to kill. This is a great opportunity for reading - either for pleasure, or for schoolwork. Choose one or two books to bring with you on the train ride, and keep them in your personal bag (not your luggage). You'll then have the opportunity over the whole ride to read and/or study.
 There's something romantic about the idea of drawing the scenery out the window as you drive by on a train. Whether you're an artist at heart or just looking to kill time, drawing is a great way to do it. Bring a sketchbook and a drawing pencil, along with any other drawing tools you might enjoy. You'll be able to draw to your heart's content, and you'll have a memento from your trip to look back on later.
 If you're traveling with more than one person, bringing a card game for the ride might be a good option. Games are a great way to distract yourself from the boredom of a long trip, and they make the time seem to go by much faster. Traveling by yourself? You can still bring a deck of cards to play a game like Solitaire, or bring a trivia card game and quiz yourself while you travel.
 Sometimes, a long train ride begs for nothing more than a good nap. However, trains aren't always the most comfortable, making napping difficult. Consider wearing a scarf or another head-wrap to use as a makeshift pillow, or bring a neck pillow for relaxing. You'll probably want headphones and some music too, to block out the sounds of a busy train car.

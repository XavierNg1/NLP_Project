 They are commonly seen where there are waterfront homes and along shorelines.


See if the spider appears to “skate” across the water. The fishing spider can also dive under the water to catch prey.
Notice the markings. Most fishing spiders are brown or grey and they have white markings on their backs.
Check out the size of the spider. Fishing spiders, with their legs extended, can have a body span of up to 4” (101 mm).



Locate cellar spiders by looking for their webs, which are usually in corners near the ceiling.
Notice the length of the spider’s legs. Cellar spiders have very long legs and are often mistaken for daddy long leg spiders, which are not, in fact, spiders at all. (Daddy long-legs don’t have 2 distinct body parts).
Remove cellar spiders, which are harmless, by eliminating their webs. They are less likely to reappear if you reduce the humidity in your cellar.
 Wolf spiders are hunters and don’t create webs to catch their prey.


Look for this spider as it scurries along the ground searching for insects to eat.
Note the color: they are dark brown, never black.
Identify a female wolf spider by the fairly large egg sac she carries around on her body.
Be aware that although wolf spiders prefer to live and hunt outdoors, they will seek warmer places to live, such as your home, when the weather turns cold.

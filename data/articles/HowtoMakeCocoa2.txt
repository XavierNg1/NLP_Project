 In your favorite mug for warm beverages, combine 2 tablespoons (24 g) of granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon (7.5 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of milk. Mix until there are no lumps.The mixture should be smooth, but still very thick and dark.
 After you’ve stirred the cocoa mixture until smooth, mix in the remaining 1 cup (284 ml) of milk. Place the mug in the microwave, and heat it on high for 1 minute.Using whole milk will create a creamier hot cocoa, but you can use any variety that you prefer.
 Remove the mug from the microwave, and mix the cocoa mixture well to distribute the heat throughout the liquid. Place it back in the microwave, and heat it for approximately 30 seconds.You want to heat the cocoa until it is hot. If it isn’t warm enough when you remove it from the microwave, heat it further in 10 second intervals until it reaches your desired temperature. Make sure to stir it after each interval.
 When the cocoa is hot, mix in a pinch of salt, stirring carefully to ensure that it’s well combined. Add whipped cream and/or marshmallows to the mug, and serve.

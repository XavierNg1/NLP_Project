 If your client is only with you for a couple hours a week and they want to see real progress, they have to do the right things when they’re on their own. Working out regularly with you is great, but it isn’t the only thing they should be doing. With your client, plan a system of checking in. Whether it is a text daily or an email every other day, decide how they will keep you updated on their exercise, diet, or anything else you’re working on with them.If you determine that your client is pretty self-motivated outside of your sessions, you can ease up on the check-ins. Continue to ask for brief recaps at the beginning of your workouts, however.
 This homework can be something like a workout plan, writing down a food journal, or even simple goals like, “Eat vegetables every day.” Most clients will genuinely want to complete their assignment successfully, so this can be extremely motivating.


When you assign this “homework,” give them the opportunity to decide if it seems realistic and manageable. If they tell you that they will be able to complete it, hold them to it.
 There are several ways that they can do this. The free iPhone app MyFitnessPal allows users to log their food intake and exercise, and it also can give your client a forum to speak to other people on a fitness journey through extensive discussion boards and comment features. Encourage them to attend a certain workout class regularly or recruit friends to become gym buddies. The more people they have around them cheering them on, the more motivated they will be to stick with it and see progress.

 Pour the water into a medium saucepan and set it on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil.


Use a heavy-bottomed saucepan for best results. You'll need to avoid stirring the rice too often as it cooks, and if the saucepan is too thin, the rice can easily burn and stick to the bottom.
Vary the amount of water by 1/4 cup (60 ml) to change the consistency of the rice. Adding less water will create drier rice, but adding more water will create moister rice. Note that these changes may alter the final cooking time, as well.;
, Once the water begins boiling, add the oil (or margarine). If you also wish to add salt, do so now.


The boiling action may momentarily settle after you add these ingredients, but it should resume within 30 seconds. At that point, you can move onto the next step.
 Add the Arborio rice to the boiling water. Cover the pan and reduce the heat down to medium or medium-low.


After adding the rice, the boiling action should slightly settle. Stir the rice during this time while waiting for the water to begin boiling again. After it boils, reduce the heat as indicated.
 Let the contents of the saucepan simmer, undisturbed, until the rice absorbs all the water. This will usually take around 20 minutes when the water is at a gentle simmer.Avoid opening the pan since doing so will release steam. Similarly, avoid stirring the rice since doing so may break the grains.
When ready, the rice should be creamy but should still have some firmness or "bite" in the center of the grains (known as "al dente").
 Remove the rice from the heat and let it cool for another minute before serving it as a side dish.


You can serve the rice as it is, or sprinkle some Parmesan cheese and black pepper to taste.

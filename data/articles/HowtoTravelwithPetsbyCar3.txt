Cats don't like being taken out of their environment so traveling takes them away from the familiar.

Another way to make it comfortable is by placing a sizeable piece of fabric inside to make it cozy.
Another way to help your cat relax is by giving them a feline appropriate, vet approved depressant for the journey.

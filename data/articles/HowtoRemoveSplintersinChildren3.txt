 This method can be used for a buried splinter that has lodged under thick skin like pads of the finger or heel of the foot.
 Instruct him to stay calm and tell him that the process can be a little painful but will subside after the splinter is removed. Consider having someone hold your child while you remove the splinter so that he doesn't move and cause himself more pain.
 For this method, you will need:


Cotton balls soaked in alcohol
Tweezers
Nail clipper
Small bowl with alcohol
A puncture proof container for discarding the splinter.
 Sterilize the tip of the tweezers and the nail clippers by soaking them in the small bowl of alcohol. Soak the tools for roughly five minutes.


While waiting, clean the punctured area with cotton balls soaked in alcohol. Work from the inner part of the wound to the outer part. This maneuver prevents dirt and other microorganisms from getting into the punctured wound.
 Get the sterilized nail clipper. Using your dominant hand, clip away the skin above the splinter in a parallel manner. This should not hurt as the skin is thick and not as sensitive.
 When the splinter is already visible, get the sterilized tweezers and pull the skin slowly apart so that you can gain more access to the splinter. Slowly grab the tip of the splinter with your tweezers using your dominant hand. Slowly pull the splinter away from you. The direction should be opposite the direction the splinter went through the skin.
 Discard the splinter in the puncture proof container to avoid further accidents. Get a new cotton ball soaked in alcohol and put it on the punctured area. Apply firm pressure to the area for five minutes to stop any bleeding.

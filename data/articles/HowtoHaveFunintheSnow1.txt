 One of the most popular wintertime activities is sledding and snow tubing. This activity is fun and easy, as you need little to no experience to begin. Find a good hill in your neighborhood and grab a tube or sled for hours of entertainment for the whole family. Sledding is fun for all ages, but young children should ride with a parent or older sibling for safety precautions.


Sleds and snow tubes are usually affordable and can be purchased at most big box stores (Walmart, Target, etc.).You can use materials found in most homes as makeshift sleds and tubes (garbage can lids, boxes, kiddie pools, etc.).;
, Snowball fights are a great way to have some winter fun in your own backyard. Get a group of friends together, or make it a family battle. To make a snowball, grab a handful of snow and pack it together to create the shape of a ball.


Make a game of Tag more interesting by incorporating a snowball fight. Whoever is "it" must tag people by hitting them with snowballs.
Play a game of dodgeball with snowballs instead of bouncy balls.
Avoid injuries by making sure the snow isn't too icy and not throwing your snowballs too hard. Remember, this should be fun, not painful., If you enjoy hiking during the warmer months, you'll love snowshoeing. Snowshoes will allow you to walk through deep snow without getting stuck, and snowshoers usually hold a pole in each hand to help them keep their balance (the poles are optional depending on the trail and your balance). Outdoor retailers sell snowshoes and poles for kids as young as 2 years old.

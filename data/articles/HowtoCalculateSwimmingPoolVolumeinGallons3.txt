 If you have a round pool that is of uniform depth, then all you have to do to find the volume is to treat it like a cylinder. To find the volume of a cylinder, all you have to do is find the area of the circular base times the height; this uses the formula V = πr2h. Let's say the pool's radius is 4.5 feet and its depth (height) is 4 feet. Plug those numbers into the formula to find the volume: V = π x 4.52 x 4 = 254.46 cubic feet. To convert this to gallons, simply multiply the result by 7.48. 254.46 x 7.48 = 1903 gallons.
 For faster but slightly less accurate results, you can also plug the depth and diameter of the pool into the following formula: V = depth x diameter squared x 5.9. Let's say we're working with the same circle that has a depth of 4 and a diameter of 9 (the same as having a radius of 4.5). The volume of this pool = 4 x 9 x 9 x 5.9 = 1,911 gallons. The result is slightly larger.
 If your pool is shallower on one end and deeper on the other. just measure the minimum height and maximum height of the pool and divide them by 2 to get the average height, or the depth you should use in either formula. For example, if the pool has a minimum depth of 5 feet and a maximum depth of 10 feet, then you can add 5 + 10 to get 15, and divide 15 by 2 to get 7.5, the average depth of the pool. You can use this as the depth of the pool in either formula.

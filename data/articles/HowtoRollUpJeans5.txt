 The bunchy cuff is normally fashioned in women’s styles, with baggy, thicker, “boyfriend” jeans. These loose but heavier jeans are then usually paired with high fashion items like heels and leather jackets, to create a juxtaposed look of both sloppy and chic.
 Fold both bottom legs of your jeans up about 3-4 inches. Then, pluck and pull the cuffing downward to create a sloppier look.


The cuff should look crinkly and wrinkled.
 Fold down the top hem of the cuff and rough up the fold by scrunching and squeezing the cuff with your hands.This cuffing should look sloppy while still maintaining its folded nature.

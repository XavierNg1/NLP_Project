 An alkane is a hydrocarbon chain that contains no double or triple bonds between carbon molecules. The suffix at the end of an alkane should always be -ane.;
, You can draw out all the symbols, or you can use a skeleton structure. Find out which one your instructor wants you to use, and stick with it.
 The parent chain is the longest continuous carbon chain in the molecule. Number it starting by the nearest substituent group. Each substituent will be noted by its numerical location on the chain.
 Substituents should be named alphabetically (excluding prefixes such as di, tri or tetra), not in numerical order.


If you have two of the same substituents on the hydrocarbon chain, put "di" before the substituent. Even if they're attached to the same numbered carbon, list the number twice.

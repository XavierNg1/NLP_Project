 Matte lipsticks tend to magnify flaws, so it is a good idea to exfoliate your lips first.You can use a lip exfoliating product or make your own.









To make your own lip exfoliator, mix a teaspoon of sugar with a teaspoon of olive oil or honey.
To use the lip exfoliator, rub the mixture over your lips to get rid of dead skin. Rinse away the exfoliating mixture when you are done.
 Moisturized lips tend to hold onto color longer and look better as well. To ensure that your matte lipstick will look flawless, make sure that you apply a layer of lip balm before you apply any lipstick.
 Applying concealer before you apply lip color can help to ensure that the color will be as vibrant as possible. It can also help to ensure that your lip color will last longer.








To enhance your lip color with concealer, apply an even layer of concealer all over your lips before you apply any color.
 Lining your lips before you apply lipstick will help to prevent the color from bleeding onto the skin around your lips. Apply liner to the inner edges of your lips to help keep the lip color on your lips.
 Applying multiple coats of lipstick before you mattify the color may also help to ensure that the color will last and look as vibrant as possible. Try applying two or even three coats of lipstick before you mattify your lip color.

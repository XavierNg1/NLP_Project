 First, dampen a cloth. Then gently apply the wet cloth to the bear. Moisten and rub the dirty area to loosen dirt without soaking the bear any more than needed.Don’t worry if you end up using “too much” water. All this means is that you will have to wait a little bit longer for your bear to dry before it is ready to play with again.;
, Add a dab of dish soap or laundry detergent to a clean portion of the cloth. Only use a small dab of detergent at a time. Avoid creating an excess of suds, which will be harder to rinse out thoroughly, thus making the fur crunchy as it dries.If you have several spots or bears to clean, or expect to have to clean toys often, mix either 1 teaspoon of dish soap for every 1 cup of water in a spray bottle,or mix a drop of liquid laundry detergent for every 1 cup of water. Spray the solution directly on the dirty spot.
If there is one, check the bear’s care label to see if it recommends or warns against any particular chemical.
 Gently rub the dirty area with that portion of the cloth until the dirt has been removed. Handle the bear gently as you do so to avoid damage. Apply another dab of detergent and repeat as needed.Only rub the dirty area. Avoid spreading soap and suds so that you don't miss any when it is time to rinse them off.
 Find a fresh, clean towel. Dampen it with water. Gently wipe the bear’s washed areas to remove soap and suds so that the fur doesn't become crunchy as it dries.This time, be sure to only slightly dampen the towel as opposed to soaking it, which may create or spread more suds while wiping the bear, and thus defeat the purpose.

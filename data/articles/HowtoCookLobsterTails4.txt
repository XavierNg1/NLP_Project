 Be generous with the salt, but don't add more than a couple tablespoons.
 It's customary to leave the shell on the lobster if you're boiling it. The shell will help impart flavor and make sure the meat of the tail doesn't fall apart while cooking.
, For example, 10 oz. of tail meat needs to cook for 10 minutes. If you are cooking with 4 tails that each weigh 10 oz., don't cook the tails for 40 minutes; cook for 10 minutes!









If you are cooking a lot of tails (4+), add a minute or two on top of the original cooking time.
 You can also do this with a knife, but be careful not to break apart the lobster meat as you cut through the shell.

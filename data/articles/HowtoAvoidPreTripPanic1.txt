 The sooner you being preparing for a trip, the less anxiety you should feel as the date draws near. Many people experience pre-trip panic because they want until the last minute to pack and finalize their travel plans. Begin brainstorming ways you can prepare for the trip several weeks or even months ahead (depending on the destination and any special processes you need to complete)., A solid list can help you feel more in control as you prepare for your trip. It’s a good idea to create several lists based on specific categories. You may want to develop a packing checklist to make sure you bring along all the necessities. This may include items like your clothing, toiletries, reading material, and a phone charger.You might also want to create a general to-do list of any tasks you need to complete before the trip like boarding your pet or applying for a passport.
 Hearing about the first-hand experiences of others and knowing what to expect on your trip can minimize any anxiety you experience. Try reading blogs, watching YouTube videos, or browsing books and magazines that relate to your trip.You might peruse topics that relate to the particular destination (e.g. Do you need a visa?) or more general subjects like packing and planning for the trip.
 Your chances of enjoying your trip improve when you depart with your to-do list complete. This is why it’s important to begin planning early on and make thorough lists. That way, you’ll have the extra time to handle any unforeseen responsibilities that arise.For example, if your trip is extended, you may need to pay your bills in advance or arrange for someone to come over and water your plants. If you are taking a work trip, you might need to communicate with your boss about any tasks that need doing during the trip or delegate any ongoing projects to another team member.
Loose ends may also apply to the trip itself, such as confirming reservations or paying deposits for excursions.

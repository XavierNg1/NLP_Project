 This second coat generally doesn't need to be left on for long. Simply apply it just like the first coat, wiping off after 2-3 minutes. Let it all dry for another 6-8 hours before moving on.


Do not add this second coat until the first has finished drying.
 Stain is for looks, but it will not protect the wood from moisture, oils, or warping. For that you will need to finish the final piece, protecting both the wood and your stain. You can choose from the following options:


Water-based polyurethane
Polyurethane
Wood lacquer
Finishing oils, Using a clean cloth or foam brush, simply apply a thin, even coat of polyurethane to the wood, then let it dry. Don't worry if it looks milky or white as you apply it -- it will dry clear.


Water-based polyurethane is, by far, the easiest finish to apply, though it is less protective of water or oil than other finishes., Apply 2-3 thin coats, making sure there are no bubbles on each one. Let each coat dry, then sand it with 220 grit paper before applying the next one.


This is the thicker, almost plastic-like clear coating on many tables and desks. If your furniture is going to be prone to nicks, scratches, and scuffs, this is your best bet for protection.
 To apply it, use a paint sprayer and aim for an even coat throughout. A natural-bristle brush can also be used, but you must work quickly, as lacquer dries quickly. Let it dry, using a brush to remove any bubbles or unevenness, then sand with fine-grit (220 or higher) paper. Apply 2-3 more coats, sanding between each one.


Lacquer is harder to apply but worth the effort for expensive pieces.
 Apply a little bit of oil to a clean rag and rub it into the dry, stained wood. Let it soak according to the oil's instructions, then rub it off with a clean rag and apply 1-2 more coats.


If the piece is subject to lots of wear and tear, this is not a very protective coating. You should use something more durable.

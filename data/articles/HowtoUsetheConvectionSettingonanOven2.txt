 Since the convection option moves hot air around the oven, it may have the effect of overcooking the outside of a dish and undercooking the inside. As a result, you should lower the temperature by 25 degrees before you start cooking a dish.Your oven might automatically lower the temperature when using the convection setting. Check this before you set your temperature.
 In addition to lowering the temperature when cooking your dish, you should also shorten the amount of time that your recipe calls for it to be cooked. If you don’t cook your dish for less time, it could burn or dry out.For example, if the original bake time was 60 minutes, reduce it to 45 minutes in the convection oven.
 Because the convection process moves hot air around the oven, your dishes will cook best if you use low-sided cookware. Ultimately, this will help your dish cook more equally and make it crisper.Depending on the dish, you may want to use rimless ovenware.
 Since the exhaust system on your oven will remove moisture from your oven, you may need to add extra water to any dishes you want to keep moist. If you don’t, the dishes could dry out or ruin.

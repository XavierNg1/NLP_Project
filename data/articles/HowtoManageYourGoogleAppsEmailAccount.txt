 If you like your old email setup (e.g. you've already got your folders/labels and email filters set up) you don't have to change. You can just go to "Settings" in the Google Apps email account, and set up email forwarding to your old account.;
,


Your new account has an "untrained" spam filter, which will be overactive in sending good emails to the spam folder. You can reduce this by these steps:








Import your contacts from your old email account - if an email comes from someone in your existing contacts list, the spam filter is less likely to think it's spam.






In your old account, go to contacts or address book and look for an "export" function. If you can, export to a .csv file.
In your new Google Apps account, click contacts, choose "Import" and select the file you exported from your old account. This should be complete.
To improve the spam filter, and catch the good emails that still get caught, regularly log into your Google Apps account. Check through the spam folder, select the good emails and click "Not spam".

 To get acquainted with the material you are going to be studying, check out the table of contents in a syllabus, textbook, or course pack. Note how the content is divided, and what the major topics are. Note how ideas are mapped out, and what concepts have more pages to devoted to them.For example, a history textbook will likely be divided by era, with subtitles listing important battles, elections, or other events of note.;
, To get a sense of what you are studying before you begin to read in-depth, scan the course material for summarizing text. Summaries could include topic headings, bolded keywords, or chapter summaries.) These parts should offer a general idea of what the chapter or section will cover and frame further reading of the content.In some study materials, pictures, maps, or diagrams may serve the same purpose.
 For further insight, or if no table of contents, headings, or other summaries are available, read the first and last sentences of each paragraph. Reading the introduction and conclusion of each paragraph will give you a quick overview of its content and help you trace the chain of ideas presented. Identify what the subject matter is, as well as the approach taken to the subject within the text (e.g. a comparative study or historical overview).

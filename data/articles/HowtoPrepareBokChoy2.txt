 To stir fry bok choy, trim off the hard stem ends and separate the individual leaves and rinse them. Dry them thoroughly while you prepare the skillet for stir-frying.
 If you want to add bok choy as part of a stir-fry, you can add it to any basic mix of vegetables and meat. But if you want to feature it as a dish by itself, the best additions are a little garlic and ginger, which help to highlight and lift the flavors of the bok choy.Use about a half-inch piece of ginger and grate it finely. You can also chop it, but grating it helps to break up the fibers and make it more palatable.
Slice two cloves of garlic thinly, or mince it more finely if you don't want big pieces.
 Put your skillet on the heat, on medium-high. Garlic and ginger and burn very quickly, so add it to the skillet right at the beginning and let it heat up gently. When you can smell them, and see the garlic and ginger browning gently, add the bok choy.
 Bok choy will cook very quickly and can become overcooked. Wilt it, get it covered in the fragrant oil, and then add some cooking liquid to get it cooked more thoroughly.


At high temperature, the bok choy leaves should wilt pretty quickly, and might brown and curl at the green edges. That's a good sign.
Make sure the garlic and ginger don't burn, or this dish will taste quite bitter.
 White wine and chicken broth or stock make for excellent cooking liquids for bok choy, adding richness and flavor. Cover the lid immediately and allow the mixture to cook for about a minute.


Add a cup of cooking liquid per pound or so of bok choy leaves you've added.
 Check the leaves for tenderness after about a minute. Cook off extra liquid, if some remains in the skillet. Then serve in a bowl and top with salt, to taste, and a little drizzle of sesame oil. Serve with steamed rice. You could also add other flavors, to taste:


Red pepper flakes
Sesame seeds
Chopped peanut
Sriracha hot sauce
Soy sauce
Hoisin sauce

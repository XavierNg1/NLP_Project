 This padding is found in the foot section at drugstores. Most moleskin comes in skin colors, so you may have a harder time matching it to your bra. It's used to pad corns and calluses, but today, you'll use it to fix your bra. A small package will do, as you don't need very much., Just like with the fabric, you will cut a strip of moleskin large enough to patch the hole. You may want it large enough to go over the edge of the bra for more stability. Also, try to round off the corners so the fabric won't poke you., Find the place the wire is sticking out. Push it all the way back in, so you can't see the wire anymore. You may want to cover it up a bit with the fabric from the bra. Just stretch it out a bit and use the one side of the rip to cover it up., Peel the paper backing off the moleskin. Put the strip sticky-side down over the hole, and bend it over the edge of the bra if you need to. Smooth it out with your fingers, and the patch is done.Make sure you spend some extra time smoothing with the moleskin. The moleskin needs the heat from your skin to really adhere to the fabric.

Collect a wergali herb. Invest in clean wergali for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy wergalis are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect a wimpy feather. You will either need to start the "As a First Resort..." quest and travel to Oo'glog to snare the birds. You can also purchase the feathers from the Grand Exchange.
 This will create a "Wergali Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose fletching potion.

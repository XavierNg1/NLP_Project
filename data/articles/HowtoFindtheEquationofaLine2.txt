 The y-intercept (or the variable b in our equation) is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. You can calculate the y-intercept by rearranging the equation to solve for b. Our new equation looks like this: b = y - mx.

Plug your slope and coordinates into the above equation.
Multiply the slope (m) by the x-coordinate of the point.
Subtract that amount FROM the y-coordinate of the point.
You've solved for b, or the y-intercept.
,,, "Given the point (6, -5) and the slope 2/3, what is the equation of the line?"


Rearrange your equation. b = y - mx.






Plug in and solve.





b = -5 - (2/3)6.
b = -5 - 4.
b = -9


Double-check that your y-intercept is really -9.
Write down the equation: y = 2/3 x - 9

 One of the worst things that you can do when answering a tough question is ramble about something that isn't pertinent to the job or the position. Refrain from telling anecdotal stories from your childhood or personal likes and dislikes. Keep your answers short, accurate, and relatable to the role that you want to fill.A great way to keep on track is to talk about recent professional triumphs or victories.
 If you've prepared for the interview but the person interviewing you still throws you a curve ball, it's important that you take your time to think through your response deliberately. Pause for a moment and take the time to think about what you are going to say.Never answer a question with a "No" or "I don't know." Aim to expand your answers to give the interviewer some context.
 When you arrive early, it gives you time to relax and concentrate on the interview. Make sure to plan your route the night before so that you can get to the interview feeling confident and prepared., Visualize yourself doing great on the interview and getting the job. Don't underplay your abilities or talk negatively about your past. Have confidence in what you do and try to smile throughout the interview.

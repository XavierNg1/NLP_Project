 Lena is drop-dead gorgeous! In the book she has straight, shiny black hair and 'green eyes, roughly the color of celery.' In the movie, Lena has wavy, shoulder-length dark-brown hair, and electric blue eyes. Dye your hair a dark shade and straighten it. Get green colored contacts if you can. Only curl your hair on events that are very special.;
, She is said to have 'a bland uniform of J. Crew khakis'. Get clothes like her. In the movie, Lena wears very classical pieces, and almost always wears white clothes. Lena loves bland outfits such as a cardigan with a brown turtleneck and sandy pants. She also prefers sort of being seen but not heard. She is also tired of being called beautiful, so she wants her outfits to be drawing away from her.
 Lena is said to be the most maternal of the foursome. She is also very shy and thoughtful. She , like Carmen, wants her friends close. Lena is very sympathetic.
 Lena doesn't like to show off her beauty, and makeup would do just that. For very special occasions, she wears a little mascara. No eyeliner! For this girl, let your inner beauty shine!

, Lena doesn't try to hide her Greek heritage, even though her parents do. Travel to your homeland, if possible.
 Lena, for example, loves art- painting, sketching, etc. Let others see your skills and respect what you can do.
 After all, it's about what YOU love, not what others love!

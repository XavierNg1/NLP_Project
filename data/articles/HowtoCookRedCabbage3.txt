 Rinse the cabbage under cold, running water. Pat the cabbage dry with a paper towel. Cut the cabbage into 6 wedges using a knife.
 Add 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of water to a skillet. Bring the water to a boil. Add the cabbage wedges and 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) of salt. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the skillet, and cook the cabbage for 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the wedges of cabbage and continue to cook them for another 8 to 10 minutes. Pour off any water and return the cabbage to the stove, allowing all of the moisture to evaporate. Add 3 to 4 tbsp. (44 ml to 51 ml) of melted butter. Salt and pepper to taste.

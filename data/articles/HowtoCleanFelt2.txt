 Be sure you dab the soap on without rubbing at the fabric. Spot cleaning small and relatively minor stains this way is preferable to immersing your felt item in water, since the dyed color in felt can run easily.Try to get started with the spot cleaning process as soon as possible after the stain occurs.
 If the stain is being stubborn, add another dab of soap on the remaining stain and dab again until itâ€™s gone.


For extra stubborn stains, you can use diluted white vinegar to clean the felt.
Use one part vinegar and two parts water to get the proper dilution for this. Concentrated vinegar can bleach the colors out of your felt.
Repeat the same process of dabbing at the stain with your vinegar/water solution. The vinegar not only removes stains but can also destroy any bad odors.
 Once free of soap, re-soak it with cool water. Try to use approximately the same water temperature throughout the entire process.
 This will force clean water through the stained area, rinsing any remaining soap from the felt. You may find it easier to use two wet rags to rinse the soap from the felt.


Using a flat surface, put one rag on each side of the felt and press down over the cleaned area, forcing clean water through.
Rinse out the rag and repeat the process, if necessary.
 Simply press down on the spot a few times until the towel has soaked up the excess water. Allow the item to air-dry in a cool place.Do not air-dry felt in direct sunlight, because this is damaging to the fabric.

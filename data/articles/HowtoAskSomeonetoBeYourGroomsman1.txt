 Receiving an invitation to be a groomsman is exciting. It also sends a meaningful message that you value your relationship with someone enough to ask that they stand beside you while you make one of the most significant commitments in your life. Accordingly, make your request personal by asking in person if you can.

There doesn’t need to be any pomp and circumstance. Simply get together and say something like, “Hey man, our friendship has meant a lot to me over the years. I wanted to ask you if you’d we willing to join Carrie and I on our wedding day as a groomsman?”
Keep in mind you can still send along a funny card or a thoughtful gift in the mail.;
, If you’re not able to speak in person with all of your groomsmen, consider writing a letter to those you will ask by mail. Since a letter can be more personal than a phone call, this is preferable, especially for a close friend that lives further away.Be specific with something like, “I’m writing to invite you to join us on our wedding day as a groomsman.”
Include a more personal message as well. For instance, say something about what your relationship with the recipient has meant, and why you want them to be at your wedding.
 Even if you’re able to have the conversation in person, it’s worth sending a card with the details. Since you already spoke about it in person, the card will simply function as a tangible reminder, with important information like dates, location, and dress code.Choose or make a card that reflects your personality, an interest you share with your groomsman, or a design that fits with your wedding theme.
Look at greeting card websites and wedding websites for examples of card designs. Many will allow you to order cards in a design you like and customize lettering and color schemes.
If you haven’t finalized a date but want to nail down your wedding party, let them know what time of year you’re thinking. Get back to them about a specific day as soon as you determine one.

 Hold a normal deck of cards in your hands. Keep one or two jokers in the deck. Show the deck to the audience and let them see you shuffle it., It is essential that your audience doesn’t notice you peep at the bottom card. You’ll need to memorize the bottom card. Act casual and show them the top of the deck while you look at the bottom., Ask an audience member to pick a card. Once they have the card ask them to memorize it and place it on top.


Insist that they don’t let you see the card, but tell them to show others if they want., Place the bottom half on top of the card placed on top. This puts the card you memorized directly on top of their card. You can do as many cuts as you want, as long as they are single cuts.
 Pretend to look for jokers and take them out, but also find the card you memorized. Their card is resting directly on top of it. Cut the deck again so that their card is on top.


Cutting the deck a second time may take a few trials and errors before doing it seamlessly., Have them pick a number between ten and twenty. Deal that many cards off the top of the deck. Take that amount of cards and hold them between your thumb and pointer, have them slap the cards and the one farthest to the left should be their card.


Make sure you hold that one tightly so that it doesn't fall out.Adding the card slap and additional shuffling adds to the showmanship of the card trick. These additional steps also help distract the audience of how simple it really is.

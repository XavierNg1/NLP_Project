 Use a clean microfiber cloth so you don’t introduce debris into the scratch. Dampen the cloth with lukewarm water and wash the glass as you normally would.
 You only need a spoonful or less of each ingredient. It’s best to place them in a bowl so you can mix them with a spoon to remove large clumps of baking soda. When mixed, you’ll have a pudding-like paste., Again, use a fresh cloth. It helps to wrap the cloth around your finger and press the cloth into the paste. This way, you’ll pick up a small amount of the paste.
 Place the paste on the glass and buff out the scratch by moving the cloth in a circular motion. Do this for 30 seconds maximum, watching for any sign of the scratch disappearing., Rinse the glass or apply a fresh cloth. Dampen the cloth in lukewarm water and pass it over the scratched area, making sure all the baking soda paste is removed.

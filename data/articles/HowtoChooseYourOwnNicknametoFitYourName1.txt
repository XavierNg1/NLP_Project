 Think about shorter names that might be hidden inside it. For example, the name Steven contains the shorter name Steve. The name Alfred contains Al, Alf, Fred, and Red. Those names in turn might also have nicknames, such as Alfie (for Alf). Many people choose a nickname based on their own first name because it is easy for themselves and others to remember.


Last names can also be a good source of nicknames. For example, people whose last names begin with Mc- or Mac-, as in John McClane, sometimes choose to go by the nickname Mac. A last name itself can also be a nickname.
Consider letter combinations in your name that might not be regular names, but which are easy to say. Someone named Steven might think about going by Te or Ven.
Nicknames based on your name can be spelled however you like. "Mack" works just as well as "Mac." The pronunciation is more important than the spelling.;
, If you have a reputation for doing something well or standing out in some other way, it can lead to a nickname. Someone with a loud, booming yell might go as Boomer. A very smart person is sometimes called a "brain;" Brain can also be a great nickname. To ensure that the nickname you choose references your own name, look for nicknames that share a first letter with your name, or that rhyme with it.
 The places you grew up, as well as the places your ancestors lived, can sometimes provide great nicknames. People with ancestors in the Netherlands could choose the nickname Dutch; a person who grew up in Texas might go as Tex or Texie. A strong sense of connection to an ancestral culture can also provide nicknames that mean the same thing as your name means, but in another language or cultural tradition.

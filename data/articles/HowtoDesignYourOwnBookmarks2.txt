 These corner bookmarks can range from a basic solid color corner to designs like hearts or ice cream cones. Whatever design you choose will determine what color fabric to buy., For this bookmark, you’ll need felt squares of your color or design choice, scissors, a ruler, a sewing needle, and either sewing thread or embroidery thread of your color choice.
 If you’re making a simple design, like a heart, use a marker to draw the shape outline on the felt before you start cutting.
 Measure one corner of the felt square to fit the corner of the book page. Fold the felt square in half, line up the corners, and cut the corners together to create two equally measured cut outs.
 Line up the two corner cutouts and sew together two of the edges along the trim. Leave one side open, or the top of your design open, to slip over the corner of your book page.

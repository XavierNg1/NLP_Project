 Get a dress with an ethereal look. It should have a ruffly bottom, and be pastel or light in color. Shoes should be sandals. You can also get cut stockings or arm warmers if you're worried about being cold.
 Draw flowers, vines, or other natural designs on your face. Finish it off with some bright eye shadow and pink lips!

, Get a bag that looks appropriate for a fairy. Take an old tee-shirt (or shirts) and stuff it in the bag until the opening is nice and visible and the shirt is poking out. Cover the surface of the shirt showing with glue and then immediately add glitter. Allow it to dry and it will look like you have a bag full of fairy dust!

, Make whatever kind of wings you want or buy a pair.

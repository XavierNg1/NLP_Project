 The refrigerator method is easy and safe, requiring very little hands-on time. Additionally, you don’t have to worry about cooking thinner portions of the food or overheating the meat. However, it can take a long time for food to thaw, especially larger meats like a turkey or a pork roast.


If you don’t have at least 24 hours to wait for the meat to defrost, choose a faster method.;
, Choose a large, sturdy plate that is big enough to hold all of the meat. The plate will prevent any moisture from falling from the thawing meat into your refrigerator.If the cut of meat is very large, such as a turkey or roast, place it on a large pan.


Leave on any plastic packaging. This will protect the meat from falling food or debris in your refrigerator.
 Place the plate of frozen meat in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. For larger cuts of meat, allow 24 hours for every 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) of meat.After the first 24 hours, check the meat periodically to see if it’s thawed.


Poke the meat through the plastic or turn it over to see whether or not it’s done thawing.
Wash your hands before and after touching the frozen meat to avoid food contamination.
 Since refrigerator defrosting is such a gentle method, you don’t need to cook the meat right away. Instead, you can refreeze it for later use or cook it at a later date. For example:


Poultry, fish, and ground meat can be kept in the refrigerator for an additional 1-2 days.
Beef, pork, lamb, or veal will keep for another 3-5 days in the refrigerator.

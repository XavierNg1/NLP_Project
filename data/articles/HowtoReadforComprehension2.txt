 Annotating is a way to keep your mind active as you read. Highlighting or underlining important words and phrases can help you to retain more of what you read and it will also make it easier to go back to find important passages later on. Make sure that you always read with a highlighter and pencil on hand.Underline or highlight things that are confusing, interesting, important, or that you want to ask questions about in class.
 Writing in the margins can help you to draw connections between concepts and register your reactions to the text.Keep a pen handy at all times and jot down your ideas and questions in the spaces next to the text.


You can write whatever you want in the margins. For example, you can sum up your reactions to passages by using words like, “interesting” or “confusing.”
You can also use sticky notes to expand on your annotations.This is a good option if you have a lot to say about what you have just read or if you cannot write in the text, such as because it is a library book or rental.
 After you finish annotating a text, go back over your annotations and read through them.As you do so, write any questions that you have about your annotations or anything that you’d like to bring up in class.For example, if you underlined something because it does not make sense, then you might turn it into a question, such as “How does annotating help you to retain more of what you read?” For simple questions, you can search for an answer to this question on your own. For more complex questions, you can ask your instructor to clarify for you.

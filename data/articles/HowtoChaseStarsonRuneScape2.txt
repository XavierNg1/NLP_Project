 Let's assume it says "3 to 12 minutes". Now, keep clicking the telescope until it the timer changes to "2 to 11", and then start your stopwatch. (Don't move the mouse down to "click here to continue", but keep it in the same spot and click again and again.) Now that the stopwatch is running, you know that the first possible landing is in two minutes exactly. Now prepare to race. Turn on run mode, adjust the camera angle and organize your inventory to make sure you hit the ground running.;
, If you don't see the star, and get a silly remark instead, the star has landed. Run! If the telescope says "0 to 9 minutes", relax for another minute. The star will not land until the stopwatch shows 3:00. This is why it's important to identify the exact time when the minutes flip over. Stars do not land in-between minutes, so if it hasn't landed this minute, it won't land until another 60 seconds have passed.
 If you get the same interval as last time, you've clicked too early. Click again. Fast! Note that the telescope timer is slightly slow, so that each minute is more like 60.5 seconds. You won't notice it for the first minutes, but after a while, the drift becomes significant. If you time a landing long in advance, the timer will have drifted so far that you have to restart the stopwatch when the landing gets close.
 This is useful if it takes you a while to get to the first landing spot. (But even a spot as remote as the northern desert clay mine only takes 1:30 minutes to reach.) If you decide to run, the stopwatch will be essential to knowing if the star has landed. Be aware, though, that it takes a few seconds for a star to land. A shadow will come in from the east as the star approaches. This animation starts *after*, and not before, the landing time. So wait for ten seconds or so before running to the next spot.

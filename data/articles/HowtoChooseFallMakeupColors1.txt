 Summer is all about airy, light coverage and a sun-kissed bronze. When fall arrives, it’s time to swap out the shimmery tan for soft, creamy skin and rosy cheeks. You can bring out your full coverage foundations that you skipped in the hot summer months, and use a beauty blender to apply it smoothly and evenly.

Opt for lighter colored concealers and foundations that you used in the summer, so that your skin looks natural in the less sunny weather.;
, As you wave goodbye to your summer tan, it’s important to add color to your face with a go-to blush. If you want to prolong a little bit of that summer spirit, opt for a peachy shade reminiscent of your summer color palette. To get into the fall and winter mode, choose a deeper shade of blush in a shade like mulberry, or a soft, rosy color.

 Just because you are putting your summer bronzer away doesn’t mean you have to lighten up completely. Invest in a contour palette for the fall to add dimension to your face. Sweep the darker across your cheek bones, along your temples, and along your jaw to accentuate your angles. Dot a bit of highlighter under your eyes and down your nose to complete the look.

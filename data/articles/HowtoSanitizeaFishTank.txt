 Depending on what the need for sanitizing is, you want to get the proper materials ready. This includes very hot water, a fish-safe cleaning product, gloves if necessary, and something to scrub with. Be sure everything is ready so you do not have to waste time looking for something. Make sure if you have any fish that lived in the tank, they are moved to an acceptable holding place, if any, while carrying out the sanitizing.;
, You can sanitize those if they are very important, but it's best to throw them away and get new ones. Sanitizing is about completely cleaning and killing all bacteria. Since bacteria can live in sponges, fake plants and decorations, adding them back in will simply re-contaminate.
 Since very hot water kills bacteria and other contaminates, you can use this to your advantage. Start by filling the tank with very hot water. Scrub if you wish.


Only use hot water for acrylic or glass tanks and bowls. Do not use with plastic bowls or the plastic will melt and it may release chemical constituents, such as BPA.,, Look for cleaning products that say "kills 99.9% of bacteria", but make sure it says that it is animal/fish safe or non-toxic. Otherwise, it will kill the fish once you put them back in or cause serious illnesses. Use this cleaner and get all of the inside treated, and scrub if necessary. Once finished, rinse very well.


Wear gloves if you don't wish to get cleaner or contaminants on your hands.
 This whole procedure is basically completely starting over with the tank.
 If you do, add clean, new sand/rocks, plants, and decorations. Once finished, add water and any pH balancing chemicals or modify the environment depending on what your fish's needs are.
 You're finished!


Make sure to clean the tank regularly if fish are kept.

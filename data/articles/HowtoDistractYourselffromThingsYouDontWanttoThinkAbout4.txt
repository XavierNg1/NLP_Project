 Exercise can calm feelings of anxiety and stress by releasing endorphins, natural mood-boosting chemicals that your body produces.Studies have shown that people just "feel better" after doing moderate aerobic exercise.So the next time you find yourself needing a distraction from something you don't want to think about, grab your sneakers and go for a run, or hit the gym to lift some weights.
 Do some gardening. Plant a tree, an edible garden or an ornamental patch of flowers. Gardening can deliver three advantages. First, being outside can increase positive feelings and reduce stress.Secondly, the physical exertion required for gardening can produce feel-good endorphins and help you fight obesity. Finally, if you plant herbs or foods you save yourself money and ensure that you are eating a healthy, balanced diet., Research suggests that merely taking a hot shower can help reduce anxiety.Simply being physically warm can help you feel more relaxed and even more oriented to social relationships.Focus on the sensations you experience in the shower or bath: the water on your skin, the warmth that surrounds you. Take deep breaths. Allow the experience to become a mindfulness exercise in noticing and relishing the pleasant sensations.


You may find that adding a few drops of lavender oil to your shower or bath also help you feel more positive and relaxed.

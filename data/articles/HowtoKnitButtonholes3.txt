 Donâ€™t make the buttonholes too large or too small for your buttons. Measure the buttons and try to make the buttonholes slightly smaller than the buttons.Try holding up the buttons against the buttonholes as you create them. This will help to ensure that you do not make them too large or too small.
 It is important to know where you want each buttonhole to be. Measure the area and place stitch markers so you will know where to place each buttonhole as you go.


You can also mark the placement spots with a small safety pin or paper clip.
 As you bind off, cast on, and knit over the areas with buttonholes, it is important to keep good tension. This will help to ensure that your buttonholes will be secure. Hold the yarn taut as you create the buttonholes to ensure that your buttonholes will be tight., If you do end up with buttonholes that are loose or too small, then you can use a knitting needle and some extra yarn to reinforce the buttonhole. Using a "yarn needle" and the same yarn that you are using to knit your item, stitch around the edges of the buttonhole, using the same "buttonhole stitch" that is used when sewing on fabric. This will reinforce the buttonhole. Or if your buttonhole is too long, stitch across one or both of the ends to make the buttonhole shorter.

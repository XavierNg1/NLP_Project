 To transpose from C to Eb, you're transposing the music up a Major 6th, or down a minor 3rd. You will have to adjust the key signature (add three sharps), notes, and accidentals accordingly.;
, Again, you'll be transposing down a minor third, which you can probably figure out mentally if you've done this before, but for handy reference, you can refer to the chart below. To use it, you'll first have to identify the major key of the piece in C that you are transposing.
 If you can figure it out on your own from here, great, or you may have used a program that automatically changes the notes with the key signature. However, if you're doing this by hand, here's another handy reference chart.
 If you're transposing for a very high-sounding Eb instrument, and all the notes you ended up with are below the staff, move them up into the playable range for the target instrument.
 While writing by hand is an okay method, there are many computer programs that can make this easier, such as FinaleNotepad.

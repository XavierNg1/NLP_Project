 Before you can make any kind of vegan yogurt, you must make vegan milk. Almond milk is made from almonds and water.


Blend 1 cup (0.237 L) almonds and 2 1/2 cups (0.59 L) water in a food processor.
Strain the almond milk mixture to remove unblended parts of the nuts from the liquid. You can use cheesecloth, a tea ball, or a nut milk bag available from specialty foods stores for this step.;
, Because culture starter products are different, you'll need to check the package directions to determine the exact amount of culture starter to add to the almond milk. Many culture starter products recommend preparing the culture starter and almond milk mix when the almond milk is at room temperature. If necessary, you can warm the yogurt on a low setting on the stove.
 Whether or not you use a yogurt maker, the fermentation process usually takes about 8 hours.


An automatic yogurt maker will alert you when the fermentation process is complete.
If you do not have a yogurt maker, you can put the almond mixture into a Dutch oven and place it in an oven on the warm setting for 4 to 6 hours, place it into an insulated thermos for 8 hours (transfer the mixture to a clean container for cooling in the next step), or place it into a sealed crock pot that you have warmed but unplugged for 8 hours.
 This will make the almond yogurt taste fresher when you strain it.
, For yogurt the consistency of store-bought yogurt, wait about 1 hour. For thicker yogurt, wait longer.

 Start writing down everything that you eat and drink to determine what foods give you heartburn. Make a note in your food diary any time that eating or drinking something gives you heartburn. Over time you will begin to see patterns and learn what foods you should avoid.


For example, you may notice that you tend to get heartburn about an hour after your morning cup of coffee each day. You may then decide to switch to tea or a latte.
 Some foods have a reputation for causing heartburn, so it is best to avoid these foods or at least limit them as much as possible. These foods include:Citrus fruit
Caffeinated beverages
Chocolate
Tomatoes
Garlic
Onions
Alcohol
Fatty foods
Spicy foods

, Eating large meals can cause heartburn as well, so try to stick to small frequent meals instead. For example, instead of eating three big meals per day, eat six small meals spread throughout the day., You may be able to get rid of heartburn by drinking an apple cider vinegar solution. Apple cider vinegar decreases the secretion of stomach acid because it essentially "fools" the stomach into thinking that the acid has already been secreted. The stomach believes it has already done its job and the acid secretion is reduced. Mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with six ounces of water and drink the solution., Chewing a stick of gum after a meal has been shown to reduce heartburn symptoms. You can chew a stick of regular gum or look for a specially formulated heartburn gum called GutsyGum. This brand of gum was shown to have more drastic effects on heartburn than regular chewing gum, but regular chewing gum will help as well.

 Don't throw him into the shark tank, don't lock him up, don't gloat, don't push him down the shaft of eternal fire. Just shoot him in the head, then shoot him again to make sure.
 You can guarantee that somebody will have found a way to escape. If you absolutely must build a dungeon for locking people up, make sure it follows these guidelines:


Don't put in a window. The prisoner can't crawl away out of the window if there is no window.
Make sure all of the walls are as thick as possible. This stops prisoners from scratching away the mortar, pulling away the stones and making a hole in the wall.
Keep the cell keys in a locked box, out of reach of any stick, belt, shoelace or cunningly trained pet.
 This makes it easy for the good guy to disguise himself. At the very least, you need to be able to see the faces of all of your henchmen (I recommend plexiglass visors). Custom-tailored clothes are also helpful, as the poor fit will give the hero away.
 The button labeled with the word abort should do something else, like electrocute whoever pushes it. The actual abort button should be labeled with something inane, such as "make coffee" or "recline chair".
 That way, if the good guy cuts the power or detonates an EMP, everything keeps working.
 The computer should contain useless (e.g. funny cat pictures) or harmful (e.g. a virus) items, so the good guy can't download your evil plans. The plans should be written on flash paper (paper that has been converted to nitrocellulose) that will burn up almost instantly.
 Usually this means putting a mixture of men and women on guard at the same time, or hiring eunuchs.
 The rank "most trusted henchman" should only ever be awarded posthumously.
 Don't hang about, you can always come back if your henchmen defeat him.
, This stops the good guy from using the old "count the bullets" trick.
 Henchmen will either pass target practise or be used for target practise.

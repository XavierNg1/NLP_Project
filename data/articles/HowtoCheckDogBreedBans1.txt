 Some sites on the internet pull the laws for an area altogether in one place. Then you can look up your city and state, for instance, to see if your area has a dog ban on certain breeds. Keep in mind, though, that these sites aren't always up-to-date, so it's best to check them against your local government's websites., Some U.S. states have state-wide bans on certain breeds, so begin by checking the laws on your state government's website. However, you can't stop there, as some laws are enacted on the county or city level, so check on those websites, as well, for breed-specific bans.If you don't want to use the internet, you can call your local offices.
 Animal control is generally responsible for picking up animals in your area. As such, they are usually up-to-date on what breeds are banned because they are tasked with picking them up. Find the number to your local animal control online and call them for more information.
 If you can't find the information online, your local animal shelter will often know the laws in the area, and you can ask them which breeds are banned in your city. Similarly, local vets will usually have this information as well.

 If you live in a dry, desert region, such as the American Southwest, then your dog could get a fungal infection call Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever. This infection is dirt borne and it when it enters the lungs it can cause dogs to cough, lose their appetite, lose energy, have diarrhea, and get a fever.Dogs that dig in the dirt can be especially prone to this illness, as they have more chance of contact with the fungus.Not all dogs that are exposed to this fungus develop symptoms or the illness. Dogs with strong immune systems can oftentimes fight off the infection before it takes hold.
 If you suspect that your dog has Valley Fever, then you should contact your veterinarian and describe the symptoms and when they started. Your veterinarian will then suggest whether or not they think the dog should be brought in to be assessed.


If your dog is brought in for assessment, the veterinarian will test the dog's blood for antibodies to Valley Fever, which is called a "titer test.", If your dog is found to have Valley Fever, then it will need to undergo treatment with antifungal medications. This treatment takes a long time, up to a year if the infection has taken hold in the lungs, and perhaps for its lifetime if the infection is in the dog's nervous system.This treatment can have adverse side effects, including vomiting and damage to the liver. Because of this, the dog will need to be monitored regularly by its veterinarian.

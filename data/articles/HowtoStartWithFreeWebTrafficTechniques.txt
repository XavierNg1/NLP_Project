, In some cases, if you are using Wordpress or Drupal, both systems are setup so that you are search engine friendly. It is best to also optimize all the other pages included in your website so that search engines will also "crawl" your other internal website pages.
,, Wordpress is amazing and new plugins can be added. For example, one plugin that is fairly useful and also a must is the All In One SEO Pack.
 Write a blog weekly or daily on topics related to your product. Give useful information to your readers. Once you use keywords that people are searching for people will definitely find you.
 An example would be my Facebook page for www.donteatnuts.com. Facebook has been quite efficient and has driven some traffic to my website. Every time you post a new blog or have something interesting to share, then post it in the status of your Facebook Page and be sure to link back to your site!

, Twitter is also very popular in ranking and by creating a community or followers on Twitter, it's instant free traffic.
 If your website or product is unique, you will definitely have people talking, this leading to free organic traffic.
 It may seem that there is no use for you since the layout of your website is clear, however, Google for instance, loves sitemaps. Sitemaps are intended solely for the search engines. Wordpress has the Google Sitemap Plugin as well, another great suggestion that you should install into your blog.
 One good website is called Entrecard. This website has generated some interesting results and has improved the Alexa page rank as well.
 Submit your website once. If you become high ranked in Google then you're all set, the other search engines will follow.

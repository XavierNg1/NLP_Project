 Follow the order of the arrows in the photo. However, do not slide it all the way down, otherwise you may break the plastic tabs. (In the photo, plastic tab #1 is already broken off, but it does not affect the multifunction switchâ€™s functionality). Reattach the 3 wiring harnesses.
 Take a small straight screwdriver and gently push in the horn-ring contact pin while working the whole unit down. You will know the multifunction switch is properly seated when it is flush with the steering column and the spring-loaded horn-ring contact pin makes contact with the metal face, NOT the edge, of the horn ring.


If you fail to do this, the brass horn ring can be damaged and the horn may go off whenever the steering wheel is moved, or the driver's horn switch will not work at all.

 You will need 8 medium size binder clips (1 and a quarter inches wide) and 4 rubber bands. That's it.;
, Take the 8 clips and pull the metal handles back, so they rest on the black metal clip (as shown). Now on their sides, arrange them into a circle. The shape will look more like a flower, and may not be a 'perfect' circle, but get as close to it as you can.
 With your flower-looking shape laid-out and ready, take two rubber bands and stretch them out between four fingers, as shown, larger than the circumference of the clips. This will allow you to drop them down over the clips in one smooth motion, so it contacts all the clips at once - otherwise your shape will not stay intact. After applying the first pair of rubber bands, carefully flip it and apply a second pair. If you need to reshape the "flower", poke a finger or a sharpie in the center of the clips.
 You can keep the color the same for a sleek minimalist look or use different colors to create something more eye-catching.
 Time for the creative fun! Placing them in between the handles of silvery metal, add photos, postcards, notes -- whatever you'd like.
 Place this amazing pen and photo holder someplace where fellow coworkers can pass by and compliment you on your skills. Oh, and if anyone asks, well, the clips aren't leaving the office, are they?

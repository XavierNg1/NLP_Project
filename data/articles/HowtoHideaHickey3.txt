 Do this gently and lightly to increase the circulation around the area. If you press too hard, you could make the hickey worse.Use a brand-new toothbrush.
 The redness and swelling will spread, but it will tone down if you wait.
 Leave it there for another 15-20 minutes.
 If you see that your hickey is less noticeable, try the method again. If you see that you've made it worse by brushing too hard, then keep icing it and wait for it to go away.

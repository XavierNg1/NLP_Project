 For example, "crocodile" and "rocket" can be combined to make the word "BettyCrocker." Try to match words with the same beginning syllables to words that have similar endings. Another good method is to take a word that you like, such as "laser" or "turbo" and use it to describe another word, such as "laserboulder" or "turbocandy." The word you are describing can be quite random.


You may want to capitalize the first letter of each word instead of an underscore to indicate a separation. "LaserBoulder" or "TurboCandy".
 Avoid abstract numbers or birth years, as these are rather common and may take away from the originality of your address. Again, however, you might consider using more "generic" style elements if you plan to eventually use this email for professional purposes.


"james.madison.98@example.com" or "joeksmith@example.com" are examples of "generic" email addresses. On the other hand, they are simple and straightforward. It all comes down to what you think is "cool".
"AKDJFIADJF@example.com" or "shabalaba810@example.com" are instances of "random" addresses. They might be cool, but they won't say much about you.
 If you find something that you get attached to, but it's already taken, think about throwing in some periods or numbers. These can be meaningful or random, to your taste. For instance:


dragon.finding.warrior@example.com
redinkedbooks2015@example.com
chocolate.adventures5@example.com

, This can be a great way to make your email address more unique, and it may help you keep the core of your idea if someone else has already reserved the address that you want. Make sure the misspelled word still looks or sounds similar to the correct word; it should be recognizable, even if it isn't exact. Try replacing S with Z, or a "ks" sound with an X.


"lovinpandaz@example.com" and "pizzas.and.pizzazz@example.com" play with the "S" and "Z" sound.
"the.sox.rox@example.com" and "madd.haxx@example.com" both replace the "ks" sound with an "x".

 Many crank-operated drum tumblers are situated higher off the ground. These tumblers cost more than some other tumblers but have a crank handle and baffles inside to mix and aerate the compost.


To empty crank-operated drum tumblers simply situate a wheelbarrow underneath and turn the drum so the door is above the wheelbarrow. Open the door of the tumbler to let the compost empty into the wheelbarrow.

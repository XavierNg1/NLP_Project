 This button will be at the bottom of your recent notifications and above the "FRIEND REQUESTS" and "PEOPLE YOU MAY KNOW" sections.
 Every time you're tagged you in a comment, you get a new notification saying a user "mentioned you in a comment."


Notifications will not disappear from this list unless you Hide a notification.

 Atoms are made up of protons (positively charged particles), neutrons (particles with no charge), and electrons (negatively charged particles). Protons and neutrons make up the mass of the atom and rest at the center of the atom. Electrons are so small that their mass is negligible, and they orbit around the center of the atom., Electrons do not orbit the nucleus randomly. Instead, they remain in orbitals that reside at specific distances from the nucleus (this distance varies by atom). Orbitals closer to the nucleus are considered low orbitals and those further away are high orbitals. The more energy an electron has, the higher orbital state it will occupy.Electrons are most stable in the lowest possible energy state.
 When conceptualizing the electron cloud (the space in which electrons can be found), many people naturally envision a sphere around the nucleus. While some orbitals are spherical (s orbitals), others are shaped like dumbbells with the nucleus in the center (p orbitals). These different shapes are important to the concept of valence bonds, and must be taken into account when you analyze the bonds between two atoms.There are also d orbitals and f orbitals that have more complex geometry.

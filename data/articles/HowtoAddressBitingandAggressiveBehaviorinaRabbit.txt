 It is important to get a pet rabbit spayed or neutered at around the age of four months, when its hormones start to kick in and cause it to behave differently.Getting the rabbit spayed or neutered will help to allay the hormonal reasons behind biting or aggressive behavior in a rabbit, as nipping behavior is often a sign of sexual frustration in rabbits.Rabbits can breed at any time of the year and the act of mating triggers ovulation, hence rabbits are primed to find a mate from the time nature deems them ready to breed.


Talk to your vet about any concerns you may have at this stage concerning the rabbit's biting or aggressive behavior.
Have the vet check the overall health of the rabbit. Biting can be a sign of pain that needs to be treated, such as teeth or gum problems.;
, It is possible that something is frightening the rabbit and causing it to bite or be aggressive as a result.Some things to consider include:


Is the rabbit housed where it can see or be seen by animals that might normally prey on it, such as birds or dogs? If so, move the cage or add covers.
Is the rabbit reacting when you try to remove toys, bedding, water and food bowls, etc., from the cage? If so, the rabbit may be responding in a territorial way and you'll need to remove the rabbit first, then clean the cage.Is the rabbit in a foreign cage all of a sudden? Rabbits are used to the familiarity of their known home space. In the wild, they use their whiskers to check that they've entered the right burrow and if not, they panic.If you need to transfer your rabbit to a new cage, it is a good idea to gradually introduce the cage by keeping it alongside the existing one, letting the rabbit out to explore the new cage and then considering moving the rabbit into the new space.
 It is important to feed the rabbit regularly and on time. A hungry rabbit may bite out of hunger.
 Rabbits have a keen sense of smell. If you have been handling another rabbit that your rabbit is unfamiliar with, even if you've washed your hands, it might be possible that the rabbit can smell this odor and is displeased.In this case, the biting might be triggered out of fear of the other rabbit.
 Whenever the rabbit bites you, make a loud "eeeep" noise, imitating the hurt noise a rabbit makes.Then say "No bite!" or something similar every time it happens, to reinforce this as a command to stop the behavior.Do not physically discipline a rabbit. It is cruel and pointless, and will only make the rabbit more likely to bite you, out of fear.
Create a noisemaker, such as beans in a can, to shake whenever you're about the issue the "no bite!" command.Remain consistent; do the same stopping process every time the rabbit bites, including small nips, as any bite is an unacceptable bite.
 Praise and love the rabbit next, to reinforce the non-biting behavior., Keep your hand flat with the palm facing downward and your fingers spread widely.When petting the rabbit, lower the hand from above the head and pat gently. Do not place fingers or hands in front of the rabbit's face. Use a reassuring voice.
 In some cases, the rabbit may want to socialize more often with you (again, out of boredom), and the biting may be a sign of frustration or demanding this attention., Providing adequate enrichment for your rabbit companion is vital to relieving boredom and keeping the rabbit in a happier frame of mind.


Provide plenty of toys for the rabbit to play with.
Give the rabbit toys with food inside that the rabbit has to work at getting out.
Find objects that require the rabbit to do something constructive with.
 Rabbits can perceive a hand in front of their face as a threat, both because rabbits are near-sighted around the nose area and because they expect a dominant rabbit to threaten them by coming up close to their face.As such, it is advisable to stroke a rabbit from above and avoid all parts of the face except for its forehead.Rabbits do have good eyesight but it's focused on covering the field rather than as we see (stereoscopically), and this is for the reason of being a prey animal., Rabbits are easily spooked, and when this happens, they can use their strength, teeth and claws to injure you.Mishandling can also injure the rabbit's spinal cord or induce a heart attack in the rabbit.Things to keep in mind when holding a rabbit include:


Do not ever pick a rabbit up by its ears.
Put one hand under the rabbit's chest, hold each foreleg separately between your thumb and forefingers. Use your other hand to take the weight under the rabbit's rump.Rather than continuing to hold a rabbit, place it on a solid, non-slip surface for stroking it, but keep it restrained by your hands.If the rabbit is nervous or flighty, you can take its scruff in one hand and support its rump with your other hand while moving slowly and handling the rabbit gently.Realize that a rabbit familiar with you may not appreciate you handling it by the scruff.
At all times, speak calmly and reassuringly. Do not yell, sound afraid or emit high-pitched sounds yourself.

, First, start any DIY spa treatment with squeaky clean skin. Use a gentle cleanser, not soap, with warm water. Cleansers with a soy base are less irritating to the skin. You may want to combine equal parts of rosewater and coconut milk in a small, clean jar. Shake gently and then drizzle into running bathwater. Soak for the desired amount of time and then drain. You may need to add some cleanser to the tub to remove any film left behind from the coconut milk.
 It is as simple as heating up water in a large bowl in the microwave or on the stove, draping a towel over your head, and letting your skin absorb the steam for 5 minutes. For a rejuvenating steam, add green tea and some herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, or mint to the water. Facial steamers will open up the pores, providing a deep cleansing by steaming out embedded dirt, as well as hydrating the skin.
 Use a stimulating toner rich in emollients and antioxidants.
 Once a week, give yourself a skin-enriching treatment with a moisturizing and hydrating facial mask. There are several OTC options, or you can make your own mask using common ingredients such as avocado, banana, or aloe mixed with freshly squeezed citrus juice and a drizzle of olive or nut oil.
 Do this once a week with an OTC product that contains an alpha hydroxyl acid (AHA) or beta hydroxyl acid (BHA). You can also easily make your own. Mix 30 drops of ascorbic acid, a few crushed plain aspirin, and one-half packet of unflavored gelatin into one stiffly whipped egg white.
 Doing this once or twice a week will get rid of dead skin cells and stimulate cell renewal. There are several types of microdermabrasion products to chose from, all being effective. Use an OTC microdermabrasion scrub, a microdermabrasion cloth, or a handheld microdermabrasion scrubbing wand. Studies suggest that 5 to 6 home microdermabrasion treatments are equivalent to one professional spa microdermabrasion treatment!, There are several different home facial laser devices to choose from, including the ever-popular derma wand and the oxylight. The Baby Quasar or â€ Baby Qâ€ is the newest facial laser to be introduced on the market, and it has been quite a hit. (It was originally designed to be sold as a professional spa photo rejuvenation treatment but was recently released to be sold to the home consumer.) The current correlation is that 3 to 4 home facial laser treatments are equal to the results achieved from one professional IPL treatment.
 A simple facial wrap can be achieved by either using an OTC product or by soaking nori seaweed in warm vitamin water until soft and applying it to the skin for 15 minutes.
 Mix brown sugar and honey (equal parts) in a bowl.


Wash your face using a mild cleanser, rinse it off, and then apply the scrub to your face. Using clean fingertips, gently rub the scrub into your face in a circular motion.
Don’t scrub too roughly as it could scratch your skin.
Rinse well and pat dry with a clean towel.
 Mix raw sugar with non-petroleum-based jelly. Consider adding 2 parts jelly to 1 part sugar at first in the event your lips are very sensitive. Rub scrub over lips and allow to set. Rinse well and then apply a soothing lip balm.
 Apply with a clean washcloth to clean face and gently pat. Don’t rub, as this will only encourage redness. Rinse well and pat dry.
 After completing a DIY spa treatment with an emollient-rich moisturizer, find moisturizers with Hyaluronic acid, retinol, DMAE, and alpha lipoic acid.


Also, for a more natural moisturizer, you may want to moisturize your skin by mixing honey and olive oil. Combine equal parts of each ingredient and apply after a hot shower. Smooth a small amount over the skin and allow it to soak in. For extremely dry skin, add a few coats until you find relief.
 Last, but not least, always use sunscreen to protect your skin from sun damaging UV radiation, or all your efforts on DIY spa treatments will simply be undone by overexposure to the sun.

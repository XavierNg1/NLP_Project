 Make sure to secure all medications in a medicine cabinet or high cupboard. This should include anything from prescription pills to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs. Even a small dose of medication could cause symptoms such as vomiting, seizures, stomach and intestinal ulcers, kidney failure, or cardiac distress. To prevent any accidents (e.g. your dog jumping to eat a pill you drop on the ground before you can stop it), take your medications when your dog is out of the room and be sure to close pill containers firmly after use.;
, Household products with harsh chemicals should be kept as far as possible from your dog, preferably in a room it does not frequently enter (e.g. the garage or laundry room). Make sure that these products are placed in a closed closet or cupboard, and that they are firmly sealed so that they do not leak or spread. Products to be especially vigilant about are:Paint thinner
Anti-freeze
Bleach and other cleaners
Pool chemicals
Fertilizers

, Keep pest-control products like rat poison and insecticide away from your dog, as both can be toxic to it. If possible, avoid using these products inside your home. Instead, opt to use glue traps in areas that your dog canâ€™t reach, or other methods such as live traps.If you do use pest-control poisons, place them only in rooms closed off to your dog (e.g. by means of a baby gate or locked door) and store them securely with other harmful household chemicals.

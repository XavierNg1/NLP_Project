 Or create the card shape and size using the heavy cardstock. You only want to use heavy cardstock because even though the buttons are lightweight, they will add some weight to the card--only heavy material can support them. Also, when using hot glue you will need strong material in order to avoid having bleed through the card.;
, Instead of just gluing buttons on the card, go into the design with a plan. Consider the overall message (such as “Happy Birthday”) and card size. Also, determine if you plan to create an abstract design or something more traditional, like a birthday cake or balloons.


Sketch the design directly on the card using pencil. Make light sketch marks to use as your guide. You can erase any remaining marks after the card has been completed.






Map out where the buttons will be placed. Obtain a general idea of button placement by laying them along the sketch without gluing them in place. This way you can see what your design might look like without making a commitment.
 Use the paint pens or markers before adding the buttons. The buttons will enhance the design so include your message and base design first.


Allow paint or marker to dry on the card before adding the buttons.






Place a small dab of hot glue on the back of the button before applying it to the card. Add glue for each button immediately before it is placed.
 You may want to let the card rest overnight to ensure the glue and marker/paint is completely dry.

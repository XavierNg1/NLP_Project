 One of the hardest parts of the MRI for some kids is holding still. You can help prepare them by brainstorming ways to hold still together.You might try singing songs, telling stories, counting, or imagining they are visiting their favorite place.
You might even practice these at home, and work up to staying still for the full length of their MRI.
Most MRIs last 30-45 minutes, but they can be as short as 15 minutes and as long as 90.
 Children are usually allowed to bring comfort objects, such as blankets or stuffed animals, as long as they do not contain metal. Help your child select the blanket and/or animal they would like to bring. The room is sometimes cold, and these items help keep them calm and cozy as the MRI works., Some children will be able to listen to music and/or watch a movie during their MRI. Ask your doctor if this is a possibility for your child. If it is, help your child select a calming CD or a favorite movie. You may also want to bring your own headphones from home though they must be approved by the technician.

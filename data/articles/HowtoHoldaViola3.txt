 Maintain balance by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Make sure your stance is firm, straight, and upright. Try swaying forwards and backwards to keep your weight centered.
 Keep your back straight. Your sitting viola hold should be similar to your standing hold. Relax your knees. Be firm, but not stiff.
 If it will make you more comfortable, don’t be afraid to use a chair with a firm surface. Stay close to the chair’s edge.Do not sit on a couch, you may end up slumping back in it., Your arms should not stay too close to the rest of your body. If they stay too close, they will hinder your amount of movement.

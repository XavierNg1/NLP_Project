 Moving your body is great fun. But some kids don’t see it that way. If your child’s fitness tracker makes it fun for your child to engage in physical activity, they will be more likely to do so. Choose a fitness tracker that offers new games or unlockable digital prizes when your child meets their fitness requirements., Many fitness trackers can also be used as watches. With a clock feature, your child will be better able to keep track of the time, as well as their fitness and activity levels., Some fitness trackers specially designed for kids offer games that help them learn. Children love opportunities to learn on the go.For example, the Garmin Vivofit Jr. app – used in conjunction with the Garmin Vivofit Jr. fitness tracker – teaches kids interesting facts about and images of animals as they move closer to their fitness goal.
Other trackers like the Jewelbot offer opportunities to learn basic programming skills by entering simple code into the fitness tracker’s system.

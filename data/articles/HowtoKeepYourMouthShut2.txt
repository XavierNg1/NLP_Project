, If you are trying to start a good conversation at dinner, ask open-ended questions and then back off. The desire to jump in too quickly can prevent people from thinking about the question and expressing themselves.

You will instantly become a more positive person., Stop talking and start journaling. If your conversations with your partner or children have been frustrating lately, you can work out your thoughts on paper before you say them.

 Exposing the wine to air before serving is one of the primary purposes of a decanter. A wide neck decanter will give your wine ideal exposure and bring out more flavors within your wine. Because you'll be able to taste more, wide neck decanters are great for making young wines taste complex.Wide neck decanters are also better for cheap wines, as aeration will make the wine taste richer.
Generally, wide neck decanters are easier to clean.;
, Because a narrow neck lets less air in, thin neck decanters are not as good at aerating wine. They are, however, much better at sifting out sediment. For expensive, aged wines, thin neck decanters offer a cleaner flavor.Thin necked decanters often come with a special brush for cleaning.
 Decanters in odd shapes can make it challenging to pour without dripping. You don't want to stain any counters or waste expensive wine. Decanters with mouths wider than their neck will make for mess-free pouring., Decanters with wide middles give the wines room to aerate before serving. After a wine has been stored in a bottle for several years, it takes time to aerate. In decanters with a narrow surface area, the wine will take much longer to react with air and bring out its flavors.Decanters with the most surface area in the middle will need around an hour to achieve its ideal aroma and taste.
To speed up the decanting process, swirl the wine around so it receives more air.

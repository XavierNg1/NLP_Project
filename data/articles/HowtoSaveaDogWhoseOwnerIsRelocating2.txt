 If you are not able to give the dog a home but you do not want the dog to end up homeless, you can contact your local dog shelter or rescue group. Call them directly and ask them if they would take in the dog and register the dog for adoption.You can find dog shelters and rescue groups in your area by searching online or by calling your local Humane Society.
Look for dog shelters that have a no-kill policy, as this will ensure the shelter will not put the dog down if a home cannot be found within a certain time limit.
Be aware that surrendering the dog to a pound means the dog’s chances of finding a new home are very limited. Most pounds are only legally required to hold a pet for 72 hours and then the pet may be put down.
 You will need to provide basic information about the dog to the shelter, such as the dog’s breed, age, gender, and given name. You may also need to tell the shelter about the dog’s training and any behavioral problems it may have. Speak to the dog’s current owner to get this information.


Keep in mind the shelter may ask you to keep the dog with you for a few days while they try to find a placement for it. Many shelters have a waitlist for rehoming dogs so you may need to wait a few days for a response.
 Once the dog is accepted at the shelter, they may be kept there until they are rehomed. You may call the shelter or rescue group and ask about the dog to determine if it is healthy and well cared for. This may also be a good way to keep tabs on where the dog is at in terms of being up for adoption or being fostered by a temporary owner.


You may also help the shelter with rehoming the dog by advertising the dog on social media and online. You may also consider fostering the dog until a permanent home can be found for the pet.

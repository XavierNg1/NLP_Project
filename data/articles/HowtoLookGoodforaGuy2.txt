 It may seem obvious to you that you want to talk to him, but it may not be obvious to him. There are three easy signals you can use to show you are interested. The eyebrow flash is a signal that says that you are friendly and approachable. Tilting your head to one side is another way to show interest while he is talking to you.
Finally, smile at him and make eye contact! When you smile at guys they will usually smile back at you. Smiling makes people feel good, because smiling releases endorphins. , Be engaged in what he is saying by nodding along and making eye contact. Ask questions that show that you care about what he is talking about.


Be careful not to accidently disrupt the conversation and talk about yourself. Stick to asking him questions about himself while he is talking. Later, when he asks about you, feel free to relate to what he was talking about or talk about yourself.
Use your body language to show your interest. Nod your head, and be expressive with your facial expressions.
If he tells you about something that is difficult that he is experiencing, be empathetic. Speak with concern and show him sympathy.
Remember what he says, and when you see him again, ask him about how things are going.
 Later, you can send them a text or call them. The text or call can be simple. If the guy is interested, it will go somewhere. If he isn't, that is no big deal. It happens to everyone at some point. Be confident, move on, and keep talking to other guys.


Make sure to pay attention to how he responds to your texts or calls. If he doesn’t respond much, don’t keep texting. Let him text you.
If the texting goes on for a sustained about of time, consider asking him to get together and do something.

 Open any web browser and go to Yahoo Messenger’s download page. Click on the “Download Now” button at the top of the page, and the setup file will download to your computer.
 Follow the on-screen instructions. Tick on the checkbox for “Launch Yahoo Messenger” on the last screen upon successful installation.
 An IM program will load on your screen. The default color of its user interface is purple.
 Enter your Yahoo ID and password into the fields provided, and click on “Sign In” button.
 Click on your name on the header of the IM window, right beside your avatar or picture. This will bring up a drop-down list. Select from “Available,” “Busy,” or “Invisible.”


If you want to log in and have your friends know you’re available to chat and talk, click on “Available.” Your friends will know your status by the yellow dot in front of your name.
If you want to log in, but do not necessarily want to be disturbed, click on “Busy.” Your friends will see you online, but they will know you’re busy by the red dot in front of your name.
If you want to log in, but would like to hide from your friends, click on “Invisible.” Your friends will not know you’re online. You can pick and choose which friends you want to talk to, without risking others knowing you’re online. Your name will appear as if you’re offline, with the gray dot in front of it.
 You can now start sending messages to your friends and chatting with them. Double-click on the name of your friend from your contact list on the left panel, and type in your message in the chat box that appears on the right panel.

 You need some time to study, get help from teachers, make new friends, and just relax. It’s better to be moderately busy every day, than to have one or two days where you’re overwhelmed with classes.


This may mean deliberately leaving a class period empty, so you can have a long lunch. You could also get your classes out of the way in the morning, and give yourself the afternoon to unwind.
 This will give you an outlet during your week, and give you time to socialize and make new friends. During college, it can be easy to waste time, so it will help if you commit to a weekly social activity. This could include:


Going to a ball game or sports event.
Taking dancing lessons with your friends or partner.
Get a group of friends to see a movie on the same night every week.
 More and more students are working to help put themselves through college. If you’re working, your job will be an important part of your life, and may take up substantial time during your week. Try to find out your work schedule as early as possible, and schedule your classes around your work.Work with your supervisor. Let him or her know that you’re attending college as well as working, and ask if they can adjust your work schedule to accommodate your academic schedule.
If you’re looking for work, consider finding a job on campus. Check with your college’s Human Resources department, or check into Student Employment opportunities in your department.

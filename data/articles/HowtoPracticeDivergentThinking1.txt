 Divergent thinking is a form of creative thinking, so it examines a problem using more of an out-of-the-box mindset. Instead of settling for a status-quo answer or no answer at all, you can try to solve the question by asking "what if I tried it this way?" It is a thought process used to generate creative ideasby exploring many possibilities. Instead of taking obvious steps and walking along a straight line, one looks at different aspects of the situation, creating different results. Divergent thinking encourages seeking and considering new and different methods, new and different opportunities, new and different ideas, and/or new and different solutions.;
, Whereas the left side of our brain is rational, analytical, and controlling, our right hemisphere is where we acquire our creativity, intuition, and emotional expression. It plays a key role in divergent thinking and the creative problem solving that depends on it. Divergent thinking is spontaneous, free-flowing, non-linear manner. It uses lateral , nontraditional, and unconventional thinking.
 Creative thinking is needed to solve problems; however, we don't really get to use it in the classroom. Instead, linear convergent thinking is required with multiple choice tests as a great example. This is not how a divergent thinking solves problem because it's associated with four main characteristics:Fluency – the ability to generate numerous ideas or solutions quickly;
Flexibility – the ability to think about different ways to solve a problem at the same time;
Originality – the ability to generate ideas that most people don't consider;
Elaboration – the ability to not only think through the fine points of an idea but to carry it out as well.

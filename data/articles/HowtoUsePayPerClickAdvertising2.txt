 Some of the most popular programs include Google AdWords, Microsoft AdCenter and Facebook Ads. These are good places to start because they are user friendly programs that do not take very long to set up.
 Whether on social media sites or search engine PPC programs, search keywords are the factor that determines who sees your ad. Choose specific, high-value keywords that cater to searchers who want to buy, not simply look.


Consider buying your brand name as a keyword. This is especially important if your website does not appear high on the top of the search results when you look for your company or brand name.
 Choose geographic areas and peak times, options that are now being offered by many search engines for sponsored listings. Facebook also lets you narrow down where your ad appears by gender, relationship status and group.


Look into different PPC formats. For example, this type of ad commonly shows up to the top, right or bottom of search listings in link form. However, banner ads that use graphics and headlines have been shown to be more successful, in general, than text-based ads.
 PPC ads can be very easy to create on Google and Facebook; however, the headlines, text and images determine whether they comprise an attractive ad for the consumer. Hire a graphic designer to design banner ads and use words like "sale," "discount," or "exclusive" to encourage people to click.
 Most PPC ads allow you to bid for the amount you pay per click. Remember that small businesses are likely to be easily outbid by big corporations for popular search terms, so choose your keywords carefully.

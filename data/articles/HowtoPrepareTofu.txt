 While mass-produced tofu is now available at many supermarkets and grocery stores, it's even better to find your local Asian grocery and buy it fresh there. Packaged tofu will have traveled many miles to reach its destination, and might contain preservatives that reduce both the flavor and nutritional value. In general, the fresher, the better.

, Firm tofu is often a bit gritty and is most commonly used in stir fries, or other dishes that cause "rough handling". Silken tofu has a much finer, creamier texture but needs to be handled somewhat delicately; it is best used as tofu steaks or for mixing in desserts.
 If you are using water-packed tofu, you want to get the water out. This is done easily by pressing the entire block or cutting into slices. All you need is something absorbent (paper towel or clean lint-free kitchen towel) and some weight. Place tofu in between towel, put a plate on top, and use a soup can. All you are doing is gently pressing the water out.
, Tofu can be pan-sauteed, fried, toasted, grilled, etc, until it is firm enough that the skin offers a decent amount of resistance when poked with a spatula or a fork.
 A traditional Asian option would be to mix soy sauce with sesame oil. You can also toss in a bit of minced garlic, if you think your taste buds can handle it. A nice, finishing touch is to toast some sesame seeds to sprinkle on top of the sauce right before the tofu is served.

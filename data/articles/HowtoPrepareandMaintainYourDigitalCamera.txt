Even if you do not use your camera, remember to charge your batteries at least once a week.
You may also have an extra charged battery ready to use so you do not worry about running out of battery power while working with your camera.
Some cameras have built-in memory, so you can use that memory to save photos. But other cameras do not, so you have to purchase a memory card before starting to use the camera.;
, (Some cameras do not have that option, so you can only format your memory card using a computer).

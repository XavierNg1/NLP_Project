 Download the free software here: http://decibel.ni.com/content/blogs/Simon/2010/06/16/world-cup-2010--filtering-the-annoying-vuvuzela-noise. There is a Windows and a Mac version available, choose whichever one suits your needs.
 If you don't have the Lab View Run-Time engine, you'll need to install this also (it's free).



If the TV has an audio output, connect the sound card line in to this outlet. Connect the sound card's output to your usual listening devices (such as speakers or headphones).
 If still needed, adjust the frequency on your computer. How much and whether you need to adjust will depend on the speed of your computer.

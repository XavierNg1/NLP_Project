 You’ve seen him at the coffee shop or gym a few times. You’ve exchanged a smile here and there, but that’s about it. Now, he asks for your number. If you aren’t interested, you’ll need to let him know.


You can say, “I’d like to get to know you more as a person, so why don’t we become friends?” You’ll see his true colors if he gets defensive and nasty. If he’s willing to build a friendship first, you may want to see what the future holds., There’s nothing wrong with telling a person you don’t have much interaction with why you’re not interested. You likely have a valid reason. If they can’t accept it, at least you may not have to see them much again.


For example, you could say that you’re just getting out of a relationship and aren’t interested in finding a new one, if that is the case. You could also tell him you’re just not into him that way. Additionally, a “no, thank you” also works., Treat him the way that you would want to be treated if you were in his shoes. Avoid saying something like, “ew, no way” or “not a chance.” Instead, decline gracefully. Remember, it took a lot of guts for him to put himself out there. Respect that when you’re turning him down.


You could say, “Wow, I’m flattered, but I can’t.” Letting him know that you appreciate him telling you how he feels could soften the blow.

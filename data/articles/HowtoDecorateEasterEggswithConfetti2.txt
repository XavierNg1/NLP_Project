 This method works best with hallow or blown-out eggs. You can also try using hard boiled eggs, but you won't be able to eat them if the paint soaks through the shell. Since you will be painting the egg, the color does not matter., To keep your fingers clean, paint half of the egg first. Let it dry, then flip it over and paint the other side.Pastel colors work best, since they will create the most contrast., You can also use a different type of decoupage glue. If you can't find either, make your own by mixing equal parts of white school glue and water.Skip the top coat.

You can paint the top or bottom half of the egg. It's up to you!
How far up you paint the egg with Mod Podge is up to you.
 Fill a bowl with shiny, metallic confetti. Holding the egg by the unpainted side, dip it into the confetti. Roll it around so that the confetti sticks to the Mod Podge.For an ombre effect, set the egg into an egg holder, Mod Podge side up, then sprinkle the confetti on top.
Don't worry if the confetti sticks out. This will give the egg some interesting texture!

, Once the egg is covered to your liking, take it out of the bowl, and set it down into an egg holder. Make sure that the confetti side is sticking up., Some of the confetti may come loose after the egg dries, which is normal. Simply dust it off using a soft brush or blow on it., Once the egg is dry, it's ready to be tucked into your Easter basket or set on the mantle for display. Do not coat the egg with more Mod Podge, or you will dull down the confetti's shine.

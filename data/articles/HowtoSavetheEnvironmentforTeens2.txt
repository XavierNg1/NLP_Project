 Seek out products that do not test on animals and do not contain chemicals that require big CAUTION or WARNING notices on the label. There are increasing numbers of products called “natural” or “organic” available, but it never hurts to look at the labels.


Choose products without excess packaging. It was annoying enough when you had to wait for your Dad to dig out your new action figure from that plastic blister packaging; think about the excessive waste such over-packaging creates.
Buy local products when available. Maybe your area has a little candle-making factory or engraver where you can pick up a nice Mother’s Day gift. Not only will you be helping your local economy, you will be saving the energy usage and pollution required to ship goods long distances.
 They don’t take up much space but can prevent a lot of waste. Ever notice how plastic bags seem to always end up stuck in trees or on grassy hillsides, or seen news reports about the giant swirls of plastic junk floating in the middle of the oceans? Every plastic bottle not made and plastic bag not used helps a little bit.
 Just because you don’t want them anymore doesn’t mean someone else wouldn’t be happy to have them. People always seem to assume that all teens need to have the newest everything and discard perfectly good things that are no longer “cool” enough. Prove them wrong.


Buy used and vintage items as well. Freak out your parents by buying a shirt from their high school days and declaring it “so retro.”

, Can you use some parts from your broken-down old bike for your science fair project? Or use your (or, okay, maybe your parents’) old CDs to make a collage or mobile for art class?

, If your municipality has a recycling program, make sure your family uses it. Does your school make recycling convenient? If not, isn’t that something that student councils are for? Help turn recycling into a habit for everyone.

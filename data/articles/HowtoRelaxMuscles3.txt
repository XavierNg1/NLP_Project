 By gently squeezing and releasing your muscles, you can increase blood circulation and help relax muscles.For example, use your left hand to squeeze the deltoid muscle on your right arm. Take a slow, deep breath, and hold the pressure for five seconds. Then, release your hand and slowly exhale. Keep your arm relaxed so you don't cause stress to surrounding muscles. Keep doing this for about five minutes before moving on to another muscle., Before and after you perform physical activity, practice effective stretches. Each muscle group needs to be flexed or stretched for about 15 to 30 seconds in order to be effective. Be sure to stretch the muscle until you feel a good pull with no serious pain.Here are some good stretches to practice:Slowly roll your ankle and foot in circles.
Pull your foot towards you, and then point your foot back down while squeezing to work your calf muscle.
Raise your shoulders up to touch your ears, and then roll them back down and around.
Lean your head to each shoulder, and keep it there for 15 to 20 seconds. Be sure to stop when the pull becomes too intense.
 Performing light cardio is a good way to relax and loosen your muscles by increasing blood circulation.


Simply walk on a treadmill or outside at a quick pace for 15 to 20 minutes. Remember to keep the pace faster than a walk, but not too fast as the purpose is to relax your muscles and not cause any tension.

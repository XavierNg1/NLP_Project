,, There are some rules to this:


The person or character chosen must be famous or well-known. No vanity references like a person's father or a high school friend.
The person or character can either be real or fictitious. Examples could be "King Kong", "Oprah Winfrey", or "Dr. Seuss".
, You would get the card from the person on your left.
, Everyone but you should be seeing your card. You, on the other hand, can see everyone else's.
 This person asks the group "yes or no" questions to figure out who they are (what their card says).


If they guess their character correctly, everyone else but them must finish their drinks.
If they guess their character incorrectly, they would need to finish their drink alone.

 Butcher's twine is the best, easiest way to truss the tenderloin, although some heavy cotton cord — as used for kites — will do in a pinch.
, Bring both pieces of string together and loop one string under the other twice. Tighten the string, then twist the pieces of string and tie a simple overhand knot.


Make sure that when you tie the butcher's knot, you leave enough rope at the end of your knot. You'll need a little bit of rope at the very end of the trussing process to tie both ends of the rope together.
 Do this by taking the string around your hand and then twisting your hand. A simple loop should form.
 Tighten the loop by tugging on the free line while holding the loop knot in place with one hand. Make sure that the loop knots are lined up in a relatively straight line.
 Loop and tie off in the same manner, separating each loop by about an inch, until you reach the end of the roast.
, Wrap the string under one loop, then over and under again, working down the roast in a straight line.
, Bring both ends of the rope together, loop one end underneath the other twice, and finish off with a simple overhead knot. Your roast is now officially trussed!

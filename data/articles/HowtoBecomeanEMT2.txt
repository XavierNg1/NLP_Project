 Once you're certified, look at job listings at local hospitals, police stations, fire stations, and private emergency services providers. The health care industry is growing, and there are plenty of opportunities for EMT-Bs.
 EMT-IIs take on more responsibilities than EMT-Bs, including administering IVs and using defibrillators to resuscitate people in cardiac arrest. The EMT-II certification process is similar to that of an EMT-B, but requires more coursework.
 Paramedics have more training and expertise than other EMTs. In addition to performing all the duties of EMT-Bs and EMT-IIs, paramedics may administer medication, read EKGs, and handle sophisticated medical equipment. Additional training and certifications are required for becoming a paramedic.

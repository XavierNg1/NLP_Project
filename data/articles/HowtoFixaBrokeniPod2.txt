 If your iPod fell in the pool or into a full sink, don't try to turn it on. This could cause irreversible damage by shorting out all of the components. You will need to remove the moisture before trying to power it on again.


Don't simply wipe the phone dry and try to use it. The water can cause serious damage to the inside of the phone when it is wet.
 While the most effective way to remove the moisture is to put the iPod into a bag of silica gel packets, most people don't have these handy. Instead, put your iPod into a bag or bowl full of rice and make sure it is completely covered. The rice will draw the moisture out of the device over time.


This could cause your iPod to get a lot of dust inside, but it sure beats it being broken for good.
Seal the bag or container while you let it sit.
 It will take a while for all of the moisture to get sucked out of the iPod. You want it to be bone dry when you try turning it back on, so give the rice plenty of time to absorb all of the water.Don't use a hair dryer to dry the iPod. The heat from the blower could cause more harm than good.

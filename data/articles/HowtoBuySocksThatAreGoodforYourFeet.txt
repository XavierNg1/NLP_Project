 This is very important, as it provides cushion every time you step, softening impact and reducing stress on the heels, thereby leaving your feet less tired at the end of the day.;
, Just like shirts, socks come in different sizes and shapes, and though they may stretch somewhat, one-size socks often fit poorly and are a common cause of blistering. If you can feel your sock move up and down your leg, it's causing abrasion. A good brand of socks will offer at least four sizes.
 These allow the sock to grab the arch of the foot, giving a snug feeling. The arch support also helps prevent the sock from bunching up.
 Denser socks wick more moisture and provide cushion for a longer period of time. They support the feet better, and they often last longer.
 Look for socks with reinforced heels and toes, as these are the areas that wear out the fastest.

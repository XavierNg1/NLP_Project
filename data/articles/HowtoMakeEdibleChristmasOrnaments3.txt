 Try not to make the hole too near the edge, or your cookie may crumble. Try to go for the center or near the top.


If your cookies are not properly baked, they could easily crumble.
 You could have an individual string for each cookie, or string a whole bunch of them together - this is all up to you.
, Make sure the icing is smooth enough so that the cookie can easily enter and exit the icing. Carefully wipe off any excess icing dripping over the sides of the cookie, as you'll want to avoid leaving any stains on the floor or furniture.


If desired, repeat the directions for the icing. Put the icing in a sandwich bag, then cut a hole at the tip of the sandwich bag. This will create some sort of an icing tube so that you will be able to pipe on designs onto the cookies.
An optional step would be to purchase an icing tube and fill it with your icing, then design your cookies with the icing.

 Pour a half a cup of water into a ceramic or microwave-safe bowl. Then take one lemon and cut it in half. Squeeze each half of the lemon into the water. Drop the halves into the bowl after squeezing. Put the bowl into the microwave., Microwave the bowl with the lemon and water on high for three minutes. This will produce a steam that will pervade the microwave and make it easier to clean. Keep the microwave door closed for five minutes after the cycle is complete to let the steam do its work., After the five minutes are over, open up the microwave. Carefully with an oven mitt or towel, remove the bowl and set it aside. Use a sponge or wet cloth and wipe down the inside of the microwave.If the microwave has a turning tray, you can take this out and clean it individually to make the process easier.
 Use a scrub brush to scrub away any drips or stains in the microwave. The stains are probably not from the popcorn, but the popcorn odor can stick to these stains. If the scrub brush isnâ€™t working, try dipping a cloth into the lemon and water mixture and rubbing at the stains., After you have removed the stain, do a final wipe down of the microwave with a dry cloth. This will remove the moisture from the inside of the microwave. You should notice that the odor of the popcorn is gone and is replaced with a nice citrus smell. If not, there are a couple more measures you can take.

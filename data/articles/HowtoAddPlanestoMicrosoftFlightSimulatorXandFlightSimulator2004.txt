 This is the most important step, of course! Make sure that if the file is a .zip file, or file like that, have a program ready to use that file, such as WinZIP, or WinRAR.;
, When the download completes, more than likely the zip file program will open the file automatically. You should, after possibly opening the file that appears, see a couple of files such as: A model file, maybe a panel file, a texture file, possibly a sound file, a .cfg file named 'aircraft', and a .air file.
 Place the main file, holding the files mentioned above, if using FS2004, in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Aircraft. If using FSX, place it in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Simobjects\Airplanes. If there is no main file containing all the files of the aircraft, make one and place the aircraft files there.
 Happy Flying!

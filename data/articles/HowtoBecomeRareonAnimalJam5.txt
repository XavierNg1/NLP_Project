 Sometimes, jammers will try to scam, and unfortunately, not always do they get banned. However, some giveaways are actually truthful. If there is a new jammer or an unrare looking person saying spike giveaway my den, they're obviously trying to scam, because they have no spike. Usually, the scams are used with spikes and other extremely rare items. Enter small giveaways first, such as rare giveaways (some include worn blankets, nerd glasses, straw hats, etc., giveaways like that). Avoid flash trading and trolls, and do not trust any jammer who is doing the giveaway through flash or trust trading, or gifting.
 Famous jammers usually host giveaways, and they're obviously not scams. Famous jammers could not scam, otherwise they would probably get a lot of hate. Follow the instructions in order to win a giveaway that the famous jammer says, and just maybe you'll get a chance to win, and actually get a good rare item.
 Online giveaways on YouTube by not only famous jammers, but even regular animal jam YouTubers are usually trustworthy as well. You might just win and become very rare.

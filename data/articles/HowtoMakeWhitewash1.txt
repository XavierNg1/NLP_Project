, Combine all of the ingredients in the large bucket to create the whitewash. Make sure to wear protective gear to minimize the risk of being hurt from the lime powder. Wearing a dust mask, protective eyeglasses, and gloves should be sufficient.


Mix 2 cups of salt with 1 gallon of warm water and stir to dissolve the salt.Add 6 to 8 cups of hydrated lime to the salt water.
Mix well until the lime is dissolved.

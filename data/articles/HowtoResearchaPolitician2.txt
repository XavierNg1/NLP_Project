 Two respected fact-checkers, factcheck.org and politifact.com, routinely fact-check the statements of politicians. They typically conduct their fact checks as an item becomes newsworthy, and categorize them according to individual, subject matter, and degree of honesty. If a politicians makes a dubious claim, this is probably the easiest way to check up on it.Unfortunately, factcheck.org doesn’t typically fact check claims made by state-level politicians. Politifact.com does, but only for about 18 of the largest states.
 Both factcheck.org and politifact.com allow users to suggest fact checks, so those are good places to start. If you’re looking to verify the claim of a state or local politician, it’s a good idea to approach a local newspaper or media outlet. Some of these organizations have dedicated political fact checkers already, but even if they don’t, it’s the job of the media generally to verify the statements of politicians and elected officials., If you feel comfortable, do your own research about the accuracy of a politician’s statement. While politicians are famous for using weasel words, they’re ultimately dealing with issues that have to be addressed in the real world, which means that many of the statements are verifiable.

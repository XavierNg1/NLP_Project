 Don't just go up to the guy and ask what his name is; mention something about him that you find interesting, and get into a conversation that way. Some examples are: "I've read that, it's really good." "Sorry, that vending machine's broken. Don't you hate it when that happens?", "Wow, it's like these cashiers are moving underwater.", "Nice shirt. I love their music.", "Do you know what time it is?".;
, Nothing puts people more at ease than if they think someone else is having fun. It will open him up more and make him more interested in talking to you.
 Just make sure they're in context and not out of the blue. Also don't tell many stories as it will probably bore him.
 Those are more casual than talking on the phone, and don't have all the cultural strings attached to "talking on the phone with a guy". It will make you seem less forward.
 When you do first email/IM him, restate who you are, like "remember me from...?"

, A string of emails or the occasional IM means you did it! You've succeeded in becoming friends with a guy you just met. Congratulations on it!
If you want to be closer friends with him, invite him out to the movies with a couple of your close friends (be sure to invite guys too to make him more comfortable). If your friends get to know him, you'll probably be seeing him more often.
If you find out you like him more than a friend, also invite him to the movies with your friends. If you both like it, make it a regular thing. Start flirting with him a little; he'll get the idea. Sit next to him too, if that's possible. If he seems to want to go farther with you, invite him to the movies, just the two of you, and see what happens. Do other activities too, like going to the park, an art museum, a walk, out for a drink, etc.

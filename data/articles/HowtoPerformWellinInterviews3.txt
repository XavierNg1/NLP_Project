 Because you will be feeling nervous your mind will be running on double-time. Take your time. Breathe. Think about your answers. Rather take your time and give the right answer than rush and talk nonsense.
 The fundamental purpose of the interview is to ask one simple thing: “Why should we give you a job?” Good question. And why should they? You need to let them know that you are passionate:


“…I enjoy working with people.”
“…I have a great respect for this company.”
“…I have always been passionate about…”
It’s fine if you have lifted these ready-made-phrases directly from your application form because that will show consistency.
 If you get nervous you may talk nonsense. Imagine your answers as aiming at a bullseye on a darts board: if you aren’t hitting the bullseye you’re wasting your time. You have two options if you start to talk nonsense: first, stop yourself, smile politely and say, “I think I’ve answered your question. Second: Take a breath and get back on track. Either way they’ll appreciate your openness.

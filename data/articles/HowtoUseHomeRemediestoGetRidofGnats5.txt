 Mix a little rubbing alcohol or drinking alcohol with water inside a large spray bottle.


Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) vodka with 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of water.
As another option, you can mix 1 cup (250 ml) rubbing alcohol with 1 quart (1 liter) of water.
As a third option, you can mix 1 Tbsp (15 ml) apple cider vinegar with 1 tsp (5 ml) wine and 1 cup (250 ml) water.
 Spray one leaf with the solution and let it sit for several days. If it does not burn the leaf, it should be safe for the plant.


If the solution does burn the leaf, you can try diluting the alcohol further by using more water.
 Gently mist the leaves, flowers, stems, and soil of gnat-ridden plants with the alcohol solution.


Repeat this treatment every three days for two weeks, or until the gnat problem dies down.
Alternatively, place this solution in a bowl near your plants. If you are unable to make the solution mild enough for your plants, you can place it in a small dish near the infested plant. Some gnats will drown in the mixture after being drawn in, while others will be driven away.

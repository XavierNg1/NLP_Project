 Your child should be seen by the proper specialists when being treated for juvenile arthritis. Your child needs to see a pediatric rheumatologist, who specializes in treating all forms of juvenile arthritis. Your child’s pediatrician and a team of nurses will also be involved in their care.Your child’s team will likely also consist of a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist.
Your child’s pediatrician will more than likely diagnose your child. Then they will refer you to a pediatric rheumatologist.
 Your child may need to see a physical therapist as part of their medical treatment plan. A physical therapist or rehabilitation specialist can work with the child to regain use of the joints and improve the range of movement.The physical therapist may design an exercise program appropriate for the child until the symptoms lessen and they can perform most movements.
 Occupational therapy is another important therapy your child may need, depending on the severity of their juvenile arthritis. During occupational therapy, an occupational therapist will teach your child how to adapt to their condition to reduce any strain on the joints. OT is used a lot for arthritis that affects the hands.OT is used to help work with children to improve their reach, grasp, and use of objects. During therapy, the children learn how to dress, bathe, and eat with limbs or joints affected by arthritis.
The occupational therapist may give the child splints or other devices to help ensure the child’s bone and joint growth.
 In very rare cases, your child may need surgery. It is not often a treatment for juvenile arthritis, but if no other medical treatments have alleviated the symptoms, the doctors may consider surgery. The surgery may be used to improve the position of the joint. It might also be used if the joint is deformed.

 Jean buttons are usually made of metal and they attach to the jeans with a stud. Therefore, you may be able to replace a jeans button without any sewing. To do this, you will need:Replacement button
Button tool
Iron-on denim patch
Hammer;
, A patch will help to reinforce the area where you will place your new button. Cut the patch as needed to ensure that it will fit into the space behind the button. Then, iron on the patch according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

If you can’t find an iron on denim patch, or do not wish to purchase one, then you can also get a piece of scrap denim and glue or sew it onto the area behind where you will place the new button.
 Jean buttons come in two pieces. One piece is the button and the other is a backing piece with a stud that connects with the button. Put the two pieces into the button replacement tool.The button will go into the larger slot and the backing will go into the smaller slot.
 Next, close the button tool partially and slide it over the jeans. The button side should be on the outer part of the jeans and the stud piece should be on the inside.Try to align the pieces so that they will be near the location of the old button, but so that the stud will go through the denim and the patch.
 After you have positioned the tool, close it as much as you can. Then, get the hammer and hit the tool to snap the two pieces together.Just give the button replacement tool a gentle tap with the hammer at first and then increase the force if necessary.
After the pieces are secured together, you can remove the tool. The new button should be secured and the jeans should be ready to wear!

 Because your wheels and tires are usually the dirtiest part of the vehicle, washing them first will prevent you from splattering dirt and grime on a clean car as you wash and rinse the tires.Washing the car after the tires gives you a chance to clean off any tire or wheel cleaner you accidentally get onto the car’s paint.
 Your wheels and tires are not only covered in dirt, but also brake dust caused by the wearing of your brake pads when you stop. This dust can create small scratches in paint, so it’s important to keep the bucket, sponges, and towels you use on your wheels and tires away from those you use on your paint.Keep one bucket with sponges for washing the car and another for the wheels and tires.
Never use a sponge or towel you used on your wheels and tires on the body of the car.
 Tire cleaner can dull paint or even remove wax or clear coat from the body of your car. It is designed to eat through stuck on grime and the chemicals can even be harsh enough to damage painted or powder coated wheels. Take care when applying tire cleaners and immediately wipe any overspray off.If you use a wheel and tire cleaner in one, it is okay to get it on your wheels.
Some wheel and tire cleaner is only designed for specific types of wheels, so read the instructions carefully before spraying your wheels with the cleaner.

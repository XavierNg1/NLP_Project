 It is important to know about the climate and soil type, so as to make preparations for each different kind of corn. Some types of corn prefer warmer/cooler soil and different soil pH levels., Sweet corn is the classic variety typically eaten on the cob or from a can. It is known for a golden yellow kernel and a light, sweet flavor. Sweet corn is most commonly used in home gardens.


Standard sweet corn (labeled as ‘su’ on seed packets) is the most mild of the sweet corns. Over 50% of the sugar contained in standard sweet corn is converted to starch within 24 hours of being picked, so it must be consumed or canned soon after being harvested.
Sugar enhanced sweet corn (labeled as ‘se’ on seed packets) is genetically modified to slow the sugar to starch conversion rate, increasing the sweetness and tenderness of the kernels.
Super sweet corn (labeled as ‘sh2’ on seed packets) is the sweetest variety available. It’s kernels are slightly smaller than other sweet corn varieties, and shrivel when dried., Dent or field corn is not typically grown to eat raw. It is used primarily as feed for animals or for use in making many processed foods. Growing dent corn is beneficial for use on a farm or for selling to other farms.
 Flint corn, also called Indian corn, is characterized by hard, multi-colored kernels. It has uses similar to dent corn, but is not grown as widely in the United States as its preferred habitat is in central and South America. It is often used for its decorative purposes.

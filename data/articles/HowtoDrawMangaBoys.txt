Don't forget the idea of perspective. In the introductory picture, the hand in the front is a lot bigger to appear closer to the viewer.;
, He should be bigger at the shoulders and narrower at the hips, with little or no expansion at the chest or constriction at the waist.
 These are pretty key in differentiating the jawbone and adding masculinity.
 Guy eyes are different because they are not as round or shiny, unless they are very young. For a teenager like the one depicted, a good medium sized, slanted eye style works well.


Guys don't accentuate their eyelashes. So, in cartoon styles like manga, they have little to NO eyelashes.
 So, go wild and draw a messy tuft of hair.


The guy in the introductory drawing has a hat, another boyish feature.
 For guys, they usually wear baggy tee shirts or graphic designs, jeans, hoodies, and lack accessories. Draw the tee shirt like you would define his back, and then let it hang off in the front to show the bagginess.
 The main details are his shape, which should be boxy and muscular, and his head with short, spiked hair. Goofy grins are optional!

 You'll need the paint to dry overnight on the first night, then you'll be applying a second and maybe a third coat. After each coat the paint needs to dry overnight then it needs roughly 24 hours to complete dry when you're done. Do some homework, and only tackle this project when the weather is right for it., Before adding your color, you need to use primer to ensure that the paint will stick. Apply a primer to the concrete to ensure strong adhesion of the paint. Again, follow the manufacturer's instructions to confirm the necessary application and drying time.


If you are painting over an old color, or you are working outdoors, you may have better results with 2 coats of primer. Be sure to let the first coat dry fully before applying the second., Your best bet, when working with concrete, is to use masonry paint, which is formulated to contract and expand as concrete changes temperature. It is sometimes sold as elastomeric paint or elastomeric wall coating. Since it is much thicker than regular paint, you need to be sure to use a high-capacity roller or brush., Start in one of the corners, or at the top of you are painting a wall, and work slowly and evenly across the entire surface. You don't need as much paint as you think in each layer -- you'll be adding 1-2 more layers once the first is done drying, so don't try and slather it all on now., Once the paint has dried overnight you can layer on another coat. You should add at least 1 more coat of paint, thinly, but you could add a third as well for a deeper color and a more even coating., Dry the final coat of paint for at least 24 hours before moving items onto or near the newly painted concrete to ensure a smooth, professional appearance.

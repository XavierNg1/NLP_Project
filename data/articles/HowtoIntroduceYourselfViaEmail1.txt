 Your recipient should have a good idea about what the email is about before they even open it. Keep it short as well; a long subject can be cumbersome. For an introductory email, it is usually perfectly acceptable to write "Introduction - Your Name".


Make sure to write the subject line first! A common mistake is to save the subject line for last, which can lead to forgetting to write it at all.
Mobile devices will typically only show about 25-30 characters of the subject, so keep it short.;
, Don't start off with "Hello" or "Hi". You can use greetings like that once you've gotten to know the person. Start off with a tried-and-true business greeting. Avoid using the recipient's first name in the salutation."Dear Ms./Mr./Mrs." - If you are at all unsure about the marital status of the female you are emailing, you should always default to using "Ms." as it is less presumptuous.
"To whom it may concern" - This should only be used if you are not sure who will be receiving the message.
 Your first sentence should introduce yourself to your recipient. This allows them to associate a name with the rest of the email message.


"My name is..."
Give your title if applicable. If you have multiple titles, don't list them all out, just the most important or relevant one.

 One foot (about 30.5 cm)is recommended for beginners. ;
,, This will be the length of your stilt poles.
 Be cautious to cut the ends so at least one end on each pole (the bottom) is flat, as this will be the surface on which you will be walking.
 A good size is usually 4”-6”. Again, insure that at least one side on each piece is flat, as this side will line up with the long stilt poles.
, You will want to measure to make sure you are nailing these pieces in at the right height. From the bottom of the stilt poles, measure the height you want to gain (from #1) and subtract 2”. This will be where you nail in the top of the triangle, so that one of the 4” surfaces is perpendicular to the stilt pole and the other is parallel to the stilt pole. Two nails should be used to secure each triangle. Hammer one nail in through the bottom of the triangle (1” from the bottom) through the stilt pole first. Hammer the other about 1” above that through the triangle first.
 The foothold should fit nicely on top of the triangle. Make sure the flat side of the foothold is next to the stilt pole. To fix the foothold into place, nail the footholds into both the 2”x2” stilt pole and the foothold supports. Three nails should be hammered in through the top of the foothold, at a 45 degree angle to the foothold, through the support and stilt pole.
,, You can now try to walk on your stilts! Happy walking!

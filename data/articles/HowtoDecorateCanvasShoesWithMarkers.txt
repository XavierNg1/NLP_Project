 Converse and flats are very popular, so they are a good choice. Remove the laces.;
, Thin ones are very good for small details, blending colors, and drawing outlines, while thick ones are good for blurry images and backgrounds.
 Try thinking of objects that resemble one another, are easy to draw in a variety of different colors, and are unique and pleasing to the eye. For example, flowers, hot air balloons, and even jellyfish are great examples. Refrain from large landscapes with dull colors, or images that are too dark. They will look bad when drawn on.
 It is best to keep it small--1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) at its widest point. Draw more, keeping them about a half inch apart.
 Using the same color, outline the pictures you just drew. Make sure this color is contrasting. Be careful! It may bleed. If you do not want the risk, outline it in thinner marker.
 If you used a dark blue, move onto lighter and lighter blues, then greens, then yellows. Yellows are very dynamic looking when they sit top-tier over darker colors. Keep in mind that Sharpies go over previous colors. On cloth, if you make a blue mark and go over it with yellow, it will turn green. With this in mind, overshoot your colors a little.
 Repeat on all other sides, and maybe even the tongue.

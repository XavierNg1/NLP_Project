 In every school, there are nerds. However, don't immediately assume you know who the nerds are. You may just pick someone who wears glasses and braces, but inside they may be a total Nerd Hater. So spend some time watching everyone like a hawk (don't be creepy though!), and try to discover who the nerds are. It may be someone obsessed with one particular topic - like computers, a fandom, or literature; or it might be someone who loves schoolwork and seems to always be doing homework and extra credit. Make sure you're careful when trying to find the Nerds - don't make a mistake and pick someone totally different.;
, This is essential. You need a good conversational base to construct a dialogue with the nerd, because they will probably be talking a lot about (especially in the beginning) their chosen field of expertise, or what they may regard as their obsession. Mastery is not necessary - unless of course, you want to, if it fascinates you or you enjoy it- which is even better!

, This shouldn't be too difficult. Talk to them about their obsession,and how you're interested in them. You may want to ask them some questions, for example: if the Nerd is into math(s), you may ask them, "So what do you prefer - Algebra or Geometry?" Or if you have a literature fan on your hands, you may ask them what their favorite authors are, and what their opinions are on a book.
 Talk more and more about the Nerd's obsession with them. Be nice to them, don't tease or pick on them. Try to ask them intelligent questions, and be interested in their opinion. Add your own opinions too - don't be afraid to speak your mind. Spend more time with the Nerd - try to sit next to or near them, spend a break time with them, or even go to their hang-out place or to their home(s).
 Don't do anything too "normal"; this might put them off. Nerds are simple folk, and that is all that needs to be done to continue the friendship indefinitely.

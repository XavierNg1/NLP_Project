 As free internet becomes more and more par for the course, businesses are hard-pressed to offer their clients (or passersby...) free, unlimited WiFi.


Obviously, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Panera (to name just three) offer free public WiFi. But maybe you're cappuccino-ed out?

Truck stops, car washes, and auto shops offer WiFi to waiting clients.
Libraries, city halls, and even parks are starting to offer free WiFi now. It all encourages local citizens to get more involved.
Plenty of hotel chains are now starting to jump on the bandwagon. Do a minute of research to find hours of gold.

Download an app like MAC Makeupto get the process rolling. Even changing one number should be sufficient. You can either just extend your time a bit or hack into someone else's MAC address that has paid for the WiFi already. It's not the most honest of solutions, of course. But it'll do.

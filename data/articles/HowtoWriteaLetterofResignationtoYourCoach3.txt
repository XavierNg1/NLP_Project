 Once you have finished writing your letter, there are many methods of delivery from which to choose. However, the best way is to deliver the letter in person. This will give you an opportunity to speak directly with the coach and answer any questions.


You can hand the coach the letter after practice and have a conversation immediately following, or you can discuss the details at a later date.
 If you do not want to personally deliver the letter, you can also have someone deliver the letter for you, as long as it is in a sealed envelope.
 You can always send the letter by mail if you do in fact have an address for the coach. The best address to use is the address of the school or organization that coordinates the team’s activities.
 If you choose to send the letter by email, you can send it as a document attached to the email or by writing the content of the letter in the actual body of the email message.
 Want to do something out of the norm and extra special? Often there is an assistant coach or other administrators who have been particularly helpful to you as a member of the team. You may consider providing a thank you note or greeting card to one or more of those individuals. This is a way of acknowledging a person’s kindness in a way that can be memorable and does not take a lot of extra effort or money.


You can find inexpensive greeting cards and thank you cards at stores like Target and Walmart, as well as other retailers such as various dollar stores and grocery stores.

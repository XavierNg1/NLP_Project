 Many manufacturers package their ink cartridges with a returnable envelope. If not, check the manufacturer's website or call to see if they support a recycling program.
 Manufacturers will often specify guidelines on how to pack and ship the spent cartridges to avoid leakage. Make sure to follow their specific instructions.
 Once the manufacturer receives the cartridges they will handle the recycling. Give yourself some credit - your effort is helping the environment!

 If you have your own domain that’s hosted by a web hosting provider, visit their website in your browser.

If you use Hostgator or Bluehost (and most other hosting providers), your incoming mail server is mail.yourdomain.com (replace “yourdomain.com” with your domain). The POP3 port is 110 and the IMAP port is 143.
To use Secure POP or IMAP with Hostgator, you’ll need the name of the server which hosts your site. Log into Hostgator and launch the Cpanel. Find the server name next to “Server Name” on the left side of the screen. If the server name is gator4054, your secure incoming mail server will be gator4054.hostgator.com. For secure POP, use port 995. Secure IMAP uses port 993.
Bluehost uses mail.yourdomain.com for secure POP and IMAP. For secure POP, use port 995. Secure IMAP uses port 993.

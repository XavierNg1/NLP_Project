 The default Android browser resembles a blue globe, but you can download browsers like Chrome or Firefox from the Google Play Store if you like.
 It's either at the top of the page or in the middle of the page, depending on your browser.


If you don't see a bar here on Chrome, first tap â‹® in the top-right corner of the screen and then tap New Tab.
 This might be an HTML document or a picture.
 Doing so will take you to that item's page.


If you're searching for images, look for an Images tab somewhere on the search results page. Tapping it will display only images.
 You should see several buttons appear along the top of the screen, though in some cases a pop-up menu will appear instead.
 It's generally a downward-facing arrow. Doing so will prompt your file to download to your Android's storage.
 For non-image files, you can do so by opening the Files app on non-Samsung devices, or by opening the My Files app on Samsung devices.


You can view your saved images by opening your phone's photo app.
Third-party file explorers such as Solid Explorer will also allow you to browse your Android's downloaded files.

 If you'd like your cornstarch paste to dry quickly, you may want to add some white glue to the mixture. Blend enough cornstarch and water to make a thick paste. After heating the mixture until translucent, take it off the heat, and stir in the white glue.For best results, use a 50/50 mixture of glue and paste.


Make sure you stir thoroughly after the white glue is added. Otherwise, the glue will not bind with the cornstarch paste base.
The resulting mixture is a good choice for craft projects that require extra gluing power.
 Choose your favorite scent and stir in a few drops just before using the glue. A little goes a long way, so don't add more than 3-5 drops.


Rose oil is a great touch for glue on a love letter.
Peppermint would be an excellent addition to a Christmas card.
 Change the appearance by putting in a bit of food coloring. This is a great way to add flair to paper craft projects. Experiment with food coloring until you get the right color and desired transparency., When the paste is almost hardened, you can mix in some glitter to add sparkle. This is a great way to integrate glitter into arts and crafts without making a big mess. Ensure the glitter is not added too late, or it will be difficult to blend into the paste.

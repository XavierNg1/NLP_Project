 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Get out a baking sheet and line the sheet with a silicone baking mat. If you don't have a mat, you can line it with a sheet of parchment paper. Set the pan aside while you make the cookie dough., Place 1/2 of a medium banana into a mixing bowl. Use a fork or potato masher to mash the banana until it's smooth. Add 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed, 3 tablespoons of water, and 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Mash the mixture until the water and oil are combined., Measure and add 1/3 cup (66 g) cane sugar to the mixing bowl along with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Use a spoon or rubber spatula to stir the wet mixture well. Set it aside while you mix together the dry ingredients., Get out another mixing bowl and place all of the dry ingredients into it. Use a whisk to combine the mixture for about 30 seconds. This will ensure that the baking soda is evenly distributed. You'll need to combine:2 cups (180 g) quick cooking oats
3/4 cup (90 g) all-purpose gluten-free flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

, Scoop the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to stir the cookie dough until it's just combined and you don't see any pockets of dry ingredients. Stir in 1/2 cup (80 g) of vegan chocolate chips or chunks., You can use a large tablespoon to scoop the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Or use a cookie scoop that measures about 1 tablespoon. Gently flatten each of the cookies just a little, since they won't expand and spread out very much as they bake., Put the baking sheet in the oven and bake the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes. The cookies start to look dry and cracked around the edges once they've finished cooking. Cool the cookies on the sheet for 5 minutes before you transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling.Store the leftover oatmeal raisin cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.

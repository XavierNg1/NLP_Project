 Make sure that your tires are rock solid. If they're not, pump them up. Tighten your stunt pegs to ensure that they stay on the bike. Tighten your seat to ensure you stay on the bike and tighten your handlebars so you can get a good grip on the bike. Replace your helmet if it's cracked or if it has suffered a hard knock. Even if you can't see the damage, it's there.;
, The bunny hop is the simplest but most important trick on a BMX bike. Most other tricks (including the barspin) use a bunny hop to get into or out of the trick. For example, a 180 is a bunny hop but spun around. However, without knowing the bunny hop, you can't 180.
 If you're going to barspin over a gap, ride a little bit faster. However, when first trying this trick, you should start flatland and work your way up to jumps and ramps. Keep your bike dead straight while riding. If you try and barspin at an angle, you will most likely bail.
 As soon as you get to a comfortable and steady speed, you need to bunny hop. Bunny hop as high as you can to get the cleanest spin. Think of it this way, the higher you bunny hop, the more time you have to bar spin. The more time you have, the less likely you are to bail.
 Throw the bars with your dominant hand. If that's your right hand, throw the bars clockwise. If your left hand is dominant, you're throwing the bars anti-clockwise. Wait for your bars to make a full 360 rotation before moving on to the next step.
 When your bars have nearly completed the 360 rotation, prepare your non-dominant hand to grab them. When the bars are straight, grab them as if you're going to ride off.

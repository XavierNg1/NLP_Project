 Because this technique requires that you apply marker ink directly to the paper and then use water to spread it, you might want to a choose a thicker paper. This prevents bleed-through to the opposite side of your paper and also helps prevent your ink from spreading too far.

Card stock is a good option for this, particularly if you're planning on using a lot of ink/water.
You can also use actual watercolor paper for this method, too.
 Using either the fine or brush tip of your distress marker, color on your paper where you want that particular color to go. You’ll want to color a little more darkly than you normally would since you’ll be diluting the color by adding water to it.Unless you are looking for a very defined border with the color you’re using, you should favor the brush, rather than fine-tip, end of your marker. The fine tip can scratch the paper, which prevents your color from being applied evenly., Dip your watercolor brush into water, and then gently spread the marker ink with light, smooth strokes. The more water you apply to the marker ink, the more diluted and therefore light the color becomes.

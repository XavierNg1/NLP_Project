 This is a great way to dry leaves for crafts, but some color fading will occur. Place fresh leaves on top of two paper towels. Cover them with another single layer of paper towel.


Use freshly fallen leaves that are still vibrant and pliable. Avoid leaves that are curling at the ends or those that have rips or rotted spots.
For best results, leave a little space in between each leaf to prevent them from sticking together as they dry.
 Place the leaves in the microwave and heat them for 30 seconds. Afterward, continue microwaving the leaves in 5-second intervals.Autumn leaves will generally need to be microwaved 30 to 180 seconds before they are sufficiently dry.
Be very attentive when microwaving leaves. If cooked too long, leaves can actually catch fire.
Leaves that appear scorched have been microwaved too long. Leaves that curl at the ends after being removed from the microwave have not been microwaved long enough.
 Store the leaves in a draft-free, shady area. Leave them there overnight, at minimum, or for two days, at maximum. If you notice a change in color, the leaves should be sealed immediately.
 Spray both sides of each leaf with clear acrylic craft spray to preserve the remaining color. Let the leaves dry before using them as decorations or for crafts.

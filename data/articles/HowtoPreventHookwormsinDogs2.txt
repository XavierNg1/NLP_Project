 Hookworms are parasites that suck the blood from where they attach to the intestines. This means that you dog may show signs of anemia. Your dog may have pale gums or be lethargic due to the blood loss. If a puppy, your dog may have stunted growth due to the hookworms feeding on him and the blood lost.Hookworms attach themselves to the intestines, so the major symptoms of hookworms are related to the digestive tract. Dogs may suddenly lose weight or have bloody diarrhea.
Irritation and itching around the paws is a symptom of a large infestation of the environment.
 If you believe your dog has hookworms, take him to the vet. Your doctor can perform an exam and take a stool sample to check for hookworms. Your vet will look for eggs floating in the dogâ€™s stool.In very young puppies, this method may not be effective for diagnosing because it takes a few weeks for the hookworms to start producing eggs. Your vet may give a young puppy a different test or go ahead and treat him just in case.
 If your dog has hookworms, you can treat them with medicine. These medicines kill the hookworms. However, these medicines only kill the adult worms, not the eggs or larvae. You will have to give your dog the hookworm medication for two to four weeks to kill any newly hatched worms.These medications are oral medications with very few side effects.
You should remove all feces from the yard of the infected dog using gloves to help protect against reinfestation.

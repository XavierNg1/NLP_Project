 Do not waste your time buying a gasoline powered generator. You will have to be at home at the time of the power outage to start it. You'll also have to keep returning to your home to add gasoline.


There is a wide variety of propane or natural gas generators that run automatically when your power goes out. They set up to run once a week automatically to keep the battery charged.
You can be at work or on vacation when an emergency occurs. Your automatic emergency generator will assure that all your important electrical circuits have power for heat, sump pumps and refrigerators.;
, It is more important than your plasma TV or a refrigerator. Without it, it's just like the Titanic in an iceberg field: bad.
 A simple 30-minute thunderstorm can quickly destroy weekends worth of sweat equity â€“ unless your sump pump has backup power.


Emergency power comes in three basic forms. Backup battery systems come in different configurations. Some will work for a few hours but some state-of-the-art battery backup sump pump systems will have enough power to keep a basement from flooding under most circumstances. Some systems allow you to add more than one battery to double the duration of the power. A standby generator offers automatic AND long-term protection. It also protects your whole house, but it is more expensive. Since standby generators are also used to keep your beer cold and your TV tuned into the big game keeping your family safe and warm during a disaster you might want to add the protection of a battery backup with the sole purpose of keeping your basement dry.

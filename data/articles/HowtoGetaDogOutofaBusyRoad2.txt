 If you manage to get the dog to come to you, gently slip a leash on the dog’s neck. This can help you keep the dog from running into the road again if the dog gets startled or doesn’t want to be near you.You can try to get the dog into your car without a leash, but a leash helps you secure the dog and keep it safe once you get it out of the road.
 Many dogs have collars and tags around their neck. The tags may provide information about the dog, such as their name, the owner’s contact information, or vet information. You can use this information to help locate the owner.If the tag only has the name, it can help you identify the real owner of the dog.
With vet information, you may be able to contact the dog’s vet, who can get in touch with the owner.
 If the dog doesn’t have a tag with owner identification, try finding the owner. You may rescue a dog from a neighborhood or area near houses. Go around to the houses asking if they have a missing dog. Sometimes, the dog just wandered off and ended up in the road.You may consider asking people to describe the dog and keeping it out of eyesight so you don’t give the dog to someone who isn’t the actual owner or may hurt it.

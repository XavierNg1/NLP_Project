 Take the time to wash your extensions at least a few times a week if not daily. Remove light debris and dust in between washings with a little warm water and combing. Do this by wetting your lashes with a little warm water and then very gently combing them out., Don’t let moisture-rich products like shampoos, conditioners, or heavy creams near your lashes or lash line to protect the integrity of the adhesive. For example, tilt your head back in the shower to keep these products away from your eyes. Also try dabbing a very thin line of 70% isopropyl alcohol on your lash line once a week to wipe away excess oil that can be produced by sweat when you exercise frequently., Avoid tugging, rubbing, or pulling at your lashes. This will loosen them and make them look clumpy if you’re not careful. It can also pull out your natural lashes. Get them professionally removed if the extensions itch or are otherwise really bothering you., Use powdered eye shadow as you normally would. Avoid eyeliners except at the very corners of your eyes. Steer away from liquid eyeliner, which can damage your extensions. Most importantly, never use mascara. It will damage your extensions and leave them looking and feeling crusty.

 Make sure to read the labels on your cleaning products before you buy them, and consider stopping to use any harsh chemical you already have in your home.
 A baby’s skin, particularly a newborn’s, is extremely delicate and sensitive. Look for products that are made with all natural ingredients and free of harsh chemicals and preservatives that may irritate or dry baby’s delicate skin.

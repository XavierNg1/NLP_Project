 Draw up scenery ideas on paper using a pencil, so that you can erase the elements that don't work. Ideas for scenery can include countryside, farmland, mountain areas, villages, and even a cityscape.


Consider the season or climate as well as the landscape. This provides you with an opportunity to develop scenery around specific themes, such as a snowy winter, a colorful fall, a bright summer or even a tropical setting.
Look up famous train lines on Wikipedia or train hobbyist sites, for inspiration.;
, Good supplies include grass, trees, buildings, people etc. You will also need a shaker to put the grass into the scenery. If you don't know what to products to buy, ask for help.


Also gather items from around the home that can be repurposed as model train scenery. This requires imagining what could be turned into scenery, such as making seating and tables from toothpaste caps, a mountain from cereal box cardboard or snow scenes from foam.
 Such things as soil, sticks, little rocks etc., depending on your scale of choice and if you think it will work.
 It needs to be strong and flat, so that the train can run on it with ease and it can hold all of the scenery without bending. Size is also a consideration, as you'll need to decide whether or not the scenery can stay in place or needs to be moved to make way for other things in the house.

A wooden board is recommended, as it is strong and not likely to bend. Cardboard would need to be thick or layered and is not likely to be as effective as wood.
 Hobby brands such as Woodland Scenics have a great range of scenic cement but if you want a cheaper option, make your own using PVA glue, detergent, a glass jar and an eye dropper. Mix half glue half water and two drops of detergent in the jar then shake the mix.
 Put the grass material in a shaker and gently shake on the chosen area.
 Gently drop over area.
, If the scenery did not turn out the way you wanted, put another layer on and repeat until you are happy.

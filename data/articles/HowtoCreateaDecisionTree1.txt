For example, your main problem or decision you need to make might be what car you want to buy.
Focus on one problem or decision at a time in order to reduce confusion and increase clarity.;
, Brainstorming can help you develop ideas. Write down each of the variables associated with the decision that you want the decision tree to help you make. Write them down on a sheet of paper, or in the margin of your main sheet.


For example, if you were making a decision tree for buying a car, your variables might be "price," "model," "fuel efficiency," "style" and "options."

, Find out what parts are the most important to you and write them down in order (from most to least important). Depending on the kind of decision you're making, you can prioritize the variables chronologically, by order of importance, or both.For a simple work vehicle, you might prioritize your car decision tree branches as price, fuel efficiency, model, style and options. If you were buying the car as a gift for your spouse, the priorities might go: style, model, options, price, and fuel efficiency.
One way to understand this is to make a graphic representation of the bigger decision versus the components needed to make the decision. You would place the bigger issue in the center (organizational issues with affect work quality), and the components of the issue would branch out from the center.So, buying a car is the bigger issue, while price and model are factors that affect the final decision.

 Look around for a good, hidden area to build your hideout in.;
, This could be anything, like wooden boards, branches, and rocks. Another suggestion is to make a cave or dig a hole in snow, for example.
 You'll probably want to make it big enough for 2-4 people and make some room for extra items.
 You could cover your hideout with things like leaves or twigs to make it seem like other people think that there's nothing there.
 You could bring in things like lawn chairs for people to sit in, a snack drawer, or pillows and a soft blanket for people to lay on.
 You'll need to make a good door to keep people out whenever you leave your hideout. Again, things found in nature work perfect. You could also improvise by getting a wood board and gluing things on it like bark, leaves, or twigs to give it a more of a nature look.
 This might be a secret hideout for you and your friends, but remember, safety first.

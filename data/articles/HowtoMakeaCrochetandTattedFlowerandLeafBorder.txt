 Work first 2 double stitch, 1 purl, repeat 9 times, join the stitch into a circle.;
, This should consist of 3 double, 5 purl, divided each by 2 double stitches, 4 double.
 Repeat 8 times more, only each following circle must be fastened on to a purl of the preceding circle after 3 double stitches. Having completed each circle, the thread must be drawn through the purl of the first circle, which forms the centre of the rosette.
, For the tatted border, make at short distances 1 loop with 5 double, 1 purl, 5 double. After having worked a sufficient number of such loops, wind another thread round the thread between the loops, turning always 1 loop on the right side and 1 on the left.
 Make for each of these a foundation chain of 12 stitches, crochet back over this chain 2 double in the last stitch but one, 1 double in the next stitch, 1 treble in each of the following 7 chain, 2 treble in the next stitch, 2 treble, 1 long treble, and 2 treble in the next following stitch of the foundation chain.
 Then 3 double in the point of the leaf thus formed.
 Always work 2 double in each stitch of the preceding row, and 3 in the long treble stitch. In working this last round, the circles must be joined to the leaves by taking up the purl stitch of the circle before casting off the corresponding double stitch of the leaf.
 This joins the 2 rows of circles and leaves with a row of chain stitches, on which a row of double is worked.
 Make a row of chain stitches, joining leaves and circles together. Then work 3 rows of treble, work 3 more rows over the tatted border:



First row: entirely in chain stitches. After every fourth stitch take up the purl of the loops on one side.

Second row: 1 treble in the middle stitch of the 3 chain, 2 treble, divided by 3 chain.

Third row: 1 treble, 1 chain, miss 1 under the last. In the last row the leaves and circles must be fastened on the border, as seen in illustration.

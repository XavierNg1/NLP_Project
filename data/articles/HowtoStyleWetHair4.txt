 Create a center part through your hair by dragging the first tooth of a comb down the middle of your scalp. Be sure that the part goes directly through the middle of your head., Spray a small amount of a shine-enhancing product through your hair and comb it through from the roots of your hair to the ends. If your hair is thicker or wavy, you can rub in a small amount of flexible gel throughout your hair.The shine spray or flexible gel will add a glossy look and little bit of hold to your hair. This will help your ponytail look as sleek as possible.
 Gather all of your hair at the nape of your neck. Use an elastic hair tie to secure your hair. As you are making your ponytail, only pull half of your ponytail through the last rotation of the elastic hair tie.This will form a loop in your hair, with the ends of your hair near the bottom of the ponytail base.You should have about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) of hair hanging out from the loop.
 Hold onto the loop with one hand, and wrap the ends of your hair around the base of the ponytail to cover up the elastic hair tie. Push about two or three bobby pins into the wrapped ends and underneath the elastic hair tie.Crisscrossing the bobby pins over each other adds extra hold.
 Finish your hairstyle by lightly misting on some shine spray. Run your hands over the surface of your hair to even out any frizz. This style looks best the shinier and sleeker you make your hair.

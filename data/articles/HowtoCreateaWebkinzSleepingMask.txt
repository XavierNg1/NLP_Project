 Felt is easy to work with and typically cheap, so it's most likely the best choice. Cotton, flannel, and tee shirt fabrics can be hard to work with since they stretch and aren't stiff at all.;
, Tracing around a spool of thread or other small, circular object twice and connecting the circles into a peanut shape usually works pretty well. Draw the lines in chalk or thin pen that won't bleed through the fabric and draw on the "wrong" side.
 Leave a small border on each side if you wish to sew the garment together. Cut out two of the shape and make adjustments if it is too big, leaving the extra border if sewing.
 Use embroidery floss and make sure you're embroidering on the right side of the fabric.
 Pin the wrong sides out if you are sewing, put the right sides out otherwise.
 Elastic is best by far, but ribbon will do. Measure it around the pet's head with the eyemask, adding a bit extra. Pin the ends of the ribbon inside the eyemask unless you are sewing, in which case tuck all of the strap inside your eyemask and leave the ends hanging out.
 If glueing, use either stripes of glue from a hot glue gun or use Tacky Glue or fabric glue. School glue or a glue stick won't stick well.

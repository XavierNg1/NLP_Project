 If you're going to keep it minimalist, that means you need to stick to just one or two pieces of jewelry as your statement piece if possible, such as a necklace, bracelet, or earrings. If you want to wear earrings with a necklace, keep the earrings very minimal, such as basic studs., To keep your look simple, you need clean lines. That means that the lines you create shouldn't overlap. You're essentially using your skin as negative space or background, to give each piece room to breathe. For instance, don't let your necklace go over your shirt line or your bracelet clash with a shirt cuff., If all you're wearing is a pair of dainty earrings, you want people to see them. If you're wearing your hair down, tuck at least one side behind your hair or pull that side back with a clip. That way, people can actually see the jewelry you're wearing.

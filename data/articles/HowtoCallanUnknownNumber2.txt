 If your landline is called and there is no voicemail, you can use a feature called "Call Return" to call the number back. However, this only works for the last call you received, so you will have to call back before you receive any other calls.
 When you dial *69, you will be told any registered information about the caller, such as their name and address. You will also be given the option to call them back. Press 1 to call the number once you are prompted.Dialing *69 tends to cost between 30 and 50 cents a use, unless you subscribe to Last Call Return" through your service provider. In this case, it may cost around 2 dollars a month.
 *69 only works on calls from landlines in your area. If you were called from a cell phone, a long distance or international number, a blocked number, or an 800 or 900 number, you will not be able to use Call Return., If you do not, Call Return will automatically cancel itself after 30 minutes.

Kai-lan: Often referred to as the "Chinese Dora", she brings the viewers into the daily activities that her and her friends do. She always tries to see the positive aspect of situations.






Yeye: Kai-lan's grandfather. He inspires Kai-lan and her friends with advice on how to work out problems.






Hoho: The youngest of Kai-lan's friends. This monkey is filled with energy and loves being in the center of the crowd.






Lulu: Known for having a balloon tied to her nose, this rhino loves to play pretend or tea parties.






Rintoo: Roaring along with Kai-lan in the introduction, this tiger loves race cars and adventure.






Tolee: You can find this panda always thinking of new ideas.

, There's many things or events that could happen. For example, a moon festival, sleepovers, or playing at the beach.
 When Kai-lan introduces the activity, she usually asks the viewer, "Do you want to see how I say _______ in Chinese?", followed by, "Say _______." She'll then repeat it again to encourage the viewer and applaud them.
 Every episode starts off as great and happy, but always comes to a negative point or turn where someone is unhappy, sad, or mad.


For example, in the episode, "Sports Day", Rintoo eventually wins all of the races and says phrases like, "I'm going to win because I'm the best!" and "I'm better than everyone!". These comments makes Tolee and Hoho quit the races and games. Yeye and the others analyze the situation by suggesting that Rintoo should also say something nice and encourage his friends. When this "cause and effect" problem solving is applied, a new lesson is learned.
 It creates more of a bond between everyone to learn, solve, and apply problem solving, as well as the Chinese culture and language into anything.

 A student may feel obligated to smile at you when you look in their direction; however, that smile may be obviously fake and conspicuously dishonest. A fake smile indicates that the student is not feeling well emotionally or physically, but that they do not want to share those feelings with you., Almost everyone blinks their eyes. It’s an involuntary process that keeps the eye organs healthy and lubricated. If you notice a student blinking too much or hardly at all, they may be telling you that they are tired, bored, or distressed., A student may yawn or stretch several times, and this indicates that they are bored, tired, or disinterested. Encourage stretching – even if a student has to stand up to do so – as this promotes blood circulation and increases oxygen levels to the brain, providing a natural burst of energy., Your students’ arms will tell you quite a bit about how the class is receiving your instruction, how they’re feeling about being in the class, and their individual moods. Look at each student’s arms, and then look at the class as a whole for any like behavior.Folded arms indicate the student is closed off and not receptive to the discussion.
Open arms indicate interest, openness, and that student is feeling connected and included.

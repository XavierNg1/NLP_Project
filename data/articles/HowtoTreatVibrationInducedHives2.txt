 Vibration hives, also called vibratory urticaria, are a type of physical urticaria, which means they are hives caused by a physical stimulus. The hives occur on the part of the skin that have contact with the vibration.Most of these hives only last for a short period of time, but can last up to 72 hours.They can appear as quickly as a few minutes after exposure.New studies have found that this type of hives is due to a genetic mutation.
 Vibration hives are caused from some kind of physical vibration to the skin or body. The body confuses the vibrations as an attack, and the immune system reacts by causing welts or other inflammation on the body.These vibration hives occur most often from machinery, such as lawn mowers, moving cars, and jackhammers. They can also be caused by drums, loud bass beats, and even hand clapping., When a person has a negative reaction to vibrations, large itchy or painful welts or bumps occur on the skin. These bumps can be read or skin colored.The condition may also cause a red flush to the skin.Additional symptoms include blurry vision and a metallic taste in the mouth.
You may also experience some burning and pain.Symptoms typically occur a few minutes after exposure. They usually go away an hour or two later.

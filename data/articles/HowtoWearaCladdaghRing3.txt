 Many Irish people wear Claddagh rings as a symbol of their Irish heritage, rather than as a way to display their romantic status. Claddagh rings may be worn on any finger and may be turned in either direction, whichever is most comfortable for the person wearing the ring. They don't have to be worn to indicate a romantic status, and can be worn on the left ring finger without a relationship or engagement or a marriage.


Some people wear Claddagh rings on necklace chains, rather than on their fingers.
Claddagh rings may also be worn on bracelets, or kept in the pocket as a charm.
 Claddagh rings make meaningful gifts for friends and relatives, whether or not romance is involved in the equation. If you received a Claddagh ring as a gift and would prefer not to wear it to show your romantic status, it's just fine to wear it however you choose.

 The amount of electric power mobile device chargers can give out to its supported devices is measured in “Amperes rating.” Charger ampere ratings can be found written on the charger itself. Device manufacturers are required to display this information on mobile chargers so you can be sure that the one you’re using has one. Common ampere ratings of chargers for iPhones and iPods range from 1 Ampere (1 A) to 2 Amperes (2 A), while large devices like iPads typically have 2.5 A to 3 A ratings.;
, After knowing the current Ampere rating of the charger you’re using, purchase an iOS device charger from your local electronic store or nearest Apple Store with a higher rating. You can purchase iOS chargers for around $20, regardless of its Ampere rating.
 Connect your data cable to your new charger, plug the charger to a power outlet, and connect your iOS device to start charging. Measure the time it takes to charge your iOS device and compare it to the time it takes to fully charge your device using your old charger. Since the new charger you’re using gives out more power to your iOS device, it should decrease the time it takes to fill its battery.

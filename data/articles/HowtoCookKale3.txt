 Select a large heavy saucepan and heat it over medium-high heat. Add several tablespoons of olive oil the pan and let the oil heat until it starts shimmering.Ensure that your pan is large enough to hold all of the kale. If the pan is too small, the kale won't cook evenly or could take much longer to saute.
 Once the oil is shimmering, add a few cloves of minced garlic and let it cook for about 30 seconds. Turn the heat up to high and add 1/2 cup of chicken or vegetable stock. Stir in the kale so the mixture is combined.If you don't have any stock, you can use water. You may just need to add more seasoning to the sauteed kale.
 Cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and cook the kale on high for 5 minutes. Take the lid off of the pot and keep cooking the kale for a few minutes until the stock or water evaporates. Season the kale to taste and serve it right away.You'll want to salt and pepper the kale. Sauteed kale also goes well with a few tablespoons of red wine vinegar.
 You can easily serve sauteed kale on its own as a side dish or include it in an entree. Stir sauteed kale into cooked pasta or soup to add instant flavor and nutrition. Consider substituting collard greens or chard with sauteed kale the next time you're planning a menu.


You could also saute apples and bacon to stir into the sauteed kale. Sprinkle the dish with pecans or walnuts and serve it while it's still warm.

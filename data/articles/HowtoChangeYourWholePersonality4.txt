 Truly, the only way you'll see change in yourself is if you add something new into your life. To do this, you'll need to pick up new behaviors, new people, and new activities. You can't do the same things over and over and expect different results.


Start out small. Join a club. Get a job outside your skill set. Start reading up on the subject. What's more, keep yourself out of old environments. You don't want to hang out with people who do the opposite of whatever it is you're trying to achieve.
Condition yourself. If you're afraid of spiders, put yourself in a room with one. Day by day, inch closer to it. Eventually, you'll be sitting next to it. Even later, you'll be holding it. Constant exposure dulls the brain from feeling fear. Now take "spiders" and replace it with whatever your goal may be.
 You'll need some pretty intense self-awareness to stay on track. Keeping a journal will help you sort your thoughts and analyze how you've been handling this change. Write down what's been working and what hasn't to fine-tune your method.
 If throwing yourself into new environments is hard, think of it this way: stop turning opportunities down. If you see a sign that the old you would deem uninteresting, give it a second look. If a friend asks you to do something you know absolutely zero about, agree. You'll be all the more better for it.


That being said, make safe decisions. If someone asks you to go jump off a cliff, don't do it. Use your brain.

 Learn to feel good about what you accomplish by setting goals that you can achieve. Donâ€™t aim to be the next Olympic star or Pulitzer Prize winner today. These are admirable goals, but work up to them: set measurable goals, and when you achieve those, set the bar a little higher.


Perfectionists tend to quit projects when they can't accomplish them perfectly. When you break a project down into smaller, achievable goals, fear of failure will be less likely to drive you to quit.
With each small goal you achieve, you'll build confidence, allowing you to stretch yourself even more.
 We all have voices of self-doubt. The trick is to silence them and focus on the positives. Being self-critical limits what you say or do; it has the effect of making your world smaller. As a perfectionist, it's important to develop confidence and be less judgmental of yourself.


If you tend to criticize yourself, change your mental reaction when things go wrong. For example, instead of telling yourself "that was stupid of me," try telling yourself, "I know I tried my best."
Be as kind to yourself as you would to a beloved friend or family member. If you wouldn't say something to them, don't say it to yourself.
 It's not easy for a perfectionist to admit to insecurities. It makes the person feel vulnerable and uncomfortable. But sharing your internal experience with others is a great way to be more open to having deeper relationships with the people in your life. Expressing your insecurities to others can help you recognize them yourself. Once you recognize your personal failures, you are one step closer to accepting them.
As a perfectionist, resist the urge to always be "strong," in the stereotypical sense. Realize that allowing yourself to be vulnerable is a sign of emotional strength.

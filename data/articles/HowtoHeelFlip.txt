 Put the toe of your back foot at the corner of the tail. Place your front foot in the middle of the board, closer to the nose. The toe of your front foot should hang off the edge a bit.


Your feet should be parallel with each other, creating a sort of diagonal line across the board.
You can do this trick when you're moving or practice it from a stationary position.;
, Give it a firm push to tip it toward the ground as you're moving. As you push, keep your knees bent and crouch down to get ready to jump. You want to crouch so low that your fingers can touch the ground. Otherwise, you won't be able to generate enough power to flip the board.
 When you hear the tail hit the ground, come out of your crouch. As you jump, you want to kick forward with your front foot so that your heel spins the board forward. This will cause the board to flip around under you while you're still in the air.


Give the board a good hard shove with your front foot. Otherwise, it won't flip all the way around.
Be sure to stay above the board; don't let it move from side to side.
Make sure your jump has enough height. You don't want the board to get caught under your feet.
 Come out of your jump by landing squarely on the board, which should be directly under you. Try to land on the bolts. Doing this will provide a safer, smoother landing, and prevent your board from snapping.

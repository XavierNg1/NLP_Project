 Know where they stand with each other. Find out whether their split was amicable, bitter, or somewhere in between.If their current relationship is openly vicious, brace yourself for the extra drama and stress that this will undoubtedly add to your own relationships with the father and his child.If their current relationship is quite friendly, politely but firmly establish yourself as the father’s new partner. Appreciate the fact that the two have a prior intimacy that may inform their interactions, but don’t be afraid to speak up when you believe either one has crossed a line., Remember that she’s the child’s parent. Understand that she will always occupy a space in the child’s life, and vice versa. Accept the fact that, to some degree, you will have to hold yourself accountable to her as a presence in her child’s life.Even if she’s a negligent or otherwise poor parent, remember that her status as mother will never change. Don’t feel obligated to respect the woman, but do respect the fact that she will always play some sort of role in both the father and child’s life.
 Even if you can’t stand each other, make a point of being civil. Earn respect and/or the moral high ground by showing respect in order to better ensure a positive atmosphere for all concerned, especially the child.Also be aware that the child will feel more loyalty toward their mother than they will toward you.Earn their respect by always treating their mother with courtesy.
 If the father is a widower, accept the mother’s continued presence in both his life and the child’s. Allow them to speak freely of her so they can honor her memory and so you can evaluate how each is coping with their loss. Although a jealous twinge here and there may be a perfectly natural knee-jerk reaction, avoid poisoning your relationships by making the father and/or child feel like they must suppress her memory in your presence.

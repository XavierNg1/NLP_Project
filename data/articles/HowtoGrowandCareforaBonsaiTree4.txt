 When you deem the tree's shape to be finished, it's time to move it away from the training container. Beautiful ceramic and wooden containers are available for you to display your bonsai to best effect. Choose one that complements the bonsai style you have created. Be sure to repot it carefully so that the roots are not damaged, and use a container big enough to hold the amount of soil (and nutrients) that are necessary for the tree to stay healthy.


Choose a container that is as long as your tree is tall. The thicker the trunk of your tree, the deeper the container should be., While the bonsai should be the star of the show, adding a few additional elements can add to the beauty of your bonsai display. Stones and rocks, shells, and tiny plants can be used to make the tree look as though it is part of a forest or beach scene.


Be sure not to crowd the roots with stones or other objects.
Adding some moss is a great way to create an intriguing display.
 A beautiful bonsai deserves to be displayed like any other work of art. Choose a wooden or metal display stand and place it against a blank wall, so that the bonsai will stand out. Placing it near a window is a good idea, since the bonsai will continue to need sunlight while it's on display. Continue watering, fertilizing, and caring for the bonsai, and your work of art will stay alive for many years.

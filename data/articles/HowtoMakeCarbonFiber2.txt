 Quickly press sheets of carbon fiber cloth into the mold. As with applying the resin, make sure you completely cover all sections of the interior mold with the fiber cloth. If there are particularly small corners or angles, you may want to consider pressing the fiber cloth into the crannies with a screwdriver or other small tool., Spray the inside of the mold with more resin. The fiber cloth should be completely saturated with the resin. This is what bonds the fibers of the cloth together and gives carbon fiber its strength., To avoid dirt and dust falling into the resin and to get the fiber cloth to conform better to the mold, you can bag the mold. This means placing a bag over the mold with a vacuum attachment. Then, use a vacuum pump (or for a crude version a vacuum cleaner) to pull suction on the bag. This will also help the resin dry faster., Heating the carbon fiber part will speed up the curing process. You should heat the part to between 250 °F (121 °C) and 350 °F (177 °C) for several hours. Alternatively, you can allow the part to cure more slowly without heat. This usually takes at least 24 hours.Most resins will not cure well below 60 °F (16 °C).
You should not cure the part in a kitchen stove. The fumes given off smell terrible and they are toxic. You need an autoclave or other heat source for the curing process.

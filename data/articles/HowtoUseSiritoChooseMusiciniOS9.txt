 By default, Siri is activated, but if not, then you have to enable Siri through the Settings menu:


Go to the Settings app by pressing on your home button and tapping on Settings (the grey gear icon).
On the left pane of the Settings screen, tap “General.” The right pane will change to display options for this section. From these options, select “Siri.”
On top of the “Siri” pane, you will see the “Siri” slider (or toggle switch). Tap the slider and it will turn green. Select “Enable Siri” when prompted.
You can also have “Hey Siri” activated. With “Hey Siri” enabled, you can just say “Hey Siri” to start searching using Siri if your device is connected to a power source. To enable “Hey Siri,” go to the Siri screen and toggle on “Allow ‘Hey Siri.’” Below the “Hey Siri” toggle are the customization options for “Hey Siri,” including language and voice gender.;
, Do this until you hear a chime and see Siri’s welcome greeting on the screen. Siri will have voice recognition activated; this will be indicated by the soundbar at the bottom of the screen.


If you want to exit Siri, press the Home button once more.
 Say “Play” then the title of the song you want to hear. Enunciate the words clearly, and make sure you pronounce it right. You can edit the search query on the search bar that appears on the top of the screen. You can also press the microphone icon on the bottom of the screen to dictate your request again.
 You can also tell Siri to play audiobooks, podcasts, playlists, and specific artists. Say “Play” then the name of the audiobook, podcast, playlist, or artist, and Siri will play those for you as well.

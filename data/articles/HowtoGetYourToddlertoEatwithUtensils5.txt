 Your toddler may be ready to use a spoon by the time she reaches 12 to 15 months old. However, if you have not introduced her to finger foods by that time, you should do so before starting to teach her how to use a spoon. Eating finger foods will help your child to learn how to bring food to her mouth. Finger foods include:


Chunky slices of fruits and vegetables.
Dry crackers and cereals.
 After your toddler has gotten used to eating with finger foods, you may notice that she starts eyeing your utensils during Mealtime. She might even indicate her desire to hold a spoon. If you see this happening, allow her to try using the spoon all by herself.


Be prepared for a mess and always remember to applaud her efforts.
 By the 18th month, your child will most likely have figured out how to use the spoon properly though there will still be times when she will revert back to using her hands to feed herself. She will revert back to finger foods because at this stage her dexterity is still not that developed.


To help your childâ€™s dexterity, give her foods that will stick to the surface of the spoon.

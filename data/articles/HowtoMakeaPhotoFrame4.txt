 You'll be gluing the picture right onto the wooden frame. If you don't want to glue directly onto the picture, or if you want a border around the picture, mount it on, or simply tape it to, a piece of high-quality paper or cardstock.
 Use thin wooden slats about an inch wide, or 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) square dowels. They should be about an inch longer than the width of the picture.
 With the simplicity of this frame, staining the wood often looks best. However, you can also paint it a solid color or decorate it with paint if you want.
 Center the picture horizontally, and make sure the wood is perfectly straight and level across the top. Glue the wood on top of the picture so that the picture is visible underneath. If you find that you have to cover too much of the picture, use another piece of paper under the picture and glue the wood to that instead.
 Get a piece of string that you will use to hang the picture. It should be 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) long, depending on the size of your picture. Screw small hooks into the back of the wood about halfway between the edge of the picture and the edge of the wood. Tie the string onto these hooks.









If you don't want to use hooks, simply hot glue the string to the wood. This will be secure enough, and it won't show from the front of the frame.

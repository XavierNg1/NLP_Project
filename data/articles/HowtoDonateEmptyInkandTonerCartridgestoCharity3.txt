 If you're worried about producing too much waste, you can actually reuse most ink and toner cartridges. Stores like Walgreens and Costco will often refill cartridges for you. This cuts back on plastic waste, and may also save you some money., You can also work on using less ink and paper overall to reduce your carbon footprint. Try to fill out forms electronically when possible. Avoid printing out things like plane and bus tickets, instead relying on a digital bar code you can pull up on your smart phone. If you print things out to read them later, try to transition into reading from a screen.
 Ink and toner cartridges are not the only recyclables you can donate to charity. Anything that can be recycled, like cardboard, cans, and bottles, can usually be donated to charity. Be on the lookout for recycling drives in your area. Give your recyclables to organizations in need.

 Hold the bulk of the bandana in one hand and pull the corner until the fabric rips. The strip will tear away in a straight line. Keep going until you have removed the strip from the rest of the bandana.
 Take a small bowl or cup and fill it half way up with water. Put the bandana strip in the water. Move it around slightly The fabric may be a bit resistant to water, so give it a couple minutes to soak. Remove the bandana strip and squeeze out the excess water.
 Twist each end with your fingers. Twist one end away from you, and twist the other end toward you. Eventually you will meet in the middle and have one long twisted piece of fabric.
 Hold one end in your right hand. Use your fingers and hold the bandana in place against your palm. Wrap the bandana around with your wrist with your left hand.
 Bring the bandana around your wrist again. Stop when the end in your left hand reaches your palm again.
 You might want to leave a little slack in the bracelet so it fits comfortably on your wrist. Just be sure you don't make it too loose so that it falls off easily. Once you tie the knot you won't be able to adjust it, so find a comfortable fit first.
 Keep the right end in place with your right fingers and your palm. Bring the left end over the right, then underneath. Wrap the left end around your finger and pull the right end through to make the knot.









Try resting your arm against a table to help hold the bracelet in place if you are tying the knot yourself. You may also need to use your teeth to grab and hold pieces.
You may want to ask a friend to help to tie the knots if possible. Having an extra set of hands will make tying the bracelet much easier to do.
 Use the scissors to trim the excess off the ends. You can leave the knot on top or tuck it underneath the bracelet if you want.

 An APK file is the Android package format. This is the format that all Android apps come in. You can download a hacked Sims FreePlay APK from a variety of places, such as Piratebay. See this guide for details on using torrents to download the file.
 Plug your phone into your computer via the USB cable and copy the APK file to your phone's root directory. You can also email the APK file to yourself and download the attachment on your phone.


If you copy the APK to your phone, you will need to install a file explorer app on the phone to access it, such as ESFileExplorer.

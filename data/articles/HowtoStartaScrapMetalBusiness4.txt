 Even if you're strong and in great shape, most scrap hauling is at least a two person job. Figure out a fair salary for an employee or share in the profits with a partner.


If your business focuses only on more manageable items, such as wires and electronics, you can start out on your own.
 Major sources include businesses that use and discard metal and homeowners throwing away bulky items like refrigerators and air conditioners. You may even choose to buy used cars at scrap prices.


The business transaction that comes from obtaining your scrap will vary. Many commercial sources will require payment from you. However, if you advertise as a junk-disposal business to consumers, you can often obtain scrap for free or even charge for your service.
 Take out ads in your local newspaper, post your business on online forums, and flyer door to door. Let your neighbors know that you are starting a scrap metal business and ask them to send any discarded metal your way., A larger local scrap yard or recycling center are some options. You can also advertise scrap metal that you have for sale. If you decide to start a scrap yard, it can be open to the public at certain times for customers to browse and buy., Optimize the efficiency of your business by organizing your time. Set aside different day(s) to obtain scrap, sort and dismantle metal, and delivering it to buyers. Keep at it to make sure your operation runs smoothly. If you neglect any of these three tasks, the work can build up and make doing the other two impossible.

 When you first set up your dachshundâ€™s crate, take the door off (or prop open the door, if this isn't possible) and allow the dog to explore it freely. If your dog does not approach the crate on its own, use gentle encouragement; drop treats near the entrance to the crate, or toss treats and toys inside to encourage your dog to go in. This process may take several days, so time and patience are absolutely necessary. Once your dog warms up to the crate, re-attach the door., If your dog enters the crate willingly, begin feeding it regular meals in there to create positive associations. If your dog eats inside without making a fuss for several, consecutive meals, try closing the door during mealtime; open the door as soon as it finishes its meal. If it whines, cries, or acts aggressively as a result of being in the crate, shorten the time that the door is closed and open it sooner; if your dog seems comfortable, prolong the time, keeping the door closed for an additional ten minutes after it finishes eating., Once your dachshund is comfortable with the process of eating in its crate, start practicing longer crating periods. Gently coax it towards the crate with a treat; encourage your dog to go in, then close the door behind it and feed it the treat. Stay in the room and sit by the crate for about 5-10 minutes; leave the room and wait another 5 minutes or so before returning to let your dog out. Repeat this process several times a day, and gradually increase crating time.Dachshunds can be irritable and quick to bite, so be cautious when coaxing your pet into the crate and letting it out after.

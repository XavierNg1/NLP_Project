 First, place the jar on a hard surface. Next, grasp the jar tightly in your non-dominant hand. If the jar has a lot of condensation on it, wrap the jar in a dish towel. The more secure your grip is, the easier it will be to insert the spoon.
 Use your dominant hand to force the tip of the spoon between the lip of the lid and the side of the jar. The side of the spoon that holds food should be facing away from the pickle jar. The swell of the spoon will angle the handle away from the pickle jar to create a lever.


If you’re having trouble inserting the spoon, try a few different spots around the lid.
 Use the handle of the spoon like a lever, pressing it until you hear a gentle “swooshing” sound. This is the sound of the airtight seal between the jar and the lid releasing.Take care not to press the spoon too hard or you will bend the spoon.
 Now that the seal is broken the jar should be easy to open. If not, there may be food stuck under the lid. In this case, drape a rubber glove or dish towel over the lid to help force open the jar.

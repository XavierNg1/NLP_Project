 This will take you back to your desktop screen. You will see a narrow rectangle pop-up on your screen, with a flashing green bar, and a red dot that says "Start Recording."

, As you begin recording, you may notice the slider changing colors from green to yellow to red. These indicate the volume of your recording. Green is a good volume and yellow means that your recording might be too loud and you should speak softer. Red means that you are speaking too loudly. You'd want to stay in the green or yellow area.


Recordings that are too loud may sound staticky.
 This will not only stop the recording, but give you a chance to save it.
 When you hit "Stop Recording," you will get a pop-up that asks you to select a location in which to save the file. You will also get to name your recording. Name your file first, then select the folder in which you want to save your file. Click "Save."

 Despite that it's not his WWF actual debut, the "Kane" character has made him what he is now in the company. Feuding with the Undertaker, Kane has had an emerging violent and out-of-control rage upon their "family secret" and what has happened to him.;
, Kane initially kidnapped Lita and used her to dominate his feuders, especially Matt Hardy (whom was Lita's off/on screen boyfriend at the time of this storyline). Lita became the ultimate heel of this storyline when she turned on Kane and became with Edge (whom betrayed Matt Hardy and started a relationship with Lita in real life).
 The movie actually brought up a personal WWE storyline for Kane with the words "May 19th". May 19th was the date that the movie came out and Kane would go berserk at anyone who would mention the date around him.
 The episode, "Combat", features Kane as a phantom in a crate yard. This episode also features Ashley Massaro (Diva Search winner) who also plays as a villain.

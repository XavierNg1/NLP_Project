 The SSA requires you to make an appointment during which you will file your disability claim.


Call the SSA appointment line at 1-800-772-1213 and choose an appointment time. You can file for disability at any SSA office in your local area.
If you are deaf or hearing impaired, call 1-800-325-0778 to make your appointment.
 After you arrive at the SSA office for your appointment, you will be asked to fill out an application and other paperwork regarding your disability, which will then be submitted to the SSA and the Utah DDS for review.


Bring all the documentation you compiled for filing disability; such as your medical records, employment information, tax information, and military discharge form.

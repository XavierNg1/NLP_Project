 Locate the Photos app on your home screen or app drawer. The icon is a colorful pinwheel. Tap to open the app.
 You will have to turn on the Auto Backup option to get professional-looking movies automatically made from your photos and videos. Auto Backup ensures you don’t lose the original photos.


The welcome screen will display a message allowing you to either “Turn on Auto Backup” or select “No thanks.” Tap “Turn on Auto Backup” to enable this option.
For those who have already selected “No thanks” previously will be reminded again on reopening the app if they wish to turn on the Auto Backup feature.
 Auto Awesome will take your photos and videos, and create movies out of them. It just takes a copy of your photos to make a movie. Auto Awesome will select a few photos taken on the same day and stitch them together into a movie. It will let you know when it has already made an Auto Awesome movie for you.


There is no limit to the photos and videos which will be turned into a movie.
 You will be notified as soon as your movie is made for you. Now you can tap the play icon to preview your movie. If you don’t like the movie, you can always delete it and redo another movie using the create icon on the main app screen.
 If you like the movie created by Auto Awesome, tap the options menu on the top right corner, and select “Download.” The movie will be saved in your Gallery.

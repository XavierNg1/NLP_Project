 Avoid getting into trouble for doing something that your parents might have allowed if you had only asked for permission. Say a friend is having a party at their house while their parents are out of town; some parents might say no to this, but others may be persuaded to say yes. Consider your situation and whether or not your parents are likely to be persuaded.
 If they’re already mad, worried, or otherwise stressed about something else, wait for a time when they’re less likely to dismiss you with an instant no. Seize the opportunity when they’re more relaxed and willing to consider your proposal., If they say no, wait for when they have more time to hear you out. If you do have to wait, open again by asking if they have a minute. Let them know that you expect to have a conversation, not an instant one-word answer. Increase their likelihood of saying yes by letting them know that they don’t have to answer immediately., Tell your parents that you don’t expect an answer this minute. Invite them to talk it over or sleep on the idea. Acknowledge that they might have concerns about your proposal and, by doing so, prove yourself to be both mature and considerate toward others., If your parents still seem indecisive or leaning toward “no,” volunteer to do extra chores or accept other responsibilities. Show them you’re mature enough to work for something that you really want.Or, make compromises. Propose the same conditions that you expect they would stipulate before they can: give your own curfew, for example, or promise to call every hour.

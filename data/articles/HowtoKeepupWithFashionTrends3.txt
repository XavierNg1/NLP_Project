 Having a smaller closet means more room for seasonal and trending items.


Throw away old styles. Make space for new items by throwing away the clothes you don’t wear.
Be honest. If you haven’t worn something in a year, you could probably get rid of it.Throw away items that do not fit you anymore. We all have sentimental pieces of clothing. However, clothing clutter will only keep you from expanding your style.
 Keep a small collection of your favorite basic items, such as well-fitting jeans and t-shirts. These items are timeless. You can pair them with trendier items you buy.


Small items, like jackets and shoes are a good way to spruce up your basics.
 Make sure you are keeping track of everything you own. This will force you to be honest about what you are actually wearing. It will also help as you continue to refresh your wardrobe.

Not only will it keep your teeth nice and healthy, it will allow your dentist to identify any problems that are emerging before they get too serious.As you age, the nerves in your teeth become less sensitive. This means that you may not be able to feel it when problems begin to emerge. This is why it is so important to have regular exams as you age.
 If you do think that you have a problem with your teeth, you should get it looked at as soon as possible. Even if you are scared of the potential pain of a dental visit or you have a limited budget and you are concerned about the cost of dental procedures, it is still a good idea to get your issue checked out.

Two common treatments are fluoride varnish and fissure sealants.Fluoride varnish is a treatment in which a strong fluoride is applied to the teeth. This application makes the enamel on the teeth stronger and less likely to decay. It can be applied every six months.

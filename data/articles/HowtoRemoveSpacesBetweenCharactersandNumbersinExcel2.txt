 The cell must be on the same row as the first line of data in the column with the spaces.

For example, if you want to remove spaces from column C, and C’s first row of data is in row 2 (C2), click the second cell in your blank column (e.g. E2, F2, G2, etc).
, For example, if you want to remove all of the spaces from the C column, click the first box (e.g. C2) in the column that isn’t the title.

If you clicked cell C2, the formula should now look like this: =Substitute(C2 .
 The cell should now look like this: =Substitute(C2,., There’s a space between the two sets of quotes—this is important.

The formula should now look like this: =Substitute(C2," ",.
 This time, there’s NO space between the sets of quotes.

The formula should now look like this: =Substitute(C2,” “,””).
 You will now see the contents of the selected cell (C2, in this example) without spaces in the new column.

For example, if C2 said w ww . wikih ow .com, your new cell will say www.wikihow.com.
 The cell should now be highlighted., The data from each corresponding cell will now appear in your new column without spaces., Your new space-free data is now in place.

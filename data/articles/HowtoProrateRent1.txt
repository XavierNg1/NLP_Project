 Total monthly rent is the amount of rent charged every month that the tenant will occupy the apartment, condo or house for a full month. Divide the total monthly rent amount by the number of days in the month to determine a daily rent rate.


Use the current month. January, March, May, July, August, October and December have 31 days. April, June, September and November have 30 days. February has 28 days except for leap years, when it has 29 days.
For example, in September, if you were paying $900 a month, you would divide 900 by 30 since September has 30 days. This equals a daily rent rate of $30.;
, Multiply this daily rent rate by the total number of occupancy days to determine the prorated rent amount.Number of occupancy days is how many days you will be renting the apartment before the first day of the next month begins.For example, if you moved in on September 20, your number of occupancy days is 11 (just like hotels book rooms, you include the day you move in). 11 days x 30$/day = 330$ total.
ANSWER = x # of days youâ€™re staying

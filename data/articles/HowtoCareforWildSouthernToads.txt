 Most toads are confused as they have similar features. A southern toad has two rough bumps on their heads, and are likely to have small bumps (also called warts) surrounding their skin. Most people believe toads give you warts. This is not true.;
, Toads are most likely to be caught at night. Around 8:00-9:00 P.M., check your around your yard for hopping creatures. Check around ponds and edges of forests. Toads can be quick and if you are using your hands to capture them, they will urinate on you. If they do this, carry the toad to a safe area and wash your hands with soap and water until clean.
 Toads can live in a variety of habitats but be sure to re-make their environment like where you found them. If you find them on concrete, be sure to provide a bowl of water, no deeper than their noses or drowning may occur. Make sure you have 2-3" of soil, sand, or potting soil for your toad to burrow in. Also, give shelters like a half-coconut shell house, or tilted bark for sleeping. If you cannot find your toad, there are two possibilities. Either your toad managed to escape, or it is burrowing. Some toads are able to change their coloring to blend (camouflage). You may be surprised to see your toad right under your nose! (Not literally.)

, Toads eat earwigs, crickets, grasshoppers, minnows, ants, cockroaches, dragonflies, butterflies, moths, worms, carpenter ants, flies, and other small insects. You can catch these insects, buy them, or raise them. Toads will only eat live food. Feed your toad at least 10 insects a day.

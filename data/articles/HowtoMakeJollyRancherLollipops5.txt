 Once the candy melts, you will have to work quickly, so it is a good idea to have everything you need on hand, including: the candy, lollipop sticks, a spoon or spatula, and the mold., You can either use a plastic candy-making mold with grooves for lollipop sticks, or you can modify a silicon ice cube mold.

If you wish to use a silicon ice cube mold, make shallow slits along the edges of each shape. Do not make the slits too deep; you still want the bottom portion of the mold left whole., Place the lollipop sticks into the slit of each mold. Only the first inch or two of the lollipop stick should be in the mold; the rest should be sticking out.

You may see a slight gap between the mold and the candy. Don't worry if you do. This will not cause the candy to spill out; the melted candy is thick and it hardens quickly.
 Select several candies that are the same color/flavor, unwrap them, and place them into a small cooking pot., Heat the candy and wait until it melts. Watch the pot carefully, so that you do not scorch the candy., Once the candy has melted, take the pot off the stove, and pour the liquid into the molds. If necessary, use a spoon or spatula to help guide the melted candy into the mold., Leave the mold undisturbed while the candy cools. This will take at least 15 to 20 minutes. After that, place the mold into the freezer for 10 minutes., Once the candy has fully cooled and hardened, pull the mold out of the freezer and pop the candy out of the mold., You can either wrap the finished lollipops with cellophane, or you can place them into an air-tight container. Keep the lollipops some place cool and dry to prevent them from becoming sticky.

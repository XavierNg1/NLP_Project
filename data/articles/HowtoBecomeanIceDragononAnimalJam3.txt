 Here is how say you want to hunt a wolf. Go to step 2 of hunting.
 You can't really eat a jammer, but pretending to is ok, as long as the other jammer roleplays too.
 Say stuff like *chases wolf and hits so hard with ice blast falls*. If the wolf listens, say *eats wolf*. Sometimes they may not like it and attack back and you may fight for your food! Sometimes you may win, others not, but at least you tried.

 Do not be rude to other members in the chat and avoid any direct arguments. That is no name calling and personal attacks.That will get you banned from the channel.;
, That is no porn and no rude jokes or comments. That will get you instantly banned from the channel.
 As most IRC channels will give you a warning or you could just be kicked and banned from the channel without warning. But some IRC channels may not be as strict as others about this. Play it safe and do not do it.
 And if you are on a Linux channel do not talk about Windows. As many channels may mistake this for trolling and that will get you banned. This applies even more if you are criticizing the other operating system.
 As you don't know the members very well and a lot of people don't like this. And may get offended by it. And you could end up getting a warning from a channel bot or human op. And it will also make you unpopular and you do not want to get on the wrong side of people.
 That is do not type lines and lines of text in your conversation or many sentences. As many IRC channels forbid this. If you are having a conversation with other members on IRC, it is best to type very short sentences. If you have to paste, use a pastebin.
 That is if you are a Windows XP user do not say "I hate Windows Vista." As many people take this the wrong way on IRC chat. Even if you do feel this way save it for the forums, not the IRC channel.
 Do not get into an argument as you will only end up being banned from the channel. Also if someone is rude to you, do not respond back, as this will also get you banned. Moderators do not care who started the argument. So if someone is rude to you, just ignore them. Would you do the same if someone in a bar challenged you to a fight? If not, don't do the same here!

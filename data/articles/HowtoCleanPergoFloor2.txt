 For stains from items such as chocolate, grease, juice, or wine, a mixture of lukewarm water and a non-abrasive cleaner should help avoid a stain or other damage to the wood.Ammonia and vinegar are good liquids to mix with the water for liquid stains., Acetone, commonly found in nail polish remover, can be useful for dealing with stains from tar, markers, crayon, lipstick, oil, shoe polish, nail polish, or cigarette burns. Apply a small amount to the stain, then wipe off with a clean, soft cloth., For something tough and solid, like chewing gum or candle wax, use a blunt plastic scraper. Make sure the substance has hardened before trying to scrape it away.


If you donâ€™t want to wait for the substance to harden on its own, use an ice pack to help chill it. Once it is cold and hard, then use the scraper., If you have a large stain that will not come out from any of these other methods, you will need to have part or all of the flooring replaced. Talk to the retailer or installer who provided your Pergo flooring, and discuss replacing the stained area.

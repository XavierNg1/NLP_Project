 Please type in "su -" followed by the password to the root account.


Only the Root user can update, or install things from the ports collection.
 You'll need to install SVN; So type in "cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion" and "make install clean"


If you're using pkg-ing, typing "pkg install subversion" will work too.
 You can type in "svn checkout https://svn0.us-east.FreeBSD.org/ports/head /usr/ports" to connect the folder with subversion, and then "svn update /usr/ports" to update the ports collection

You can replace "us-east" above with either "us-west", or "eu" depending on your location.

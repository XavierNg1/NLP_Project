 If you are making a single mint julep, donâ€™t pour any more ice into the cup. If you created a batch, fill squat cocktail glasses or traditional silver mint julep cups halfway to three-quarters full with ice., If you have made a batch of mint julep, take the refrigerated pitcher of the mint julep mixture out of the fridge, and pour the drink over the ice until it is almost full.


If you want your drink really cold and are using a silver cup, wait until frost forms on the cup before pouring in the mint julep., Place a sprig of mint, or a few mint leaves, in the glass of mint julep. This adds flavor and also makes the drink more aromatic when you are sipping it., After garnishing with mint, sprinkle a pinch of powdered sugar on top of the ice if you wish. The powdered sugar adds a bit more sweetness., Stick a short straw into the drink and serve immediately. If you let the drink sit, the ice will melt and dilute the flavor. The mint julep should taste sweet, minty, and very refreshing!

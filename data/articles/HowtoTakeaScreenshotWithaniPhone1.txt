, The Home button is the round button at the bottom of the iPhone's screen, while the Lock button is on the right side of the iPhone's casing (iPhone 6 and up) or the top of the casing (iPhone 5S and down). The screen will briefly flash white.

 To do so, tap Photos (the white app with a multicolored pinwheel), tap Albums in the bottom-right corner of the screen, and tap Camera Roll in the top-left side of the "Albums" page. Your screenshot will be the first picture here.


If you have iCloud Photo Library enabled on your iPhone, All Photos will be the "Camera Roll" folder.

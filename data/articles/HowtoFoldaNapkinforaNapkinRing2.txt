 This method isn't much harder than the basic "puff" fold above, but it looks incredibly elegant, making it a great choice for when you're trying to impress your friends. To start, lay your napkin flat and fold it in half. Press down on the fold to make a firm crease. Unfold the napkin.For this method, it's more important than normal to use a stiff, square cloth napkin. These sorts of napkins hold creases more easily than paper napkins, making your final "fan" shape look much sharper. In addition, if you don't use a square napkin, the dimensions of your fan may be off.
 Folding parallel to the crease you put in the napkin, make alternating folds from one side to the other. Aim to fit about four to six folds on each side of the central crease â€” the precise number doesn't matter. Press down to form creases as you go. When you're done, your folded-up napkin should be a long, skinny, "accordion-ing" strip.


Note that your original crease should act as one of the folds in your "accordion".You may need to adjust the width of your folds slightly to get them to line up perfectly with the crease. Over time, this gets easier.
 Next, find the middle point of your accordion-ed strip and fold it over itself so that its edges line up. This should leave you with one round, folded end (probably too thick to crease at this point) and one open, fanned-out end.
 Now, all you need to do is put the napkin in your ring. Pull the ring up over the folded end of your napkin until it's about halfway up. Pull on the edges of the open end of your napkin to fan it out and display the accordion-ed folds. Congratulations! You're done.


As usual, you can make a bold statement by simply putting this folded-up napkin in the center of your plate. You may also want to try putting the folded end in a skinny glass or champagne flute for an exotic, peacock-like arrangement.

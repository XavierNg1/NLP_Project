 First, you need to defeat the Pokémon league champion in Black 2 because only then can you unlock the migrate features of the game. To defeat the Pokémon league champion, you just have to play through the storyline of the game.;
, This is near Nimbasa City. Enter the lab and climb the stairs all the way up to the top level. When you get to the top level, talk to the non-playable (NPC) character that will tell you about an “experiment” and ask you if you have another Nintendo DS.


Select “Yes.” It will ask another confirmation; just select “Yes” again. This will launch the DS Wireless Communications feature of your Nintendo DS.
 You don’t need to use the first to third generation since Pokémon in those versions can be caught in HeartGold and SoulSilver.



Press the “A” button to launch it, and it will look for nearby DS devices and establish a connection.
Once the two DS establishes a connection, all the Pokémon available for transfer will be displayed on the screen of the second DS (where the fourth-gen game is plugged in).
 Do this using the stylus and press “Yes” to confirm.
 Back on the first DS (where Black 2 is playing), you need to catch all the transferred Pokémon in a mini game by throwing Pokéballs at Pokémon that moves across the screen.


Once you’ve caught all, save the Black 2 game.

 Use a legible font in size 10 or 12 point. Double space the paper unless you are writing block quotations. Set your margins to at least an inch all around, though they can be up to 1 Â½ inches.Number pages beginning with the first page of text.
 You can format your subheads how you wish, but be consistent. You can use the Chicago style for headings, but it is not necessary. The Chicago style has five levels of subheadings:


Level 1: The subheadings should be in bold or italics, centered, with title-case capitalization (remember to capitalize important words).
Level 2: Regular type, centered, title-case capitalization.
Level 3: Bold or italics, justified left, title-case capitalization.
Level 4: Roman type, justified left, sentence-case capitalization (capitalize the first word and after colons).
Level 5: Bold or italic, part of the paragraph, sentence-case capitalization, and end punctuation.
 You can either create a title page or place a title on the first text page. Either way, the title should be centered.


On the title page, include other biographical information below the title, such as the author and date.

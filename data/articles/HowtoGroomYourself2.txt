 The standard is to shower at least once daily using a mild, gentle soap. Avoid harsh soaps, which will strip your skin of moisture.Be sure to scrub in all of the crevices – behind the knees, between your toes, under your arms and so on.
Avoid hot showers and baths – use warm water instead.
Using hot water can strip the oils from your skin.
 Wet your toothbrush and put a dollop of toothpaste (about the size of a small pea) on the bristles. Gently brush each tooth in a circular motion, taking care to clean the front, back, and sides of every tooth. Brush your tongue with your toothbrush to remove any buildup on it, which is one of the main causes of bad breath.Gargle with an antibacterial mouthwash after brushing your teeth.Be sure to swish it all around in your mouth, including between your teeth.
Get a new toothbrush every three months, or whenever the bristles start to fray and bend.
 Wrap most of it around the middle fingers of each hand, leaving one or two inches between them. Gently push the strand between every tooth, sliding the floss up and down. Wrap the floss around the base of each tooth to remove debris, making sure you go beneath the gumline., This will help you control any sweating you do during the day, as well as manage any body odor you might have. If you’d prefer to use something more natural and with fewer chemical additives, check your local health food store for options.

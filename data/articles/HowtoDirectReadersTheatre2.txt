 This step is important as it lets people know what you're doing and to come and join in. Before you advertise, it's a good idea to have a catchy name and descriptive phrase and a distinctive graphic design for your Theatre's name. Use colors that stand out, to grab people's attention. And have an email address and phone number ready for taking messages so that these can be included with the advertising materials. It's a good idea to encourage people to join early, so that you can begin to get an idea of numbers; to this end, try to include an early joining incentive as part of your advertising, such as a discount, if you're charging fees or an extra ticket for family for the final show. Some ways to advertise include:


A good way to advertise is to get a magnetic giant sticker with your organization's name, phone number and your goal for actors (short, like a catchy motto), and put it on your car. Every time you drive, people will see it.

Put a classified ad in the newspaper. It will cost a little more, but a lot of people may see it. Ask whether this is also repeated in the online version of the newspaper––classifieds often are now.
Get picket signs with your key information printed on them and put them up around town (with permission) to advertise.
Make small posters and flyers. Place these in strategic locations like local shop windows (ask first), library bulletin boards, school message boards, washateria board, church boards, etc. Wherever people gather in a community space is a good place to advertise.
Set up a Twitter and Facebook account. Share the links with friends and ask them to pass it on. Leave useful information on both accounts and update regularly to keep people noticing your presence.

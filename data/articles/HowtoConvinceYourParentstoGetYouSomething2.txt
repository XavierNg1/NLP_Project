 Consider what your parents like or would like to be done around the house. Maybe your dad dreads cleaning the house on the weekends, or your mom cleans out the cat’s litter box every other day. Offer to do something they do often around the house for a month or two. If you do a satisfactory job after the first month, your parents have to get you what you want.


Many parents want their kids to succeed in school. If there is a subject you are bad at, offer to improve your grades. Getting an after school tutor will show your parents your dedication.
 Most likely, your parents will appreciate that you offered to pay for a portion of it. This will also show your parents how dedicated you are to getting this item.


If your parents ask you to pay for half of it, do not back out of your offer. Stick to your word and pay the share you promised.
 Ask for what you want as a gift such as an early birthday or holiday gift. Parents are more likely to help you get what you want for one of these reasons. Choose whatever event is closest.


Consider what your parents usually get you for holidays, and do not ask too much for the circumstance. Your parents might find it insulting if you ask for an Xbox for Valentine’s Day.

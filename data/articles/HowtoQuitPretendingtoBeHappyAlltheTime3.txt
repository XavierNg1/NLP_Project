 If you are unhappy, you should reach out and confide in someone. Just telling someone you trust can be a step to accepting that you are unhappy and trying to figure out how to be happy. This trusted person may be a family member, friend, or professional.This may be someone you have hidden from to protect them. For example, you may have pretended to be happy for your spouse, best friend, or parents. Tell them how you feel instead of protecting them from the truth. It can lead to a stronger, healthier relationship between the two of you.
You may want to tell the person, “Although I may not act like it, I am not unhappy. I have been pretending for a very long time.”

, Sometimes, people are unhappy due to life circumstances. This may be due to a job, a failed relationship, finances, or life stress. However, if you have been unhappy for a long time, you may be suffering from depression. If you are pretending to be happy, you may never discover that you are depressed.


Depression is a serious mental illness that should be treated. By not treating depression, you are putting yourself at risk of both mental and physical side effects, such as fatigue and lethargy, weight gain, and anxiety.
 If you know you are not happy but you cannot stop pretending, you may want to visit a therapist. By talking to a therapist, you can try to work through why you feel you need to pretend, and figure out how to quit pretending to be happy.As you go through this process with a mental health professional, you can work with them to figure out how to be more authentically happy.

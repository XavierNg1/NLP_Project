 This method uses common ingredients, but requires sunlight to finish the process. You will also need to wait for the fabric to air dry before you can tell whether the stain was successfully removed, making it slower than most other methods.


Warning: lemon juice and sun are both capable of harming delicate fabrics, especially silk.
 Submerge the fabric in cold water for a few minutes. While it is soaking, gather up the other materials you will need. This includes lemon juice, salt, and a zip lock plastic bag large enough to contain the clothing., Twist the clothing to remove some excess water. Untwist it and transfer it into a large, resealable plastic bag.
 Pour about 500 mL (2 cups) lemon juice and 120 mL (1/2 cup) salt into the plastic bag and seal it.
 With the bag closed, press the contents together to work the lemon juice into the fabric, focusing on the stained areas. Some of the salt should dissolve, and may help rub the lemon juice into the fabric, or abrade the stain itself.
 Let the bag sit for ten minutes. Take out the fabric from the bag and squeeze out the excess lemon juice.
 Hang the fabric on a clothesline or clothes horse, or spread it on a flat surface and leave it to dry. Do this in a sunny area, not just in front of a heater. It may feel stiff once dry, but this should go away once the item has been washed normally.
 If the blood stain is gone, wash the fabric with water to remove all the lemon salt solution. If the blood stain remains, moisten the fabric and let it dry under the sun again.

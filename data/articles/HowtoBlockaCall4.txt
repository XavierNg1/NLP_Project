The National Do Not Call Registry is managed by the Federal Trade Commission and is designed to stop most telemarketer calls.
Instead of entering numbers you wish to be blocked, you instead type in your phone number so that telemarketers will be prohibited from contacting you.
Don't be discouraged if you still receive calls a few days after registering. Your number must be on the list for 31 days before this registration takes effect. , Also include a working e-mail address so that you can confirm your request.


You can enter up to 3 numbers to be registered on the Do Not Call list.
Double check the phone numbers you have entered. Make sure you have not transposed or omitted any numbers.
Be sure that you have access to the e-mail address you've entered. You will receive a confirmation e-mail that you must click in order to finalize the registration.
 Open the e-mail account you entered on the registration form and search for an e-mail from the website.


Be sure that you click the confirmation link in the e-mail within 72 hours of registration.The link will expire after 72 hours, after which you will have to resubmit the form in order to register.
Remember that registering on this list only stops telemarketer calls, or those who solicit goods and services. You may still receive calls from political organizations, charities, telephone surveyors, and companies from whom you have purchased products. If you wish to block these calls, simply request that you be put on that specific company's do not call list, which they must honor.If you still receive telemarketer calls after the 31 day period, you have the option of filing a complaint on the same website. The icon is located to the far right of "Register a Phone Number."

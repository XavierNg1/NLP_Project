 Three months after your piercing, it should be healed and you will be able to put a different nose-ring in. It is best to get jewellery that has been autoclaved (sterilised with a combination of gas and pressure) and sealed in a pouch. If it has been touched by other people before being inserted, put it in boiling water and wait for the water to cool before removing the jewellery and inserting it into your nose.
 Now that your piercing has healed, you don’t need to clean it twice a day. You can gradually work your way down to cleaning it a couple times a week. Instead of your saline solution, make sure you’re washing it in the shower. Do so with a face cloth (cleaned regularly) and antibacterial soap.
 When putting on face make-up try to avoid your piercing. The chemicals can build up in your piercing hole.

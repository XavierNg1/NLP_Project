 You need somewhere to store all your cool spy gadgets. Anything that flips open like a briefcase (a lunchbox, a pencil box, an old typewriter case, etc.) will feel extra official and sleuthy.There’s also a lot to be said for a spy kit you can have you on at all times and still be able to use both hands, so backpacks and fanny packs are good options too.
Thrift stores are great places to look for spy bags.;
, A good spy can’t be hampered by bad visibility. You’ll need to bring tools to help make sure you don’t miss any important details.A flashlight for snooping into dark corners
A pair of binoculars for scoping things out at a distance
A magnifying glass for getting a close look at top secret materials

, Spies need to be able to pass secret coded messages and record their discoveries. No spy kit is complete without a good pen and a notebook., You never know when you’ll need to call for backup, or let the spymaster know about some urgent new information. Make sure your spy kit includes at least one communication device.A walkie talkie
An old, unused cell phone
A digital watch with a big timepiece that can be spoken into like a communicator

, You need to find out what the person you’re spying on has been up to, and dusting for fingerprints is a great way to do it. Put together a make-believe fingerprinting kit with a few basic household objects.A small container (a baby food bottle, a small sealable plastic food container, or even a ziplock bag) full of flour
A clean makeup powder brush
A roll of transparent tape (for lifting the prints)

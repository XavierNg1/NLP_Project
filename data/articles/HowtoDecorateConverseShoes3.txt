 This will open the shoes up more and give the tongue more flexibility. It will allow you more space to maneuver inside the shoes as you stitch your designs., The rubber toe of your Converses is not suitable for embroidery, but the canvas is ideal.

 A strong, vibrant thread, such as DMC’s Pearl Cotton, will make your design stand out and last for a long time. When selecting thread, consider that thicker gauge thread will be more difficult to push through the canvas than a thinner thread., Chenille needles have very sharp tips and a larger eye. The sharp tip will be better able to penetrate the stiff canvas of your Converses more easily, and the larger eye will make threading thicker thread easier.The needles of most home sewing machines will be too fine to successfully sew through the side of your Converses. To keep from wrecking your sewing machine, embroider an item like this by hand.

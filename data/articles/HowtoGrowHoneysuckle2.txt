 When you plant honeysuckle in a container, the pot must be large enough to accommodate the plant’s growing root system. Select a container that is two to three times larger than the honeysuckle’s current pot.


If you intend to install a support system within the pot, the container will also have to accommodate for the trellis or stakes., Fill your large pot approximately halfway full of soil and/or compost. Carefully remove the honeysuckle from its plastic container without damaging its root system. Insert the plant into the large pot so that the base of the plant sits flush with the lip of the container. Fill in the empty space with more soil and/or compost.


If you need to elevate the honeysuckle, add more soil or compost to the pot until the plant’s base reaches the lip of the container.The type of honeysuckle you choose to plant is dependent upon the size of the container you wish to use, the climate of your region, and availability at local nurseries, markets, and stores. Before you purchase a honeysuckle, make sure the variety is not considered invasive., In order to train your honeysuckle to climb, you must provide it with a support structure. You may position the container next to a south-facing wall or fence. If this option is not available to you, you may install a trellis or set of stakes within the pot itself.


You can create a makeshift cage out of three bamboo dowels and nursery wire. Insert the three dowels along the inner edge of the container at even intervals. Wrap a piece of nursery wire around the top of the three dowels. Cover the rest of the structure—from its top to its base—with five to seven rings of nursery wire.
 Once your structure is in place, you can train the plant to climb up the trellis, stakes, wall, or fence. Wrap the plant’s vines around the support structure. You can attach the honeysuckle to the structure with old nylon hosiery.If you have not already done so, move the honeysuckle to a sunny location and water the plant.

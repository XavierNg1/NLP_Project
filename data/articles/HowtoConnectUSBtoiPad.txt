 Not all USB devices will be compatible with the Apple Camera Connector or other adapters., Apple sells its own model but there are third party options as well.

Older iPads use a 30-pin connection that will require a different type of adapter, but Apple no longer sells these in their stores.
 This is the male end of the adapter.,, If your device is a camera, the Photos app will automatically launch so you can browse your pictures/videos on your device. If the device is not supported then an error message may appear.

“The attached volume appears to be invalid.” This will appear if you connect a flash drive that does not use a readable format.
“The attached USB device is not supported.” This means the device will not work with the adapter.
“Accessory Unavailable: The attached accessory uses too much power.” This means that the device draws too much power to work with the iPad. You can remedy this by connecting the device to an external power source (such as a wall outlet).
If you are experiencing further trouble, try restarting your iPad and reconnecting the device.

Some studios pay based on hour, while others pay per student. Most teachers begin at an hourly rate and can negotiate after the attendance proves to be successful.

 Most teachers will spend a long time looking for just the right place and attendance. Over time you will find the right venue and figure out the right days and times that meet students needs. Be willing to let go of classes that aren't working, but only after investing a good amount of time promoting and trying to make it work.

 Pour a shallow layer of water into the pan. Heat over high until the water reaches a rolling boil, then remove from heat.


If you don't have a steamer, you'll need a colander that sits on top of the pan, and a lid that can fit over the colander.
This methods adds less heat than the oven, but more moisture. The extra moisture is most helpful when the bread is very stale and hard, or if it was left out unwrapped.
 Place the basket over the steaming pan and cover with a lid.
 Give the steam at least five minutes to soften the bread.

You will see a few open slits on the keg top and a round valve with ball bearing in the middle.
The slits guide the tap's notches and helps hold it in place.
Note the "D","E" and "U" valves are very hard to distinguish by eye from the German slider, "A" & "M" systems. Make sure you ask the vendor.



With the lever up (OFF), align the two coupler lugs with the corresponding opening on the keg valve.
Push the tap system down on the keg valve. You will drive the ball bearing down. You do not need to be Schwarzenegger to do this but a little elbow grease helps.
While continuing to push downward. Twist the tap clockwise. It is important to keep a steady downwards pressure on the tap until it is fully screwed in.
Keep twisting until you can not twist anymore, about 90 degrees.



Pull the handle out, and push it down (ON).
OR Twist the flanges.
 If you see bubbles or foam escaping around the tap it is not seated correctly.


If bubbles are escaping around the tap, you will need to disengage the pump, take it off and try again.
If the seating looks good and there are no bubbles around the tap/keg seam, continue on.

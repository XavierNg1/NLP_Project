 iOS has a built-in PDF reader which can be used to open PDF attachments in emails or PDFs that you find online.
 This will allow you to select another app to handle the PDF.
 If you are viewing the PDF in your Mail app, you will use the Share button. If you are viewing the PDF in Safari, you will use the "Open in..." button. This will display a list of apps that support PDF.
 You can add your PDF files to iBooks, or open it in Adobe Reader or any other PDF application you have installed on your iOS device. The PDF will open immediately in your selected app.

 Like most things, the first step to getting involved is getting informed and the internet is a great place to start. Take some time to browse your nearby theater's website, if they have one,and read about their mission state, what shows they are casting, if they have crew openings, if they are holding audition, or are in need of donations., They can help direct you and suggest whom to speak with further either by email, phone, or in-person.
 Chances are youâ€™ve already visited the theater before as a patron, but if not plan on checking out a show. Stick around after the show, too, and see if you can chat up current cast members. This is a good way to get a vibe of the troupe and get tips or pointers from someone already in the know.

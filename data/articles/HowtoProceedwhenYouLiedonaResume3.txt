 If you went through with the interview without coming clean, you may be suffering from feelings of guilt and worry over what the employer will do if they find out. In this situation, you may want to consider withdrawing your candidacy for the position and put an end to things before they go any further. At this point, coming clean may have lost you the job anyway, so this method will allow you to maintain some dignity.


You can keep it simple by calling or emailing the employer to request a withdrawal of your candidacy. Briefly state, “I would like to withdraw my candidacy at this time”.
 You are not required to provide an explanation for the withdrawal of your candidacy. However, if you are asked why you are withdrawing your candidacy you can simply say, “For personal reasons”. The employer will not probe any further and will never know you lied on your resume.
 Thank the employer for their time thus far and apologize for any inconvenience. You can also wish them luck in finding the right person for the job. Ending on a good note may allow you to be a good candidate for another job in the future.

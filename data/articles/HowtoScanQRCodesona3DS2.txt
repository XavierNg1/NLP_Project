 Generally a QR code will have a small image in the middle of it designating it for a game. If there is a logo around the code, or the code is otherwise labeled as "for _______ only," this means you must have the appropriate game on to view the code. Any Mii game, for example, has a little "mii" in the center of the QR code's typical checkerboard pattern., Skip the main menu and go straight to the game to input the code. All games have different ways to input QR codes, but they will all happen in the game, not in the main 3DS menu.
 This is usually in the main menu or the settings page. However, some games hide these scanner to make the items you scan more valuable. Animal Crossing, for example, makes you talk to Sable once a day for 10 straight days to unlock the QR scanner.If you cannot find the QR code reader, look online or in the game's instruction manual.
 QR codes can be a bit finicky, but you can ensure they work with a little patience. Make sure the code is well lit and the camera is six to ten inches away. Smooth out any wrinkles and hold the camera steady, moving it in slightly if it still isn't reading immediately.

 If you are well-informed about your goal, you have a better chance of accomplishing it. So, before you develop an action plan for your goals, spend some time learning what you will have to do to reach them.For example, if you set a goal to get accepted into college, you might conduct some research on this goal. From your research, you might learn that you need to keep your GPA high in high school, pass a college entrance exam, and participate in extracurricular activities.
 Once you've done your research, it's time to map out your goal. The best way to do this is by dividing it into smaller parts. This makes your goal more doable, and helps you build energy to keep going.For example, if you set a goal to lose 40 pounds, you might set miniature milestones for every five pounds lost.
 The most effective goals are time-sensitive, meaning you have a clear deadline. You won't be as motivated to reach your goal if it has an open end date. Set a realistic but challenging deadline for your goal and stick to it., How will you know when you cross the finish line for your goal? For some goals, the end point is obvious--for others, not so much. That's why it's important to measure your progress as you move along. How you track your progress will depend on your goal and your personal preferences.For instance, if you are trying to save money by a certain date, you can track your progress by using a savings account that tells you your current balance. If you are trying to lose weight, you can track your weight and measurements at intervals (like every week or two) in an app like MyFitnessPal.
You can also draw out a chart that shows your steady progress towards the goal.

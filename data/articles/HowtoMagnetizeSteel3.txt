 If you have a compass, the needle will point directly to magnetic north. Otherwise finding true north should be good enough for this method.
 Put the steel object down, so its longest dimension is laid out north-to-south.


This method will not work well for small objects or steel balls that cannot be arranged north-south.
 Tape the steel down or use a clamp or vise to hold it in place.
 Bash the end of the steel object repeatedly. The steel will gradually become a weak magnet, and get slightly stronger each time your strike it. Test this by holding a paper clip next to the steel periodically.


Some types of steel cannot be magnetized at home. Try a different steel object if you notice no magnetic effect at all, or switch to iron.
 The added energy from striking the metal allows the atomic-level magnetic domains to rearrange themselves in a magnetic field. Since the planet's iron core produces its own magnetic field, these miniature magnets rearrange themselves to point north. Once enough jostling has occurred, all these miniature magnets pointed in the same direction creates a magnetic effect strong enough for us to notice.

, You may not have any concrete ideas, but simply writing something down can help generate creative thoughts. Consider it a form of brainstorming, and remember that you can always start over or revise previous thoughts before you finish a final draft. Writing, in and of itself, can help you generate thoughts.Try free writing or journaling for 15 minutes everyday. It is best if you do this type of writing by hand because it will connect you more fully to the writing process.

Read as much and as often as possible.

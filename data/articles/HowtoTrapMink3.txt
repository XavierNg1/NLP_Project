 This set is designed to lure minks to your trap using bait. Pockets sets use a small hole or pocket dug into a river bank.
 Make sure the bank is straight up and down. The bank should also be steep so that the mink cannot reach over from the top and grab the bait while avoiding your trap.
 The pocketâ€™s bottom will be two inches below the waterline. Extend the pocket 1 to 2 feet into the bank, making sure it angles up towards the topsoil. The diameter of the pocket should be around five to six inches.Use a spade or small shovel to easily dig the pocket.
 Use a heavy object to hold the branch in place. This will also help prevent the mink from reaching over the pocket and grabbing the bait.
 Your bait should be either be a fresh fish or a muskrat carcass. Place the bait deep into the hole towards the very back. Impale the bait with something small, such as a stick, and push the bait into the wall of the hole. This will make the mink go deeper into the hole to reach the bait.


You can also use fish oil or raccoon glands as a lure.
 The trap should be at the mouth of the hole. Placing the trap at the entrance ensures the mink is trapped if it decides not to go all the way into the pocket. Use either a body-grabbing or foothold trap. If you use a foothold trap, it should be rigged to drown the mink instantly.


If you are in an area where dogs go do not use meat bait or raccoon gland lures. Place the trap in the very back of the pocket. Make sure the pocket is under the cover of low-hanging branches or exposed tree roots. This will make sure that dogs avoid the trap., While mink are naturally curious, they are also cautious. Minks have a very strong sense of smell and will avoid the trap if they catch your scent. You want to eliminate all human scent from the trap to make it effective. Pour mink urine around a set to eliminate human odor.

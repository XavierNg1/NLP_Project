 Successful work at home is only going to happen if you have some space that is quiet. Never try working in the middle of everything. Distractions are the single biggest reason people who try working from home fail. It is absolutely necessary to stay away or be away from the home "noise".;
, Next if you are serious about being successful and reaching your goals, you must keep them in sight at all times. A suggestion is that you put up a board with each one of your goals written out and placed in plain sight so that you can have a constant reminder of where you are headed. Focusing on your goals visually will help keep the thoughts in your mind directed towards the goals.
 Discouragement from reaching goals is a major factor in just giving up. If you expect too much of yourself and the goal is not met, you will just give up and think you will not be able to do it. Do Not Give Up.
 Again regarding goals. What is motivating your goals? What is it that you really want? Whatever the answers to these questions are, use them to make you work harder towards your goals. Goals will not be reached if you are not motivated enough.
 If necessary put up a sign at your office door or imaginary door. These are the hours that people in your household have to respect. Make sure everyone is aware of your working hours. Within the same information, just because you are working from home does not mean your office is open 24 hours. You have a life and a family. Respect their needs as well.

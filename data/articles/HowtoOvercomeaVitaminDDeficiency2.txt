 Based on the results of your blood test or physical examination, your doctor will recommend you take a vitamin D supplement.The dosage will vary based on the severity of your deficiency. A dosage of 1000 International Units (IU) is a common supplement dosage.Vitamin D2 and D3 supplements are widely available, and are both effective in treating a deficiency.
 Direct sunlight helps the body synthesize vitamin D. Some researchers have suggested spending up to 30 minutes twice a week in direct sun without sunscreen.However, this can increase the risk of skin damage and skin cancer, so it’s best to wear a sunscreen with an SPF of 8 or higher.In order to synthesize vitamin D, broad patches of skin will need sun exposure, so you should wear short sleeves and shorts. Just limit your direct exposure to less than 30 minutes.
Talk to your doctor about your risks for skin damage. Tell them about any family history of skin cancer and ask if extra sun exposure is right for you.
 Vitamin D fortification is not mandatory, so you should make sure a product is fortified before purchasing it.If you’re vegan or lactose intolerant, you can purchase soy milk fortified with vitamin D., Mushrooms contain vitamin D naturally but, like human skin, they synthesize more when exposed to sunlight. Leaving mushrooms gills side up in direct sunlight for as little as five minutes can increase their vitamin D content.You can also keep mushrooms under an indoor ultraviolet lamp.
 Exercising too little has been linked to vitamin D deficiency. Getting at least a half hour of exercise per day may help your body synthesize more vitamin D. Going for a brisk walk outside in direct sunlight can have increased benefits.Check with your doctor before taking on a new exercise regimen, especially if you have any bone, joint, or cardiovascular issues.

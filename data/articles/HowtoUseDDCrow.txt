 Do this by removing 1 of the monsters your opponent selects to return to their Deck, preventing them from returning the 4 other monsters that they wanted back in their Deck.;
, Crow" also to remove the third DARK monster in your opponent's Graveyard. This will slow them down in the attempt to Summon the infamous "Dark Armed Dragon".
 This will prevent the Summoning of "Judgment Dragon". This can possibly give you another turn to start a counter attack.
 Now of course "D.D. Crow" isn't just limited to removing monsters. You can also:


Remove your opponent's Spell and Trap Cards as well, stopping cards like "Magical Stone Excavation", "Mask of Darkness", and "Spell Reproduction" dead in their tracks.
If the card has a cost to activate it, your opponent will still have to pay it and get nothing back as a result giving you more of a field/hand advantage.
Its effect, ironically, can also help the Summon and activate the effect of the aforementioned "Dark Armed Dragon", since it is also a DARK monster and can contribute to the three DARK monsters in your Graveyard required to Special Summon it.
 As you can tell, "D.D. Crow" is a very flexible card and can be quite deadly and annoying when used correctly. With all these examples of stopping cards from either being summoned or being able to resolve their effects, there is no reason why "D.D. Crow" shouldn't be at least a Side Deck in your most competitive Deck.

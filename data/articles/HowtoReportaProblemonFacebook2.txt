 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on the icon to launch the app.
 Tap the menu button on the leftmost part of the header, and a menu will drop down. Swipe down through the menu and tap “Report a Problem” to open the Report a Problem window

, The small window will display the problem types you can choose. You can choose among: Something Isn’t Working, Abusive Content, and General Feedback. Tap on your choice.


Use “Something Isn’t Working” if there’s a bug or issue with a Facebook feature or tool.
Use “Abusive Content” if you’ve found any content that is harmful, spam, or a policy violation.
Use “General Feedback” for general comments or notes for Facebook.
 Depending on your problem type, you will be shown different forms. If you chose “Something Isn’t Working,” you will have to identify first the feature that you’re reporting before you get to the form. Fill up the form with as much data as you have in order to help Facebook resolve the problem quickly.
 Once done, tap on the Send button at the top right corner of the form. Your report will be sent to Facebook.

 Make sure you pick clothes that flatter your body. Flaunt the good parts of your body. Make sure you are comfortable with the amount of skin you are showing. For example, if you think your skirt is too short or too long wear one that is the right length for you.;
, Wash your hair with a good smelling shampoo. Lather it in really well. Rinse and repeat. When you're washing your body, pay attention to armpits, feet, butt, and chest. Shave or wax your legs and clean them really well. When you get out of the shower, moisturize everything but your face.
 So wash it twice a week and use hydrating hair creams after shower on your hair and let it dry, so it will look pretty and hydrated. And when going to school, just style it with your hands or a comb (the curlier your hair, the more separate the bristles of the comb must be) and let it down.
 (8 or 9 is okay, but it's not good to stay up late every night, watch out!)

, Don't be afraid to accessorize! Wear bracelets, earrings (if you have pierced ears), necklaces, bangles, etc., then put on deodorant and perfume.
 Add a pretty headband or clips.
, Concealer, a bit of face powder to set it, blush, lip gloss, mascara, and maybe eyeliner are good enough. Don't use too much bronzer and don't use any eyeshadow on a school day... it will look way too much for daytime.
 Think about at least 5 things you love about yourself without using the word nice. Think you look good? Head out the door.
 Head up, back straight, shoulders back, chest out, tummy in, and smile! This will make you look and feel confident.
 To increase your butt and make your bust look larger and firmer, try push-ups and sit-ups. They work!

, For great skin and hair drink a lot of water and eat fruits and veggies.
 In it out, breath mints, carmex or lip balm, tissues, pens, feminine things in a secret pocket, and a small mirror.

 Sometimes we can get so caught up in other people's problems that they exasperate our own. You can't fix everyone's problems. If a neighbor, family member, friend, or co-worker are burdening you with their life stresses constantly, don't take it upon yourself to try and solve them.Let go of stress that can't be controlled. Whether it's something someone around you is experiencing, or something completely out of your control in your own life, set stresses that can't be controlled aside.
 Sometimes we can find ourselves trying too hard for perfection, only to come up short, leaving us with feelings of disappointment and stress. This standard can create an unneeded burden of stress. Rather than worry about being perfect, worry about learning from each mistake., Much of the stress we feel every day comes from making decisions. Rather than spending your entire day trying to decide between variables and possibilities, simplify where you can. Create simple routines such as certain times you answer e-mails, certain times you go to the gym, or even planning out lunches in advance. Don't bog yourself down in what to wear or eat when life has so many other looming stresses.This may require some planning on the weekend, but spending some time on a Sunday preparing for your week can go a long way toward simplifying your life. Plan out your meals, outfits, and write out a schedule. Create a to-do list that keeps you on track with other tasks.
 It's great to focus on the big picture, but if you're always striving toward a far off goal, you'll always feel like you're grinding. When you accomplish something small, such as a lifestyle change for a week, give yourself credit. You can take joy out of small successes and be thankful for small opportunities.

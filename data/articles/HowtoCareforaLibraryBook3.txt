 Skim through it and look for torn or missing pages, large stains, pen or pencil writing, doodles, etc. Check the covers for missing or defaced parts. If you find any of these, report it to one of the librarians. This way, they won't assume you damaged the book., Not all damage is obvious when you first skim through the book. Call the library if you find damage during operating hours. If the library has a special email address or online form to make reports, take advantage of it for damage found after hours. If all else fails, drop by the library in person as soon as possible to notify the staff., Return it to the library as soon as possible. Explain what happened and let the librarians take care of it. Libraries can repair books with better materials and methods than you can.

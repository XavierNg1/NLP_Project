 Usually, rainbows are seen in the rain. That is because there are many water droplets falling through the sky refracting the sun’s light. To mimic that, you should find a source of water that can be moved. A water hose or a spray bottle will work nicely., A stream of water is not ideal for creating a visible rainbow. Instead, you want a mist of water that the sun has to pass through. You can create this mist by holding your thumb over the end of a water hose, or turning a nozzle to the “mist” position., Once you have a steady mist, turn so that the sun’s light passes directly through the mist. This will allow the sunlight to be refracted by the small droplets of water. You will see the rainbow form in the mist.

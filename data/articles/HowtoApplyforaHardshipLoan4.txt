 Some friends and family members may be willing to give you a personal loan at low or even no interest. Always consider the loan a business deal and agree upon all terms of repayment before going through with the loan.
 If your friend or family member requests one, you could put the terms of your loan agreement into a contract. The contract should specify how much money you borrowed, and the terms of repayment, including:


How long it will take you to repay the loan
How much you will pay each month
How much interest, if any, you will pay
What will happen if you cannot make payments.
You can find more information on drafting such a contract at: How to Write a Legal Contract.
 Once you have agreed upon the contract, you and the friend should each sign and keep a copy for your records. Remember that borrowing money from family and friends can ruin relationships if the deal is not handled carefully, so obey every stipulation of the contract. If you must break one of the provisions, tell the person as far in advance as you can and include an idea for an amended provision that will get you back on a repayment schedule as soon as possible.


Keep in mind that the signed contract is a legal document, and the friend or family member can take you to court over it if you fail to act accordingly.

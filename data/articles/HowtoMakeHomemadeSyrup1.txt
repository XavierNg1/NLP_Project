 Pour in 1 cup (240 mL) cold water. Feel free to double or triple this recipe to make a larger batch.;
, For your first batch, try 1 cup (200 g) granulated white sugar and 1 cup (200 g) brown sugar.Once you've tasted the end result, you can play around with different ratios. The more brown sugar you use, the stronger the molasses flavor will be. For extra strong flavor replace the brown sugar with a raw sugar like demerara or turbinado.


For a thinner syrup, halve the amount of syrup.
Replace some or all of the sugar with maple sugar to get an authentic maple flavor. Maple sugar tends to be expensive, and in some areas may only be available online.
 For an easy imitation of real maple syrup, add ½ tsp (2.5 mL) maple flavor extract, available from baking supply stores or online. Without it, the syrup will taste more like molasses – which is still delicious on pancakes or waffles.


You can substitute vanilla or almond extract for a more unusual pancake syrup.
 Bring the water and sugar mixture to a boil, then reduce to low heat. Stir continuously for 3–5 minutes, or until every sugar grain has dissolved. The longer you boil the syrup, the thicker it will be once cooled.This recipe is plenty thick already, so you should be fine taking it off the heat right away.
 You can use the syrup as-is once it's cooled, or add other ingredients for a more exotic flavor. Drop these in the hot syrup and let steep for at least half an hour, then strain the syrup through a sieve.Here are a few suggestions:


Peeled, sliced ginger root
Lemon or lime zest
Cinnamon or nutmeg (no need to strain)
Vanilla pod, sliced open

, Refrigerate the syrup in a clean container to discourage microorganisms. This will typically last 6 months in the refrigerator. You can add a small spoonful of vodka to preserve it even longer, but most people discover that the syrup has mysteriously vanished long before the expiration date.Storing in a squeeze bottle make the syrup easy to use.

 Before you go crazy with designing, consider how much money you have to spend first. Kitchen design can be very expensive. Figure out how much money you have, whether you have to buy new appliances or make other large purchases, and then determine what options are open to you.;
, Will you be doing all of the work after designing this kitchen or will you be hiring a contractor? This is important to consider, as it takes some level of skill to enact certain design features. If you plan on making these changes yourself, you will need to be sure that you are capable of making the things you design.
 It may be that you need this kitchen done in time for a family reunion or you want to get it done before your first baby is born in a few months. Maybe youâ€™re not designing it for yourself at all and the time constraints are set by a client. All of this will greatly affect how extensive your design will be, as well as playing a part in determining who will carry out the design.

 Since a decrease in the function of the kidneys is the cause of gout in FSGC patients, it is important that the root cause of the gout be addressed. One of the therapies that address FSGS is Micro-Chinese osmotherapy.


This is a modern Chinese therapy which involves the repair of the renal cells. This treatment requires an osmoscope, osmotic medicine, penetrants, electrode plates, vessels, powder and heating oven.
The procedure is usually done by those who practice alternative medicine but it can also be done at home. The necessary can be bought in herbal shops.
 This treatment is done by soaking the osmotic medicine in a penetrant. Then the soaked medicine bag is warmed in the heating oven until it is heated thoroughly. It can also be heated in a microwave for 2-4 minutes.


After that, a clean cloth is placed in the bed to avoid spillage in the bed.The two electrode plates are placed on the sanitary cloth with the wire edges of the two electrode plates slightly further than the opposite ends of the two plates.
The two medicine bags are placed on the two electrodes with the cloth separating them in the middle. Pressure is applied to the two medicine bags to make them flat.
 Lie down on the two bags with the kidneys right on the two medicine bags. Attach the osmoscope to the power source and pick electrotherapy mode.


The procedure lasts for 45 to 90 minutes, but can be repeated a second time. After the procedure remove the power and wipe the medication from the renal area.
 This procedure allows the medication to be easily absorbed by the body through osmosis.


The medication acts directly on the kidneys through the skin, blood and meridian system of the waist and back.
The direct contact with the skin releases a high concentration of the medicine. The procedure removes the immune complex and the necrotic tissues or scars from the kidneys.

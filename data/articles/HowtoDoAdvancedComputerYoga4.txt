 Think "Om , Om, Om... ".
 Breathe deeply from the diaphragm, breathing through the left nostril. Think "Om". Press your index finger, then middle finger, then ring finger, to the left nostril. Breathe deeply from your diaphragm, breathing through the right nostril, and think "Om".


Change several times between the left and right nostril back and forth until a feeling of inner peace and harmony is created.

 One of the simplest ways to upload your photos to your computer is by simply e-mailing them to yourself from your smartphone. While this is an easy process, you may have trouble when sending large photo albums and this method will typically only work if you are attempting to upload one or two photos.
 Create an e-mail on your phone and attach the files you wish to upload.
 You can either send this to the e-mail you are sending it from or to another e-mail account that you control. Once it has sent, go to your e-mail on your computer. From here you will be able to download your photos.

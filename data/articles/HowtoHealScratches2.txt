 After you have cleaned the wound and it has stopped bleeding, apply antibiotic ointment, such as Bacitracin or Neosporin, or petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline, on it. This helps keep the wound moist so it can heal more quickly. Apply a thin layer of ointment with clean fingers or with a cotton swab.Petroleum jelly can also reduce the chance of a scar. If the scratch itches, petroleum jelly can help soothe it.
 If the scratch is deep or moderate, you may want to put a bandage on it. This can help keep the scratch clean and protect it from bacteria. For minor scratches, leave the bandage off.You can use a Bandaid or gauze to cover the wound.
 Once a day, remove the bandage to wash the scratch with soap and cool, running water.Put on a fresh bandage afterwards. You should also change it if it gets dirty or wet. Once the scratch heals enough that you don’t have to worry about bacteria, you can leave it uncovered.When the scratch has developed a new layer of skin over it or a scab, you can leave it uncovered because it isn't at risk for bacteria.
 If you have been scratched by something rusty, like a nail, you may be at risk of developing tetanus. If you think you are at risk, go to the doctor. If you have had a tetanus shot, have the scratch assessed to make sure it is okay. If you haven’t had a tetanus shot in the last five years, talk to your doctor about getting one.

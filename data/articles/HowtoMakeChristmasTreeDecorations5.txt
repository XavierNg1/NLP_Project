 Eight wooden clothespins will make one snowflake ornament. Carefully separate each clothespin, removing the metal springs.
 Take some hot glue or wood glue and stick the flat sides of each clothespin together. Take a piece of ribbon, fold it in half, and insert both ends between two of the wooden pieces before you glue them. This will allow you to hang the ornament later.
 Assemble the snowflake as follows:


Take two of the glued-together pieces and align the flattened edges at the top to form a right-angle. Attach two more pieces to form an X shape.
Take the remaining four glued-together pieces and stick one in between each right angle. You should now have a snowflake.
 Paint the snowflake using white or gold spray paint. Paint with a slight, glittery shimmer can look very nice. Stick sequins or jewels onto the ornament as you see fit.

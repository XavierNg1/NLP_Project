 Potato chips can add a savory crunch to just about any sandwich. Try combining several slices of your preferred deli meat, a slice or two of cheese, some dill pickle slices, sliced tomatoes, and two teaspoons of mayonnaise on wheat bread. Stack some potato chips across the top before you add the final piece of bread.Potato chips taste great with almost any savory sandwich, especially when combined with dill pickles.
 Crush 4  c (950 mL) of potato chips in a large mixing bowl and add one tablespoon of parsley flakes. In a separate bowl, beat one large egg and add two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. Clean four boneless skinless chicken breasts and soak them in the egg mixture until they are fully coated. Then coat each chicken breast in the potato chip mixture. Heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil on medium-low heat and place chicken in the skillet.Cook the chicken in the oil for 10-12 minutes until they are golden brown and no longer pink in the center. You’ll need to turn them once while cooking.
Try using sour cream and onion chips for added flavoring.
 Preheat your oven to 400 °F (204 °C). In a large mixing bowl, combine 1.5 lb (0.68 kg) of lean ground beef, two chopped garlic cloves, two eggs, one small chopped onion, 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of whole milk, 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of breadcrumbs, one tablespoon of parsley, 3⁄4  c (180 mL) of potato chips, and a dash of salt and pepper. Use your hands to squish all of the ingredients together until they are fully mixed into the fold. Shape the mixture into small round meatballs and place them on a baking sheet in the oven. Let them cook for 35-40 minutes.Serve with marinara sauce, or on top of spaghetti.

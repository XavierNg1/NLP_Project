 Be sure to extend the polish over the tips of your nails to make your manicure last longer. You can use any color you want, but mirror power will show up the best against black.


UV-gel polish is easier to work with, but it is still possible to get a nice finish on non-UV gel polish and regular nail polish. It will take more work, however.
Consider covering the skin around your nails with some white school glue or liquid latex to make clean-up easier.
 Don't let the top coat dry all the way, however. You want it to feel rubbery, but not sticky or tacky. This is important, especially with regular, non-gel top coat; if you apply it too soon, the powder will make a mess, and if you wait too long, the powder won't stick.Use regular, non-water-based top coat for this. A quick-dry top coat is recommended.
Remember to extend the top coat down past the tip.
 Start from the cuticle area and work your way towards the tip. You can use a special applicator meant for applying mirror powder, or you can use a foam, eyeshadow brush. Gently flick the brush down as you tap the powder on.
 Once you have your nail coated with powder, gently buff the surface with the foam eyeshadow brush. Do not apply too much pressure, or you may create dents. As you continue to buff, the surface will get smoother and smoother.
 You can do this using a soft brush, such as an eyeshadow brush or a kabuki brush, or a Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol. If you applied glue or liquid latex earlier, simply peel it off.
 Many people find that regular top coat cracks or mars the mirror powder's finish. Luckily, water-based top coat does not do that., Once you have applied a water-based top coat, you can safely use any type of top coat. This will make your manicure last even longer; unfortunately, water-based top coat alone does not last very long., Once it is dry, you can show off your new nails to all of your friends.

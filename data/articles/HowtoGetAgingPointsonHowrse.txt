 Ow should offer to show you around or something similar. Accept it.


This will give your first horse/pony (the one you choose at the signup page) many different Black Market items (Croesus' Fortune, Philosopher's Stone, Chronos' Timer, and Philotes' Stroke). It will also give you enough Aging Points to age your horse/pony to 3 years. It may also give you extra Aging Points.;
, UFOs are items that sometimes appear and float around on a page on Howrse. These can be carrots, apples, mash, so on, including Aging Points.


Clicking on the item will catch it, giving you the item (or multiples of it). While UFOs appearing seems to be random, as does the item that appears, this can be a decent way to get Aging Points if you don't need them immediately and plan to use them for casual use.
 While not directly related to Aging Points, some Black Market Items affect age:


Morpheus' Arms lets you age your horse without using Aging Points.
One Piece of Cloud makes your horse 4 months younger. A Piece of Cloud does give you 2 Aging Points, most likely for turning back time the same amount of months as 2 Aging Points would age them.
Chronos' Timer lets your horseÂ finish its skills twice as fast.
Artemis' Arrow lets your mare age twice as fast during her gestation period, progressing 4 months instead of 2.
Water of Youth ages your horse 1 month instead of 2 each time she ages.

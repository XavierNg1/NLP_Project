 Pull a rope around the back of the object you will be tying a knot around. Pull each end of the rope towards the centre. Cross the right-hand end of the rope over the left-hand end., Hold the end of the rope that is crossed underneath taut. With your other hand, pull the end of the rope that is crossed overhand behind the object. Pull it around to the other side to meet the opposite rope end.Alternate this method by attempting a double constrictor knot: instead of looping the rope around once more at this step, do it twice.
 Pull the overhand side of the rope under the opposite rope end, between the object and the rope. Thread it under the "X" formed by the crossed rope in the middle. Pull it though to the other side. Pull both ends to tighten.

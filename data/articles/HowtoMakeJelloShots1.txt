 To make approximately 32 1-ounce (30 ml) shots, all you'll need is:


1 6-oz. package of Jello (170 grams)
Approximately 3 cups of water
Approximately 1 cup of chilled alcohol of your choice;
, The proportions will depend on the proof of the alcohol you use. Use the following ratios to ensure that the shots will set:


13 oz. (26 tbsp., 390 ml) of 30 to 50 (~20%) proof alcohol with 3 oz. (6 tbsp., 90 ml) water
10 oz. (20 tbsp., 300 ml) 80 to 100 (~45%) proof alcohol with 6 oz. (12 tbsp., 180 ml) water
6 oz. (12 tbsp., 180 ml) 150 to 200 proof alcohol with 10 oz (20 tbsp., 300 ml) water

, Wait until the mixture is completely chilled before moving onto the next step. This is important because the temperature at which alcohol evaporates (the boiling point) is 78.6 degrees C (173°F). Later you will mix the alcohol with a water that was just boiled at 100 degrees C (212°F). If the alcohol isn't cold, it might exceed its boiling point when mixed, and some of the alcohol will evaporate. This will make your shots less potent.
 You'll need exactly 1 cup of boiling water, so put a little more than that in the pot or kettle since some will evaporate.
 Stir constantly until the powder is completely dissolved.
, Adding small plastic spoons or Popsicle sticks can help, too.
, Chill them until they become firm (approximately 2 to 4 hours). Refrigerate until served and make sure to serve them cold.

 


Do not shove papers aimlessly into your desk. Place them in the correct folder for that class.






Put books used frequently in the front for easy access, and books not used often towards the back.






Make sure you do not have any bits of food in your desk, and take your lunch out at the end of the day. This will prevent any unwanted critters in your desk/locker.

Buy a backpack with several sections and generous room. Make sure it is nice quality and sturdy enough to last the whole year.






Keep all notebooks in one pocket, all textbooks in another, workbooks in their own pocket, etc.






Have a folder for each subject, plus one for homework. They are available at grocery stores, office supply stores, etc.
Buy a pencil pouch for all pens, pencils, and other writing utensils to be kept in. They can be found in grocery stores or office supply stores.



Make a bulletin board or magnetic dry-erase board to post notices, test dates, due dates, and other important things to remember.
Use sticky notes to remind yourself of upcoming due-dates or tests.
Make sure you have adequate lighting at the workspace, or a desk-lamp.
Use small storage bins/baskets or drawer dividers to keep supplies in, as well as plenty of folders for graded papers and signed forms.







When you receive a worksheet or assignment on paper, place it neatly in your homework folder or subject folder. Write the due date at the top and highlight it.
When you finish a project or homework assignment, place it in a folder neatly. Be sure you remember which folder.
Turn in all homework on time and completely. Handing in assignments late can result in losing points.






Do your homework in a quiet and calm place, like your room. Avoid spaces with distractions, like devices and other technologies.

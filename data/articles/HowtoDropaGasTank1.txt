 There are many different fasteners, clamps, and connections that must be removed or loosened to remove a fuel tank. Here are some:

Strap bolts, usually requiring a 1⁄2 or 9⁄16 inch (1.3 or 1.4 cm) or 12, 13, or 14 mm open end wrench.
Slotted and Phillips screwdrivers for hose clamps.
Special tools for disconnecting fuel line fittings.
Other items you may need include a jack, jack stands, a pump for removing the fuel, fuel rated containers for fuel that is removed from the tank, rags, and a fire extinguisher in case of an emergency.;
, Hard, compacted soil is acceptable if no other option is available., Submersible fuel pumps are usually readily available from a local auto parts supplier, but fuel level sensing units may require special ordering from a dealer., Even an empty gas tank can be heavy and difficult to manage while lying underneath a vehicle. It is also better to have an assistant to hand you tools, and to respond if you have an accident while performing this task.

 This app can usually be found in a folder labeled “Utilities.”, This will take you to the leveling screen., Your phone should be parallel to your face. A horizontal line will divide your screen into a white and black area. The degree of inclination will be at the center of the screen., When the black and white areas each take up half of your screen, that means the object you are measuring is in a level position. Your screen will turn green and the number at the center of your screen will be zero.

You can take another measurement off of that angle by tapping your screen once. Your new measurement will display in red.

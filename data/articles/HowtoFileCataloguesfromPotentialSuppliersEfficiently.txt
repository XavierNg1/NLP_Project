Throw out anything that's irrelevant to your business. If you know your business buys its electronics and computers complete, you may never need to order a single resistor. If you don't have a factory floor to maintain, you don't need a floor sealant for it.

, to establish an approved vendor list. These are companies or vendors that are central to your business. If you already have a purchasing database or even a stack of old purchase requisitions, look back through it. Vendors that your firm uses rarely or never and any vendors that have caused difficulties (late delivery, excessive fees) should go on the list only if they supply something you need but can't get elsewhere.

,, Stake out a bookcase or filing cabinet., It might be helpful for each person to have a copy of catalogs that are used very frequently. For all the rest, could the entire department share a shelf, library-style?

Catalogs can get heavy, so be sure to choose a sturdy shelf.
 Alphabetically by manufacturer or supplier is probably not a bad choice, since there's only one way to arrange them. For a larger collection, you may wish to divide catalogs into broad categories (for instance office supplies versus parts for your products). Label the shelves with what these categories are, so that you and your coworkers don't have to guess where to put them back.,, Simply mention it to the salesperson the next time you talk to him or her.

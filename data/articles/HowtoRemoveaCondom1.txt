 After you ejaculate or finish sex, remove your penis from your partner while it remains firm. Do not wait until your penis is soft. If you do, your condom more likely will fall off and become stuck in your partner.;
, When you have finished sex, hold your penis parallel to the floor or pointing downwards with one hand. Use the other hand to grab the condom's ring, or outer end. Make sure you grasp the condom's base firmly. By holding onto the bottom, the condom is less likely to come off.Inspect the used condom for holes. If your condom has broken, your partner will need to use a back-up form of birth control. Pills like Plan B can help in this situation. Additionally, you or your partner might need to seek STI testing.
 Place the condom in the garbage. In no case should you throw the condom in a toilet.It's not environmentally friendly or good for your plumbing system! There are multiple ways you can dispose of a condom:


Tie a knot at the condom's opening. This will prevent fluids from spilling. Wrap it in toilet or tissue paper and then throw it in a waste bin.
See Dispose of a Condom for more tips.
 After removing the condom, wash your hands with warm water. Use liquid soap. If your partner has had contact with your semen, encourage that person to wash their hands as well.
 They will not be effective. If you don't have another condom to use, buy another one. Otherwise, abstain from sexual intercourse.

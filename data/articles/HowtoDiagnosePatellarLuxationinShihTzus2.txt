 If you believe your dog has patellar luxation, you should take him to the vet. The vet can perform a physical exam to check for the condition. First, the vet will watch the dog walking and feel the back legs. The vet is feeling for muscle wastage, along with sideways movement in the kneecap that shouldn't be there.It is possible to diagnose a luxating patella by feel alone since the kneecap can be felt popping out of place when the leg is straightened during the exam.
In cases that are not clear cut, the vet may straighten the leg and put a slight sideways pressure on the kneecap. This can be enough to encourage the patella to pop out of place.
 Even if the vet suspects a luxating patella from the physical exam, the leg will be x-rayed so as to fully assess the underlying anatomy. This is especially important if corrective surgery is being considered.


The vet will want to look at the radiographs to check the angles of the bones, which gives essential information about what surgical procedures are most appropriate for that individual.
 For mild cases of patellar luxation, you can manage your dog’s pain and inflammation with NSAIDs. Your vet will also give you a physical rehabilitation exercise program for your dog to help build strength in the thigh muscle.You should also control your dog’s weight. Added weight from obesity can put more stress on the knee joint.
 In dogs that are regularly skipping a step or having difficulty jumping, this could indicate the changes are more marked, in which case corrective surgery could protect the joint from early arthritis.


Corrective surgery involves deepening the groove that the kneecap sits in, tightening the joint capsule, and sometimes changing the angle of the shin bone so that the patella sits in a straighter line with the thigh bone.

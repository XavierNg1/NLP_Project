 The reins on your horse should act a form of communication, rather than control. The reins should move with the horse’s front feet, thereby connecting your body to the movements of the horse. Your horse’s front legs can act as your arms and hands, responding to how you move the reins.As you ride the horse and hold the reins, you should notice any signs of tension or stress in the horse. This could be his head moving up and down quickly, his jaw tensing up, or a quickening step. When he appears stressed, hold the reins with one hand and use the other hand to pet him and stroke him. This can help him to calm down.
 The casual rein position is when you hold the reins in one hand, close to the horse’s mane, with your elbows slightly bent. The reins should be loose in your hands. This position then allows you to bend down and put your hand on your horse with one hand, calming him as you ride.It can be difficult to do the casual rein position if you are not yet comfortable with riding on a horse. However, you should try to practice the casual rein position as much as possible while on the horse, as this displays trust and confidence in your horse.
 Though you may think that pulling or jerking on the reins will help you gain control of the horse, in fact, it will only spook him further. Pulling with two hands on the rein also causes you to pullback on the reins, preventing the horse from moving on his feet to calm down.If you do need to pull on the reins, try to do it with only one hand on the reins. When you pull on with one hand, you will turn the horse in a small circle but also allow him to keep his feet moving. This will then let him calm down on his own by moving his feet and getting his bearings.

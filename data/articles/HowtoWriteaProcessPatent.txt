The U.S. Patent Office will want to ascertain that everything involved in the conception and testing of your process was your work alone. Keep a journal of your work, collect clippings of any readings or research, and be sure to date everything you do.
Ideas cannot be patented. To secure a patent for your method, you need to show that your process is workable and has been tested.;
,,


Although this is no substitute for keeping an accurate journal, the postmark on any mail you send yourself will establish a timeline for the development of your process, which will be important in convincing the patent office that the idea is yours.
,


Given the great number of patents bestowed, there may be patents similar to the one for which you are applying. Identify these patents and tweak your own application noting how yours differs from others.
Provisional patent applications do not require the oath or the claims section needed in the formal application, but do require documentation such as drawings and test results. Submitting this application first will allow you to claim your process as "patent pending," and will prevent others from patenting your method as you prepare the formal application.
,


This application needs to include a background of the process, a summary of its purpose, and claims about what it can do and how it differs from other patented processes. Also, you need to include an oath that all the work that went into the formulation of the method was your own.

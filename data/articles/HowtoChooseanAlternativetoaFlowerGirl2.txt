 The wagon could have flowers in it, making it similar to the petal idea. However, the kids could also pull a wagon carrying a favorite pet with the outside covered in ribbons and bows. It could also be a way to honor a deceased loved one, by having a portrait in the wagon.Alternatively, the ring bearer and flower girl could ride in the wagon, particularly if they are small., If you still want to keep flowers a part of the walk down the aisle, consider using a garland instead of petals. Basically, you'd need two flower kids to hold each end of the flower garland. This option is also good for younger kids who might not be able to understand what they need to do with the petals., If the venue doesn't allow flower petals to be thrown, you can simply have the flower girl carry a bouquet. You could also make a small basket of single stems and have the flower girl hand out flowers to random wedding guests.

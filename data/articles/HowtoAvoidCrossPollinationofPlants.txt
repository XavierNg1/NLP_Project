 In the home garden, your greatest concern about cross-pollination is probably your edible plants, or principally, your vegetable garden. Vegetables at great risk of cross-pollination include:


Brassicas
Cucurbits
Alliums
Beets.;
, This technique (also known as "bagging") will need to be done before the flowers open so that bees and any other pollen transporting insects are preventing from getting to them. For covering the flowers, try such items as:


Newspaper or cardboard perhaps with plastic for water protection
Toilet rolls
Tape

Muslin or similar sachets or bags (these can be tied in place)
Handkerchiefs
Plastic beverage or food containers (cleaned).
 You can cover the entire plant with a screen rigged up to cover just the relevant plant or plants. Make it like a cage with something like muslin, light organza, wire mesh, etc., covering it; anything that will keep out the insects.
 This will probably only be effective if you have a very large garden, as bees are able to travel right around the average garden with no problems.

 Press them face downwards into the cream; they will stick automatically. Cover all the inside of the jar.
 Put the jar in a warm place to stand. The jar should be left to stand for several weeks, preferably up to a month if you have the patience.
 Every day that you keep the jar standing, you will need to replace the jasmine flowers by removing the old ones and adding new ones.
 After two - three weeks smell the jar to see how strong the scent has become. If it is already strong enough for you, proceed to the next step. If not, continue the process to at least one month, by which time the scent should be strong enough.
 Once the scent is strong enough, finally remove the flowers. Stir in some more moisturising cream and mix to distribute the scented part thoroughly through the cream. Place into a small pot. You should now be the proud owner of a delightful jasmine scented moisturising cream.

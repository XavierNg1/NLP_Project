 Each seller has a preferred way of posting an ad. Some will use newspapers, others opt for classifieds or vehicle buy and sell magazines, and many use free online services. Search them all thoroughly, and make note of the used boats that closely fit what you’re looking for. Also be sure to note the condition as it is listed in the ad.
 Like most luxury second-hand items, a good deal on a used boat won’t last long. Take down the phone number and make the call as soon as you can. Take too long and you might miss out completely.
 Be willing to work around the seller’s schedule, but be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to inspect the boat. Leave a contact number in case the seller needs to get in touch with you prior to the visit.

 Even if you're a seasoned guitarist, it's still hard to hear exact notes and it can be difficult to determine whether strings and notes are flat or sharp. A chromatic tuner is an electrical device that you can plug into your guitar using a standard 1/4" instrument cable. Chromatic tuners can be purchased at most music stores or online.If you can't buy a tuner, there are apps online that may also act as a tuner.Some tuners will work with electric and acoustic guitars.
If you want a more exact tuner, you can purchase a strobe tuner.;
, The standard tuning on a guitar starting from the thickest string, or the 6th string, is E, A, D, g, b, e. Plug the 1/4" cable from your guitar to the input of the tuner. Strum the top string on your guitar and rotate the tuning knobs on the headstock until your tuner's needle is in the center of an E note. Continue to do this to all of your strings until your guitar is in the standard tuning.Tuning your guitar in standard tuning will enable you to hear if notes down your neck are flat or sharp.
 Now move down your neck and hold down the 12th fret on the high e string. The note should be the same as it was when you played the open string. If the needle on the tuner is left of the 12 o'clock position, your string is flat. If the needle is on the right side of the 12 o'clock position, it means that your string is sharp., Check the other strings to see if they are in tune just as you did with the high e string. Take note of whether your strings are flat or sharp so that you can make the proper adjustments when setting the guitar's intonation.

 Add 1 cup (237 ml) of lemon juice and 1 cup (237 ml) of warm water to a spray bottle. Shake the bottle vigorously to ensure the ingredients are fully combined.You need a spray bottle that holds at least 16 ounces (473 ml)
While fresh lemon juice is best for the spray, you can use a bottled variety as long as it’s pure juice.
Because lemon is so acidic, it can dry out your hair even when it’s diluted with water. If you have dry or damaged hair, add 2 to 3 teaspoons (10 to 15 g) of your conditioner or a hair oil to the lemon mixture for extra hydration.;
, Once you’ve mixed the ingredients, apply the lemon lightening spray to your hair. Work it through with your fingers or a comb to ensure that it’s evenly distributed.If you prefer to use the lightening spray to create a highlighted effect, only apply the spray to strategic sections of your hair.
 After you’ve applied the spray to your hair, heat helps accelerate the lightening process. Go out in the sun for one to three hours to allow the warmth to help lighten your hair.The longer time you spend in the sun, the lighter your hair will end up.
If you don’t want to sit in the sun, place a shower cap or plastic wrap over your hair after you spray it to generate some heat.

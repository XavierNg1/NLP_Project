 The skin should start to soften. You may add Epsom salts, bath oils, or even tea if you like, but they're not necessary.


Add 1 cup of apple cider vinegar if your calluses are harsh. (Warning: do not add vinegar if you have diabetes or poor circulation.);
, Be sure to periodically clean the stone or file. Do not overly scrub your feet/hands. 5 minutes is enough time. You want to slowly take down the callus over a month or so. If you begin to feel pain or after you have removed a couple layers of skin, stop.
 Make sure that you clean off all of the dead skin.
 Use a thick foot or hand lotion to hold in extra moisture. Lotions with Urea in them are particularly good.


If you are about to go to bed, put on socks or gloves to hold in the moisture and lotion.
Repeat this entire process at the end of every week.
 Reapply lotion to the callused area after showering. Use a thicker cream for the best results.

 If you're musically inclined, try your hand at writing a song and lyrics to go with it. Writing a song is much like writing poetry, but you'll have have to fit the lyrics to a melody. Grab a pen and paper, then write about how you're feeling or about a situation you were in recently., Many people have an instrument gathering dust in a corner or a closet. Quiet Saturday nights are the perfect time to put the instrument to use and learn how to play. Start slow, and use internet tutorials or music books to learn the basics. If you don't already have an instrument, buy an inexpensive instrument like a ukulele or melodica with a basic songbook., One of the best things about being home alone is that you can sing as loud as you want, and no one will be annoyed. Put some jams on with your phone, computer or radio and sing along at the top of your lungs. For even more fun, pull up karaoke tracks of your favorite songs on youtube and practice your star power.

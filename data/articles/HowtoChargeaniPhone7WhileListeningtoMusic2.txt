 This will automatically launch iTunes. If for some reason it does not, you will have to open iTunes manually.


If you do not already have iTunes installed you can download it from https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/.
 The icon for the phone will appear just below the top menu bar, above the viewing area.
 There are two “Music” options in the left panel. You want the one listed under the “On My Device” header. This will display all of the music stored on your phone.
 You can use standard 3.5mm audio or USB connection to listen from your computer while the phone charges.
 Double click the music displayed in iTunes and you will play music from your phone through your computer’s sound system.

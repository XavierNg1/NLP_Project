 Turn the heat on medium-low and whisk everything vigorously, keeping it moving and making sure everything is well dissolved.
 Keep an eye on it, and keep whisking. Icing is a quick-moving process that should not take too long to cook.
 Stir the icing completely as it cools, then let it sit. Note that you do not have to use vanilla extract here -- as banana, almond, or even cocoa will go exceptionally well here.
, Creaming means using an electric mixer or fast-moving whisk to beat the sugar and oil together. For even richer icing, use 1/2 cup room temperature butter, as this leads to a delicious buttercream frosting.
 When flour/milk mixture is cool, mix together at high speed until creamy. At first, the icing may appear curdled. It will clear up as it is beaten.

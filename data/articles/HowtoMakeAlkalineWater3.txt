 Water ionizers attach to your faucet and are very user friendly. The water becomes electrically enhanced (ionized) because the ionizer runs it over positive and negative electrodes. Doing this separates the water into alkalized water and acidic water. The alkalized water makes up about 70% of the produced water and can be used for drinking.


Donâ€™t just discard the acidic water. Acidic water can kill many types of bacteria. You can use it for washing your body, killing some of the bacteria living on your skin.
 These filters are easily transportable and cheaper than buying an electric ionizer. They work in a similar fashion to a normal filter. Pour water into the filter and let it sit for three to five minutes. While you are waiting, the water is being sent through a series of filters. Once it passes through the filters, it sits in a pool of alkalizing minerals.These filters can often be found with the kitchen appliances in home stores.
 This type of filter is known as a hyperfilter, and it uses an especially fine membrane for filtration. The delicacy of the filter allows it to capture more elements than regular water filters, which ultimately alkalizes the water more completely.


These filters can be purchased at local home improvement or hardware stores and are located alongside traditional water filters.
 Water distillers boil the water put into them, destroying the bacteria and other impurities that may be found in your tap water. Water distillers can make your water slightly more alkaline, but to really alkalize your water, add pH drops to your newly purified water.


Water distillers range in price and size. They can be found alongside other kitchen appliances.

 You and your dogs can easily bring ticks into the house from outside, so one of the best ways to prevent an infestation is to vacuum your home regularly. Vacuuming helps suck up live ticks as well as any eggs that might have come in on you or your dogs.


You should vacuum your whole house, but also pay special attention to the areas where your dogs hang out the most – near their beds or favorite nap and play spots., You can prevent ticks from getting into your yard by making sure any grass and plants are neatly maintained. Cut your grass frequently, avoid storing any of your yard tools near the edge of the yard in tall grasses, and trim plants and bushes often., If you and your dogs take frequent walks, try to avoid heavily wooded areas or areas with a lot of tall grass. These types of areas are ticks’ natural habitat and taking your dogs through these types of areas almost guarantees your dogs will pick up some ticks.

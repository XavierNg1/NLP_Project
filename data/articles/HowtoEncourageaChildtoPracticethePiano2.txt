 How? Make it a part of their daily life. You can buy CD's by great artists like Horowitz or Rubinstein and have your child listen to them. There's nothing better than the moment when your child says, "Wow! I want to be like !" When that happens, tell your child that the pianist put a lot of work into developing his skill. S/he should practice on his/her own then! If not, tell him/her that pianist practiced a lot too.
 If you listen to rap music, for example, your child is going to listen to rap music too. Then, he/she may get influenced by rap music. The result is his/her interest in piano will decrease, but you want him/her to stay interested!

, If your budget permits, you may want to consider buying some sheet music. If your child is interested in piano, s/he will be further spurred to learn when you spend your money on books for him/her. It's like getting a 1st grader to read. You buy the 1st grader a book and s/he reads it. There's no difference with piano music.
 Music is like a language. It's only interesting when you learn to speak it. That's what it was like to great composers like Chopin and Beethoven. Compare this to TV. Would it interest you if you watched the Spanish channel but understood no Spanish at all? Your child's interest in piano could be greatly increased if he/she understood what it was about.
 Find a strict teacher who at least has the knowledge to say, "You need to practice at least an hour a day". Once your child gets skilled at piano, he/she will want to continue! If you were really good at tennis, wouldn't you want to keep playing it given the opportunity to do so? With a good teacher, a child can progress extremely quickly. However, find a bad one, and you'll find your child making little progress.

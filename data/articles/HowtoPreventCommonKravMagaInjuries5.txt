 There is a lot of grappling that goes on when trying to wrest a knife or gun from someone, or when breaking a choke. Some gear (like striking pads) can also cause cuts or abrasions, which means wounds that have to be covered. Here's how to minimize this.
 If you can't remember to cut them, start biting. Keeping your fingernails trimmed short will prevent you from "cat scratching" your partners, and they will appreciate that. They certainly won't appreciate when you accidentally slice off a strip of skin when you try to control the wrist of the hand that is holding the knife up to your throat because you have a tight grip, long nails and they tried to twist away.
 Under Armor makes some great weight gloves like this, but there are probably other brands available too. These gloves will prevent straps on pads from biting into the web of your hand between the thumb and first finger, causing blisters or cuts. They also may prevent the callous you grow from taking guns away on your index fingers. This may or may not be a good thing, you decide.

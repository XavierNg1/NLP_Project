 Make yourself the person he comes to when he has problems or needs advice. If he invites you to an event, do your best to be there. You want to present yourself to him as someone who is reliable and trustworthy.
 Most good relationships are based off an initial friendship. Spend time with him regularly and just get to know him better as a person, without pressure or expectations.
 You should never lie about yourself and especially about his girlfriend. If the guy you like found out that you lied to him about something so basic, there is no chance he will ever go out with you.
 This will let him know that you are happy to see him. If you see him somewhere, say hi to let him know that you notice him.

 There are several websites that provide an online PDF to text conversion service for free. And unlike the PDF to text converter, PDF to Word puts the document straight into your word processor. Just search "PDF to text" in any search engine online. Make sure that the result is free and reliable.


A good PDF to Word supports conversion of single file, batch files, and also selected pages. It helps users preserve the original layout of text, graphics, and images after conversion. Popular choices include deskUNPDF, SolidPDF, and PDF Converter.
 Depending on the converter, you may be asked for your name or email address. Some converters can complete the conversion online, while others will email the finished product to you.
 The converter will allow you to browse your files to upload the PDF that you want to edit.
 Wait for the file to finish converting. This could take a few minutes or longer depending on the size of the file.
 Once the file is finished converting, you will be able to either open it online, or to retrieve it from your email.
 Use Microsoft Word to edit the file.
 When you're done editing, save the file.
 If you'd like to return your file to PDF form after editing it, simply repeat the conversion process, using a Word-to-PDF conversion service online. The process is the same -- find a reliable converter, upload the text file, and wait for it to finish converting back to its PDF form. You can also just convert the file back right from Microsoft Word if you have the right software.

 While too much tanning can damage your skin, a light "sun-glow" is practically the definition of radiant skin. Limit your sun exposure to 30 minutes or an hour each day, and still wear sunscreen. It may take some time, but a light, even tan will make your skin really radiate.


Use bronzer along with a light, natural tan for healthy, glowing skin.
 Makeup is perfect for faking beautifully glowy skin. Try an illuminating primer for a long-lasting glow or a light reflecting foundation for gorgeous natural looking skin. For an even more radiant glow try adding a highlighter to the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, your cupid's bow and the center of your chin. It's also recommend you opt for cream and liquid formulas instead of powder for healthier looking skin.
 While overusing makeup may ultimately lead to blocked pores and duller skin, a little bit can go a long way. Some ideas include:


Face: blend your foundation with some moisturizer to create a sheer, dewy complexion for yourself. The perfect amount of coverage but with plenty of moisture.






Eyes: put a tiny dot of highlighter on the part of the eyelid just above your pupil, this will make you look wide awake. Also, use a pale pink or white eyeliner pencil to line the inner rims of your lower lash line.






Cheeks: use a good highlighter on the high points of your face, to make you look radiant, wide awake and healthy. Some people say that high beam is "a supermodel in a bottle"!

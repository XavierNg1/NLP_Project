 Open the Zoosk mobile app from your phone. You can do this by going to your phone’s home screen or app tray and tapping on the application.
 When the app opens up, it will ask for your login information at the top of the screen. Tap on the email box and type in your email address, and then do the same for your password. Tap the green login button to load your account.
 On the left side of your home page, you will see a box with 3 lines through it, tap on this box to open up a new set of options to your left.
 When the new list pops up, tap on “Connections” to open up all of your current Zoosk connections.
 Once you locate the connection you want to block, tap on the box next to his or her name to open up an option that says “Block/Report”; tap on that new box.
 A pop-up window will appear on your phone’s screen. If you tap the empty box at the top, you can select the reason you want to report and block this person. Once you find a suitable reason, tap on it.
 Below the reason is a box that says additional information; tap inside this box if you want to add any other additional information.


This step is optional.
 When you are finished, tap the “Report” button below additional information to report and block that particular user.

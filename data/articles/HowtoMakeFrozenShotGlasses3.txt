 However, instead of pouring in just water or all one color of liquid, pour in layers. For example, a green, orange and clear layered shot glass would be made as follows:









Pour a third green liquid into the mold. Then freeze.
Pour in a third of chilled clear liquid. Then freeze.
Pour in a third of chilled orange liquid. Then freeze.
 The three layers should now form a complete shot glass. It's a little extra work but it looks very effective. Use as outlined above.

 Believe it or not, a pocket of loose change can actually be used as a weapon if you know how to use it properly. If there is an attacker in front of you, try throwing the change to his or her face. It may be sufficient to buy you time to escape or try another form of quick attack.
 This isn't really a weapon as such but is great if you use it as a shield. It doesn't have to be a backpack, it can be any type of suitcase or bag, to hold up against fists or thrown objects.



 


Just remember it's not bulletproof, so it won't do you any good if the attacker has a gun.
 If you fill up a bottle half way it can be used as an impact. That means that it is good for smacking the attacker with.






A hot drink might be useful if you need to defend yourself seriously. Remember though, that hot liquids scald and you will be inflicting injury on the other person. When defending yourself, this may be defensible but you may also get into serious trouble for causing injury too.
 You can use a flashlight to hit the attacker with.






You can also use it in a tactical way by flashing it in his or her eyes and temporarily blind the attacker.
 It's not the best but it's good if you don't have anything else to protect yourself with. It can be used to push away, hit, open out and scare, etc.






It can also be used as shield.
 This is a weapon you need to make but it is super easy to make. Just grab a sock and slip something hard it like a bar of soap, or a battery.

This weapon is mostly used in prison by the prisoners when they start a riot.

, One of the first ideas for getting a website is to find a hosting company or set up competent server hosting on-site.
 Another primary task in designing a website for a law firm is to set up the necessary Internet real estate for displaying pages of the website. Make sure the domains are good, solid ones and allow for an appropriate number of individual pages. Obtaining a simple, easy-to-remember domain name is a positive step to take as well.
 Some law firms use WordPress or associated technology for displaying their websites. Others rely on more complex web-coding programs. The project manager will need to decide how to set up the site and whether to outsource the technical build to an expert web design company.


Accommodate a color scheme. Make sure you know what colors work for the promotional items you may be inserting into the website for the law firm client. Select appropriate colors and apply them to the entire site as necessary.
Address layout. The layout of the webpages is extremely important. Experts recommend setting specific parameters for display on various web browsers as well as the Internet formats for smart phones and other devices.
 Write legal content that applies to the law firm, or hire SEO writers or others to pursue that content.


Write content in specific practice areas that are relevant to what the law firm does.
Address any legal issues with content. There may be some limitations on practice area content according to federal, state or local laws. Ask your client about any restrictions or limitations to the content that you can use to drive traffic to the site.
 Ask the client about long-term goals and make sure that your website design facilitates expansion as necessary over the years to come.

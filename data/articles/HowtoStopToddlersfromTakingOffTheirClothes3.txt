 Toddlers often simply enjoy the feeling of being naked, so removing clothing is actually a perfectly natural practice. This means that you don’t need to discourage or prohibit this behavior entirely, but should rather allow them to run around naked during allotted periods of time at home.Some good times for this relaxation include 30 minutes after bath time or right before naptime.
Even though your toddler is too young to understand social customs or guidelines of appropriateness, you can make it clear that nakedness is only okay at home through other means. Don’t ever allow naked time in the car, outside, or at another person’s house, and make getting dressed something clearly associated with leaving the house or seeing people from outside of the family.
 Your toddler is more likely to want to keep an outfit on if they had a hand in choosing it. When getting dressed in the morning, lay out two or three options of pants and tops and have them point to the one they want to wear. If they have a tried-and-true favorite in their wardrobe, let them wear it as often as you can clean it. You’ll improve the chances of a fully clothed day, while also encouraging your child to express themselves through sartorial choices.If your toddler needs some new clothes, have them come along with you when shopping. If they see, point to, or otherwise express interest in an item within your budget, purchase it!

, If your toddler enjoys fidgeting with clothing, they’re probably fiddling with their own clothes as the easiest and most accessible option. By giving them a doll and some removable clothing for it, you let them act out this interest on a toy instead of on themselves.If your toddler seems uninterested by this kind of dress-up, gather up a costume chest so that they can play dress-up with friends or siblings.

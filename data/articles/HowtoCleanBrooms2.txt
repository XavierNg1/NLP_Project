 Because brooms are large, you'll need to mix the soap and water in a bucket to ensure the broom head can fully soak. Fill a small bucket with warm water and add a few squirts of liquid dish soap. Mix the soap and water together until it’s sudsy.
 This gives the soap a chance to work into the broom bristles. It also allows the soap to disinfect your broom.








If the broom is used somewhere where germs are more likely to accumulate, like a bathroom, add a drop of two of bleach to the bucket.
 Holding the broom head under a running faucet, rub the bristles between your fingers. Do this until all the detergent has run off the bristles and the water runs clear.
 While the broom head is soaking, wipe down the broom handle. You can use any type of disinfecting cleaning wipe to wipe down the handle. You can also dip a cloth in the bucket the broom head is soaking in and use that to wipe down the handle.
 You can also lean the broom-head up against an outdoor wall, since drying in the sunlight can help kill off any bacteria. Make sure the broom is completely dry before you use it again – you don’t want to drag wet dirt across your floor.

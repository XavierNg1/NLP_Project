 You will need to right-click on a blank space on your desktop; right-clicking on an icon will pull up the wrong menu.
 This is located towards the bottom of the window.
 You will have three options for making icons larger: "Smaller - 100% (default)", "Medium - 125%", and "Larger - 150%". These presets allow you to magnify various aspects of your desktop, including the taskbar icons.


Note: This will also change the size of other elements, such as title bars, text, and windows.
 Click the "Set custom text size (DPI)" link to open the custom DPI selector. This will allow you to choose magnification up to 500% the original size. If you are using older programs from Windows XP that aren't designed to scale, check the "Use Windows XP style DPI scaling" box.
 Most changes will not take effect until you exit Windows and log back in. You can either do this now or later.

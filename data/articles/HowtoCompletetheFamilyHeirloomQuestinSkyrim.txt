 After completing the “Animal Extinction” quest of the Companions storyline, go back to the Jorrvaskr (the easternmost hall in Whiterun) and look for a Nord male companion named Vilkas. Talk to him.;
, Vilkas will tell you that a certain family has had their family heirloom stolen by thieves. You’ll then be given the name of the item you’ll need to find and where you can find it, which is both selected randomly by the game.
 If you didn’t catch Vilkas’ instructions about where you need to go, you can open the Map through the In-Game Menu and check the exact location where the map arrow is pointing at. Follow this pointer, and you should find the place you need to go, which is usually a dungeon or a cave.
 Enter the dungeon or cave where Vilkas told you to go. The task is pretty simple: all you need to do is to kill every enemy living inside the lair. Use whatever weapon or spell you have and defeat every enemy you may encounter.
 The caves or dungeons will not be very complicated, and will always lead to a dead end. Once you get to the end of the lair you’ll find a treasure box. Open it and you should find the heirloom you’re looking for.


You’ll also always find an exit at the end of the lair that will take you back to the outside world easily.
 Travel back to Jorrvaskr in Whiterun and talk to Vilkas once more. Give the item to him to complete the quest.

 Very hot water feels great, but warm water is best for your skin. Fill the bath with warm water. Fill it enough so that you submerge most of your body in the water., Two cups (473 g) of Epsom salt is a standard amount to use in a bath. This amount will work for just about anyone, but you can tailor the amount of Epsom salt you use to your body weight. The quantity of Epsom salt you should use based on your weight is:


1/2 cup (170 g) for children that are 60lbs and under
1 cup (340 g) for people between 60 and 100lbs
1 ½ cup (354.9 g) for people between 100-150lbs
2 cups (473 g) for people between 150-200lbs
An additional ½ cup for each every 50lbs

, Using a dry brush helps increase the detoxification that Epsom salt provides. The dry brush opens the pores, allowing the skin to absorb the salt. Scrub all over your body, including your face, but focus on any problem areas you may have. Scrub for about 5 minutes during your bath.You may want to use a separate loofah on your face if you have a rash on your body.
Problem areas could mean sore muscles, rashes, etc.
 Stay in the bath between 15 and 40 minutes. If you soak for 40 minutes, the first 20 is for your body to detoxify, and the second 20 is when your skin absorbs the Epsom salt. Soaking for less than 40 minutes will be beneficial, though.

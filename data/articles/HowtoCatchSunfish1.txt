 You don’t need anything special or fancy to catch sunfish. Cane poles, fiberglass poles, flycasting tackle, and ultralight spinning tackle can all be used to fish for sunfish. A 4-pound line and small hook is also good for catching sunfish.You may also attach a float and sinker weight.;
, Sunfish are typically small fish. You won’t catch a sunfish with a large hook because it will be too large for their mouth to close around it. To ensure that you catch your fish, use a small hook.Hook sizes number six to ten work well.
 Sunfish are not picky and will bite just about anything. The easiest and most common types of bait used to catch sunfish are crickets, earthworms, red wigglers, and grubs. Though you can use dead or thawed bait, live bait is better.You can also use other species of worms or even balls of bread.
When using worms, only use part of the worm because you only need a small amount on the hook. Too much of the worm on the hook can make it difficult to catch the fish. They may nibble part of the worm and avoid the hook.
 When you are fishing around brush, weeds, or rocks, you shouldn’t use live bait. Instead, use small flies or other artificial bait. You can also try small spinners, spinnerbaits, and jig-spinners.Sunfish are usually caught on small lures because they are small fish with small mouths.

While many recipes can have rice added to them, not all recipes will pair well with the addition of rice. A chicken and vegetable recipe would pair great with rice whereas an apple crisp cooked in the crock pot would not pair well with rice.;

There are many different kinds of rice, each with its own suggested cooking time. White converted rice will cook much more quickly than brown rice. Wild rice takes the longest to cook.



Unless your recipe states differently, rice should be added to the crock pot at the end of the cooking time. Rice left to cook in the crock pot for hours tends to become mushy and tasteless. Always add sufficient water or liquid to cook the rice. Follow the guidelines below.
White converted rice should be added to the crock pot with about 2 hours left of cooking time; add an additional 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) of water or other liquid per 1 cup of rice to the crock pot. Cook on low heat.
Brown rice should be added to the crock pot with 3 hours left of cooking time; add an additional 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) of water or other liquid per 1 cup of rice to the crock pot. Cook on low heat.
Wild rice should be added to the crock pot with 3 hours left of cooking time; add an additional 2 cups (480 ml) of water or other liquid per 1 cup of wild rice to the crock pot. Cook on low heat.



Another option for adding rice to a crock pot recipe is to prepare the rice on the stove top and add it to the crock pot during the last few minutes of cooking time. Simply prepare the rice according to the directions on the package. The rice can even be made ahead of time and refrigerated until you're ready. If the rice is cold, simply add it to the crock pot with 30 minutes left of cooking time.

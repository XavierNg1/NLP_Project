 Listen for increasing sounds and babbling as they grow. Children usually become fully verbal by 16 to 24 months of age.


A typical baby will be able to share sounds back-and-forth with you like sharing a conversation by nine months of age. An autistic baby may not be verbal at all or may have been verbal but then lost the skill.
A typical child will be babbling by about 12 months of age.
 Talk together about your child’s favourite toy and listen to their sentence structure and conversation skills. Typically developing children will have many words by 16 months of age, can create their own meaningful, two-word phrases by 24 months of age, and have coherent sentences by age five.


An autistic child tends to misplace words in sentence structure or simply repeat others’ phrases or sentences, called parroting or echolalia.They might mix up pronouns, saying "Do you want pancakes?" when they are trying to say that they want pancakes.Some autistic children pass over the “kid-speak” phase and have superior language skills. They may learn to speak early, and/or grow large vocabularies. They may converse differently than their peers do.
 Determine if your child takes phrases literally. An autistic child tends to misinterpret body language, tone of voice, and expressions.


If you have a moment of sarcastic frustration and claim, “How wonderful!” when you find your autistic child has used his red marker all over the living room walls, they may think you literally mean their art is wonderful.
 Autistic children often have unique nonverbal communication. Because most people are used to watching non-autistic body language, this may be confusing to you and others at times.


Robotic, singsong, or unusually childish tone of voice (even into teen or adult years)
Body language that does not seem to match their mood
Little variation in facial expressions, exaggerated facial expressions, or otherwise unique expressions

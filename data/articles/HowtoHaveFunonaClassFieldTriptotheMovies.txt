 Bring money for your ticket, money for popcorn and soda, a book to read on the bus, and some candy. You may also want to bring a book if it's the first release of the movie where lines are usually formed to the theater.;
, Make sure the movie times accommodate your schedule. You wouldn't watch Lord Of The Rings if you had a dentist appointment in an hour, right?

, Movie theaters are hot and stuffy because of carbon dioxide, so make sure you don't wear anything puffy. A comfortable tee shirt and some jeans are probably the best choice.
 If you are known for being tardy, make sure to set an alarm clock. Your teacher will be angry at you, and you'll risk missing the field trip bus by being late.
 If the movie's 3D, make sure the person gives you your glasses, or else the whole movie will look blurry and you won't enjoy it at all.
 Make sure you brought enough money for all the goodies you want. Some good things to buy are popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, and Icee. But remember, nothing at the movies is cheap. Just the popcorn might cost you $6.00.
 You probably wouldn't want to go during the climax of the movie, and your classmates will be annoyed at you for passing by the screen.
 The last row will probably be the least crowded, so you'll be the most comfortable there. You may also want to sit next to your best friend. It's even better if you and your friend only have each other, because the movie will be better like that. The popular people, however, will be bunched up like sardines in a can. You and your friend will have all the room you want.
 Put yourself in the other children/adults in the theater's shoes. Would you like it if you were an adult trying to watch a movie while 20 school kids are jabbering on about gossip?

, Just sit back, munch your popcorn, and watch the show.

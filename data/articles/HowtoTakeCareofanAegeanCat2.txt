 Aegean cats are from the Greek isles, and they are natural fisherman, so much of their natural diet is fish. Make sure to feed them fish-flavored food often since they love it so much.Cats are supposed to eat a meat-based diet, and need certain amino acids from proteins in meat. Ask your vet to suggest a cat food for you. You may also want to read the label to check the ingredient list.


Meat should be in the top two or three ingredients. Avoid foods with less than 40% protein. Try to buy a food that is grain free.
You can look for cat food that is salmon, tuna, or other fish flavored.
 Aegean cats are generally healthy and don’t have any known genetic diseases. However, you should still take them to get regular veterinary checkups. Your cat should go to the vet at least once each year.


Get your cat vaccinated against common feline diseases to protect their health. They will need booster shots each year.
 If your cat isn’t spayed or neutered, consider getting it done. Cats can be neutered around five to six months, which is before a female cat can get pregnant. Spaying or neutering your cat can also reduce the occurrence of behaviors like spraying to mark territory or behaviors connected with being in heat.


Being spayed can also reduce your female cat’s risk of cancer.

 Get some nice scented candles, get your favorite happy and calming music, scented soap, bubble bath liquid and a face mask made from mashed avocado and honey.
 Put a face mask on and relax, just enjoying your soak. If you don't have a bathtub, just take a nice, long hot shower.
 Comb your hair, do a manicure, exfoliate your face, etc.
 Soak your feet in a hot tub for a couple of minutes then dry them vigorously. Massage each toe 5 times in a clockwise and counterclockwise direction. Pull each toe out after you're done. Massage your soles with your fingers first, then. Finish by lightly tapping your soles.
 Fluffy socks will do too.

 A full roasted chicken can be bought from most grocery stores and is an excellent meal for the family. When you’ve removed most of the meat from the chicken, add the bones and skin to a pot or Dutch oven. Then:Cover the chicken carcass with water.
Insert your veggies to the mix.
Simmer the mixture for 4 hours with the lid partially covering the pot.
Remove the bones with a slotted spoon and strain the broth through a sieve to ensure the soup has a smooth consistency. Enjoy your soup., You may have leftover curry from eating out, or you may have made curry previously and have some extra on hand. Blend this with a can of coconut milk and simmer your veggies in it until they are soft. This mix will make an aromatic, tasty soup.


Depending on your tastes and the amount of curry you have, you’ll likely have to adjust the amount of coconut milk you add to suit your preferences. Add the coconut milk a little at a time and taste it to discern whether you need more., If you don’t have a chicken carcass or curry, canned tomatoes and vegetable stock can form the base of your soup. Prepare your veggies in oil as you would normally for a broth based soup. When sautéing the veggies in the oil:


Add about 2.6 lbs (1200 g) of canned plum tomatoes (roughly 3 cans worth).
Add in 2 cups (500 ml) of vegetable stock and 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar.
Simmer the ingredients for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to dissolve.
Mix in ½ cup (118 ml) of cream, adjust the seasoning of the soup to taste, and enjoy.

 Allergies are one possible reason you might have bags under your eyes. If you're experiencing other allergy symptoms, taking an over-the-counter antihistamine might be a worthwhile option to consider.Similarly, puffy bags can develop beneath your eyes during a cold or sinus infection. Over-the-counter medications meant to treat these conditions may help reduce bags under the eyes, too., If sinus problems cause your puffy eyes but an antihistamine doesn't reduce those bags thoroughly enough, consider using a neti pot to flush out the extra fluid building up beneath your eyes.Dissolve 1/4 tsp (0.6 ml) finely ground non-ionized salt in 8 oz (250 ml) of warm water.
Pour this solution into a clean neti pot, then tip your head to the side and use the neti pot to pour half the solution into one nostril. Tip your forehead lower to help the solution drain out of your other nostril.
Repeat the same process using the other half of the solution, swapping sides to cleanse your sinus passages more thoroughly.
 There are numerous eye creams formulated to help reduce puffy bags. Look for one that claims to be fast-acting for the quickest results.


Retinol eye creams are a popular choice.While these creams work well in the long run by promoting collagen production, they may not provide immediate results.A better option for fast relief might be an eye cream with caffeine in it. Caffeine constricts the blood vessels responsible for inflammation and discoloration.Another possibility would be eye creams with Arnica, a natural anti-inflammatory ingredient., Make sure you're drinking the recommended eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water per day. Puffiness beneath the eyes can be caused by water retention, but dehydration actually causes your body to retain more water.On a similar note, you should also cut back on foods and drinks that may worsen dehydration when dealing with bags beneath your eyes. This includes salt, alcohol, and caffeine.

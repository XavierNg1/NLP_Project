 Lay down old towels, rags, or drop cloths over the floor and surfaces on which you’ll be standing or sitting, laying down materials, or rinsing off.


The bathroom is a good spot to avoid dye messes because you have close access to a sink and a shower for the rinsing process. However, you should make sure you get good ventilation in your bathroom to avoid the chemical fumes.
Remember that you will have time to wait while the dye sits on your hair to process. Protect your hair and any other surfaces where you go during this time from coming in contact with one another.
 Always wear the plastic gloves provided to you in your dye kit, or purchase disposable gloves from the store, to protect your hands from the dye.


Wear gloves throughout the duration of your dyeing process, from mixing the dye to applying it. You can even keep the gloves on to rinse your hair out until the water runs clear.
Even if you have the gloves included with your dye, it’s a good idea to have other disposable ones nearby, in case the first pair breaks or it’s hard to apply the dye in the typically too-big, generic size that comes in your kit.
 Wear clothes you don’t mind getting ruined and cover your shoulders with a rag towel for extra protection. Dab petroleum jelly or oil around your hairline, ears, and neck to make it easy to wipe away dye from those areas later.


If you do get dye on your neck and ears, try using clarifying shampoo and a wet towel to dab away the stains after you rinse out the dye from your hair.You can also try baby oil, olive oil, or a gentle dish soap or laundry detergent to remove stains from skin., If your hair dye gets on the sink or counter or another surface nearby, spray the spot with bleach and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes before wiping it away.If the dye got on clothes or other fabrics, you may be able to spot-treat it with bleach also, but these stains are very difficult to remove.

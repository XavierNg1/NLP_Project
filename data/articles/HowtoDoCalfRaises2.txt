 It's always a good rule of thumb to start with lighter weights, and work your way up to heavier ones. Get two dumbbells of the same weight, and stand with your feet about shoulder width apart.
 If you have trouble with your balance, it's a good idea to have a chair nearby with the back facing you. You can also perform this exercise while facing a wall.
 Make sure that your arms are below your shoulders, and keep a firm grip on the dumbbells.
 Shift your weight onto the balls of your feet while keeping your legs straight. Continue to keep your arms alongside your body.









There is no arm movement involved, as the weights are meant to train your calf muscles.
While your legs should be straight, it's a good idea to keep a micro bend in your knees to avoid locking them up.
 Do this movement with as much control as possible.









You should feel a nice stretch and little tension in your lower legs, particularly your calves.
 That's an adequate number of repetitions for most people, and should gradually strengthen your calf muscles.

 The opposite corner should be folded over the first fold that you made, so that the only corner showing is the second fold that you made.


The opposite corner of the scarf should touch the center of the new flat edge created by your first fold.;
, Your scarf should look like a long strand with pointed edges. There will be a slight gap in the middle where your folds have met.


These folds may seem like they will not hold, but donâ€™t worry. They will actually create volume later on.
 Then fold the other edge over it so that it is completely covered.


This last fold will serve to protect the earlier folds. Hold it tight in the center, then pick up the scarf so that it hangs in a U-shape with the fold on the inside.
 The bias fold is the basic starting point for most knots.


It is not necessary to fold your scarf this way-- you can fold it lengthwise. If you are looking for the elegant pointed ends that are often seen in magazines, however, this fold is the way to go.

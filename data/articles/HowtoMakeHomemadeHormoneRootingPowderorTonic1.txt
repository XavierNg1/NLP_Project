 There are four types of stem cuttings based on the growth stage of the plant: Herbaceous, softwood, semi-hardwood and hardwood.It is important to know what the plant is, as this is part of determining whether or not the cutting will even root.As such, you need to know what time of year is the best time for taking cuttings from the plant in question. Do some research into the plant to find out its specific best times for taking the cuttings. Provided you have taken the cutting at the right stage in its growth, the rooting process is more likely to be successful than not, especially when adding a rooting hormone and using an appropriate growing medium.


Note that woody ornamental plants, herbs and some flower species tend to root more easily than cuttings from trees., Rooting hormone is helpful but should never be overdone. Whichever rooting hormone you choose to use, be it commercial or a homemade variety, use it sparingly. Too much can cause problems such as burning the cutting, stifling growth, creating a growing medium for fungus or bacteria or discouraging root growth in some way.
 To prevent the transference of possible disease to later cuttings, don't dip each cutting into the large container of your homemade rooting hormone.Always tip or pour it into a small container for each batch of cuttings, then discard once used. Or, only make sufficient for that day's cuttings.

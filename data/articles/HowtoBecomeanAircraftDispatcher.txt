The FAA requires dispatchers to have prior experience around airplanes and with flight planning. Entry-level jobs that provide such experience include dispatch clerk and radio operator; other positions, which include additional education (usually a college degree), include meteorologist or station manager.



Technical knowledge, such as how to craft and send a Notice to Airmen about hazardous conditions, or how to calculate fuel and weight for takeoff and landing, is required prior to taking the aircraft dispatcher test. You should be able to easily learn the relevant material as a lower-level aviation industry employee.



The FAA mandates that dispatcher courses offer 200 hours of training, which usually runs over 6 weeks. In the program, you will learn the basics of the dispatcher job, including flight diagnostics, advanced calculations, and proper communication protocol.
Many community colleges offer dispatcher training courses. There are also several for-profit training programs around the country. Likewise, many airlines offer the training course to current employees trying to become aircraft dispatchers.



Contact the FAA for test dates in your area. You must be at least 23 years old at the time of the test and must take the test within 90 days of completing your training course.
The first part of the test consists of 80 written questions covering basic aircraft dispatcher knowledge and takes 3 hours. The second part of the test is a practical exam and requires you to demonstrate mastery of flight planning, emergency protocol, pre-flight and departure procedures, in-flight practices, landing regulations, and post-flight procedures.

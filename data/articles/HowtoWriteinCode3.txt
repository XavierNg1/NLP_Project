 Start your coding by writing out the entire alphabet neatly, giving ample space to write directly below it. You'll be organizing your codes on a single sheet of paper, so you don't want to run out of room. Your alphabet should fit into one uniform row.
 Go through the alphabet, after you've written it out in normal order, and write it in reversed order. This means that Z will sit under A, Y under B, X under C, and so on. It's good to write it out completely, as this will help you visualize the entirety of your code.


Start to memorize the code, as this will save you time in writing it out in the future. Know that by practicing it, you will grow more comfortable working in the code eventually.
 Using the code as a guide, you'll begin to translate your message into your reversed code. Start by writing out your message in normal English. Below this, you'll use your key to translate this message into the reversed alphabet. The message "HELLO," for example, would be read as "SVOOL."


When decoding a message, look at the bottom row of your key and follow to the letter above. The letter above will correlate to the letter in English.
 It will also save you time in writing out your key. To prepare to write in this code, simply write the letters A through M and then write the rest of the alphabet, N through Z, underneath them.


When translating using the half-reversed alphabet, A will equal N, and N will also equal A. It's a two-way correlation, so some people find will find it easier and quicker to assess when translating.

 Before you begin clipping the back lines, secure your poodle at the front by placing your hand on your dog’s neck. If your dog has trouble standing still, use a slide collar to secure your dog. Attach the slide collar to a table or a cupboard to secure your poodle.Your dog should be standing throughout the entire process.
 Standing at the rear of your dog, use a clipper with a number 10 blade to shave a vertical line down your dog’s back. The vertical line should start between your poodle’s shoulder blades, i.e., at the base of the neck band, and continue down to the base of its tail. To set the straight line, go over the line again with your clippers.Make sure your poodle is standing completely straight throughout the process.
A number 10 blade is appropriate for standard poodles. If you have a smaller poodle, use a narrower toe blade instead.
 Starting at your dog’s last rib, shave a horizontal line down your dog’s right side. The line should end at your poodle’s underside. Go over the line once more with your clippers.Placement of this line will depend on the size of your dog. On very long dogs, this line will be a bit more forward in comparison to dogs with shorter backs.
 Once you have completed the horizontal line behind your dog’s last rib, create an angled line. Create the angled line by clipping the corners of the pattern, i.e., where the vertical and horizontal lines meet.Repeat steps three and four on the left side of your dog. Once both sides are shaved, the lines should resemble a cross when viewing your dog from above.
 Use a snap on "E" comb to trim your poodle’s body. Trim just enough so that the lines a more visible. Then, create a “bevel” on your poodle’s patterned lines. Create a "bevel" by combing the longer coat over the clipped lines. Scissor the edges of the coat.

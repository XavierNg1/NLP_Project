 Sit down on the toilet so any blood will drip into the toilet bowl and not onto the floor or your clothing.;
, Don't throw away the wrapper--it's perfect for wrapping up and disposing of your pad when you change it later., There's usually a long piece of wax-like paper covering the adhesive on the bottom of the pad. The wrapper may also double as backing, so the adhesive will already be exposed., Make sure the adhesive is stuck firmly to the fabric of your underwear.


If your pad has wings, remove the backing and fold them around the middle part of your underwear, so it looks like the pad his hugging your underwear.Make sure the pad isn't too far forward or too far back--it should be centered in your underwear.
 It may feel uncomfortable at first (kind of like a diaper), so walk around the bathroom to get used to the feel. You should change your pad every 3-4 hours (or sooner if you have a really heavy flow). Changing your pad will help keep it from leaking and keep you feeling fresh.
 If you're in a public place, look for a small trashcan on the floor or attached to the wall of the stall. Discard the soiled pad in the trash--never, ever throw it in the toilet, even if the packaging says it is okay to do so. It will clog the plumbing.


If you are at home and you have pets, you may want to throw the used pad into a trashcan with a lid or even the trash bin that the garbage men collect. Cats and dogs especially can be attracted to the smell of the blood on your pad. Your dog eating your tampon or pad is not only embarrassing, but it can be life-threatening to your pet.

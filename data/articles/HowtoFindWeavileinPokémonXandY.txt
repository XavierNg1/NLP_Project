 They can be found before the 7th gym when you are on the Mamoswine. If you want an easier route, breed a Sneasel in another game and trade it over.;
, They can be purchased in the Battle Maison after you beat the game for 48 Battle Points (BP).
 This will only work if the game's clock is set from 8:00 PM to 3:59 AM. If it is not, go to the 3DS's settings to change the clock then.

 You can now use a Weavile.

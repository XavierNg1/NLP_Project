 Pick a time each day to go through your backpack and sort your papers and other supplies. Move graded work and old handouts to a folder you keep at home, so you can use them to study later. Check that all your homework assignments are packed into the right folder in your binder.


Some people remember to do this more often if they organize their binder right after they get home. Waiting too long can make you unwilling to return to "school mode."

, A daily planner or portable calender makes keeping track of assignments much easier. Many people write down each assignment in the space provided for the day it is due. If you keep forgetting to look ahead at your assignment, however, you can try a different system that keeps all your current assignments in the same place:Each time you are given a new assignment, write it down in your planner in the space for today' date. Write the due date next to the name of the assignment.
Each evening after school, look at your planner's entry for yesterday's date. Cross out any assignments you've completed, then re-write the names of all uncompleted assignments in today's date.
 Notebooks, binders, and returned assignments can easily get lost in a pile of clutter when you leave them at home. Prevent this by clearing space on a bookshelf or drawer, and always keep your notebooks in the same place. Put all papers left at home in a special folder for that class, separate from the one in your binder.
 Ideally, you won't need extra notebooks, but some teachers will require you to use them. If they do, make it easy to remember which is which by keeping them color coded. For example, if you keep your math papers after a blue divider in your binder, use a blue notebook and supply case for your math class.

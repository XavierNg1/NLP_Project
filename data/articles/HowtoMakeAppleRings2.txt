 Along with the prepared apples and your other ingredients, you'll also need a large mixing bowl, two small mixing bowls, a whisk, a deep pan for frying (or a deep fryer), and metal cooling racks.
 Fill your frying pan with about an inch (2.5 cm) of oil. Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 F (177 C).Use a deep fryer or candy thermometer to maintain a consistent temperature.


The best oils for frying include coconut, peanut, and canola.In case you don’t have a thermometer, drop a single popcorn kernel into the cold oil. When the kernel pops, your oil is ready.If you're using a deep fryer, make sure the oil is fresh, otherwise your apples could taste like fish and French fries and anything else you’ve fried in that oil.
 In your small dish, combine ⅓ cup (75 g) of sugar and 2 teaspoons (10 g) of cinnamon. Set the bowl aside.


The remaining cinnamon and sugar called for in the recipe are for the batter.
 In a large mixing bowl, measure in the flour, baking powder, salt, ⅛ teaspoon (0.6 g) of cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of sugar., In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the egg and buttermilk until fully combined. When they are ready, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk the batter together.Instead of buttermilk, you can use plain yogurt if you prefer.
 One at a time, dip the apple rings into the batter to coat them. Wipe off excess batter on the side of the bowl. Lay a few slices in the frying pan at a time, being sure not to crowd them, otherwise the batter will stick together and the apples rings will merge.


Fry each batch for two to four minutes, turning once, until the rings are golden brown and crispy., When the apple rings are done, remove them from the oil and hold them over the pan to let the excess oil drip off. Toss each one into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat both sides.Once coated, lay the apple rings on a wire rack, which will allow them to cool without getting soggy.

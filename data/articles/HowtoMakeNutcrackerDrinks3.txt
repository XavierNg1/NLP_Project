 This particular recipe is for a single-serving nutcracker, but be warned that as per tradition, the alcohol content is quite high., Measure all your ingredients into a large glass or small pitcher. Serve in a glass or clear plastic juice bottle.
 Another option for this drink is to serve it semi-frozen like a margarita. A frozen nutcracker is called a nemo, after the movie "Finding Nemo." Instead of mixing ingredients in a pitcher, blend them in a blender with equal parts ice until a slushy consistency is achieved.Serve as usual.

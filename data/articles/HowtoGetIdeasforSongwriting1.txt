 You experience your own life, and you get to experience the feelings first-hand. If you're going through some tough times, you can always write a song about it. You'll find that your song will include your emotions in it. When there's emotions in a song, it comes to life. It is a good practice to keep a journal or have a blog to record down your daily experiences. Not only do you practice writing, you reflect on the day and it'll come back to you when you need inspiration.;
, This is one of the most common song-writing themes. Many songs we hear these days revolve around love. It can be either a happy song or a sad song. If you were to talk about your love leaving your side for another person, then it would be a sad love song. Maybe you can write about how magical the feeling is like to fall in love. Remember, include your emotions if you can.
 Write a song about how you are able to conquer the odds. Whenever you feel low, just think about how you are able to come all the way here. Think about positive things that can raise your confidence and boost your mood. Your song will sound very positive and not only will you feel better after that, other people, whom you have shared your song with, might feel good as well.
 Just play the piano or strum a few chords on the guitar. After doing so for awhile, just start singing. There may be some of time where you'll just be singing "hmm..." but no worries, the words will eventually come to you. Let inspiration strike you. That's how some songs came about.

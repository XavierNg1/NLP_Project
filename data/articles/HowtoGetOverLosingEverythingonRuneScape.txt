 Don't just stop playing because you lost you're beloved gear or money. Realize that all can be made right again with a little bit of hard work. Nothing in the game is worth making never play it again. If you need to, taking a small break can be needed to clear your thoughts.;
, If you lost your bank PKing, then do some questing or skilling for a little bit. Not only does this prevent you from losing what remaining money you have to the same event, you will be training your account and, in some skills, be making money to buy back your supplies!

, This gives you people to talk to to get your mind off losing your stuff. Chances are, they've been in the same situation as you and can relate. This gives you other people to play with, and people that you can talk to.
 Start making money to buy your supplies back. You wouldn't be heartbroken about losing your stuff if it didn't mean something to you. Even doing little things like saving a bit of money here and here can add up everywhere.
 Whether it's not going into the wilderness with your stuff or changing your IP address to prevent yourself from DDoS attacks, you don't want to have to repeat this process again.

 Oil comes in different "weights," and different cars require different weights. Check your car's user manual to figure out what kind of oil you need to use, then buy a quart of it from a gas station or convenience store.
 You don't pour oil down the same pip where the dipstick is located; instead, unscrew the cap located a few inches away.
 If your oil was very low, pour in the entire quart. You can use a funnel if you wish, or just pour it directly from the bottle into the tank.
 Go ahead and pull out the dipstick, wipe it with a rag, reinsert it, and check the oil level to make sure the car now has enough oil. It should now come up to the FULL line.
 Screw the cap back on tightly, lower the hood and make sure it is firmly closed before starting your engine.

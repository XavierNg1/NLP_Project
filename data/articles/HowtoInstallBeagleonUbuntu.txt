,,, This is the password that was entered when Ubuntu was first installed. Type this in.
 A window will open similar to figure 1 (right). You need to add the text "user_xattr" to the fourth column of whichever partition your /home folder is on. If /home does not explicitly appear in the second column, then you need to add this property only to the row where the second column is a solitary /. This allows Beagle to index files more thoroughly.
After having saved /etc/fstab, you need to remount the directories you've changed the settings in the /etc/fstab file. You can do this with the commands "mount -o remount /home", and "mount -o remount /". (where / and /home are the directories where you've changed the configuration). Another way to remount is to just reboot your system.
, This will open a window which allows you to configure which folders you want to allow Beagle to search through. After you've confirmed this, click OK to close the window, open a terminal window and type beagle-info --status and ensure that the text output contains no errors.
 To do so, you can open the program BEST (Bleeding Edge Search Tool) and type in the search term. You can open Best either through your menu system (Applications -> Accessories -> Beagle Search) or the Run dialog (simply type best).
 In order to do this, open the Sessions window (System -> Preferences -> Sessions), go into the Startup programs tab, click the add button and type beagled in the Startup Command box.

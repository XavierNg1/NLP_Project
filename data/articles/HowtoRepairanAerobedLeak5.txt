 Is there a hole or a crack? A hole will be easier to fix than a crack. If there’s a crack you might need to order a new valve from the air mattress manufacturer.This is a long-shot method and may not always work. Often, a severely damaged valve means that you’ll need to buy a new mattress.
, If the valve is leaking air because the valve plug isn’t properly sealing against the valve stem, you can line the stem with a thin piece of plastic to help it seal properly., If the valve is damaged beyond repair, order a new one from the manufacturer and replace it according to the instructions.

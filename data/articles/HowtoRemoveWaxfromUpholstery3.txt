 If you do not have an iron available, a hairdryer can have the same effect. Use the hairdryer to melt the wax and then carefully lay the brown paper bag on top of the wax. The paper bag will begin to absorb the warm wax. Repeat the process until all of the wax has been transferred.Use a blank paper bag or clean rag for this method as well.
 WD-40 breaks down the wax and makes it softer and easier to clean off of upholstery. Gently scrub the solution into the fabric and wipe away with a clean rag or sponge. Use warm water to clean the solution from the fabric once all of the wax is removed.Test the WD-40 on an inconspicuous portion of the fabric before using it on a more noticeable section.
 Combine the dish detergent with warm water in a small container. Dish detergent is designed to break down grease and, in some cases, can break down the wax. Gently scrub the wax with a clean sponge or rag and then let dry.

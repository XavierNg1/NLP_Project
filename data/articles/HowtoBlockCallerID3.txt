 Cellular phones come with the capability of blocking specific numbers from calling you, so if you want to prevent certain numbers from getting through to you on your mobile, you can add the numbers to the blocked list.

For iOS, go to Settings > Phone > Blocked > Add New, and add the contacts you want blocked. Or, you can go to your calls > Recent, and find the recent caller whose number you want to block. Select the i beside the number and select Block This Caller.
On an Android, go into your dial screen > Settings > Call > Caller Rejection > Auto Reject List, and from there you can add numbers to the list of blocked callers. Or, go to your dial screen > Recent, and find the recent caller whose number you want to block. Click the three dots and select Add to Reject List., Many countries have a national Do Not Call list or registry that's designed to help stop unsolicited telemarketers from calling you. The United States has the Do Not Call Registry, and Canada has the Do Not Call List, and you can go to their websites to add your name to the applicable list., Most telemarketing firms have their own internal do not call lists, but you have to request that your name be added individually. Next time you get a call from a telemarketer, take the opportunity to request that your name be added to their do not call list.Make sure you don't word your request in such a way that it could be misinterpreted. Don't ask that your name or number be taken off the list; instead, be sure to ask that your name be added to the do not call list., There are several apps out there that can be downloaded onto many mobile phones. These apps allow you to block specific numbers, unknown numbers, and other unwanted calls.

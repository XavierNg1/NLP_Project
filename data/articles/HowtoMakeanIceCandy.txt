 A plastic ice bag, spoon, juicer





;
, Here we are using MILO; which is an excellent short cut - all you have to do is create the MILO drink.
 Gently pour your flavour into the ice bag. But do not fill it to the top(about 3 quarters). You may need someone to help you with the ice bag or you can use the spoon to prevent leakage.
, Leave your product in the freezer for an hour or two , find something simply exciting to do. Your ice candy should be ready!








, Cut of the bottom part(not the one with the knot)and devour your delicious home made your ice candy! Enjoy!

 You can start a search directly from the Start menu.
 You can also type an extension to search for all files of that, such as "docx" for Word documents.
 If the result is a file, it will open in its default program. If it's a folder, the folder will open in a new window. If it's a program, the program will launch.
 For example, if you have lots of documents that share the search term, clicking the Documents header will display all of the results that match.
 This will open the folder that contains the file in a new window.

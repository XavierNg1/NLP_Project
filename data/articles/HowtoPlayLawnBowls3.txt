 Essentially, you aim to get the lawn bowl near the jack without bumping into anything. Roll the bowl to the right of the jack, allowing the bowl to curve in to the left. This curving is due to the fact that a lawn bowl is not a perfect sphere. Lawn bowls are shaved on one side, causing them to curve as they roll.


You can also have a backhand draw by turning the bowl over and curving it in the opposite direction. Aim to the left of the jack, directing the bowl to curve to the right.
 This is also referred to as an upshot or a "chap and lie" shot. In this delivery, you aim and forcefully deliver the bowl so that it disturbs jack. The bowl should knock into the jack and drag it 1 or 2 yards (1 or 2 meters) away from its initial location. This delivery is used to move the jack away from the opponent's bowls and toward your own.
 A running shot is similar to a yard on in that it requires force to change the position of another object. Usually, the goal is to move an opponent's bowl away from the jack. The shot is also used on occasion to push the jack toward the ditch without causing it to tip into it.
 A drive shot requires a roll that has so much speed and force that it hits an opponent's bowl or the jack with full force. As a result, the target is removed from play, meaning that an opponent's bowl is either pushed out of the rink or that a jack is pushed into the ditch. Using it to destroy an opponent's bowl does not destroy the end, but using it to push the jack out of the rink does destroy the end.

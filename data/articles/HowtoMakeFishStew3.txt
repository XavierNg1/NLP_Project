 Chop 4 ounces (115 g) of slab bacon, sliced bacon, or salt pork into pieces. Place the meat in a large saucepan or pot and turn the heat on to medium. Stir the bacon and stir it occasionally to keep it from sticking. Once the bacon is browned (but not crispy), use a slotted spoon to remove it from the pan.Place the cooked bacon onto a plate lined with a paper towel. This will absorb the excess grease.
It should take 8 to 10 minutes to cook the meat.
 Put 2 tablespoons of butter into the pot that has the meat drippings. Finely chop one large onion and four celery stalks (with the leaves) and add them to the pot. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the vegetables and cook them over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes.The vegetables should soften and the onion should turn clear.
 Peel 2 large Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 pound or 450 g) and cut them into 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) pieces. Add the potatoes to the sauce pot along with 1 cup (240 ml) of clam juice or fish broth, 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves, and one cup (240 ml) of water. Turn the heat to high so the stew boils. Turn the temperature down a little and simmer the stew for 10 to 15 minutes.The stew should bubble lightly so that the potatoes cook and become tender.
 Sprinkle 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) of firm fish with salt and pepper and cut it into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. Set the fish on the potatoes in the pot and cover the pot. Cook the stew on medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes so the fish cooks completely.You can use skinless cod, haddock or pollock for the creamy fish stew.
 Add 4 cups (950 ml) of half-and-half into the creamy fish stew. Bring the stew to a light bubble to heat the half-and-half thoroughly. Taste the stew and add more salt and pepper according to your taste. Serve the creamy fish stew with crackers.Don't worry if the fish breaks down into small bits as you stir the stew.

, Similarly, if your baby seems uninterested in suckling at times when it normally would be, you should contact your doctor. For instance, if your baby was ready to breastfeed immediately after it woke up for several weeks in a row, then suddenly it loses interest in breastfeeding as soon as it wakes, you should contact your doctor., Constipation could be a sign that your baby’s digestive tract is being affected by medication in your breast milk. In other words, if your baby is not defecating regularly, you should contact your doctor and determine if you need to adjust your feeding habits or medication dosages.Babies who have diarrhea might also be suffering from medication-related side-effects.During the baby’s first few days, it will poop a dark-colored goo called meconium. A few days later the stool will become yellow, tan, or yellow-green in color.After the first few days, the baby will have two to five bowel movements every 24 hours.
After six weeks, the frequency of a baby’s bowel movements becomes harder to predict. Your baby might poop once every day or two, or it might continue to poop up to five times daily.
 If your baby becomes fussy, irritable, or exhibits other behavioral abnormalities, contact your doctor.For instance, if your baby is normally relaxed and happy after breastfeeding, but – after you begin a new regimen of medication – starts crying loudly in an especially shrill and unpleasant way, its behavior may be affected by medication it absorbed through breast milk.
Your baby might also become exceptionally tired after absorbing medication through breast milk. For instance, if your baby normally likes to crawl about and babble happily after consuming breast milk, but after you begin taking medication it immediately falls asleep, this changed behavior could be due to increased levels of medication in your breast milk.

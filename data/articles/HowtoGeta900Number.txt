 A 900-number company can forward calls to you so you can answer the phone personally or you can choose to have a recorded message waiting for your customers.;
, You can choose whether to charge your customers per minute or a flat-rate fee when they call.
 Up-front fees are charged to you for setting up your service. These fees can be very expensive, depending upon the type of services you desire. Monthly maintenance fees will also need to be paid for you to use the 900 phone service.
 Many companies will not start paying you until 50 days after you have started your business. Be sure you know exactly when you will be paid and how.
 Preambles are the recorded messages that a caller first hears before they are either transferred to you live or to your recorded message. The preamble usually contains specific things, such as the cost of the call, a description of the service provided, and age requirements. A caller is allowed to hang up during the preamble without any charge. However, you as a business owner may be charged by your 900-number provider.
 Some 900-number companies must approve your preamble before you can get a 900 number.
 It should take you 5 to 7 days to get a 900 number, depending upon the services you have chosen. Once you have a 900 number, start advertising your business and start making money.

 White roses work especially well for this exercise: Like blank canvasses, they're easier to transfer colors onto than other colored roses.;
, Have enough water in the pot so that you can fully submerge your rose petals after it has come to a boil. How much water you put in will therefore depend on the type of pot you use.
 Many people prefer to use Rit dye, although other dyes or food colorings can easily be used. Depending on the amount of water in the pot, add anywhere from 8 to 15 drops. More drops will help achieve a deeper color.
 Make sure that you have dissolved the salt in the dye. Salt helps the color adhere to the flowers. 1 teaspoon should be sufficient for a medium-sized pot of water.
 The hotter the water is when you submerge the rose petals, the deeper the color will be. The cooler the water when you submerge the rose petals, the lighter the color will be.


You can actually get a pretty cool, "airy" effect with your dye by submerging the petals into cooler water for less time. Many people prefer this type of color to the uniform, deep color of hot water dyes.

 Since scarred skin does not contain the normal pigments the rest of your skin does, it burns easily. Furthermore, your sun-exposed scar is more likely to become and remain darker than the rest of your skin if you do not use sunscreen.Therefore, using sunblock when you go outside for a significant length of time is recommended for at least one year after receiving the scar.Use a sunscreen of at least SPF 35.
Rub the sunblock on your scar in a circular motion with the tips of your fingers.

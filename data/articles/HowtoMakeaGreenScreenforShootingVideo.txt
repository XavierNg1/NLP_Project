 Prop the curtain rod up across the frames and hang the screen from that. Again, let a strip hang along the floor and weigh it down.



To roll it up evenly and tightly, roll it around a hard/heavy cylindrical object with a diameter or about 2-4".
 You'll also need to light the screen differently on your subjects. Your best bet would be to set up a 500-300w light at each vertical side pointing inwards and then two spaced evenly apart along the bottom pointing up (these should be 100-250w).

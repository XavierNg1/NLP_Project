 A file, flimsy, folder or piece of card will all be suitable.;
, Check to see if it fits in the container(s) you intend to use.
 You now have a funnel model ready for wrapping the aluminum foil around.
 You want a slightly longer sheet in case you need to adjust the size.


Use only new foil for making the foil funnel. While you may want to repurpose the foil used to wrap last night’s meal, it will be weaker and may rip or tear.
 Lightly tape one end of the foil to the funnel model. Wrap the foil around the model to create the foil funnel.
 You may want to line the entire edge with tape to ensure it fully adheres.
 You will be left with a perfectly formed aluminum foil funnel.
 This funnel can be easily crushed or changed so it’s best to put it to use right away.


Place a paper towel underneath the receptacle to avoid dripping (in case the funnel fails or liquid drips). Also place a paper towel underneath the funnel after removing it from the bottle.
Push the funnel deeply into the bottle when transferring liquid to reduce the possibility of spillage.

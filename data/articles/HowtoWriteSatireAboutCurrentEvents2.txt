 You are using satire to make a point about the current event. Your entire essay is structured around this point. Your goal might be to raise awareness for an issue or improve upon a problem. If you are not clear about your motivation for writing, your writing will seem all over the place and will be difficult for your readers to understand.Help the audience to consider problems they might not have been aware of by poking fun at those problems or addressing the terrible solutions that are currently in place.
Inspire your readers to act. There should not be a specific call to action in your writing, but using your words and humor to encourage people to change the way they think or act is part of well-written satire.
Always support your opinions with facts. This will help your readers to see the point you are making.
 Satire should be fun and make the reader laugh.The combination of humor and critique is what makes satirical writing unique. Think about things that are relatable to your intended audience and that pull from knowledge about your current event. Ask yourself, what do the readers need to know to understand the joke that I am making?
The title of your article can be sarcastic and funny as well.
 Irony is a technique commonly used when writing satire. When using irony you would show some inconsistency between what is said and what is really meant, what is expected to happen and what actually happens, or what is meant and what people understand.An example of irony would be someone getting rich and never working a day in their life.
Another example of irony is telling a person that you love his or her shoes when in reality you think the shoes are terrible. You and your audience are aware that you do not like the shoes, but the person wearing the shoes actually thinks that you were giving a compliment.
 Taking something out of its normal context to show how ridiculous or absurd it is can be used to make your point as well. It should be obvious to the audience that you are exaggerating. Exaggeration is even more effective if you keep a serious tone throughout your writing and do not use any joking language.


For example, Jonathan Swift wrote a satirical writing about the famine in Ireland in the 1700's. His solution to the famine was for poor people to sell their babies to the rich people so the rich people could eat and the poor people would have money. Eating children is obviously a ridiculous solution to a famine and would not solve the root problem.
This exaggeration highlighted how badly the government treated poor people and the negative lens that rich people viewed the poor people in the country.

 Eating protein helps you feel full and satisfied. To help prevent overeating, include some type of protein with your soup. This is not limited to meat, but can also include beans or whole grains.Add kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, and other beans for protein. Beans make really good additions to soups.
Making a soup with reduced-fat dairy, like 2% milk and reduced-fat sour cream, can add protein without a lot of extra fat and calories.
Put low-fat steak or ground beef, lean chicken or turkey, pork, or shrimp for added flavor and protein.
 Soups can help you not to overeat by helping you fill up on fiber. Fiber keeps you full without adding excessive calories. Adding a variety of vegetables and beans to your soup can provide your needed fiber content.All vegetables contain fiber, but you may want to include greens, like kale or spinach, carrots, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, squash, or asparagus.
 Whole grains can help you feel more full and satisfied. They also increase fiber content and help with digestion. Include healthy sources of whole grains. Do not add white pasta or white rice, which are unhealthy carbs.You can try adding brown rice, quinoa, farro, or bulgur. You can also try whole wheat pasta or a garnish of whole wheat tortillas.

 Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of water into a blender or food processor. Measure out 3 1/2 cups (16 ounces or 453 g) of powdered sugar and add it to the blender., Put the lid on the blender and blend the water and powdered sugar for about 30 seconds. The powdered sugar should completely dissolve in the water.You may need to pulse the mixture to break up any clumps of powdered sugar.
 Pour 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of red food coloring into the blender. Put the lid on it and pulse the blender until the dye is blended into the mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder and blitz the fake blood again.

The cocoa will help the fake blood thicken a little and will make it turn a more realistic shade of red.
 Remove the lid from the blender and dip a spoon into the fake blood. Drip the fake blood onto a paper towel, so you can get a better idea of what the color looks like. Add more red food coloring or cocoa powder to get the color you want.

You can transfer the fake blood to a squeeze bottle and squirt it when you're ready to use it. Just store it in the refrigerator until you need it.

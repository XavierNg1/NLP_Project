 When body lice feed they can cause an allergic reaction in the skin. These reactions include:intense itching
rashes on the skin, particularly the armpit and waistline areas of the body
red spots or elevated bumps on the skin

 Body lice live mainly in the seams of clothing.Only after hatching and maturing, do body lice invade the skin.Although it is rare, body lice can lay eggs directly on the human body., Mature lice cannot live longer than five-to-seven days after falling off a host. Because of this, it is more common to find lice eggs, or "nits," in any article of clothing .


Nits are oval in shape, and can be yellow or white.
Nits are generally found in the waistline and armpit areas of clothing.Nits will hatch in one-to-two weeks.

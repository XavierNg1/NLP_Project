The "th" sound as in "the" is usually not pronounced as the "th" sound normally is in the English language, usually as a "d" (e.g. de=the mudder=mother)
The sentence "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" would be pronounced something like "de kwik brr-ah-n fox jumped ova de layzee dog."
"They" is quite often pronounced as "thee" or "dee"
"The" can sometimes be pronounced at "thee" or "dee"

,


People don't say "um" they say "erm", which is very hard if you don't come from Liverpool. It is somewhat like "aiirrrmmm".
Teenagers say "eeee" a lot when offended, this is either pronounced as a plain and simple eeee sound but sometimes it is said somewhat like "urrrr" or "eeeeeeeeeeehh" (this pronunciation is very hard to write down phonetically, but the pitch of the word starts quite low then drops very low and then goes very high)
The words "like" and "pure" (pronounced p-yar), "proper" (pronounced propehh) and "though" are randomly inserted into sentences, e.g. "Eee she was propa snarlinnn me tho a was pyarrr fumin." or "yerr e's fitt im tho."
The verb "to snarl" is when somebody gives a look of disgust and dislike, or looks you up and down etc.
"Do you know what I mean (though)" (pronounced "dya no warra mean. (tho)") is often added to the end of a sentence, it is usually not meant literally, just a habit. The though at the end is optional.
"Fit" and "fine" are the words generally used to say that you find someone attractive. The word fit can also be used to express a like for something. E.g. "That lad is pure fine" or "This lippy is pure fit"

 Trash bags don't come in all colors, but generally an accent color can be found, like yellow, black, or white. This method works great for squads that need impromptu sets as the material matches that of many professional poms.


Place them on a flat surface. You'll be using scissors, so you may want to avoid shaggy carpet or a nice hardwood floor.
 Any edge that doesn't match the rest of the trash bag needs to be gotten rid of.


Once all the rough edges or areas are cut off, fold the bags in half, width-wise. That is, fold them so they're half as long.
Cut off the folded edge. This gives you a pile of 40 pieces of trash bag. Keep the bags lined up.
 Leave about 3" (7.5 cm) in the middle, uncut. That's where your handle will go. Do this on both sides -- this is a double-sided pom pom.


If you want thinner strips, cut more slits. If you want thicker strips, cut fewer. Again, make sure to keep your pile aligned.
 Electrical or duct works best -- any sturdy tape will do. Wrap it around a few times to get it secure.


Electrical tape may be a bit narrow and duct may be a bit wide, depending on your measurements. If either is the case, adjust the tape (by cutting it or adding more) so that it covers the entire uncut center.
 The more you fluff and crinkle, the more voluminous your pom pom will be. Grab small sections and scrunch them up; don't crinkle the whole end in one handful.


If you'd like a bigger pom pom, start over but with more trash bags. But don't write off the possibility that you didn't fluff enough -- your pom pom should double in size.

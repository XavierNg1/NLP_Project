 The formula for the surface area of any prism is SA=2B+Ph{\displaystyle SA=2B+Ph}, where SA{\displaystyle SA} equals the surface area, B{\displaystyle B} equals the area of the base, P{\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter of the base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the prism.In order for this method to work you must know the surface area of the prism, as well as the length and width of the base.
 If you do not know the surface area, this method will not work.

For example, if you know the surface area is 1460 square centimeters, your formula will look like this:1460=2B+Ph{\displaystyle 1460=2B+Ph}


, To find the area, you need to know the length and width of the base (or of one side, if the base is a square). Use the formula A=lw{\displaystyle A=lw}. To find the area of a rectangle.

For example, if the base is a rectangle with a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 2 centimeters, to find the area you would calculate:A=(8)(2){\displaystyle A=(8)(2)}A=16{\displaystyle A=16}


, Make sure you are substituting for the letter B{\displaystyle B}.

For example, if you found the area of the base to be 16, your formula will look like this:1460=2(16)+Ph{\displaystyle 1460=2(16)+Ph}1460=32+Ph{\displaystyle 1460=32+Ph}


, To find the perimeter of a rectangle, add up the length of all four sides, or, for a square, multiply the length of one side by 4.

Remember that opposite sides of a rectangle have the same length. For example, if the base is a rectangle with a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 2 centimeters, to find the perimeter you would calculate:P=8+2+8+2{\displaystyle P=8+2+8+2}P=20{\displaystyle P=20}


, Make sure you are substituting for the letter P{\displaystyle P}.

For example, if you found the perimeter of the base to be 20, your formula will look like this:1460=32+20h{\displaystyle 1460=32+20h}


, This will give you the height of your prism.

For example, if your equation is 1460=32+20h{\displaystyle 1460=32+20h}, you would first need to subtract 32 from each side, then divide each side by 20. Thus:1460=32+20h{\displaystyle 1460=32+20h}1428=20h{\displaystyle 1428=20h}142820=20h20{\displaystyle {\frac {1428}{20}}={\frac {20h}{20}}}71.4=h{\displaystyle 71.4=h}

So, the height of your prism is 71.4 centimeters.

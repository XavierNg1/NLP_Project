 As illustrated above, a simple homemade mayo is easy if you have an immersion blender. Simply blend a room-temperature egg with 1 cup of oil (usually avocado) in a tall, thin jar. That said, you can also buy dairy-free mayo in most stores since most mayo is usually dairy-free!

, This is going to be similar to a traditional ranch dressing, but you should still feel free to adjust and play with the ratios however you see fit.


1 Tsp Dill and/or Thyme
1/4 tsp each mustard powder and ground garlic
2 tsp dried parsley
Salt and pepper, to taste (1/4-1/2 teaspoon each), This will account for the light, tangy sourness of the buttermilk. Start with just 2 teaspoons, then add more to taste as you keep mixing.
 You can't use milk or buttermilk, and water will dilute the taste too much. Coconut milk has a light sweetness to it that will mix will with the sour lemon and any spices you added, creating a delicious and well-balanced dressing.For a thicker dressing, use coconut cream instead of coconut milk.
 Again, you don't have to chill it before eating, but it will be much better if you do. Remember, as well, that there is a raw egg in this dressing. While it will not be dangerous to eat, the dressing will go bad within a week and should be kept refrigerated whenever you're not eating it.

 Heat about 1-inch (2.5 cm) of water in a small saucepan and add 2 cups (650 g) of chopped cauliflower florets. Put the lid on the pan and steam the cauliflower for 4 to 5 minutes. Drain the cauliflower and set the florets on a paper towel to dry. Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (204 C).The cauliflower should be soft, but not falling apart or mushy.
 Finely chop the cooked florets and put them in a mixing bowl. Add 1 whole egg and 1 egg white to the bowl along with 1/2 cup (75 g) of minced onion, 3 tablespoons of minced fresh parsley, 1/2 cup (50 g) of sharp cheddar cheese, and 1/2 cup (45 g) of seasoned breadcrumbs. Stir the mixture well to incorporate the cauliflower.Add salt and pepper to taste or use your favorite all-purpose seasonings.
 Spray cooking spray on a baking sheet and set it next to your work space. Measure out 1 tablespoon of cauliflower tot mixture. Use the palms of your hands to roll each tot into a small oval. Set them on the baking sheet.You can use a spoon or small cookie sheet to quickly measure out each tot.
 Put the baking sheet in the oven and bake the cauliflower tots for 16 to 18 minutes. If you want both sides to get crispy, consider turning them halfway through the cooking time.The breadcrumbs and onion should help the tots crispy up, but you'll still want to serve them immediately after baking.

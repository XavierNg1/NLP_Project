 In the morning, eat foods which release energy slowly and throughout the day, such as carbohydrates. Stretch yourself and mentally run through all your strategies.
 If you are able to get the schedule of when your opponents fight, you can watch them and prepare for your match. Similarly, you should change styles in different rounds so that your strategy cannot be preempted.
, You will be sitting with your opponent in the holding area, waiting for your turn to go to the ring. If you are nervous at this stage, it's perfectly fine to get up and pace around. This also lets your muscles relax. At the same time, with a rational mind, size up your opponent. For example, by guessing his height, you can prepare to do head kicks.
 Your mind will be focused on attacking your opponent and taking him out, and it is important for your coach to remind you of your strategies. The process is as follows:


The referee points to the ground with their right and left hands, saying 'Chung, Hung'. This means 'blue, red', and indicates where you should stand.
The referee will then say 'chareot' to get you to attention, and 'kyueng-rye' to get you to bow to the judges and each other.
The referee then says 'gyeorugi choonbi', upon which you enter your fighting stance.
He then says 'shijak', and the fight begins!
You should stop immediately if the referee says 'kuman' or 'kalyo'.
 Try to get the first point, as this psychologically intimidates the opponent and gives you an edge up. Attack quickly when the signal is given to start. 1 point is given for kicks to the hogu (body protector), 2 points for kicks to the head (should these be allowed), and 1/2 or 1 point may be deducted for fouls.

,,,, After about 30 seconds from the moment you feel the burn in your legs, just focus on breathing and you will soon forget about the burn in your legs, and eventually your body will become used to it.
 Although its optional; having music can really give your mind something to focus on for anyone who feels the burn in their legs.
 Optional but highly recommended. At first you may not be able to do a trot for long, but soon you will be able to do it without stopping. And until you can do it without stopping, get a pedometer to measure how much trotting you did and for how long, compared to jogging.
 If the pain has not gone away and you are finding yourself unable to walk or nearing that point, seek medical attention immediately.
 Like most things in life that require hard work, you will find yourself wanting to stop and go inside after a small workout. Don't!!! Or else you will find that every time you feel that burn that you don't like, you give up.

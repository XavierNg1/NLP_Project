 There are several types of spinner blades available, each with its own properties, as listed below:


Willow leaf. Willow leaf blades have a pointed teardrop shape that lets them reflect light more than the other types without snagging or fouling.
Indiana. Similar to the willow leaf blade but with rounded ends. Some Indiana blades feature ribbing in the center to add flash and turbulence.
Colorado. These wide, teardrop-shaped blades are designed to produce more turbulence than willow leaf or Indiana blades. They often feature a golf-ball-like surface that maximizes turbulence and provides extra flash.
Propeller. Propeller blades for French and safety-pin spinners are shaped like rounded triangles with the ends bent. They provide more turbulence than the other blade types and are designed so that the spinner shaft runs through them, so that they don't require a U-shaped clevis to put them on the spinner.;
, Just as you have a choice of blades for making your spinner, you also have a choice of what material to make its skirt with. Some of the types available are listed below:


Bucktail. So named because it comes from a deer's tail. Commonly used for spinners fished in colder waters.
Squirrel tail hair. This material was commonly used by Mepps for the skirts of its double-armed safety-pin spinners.
Marabou. Named for the marabou stork, this material is more commonly made from turkey feathers. It's used for jigs as well as French spinners.
Flashabou. A synthetic marabou that includes strips of reflective material.

 Knowing how to talk about the guitar will make it much easier to learn your chords. Luckily, numbering on the guitar is easy:










The strings count from the bottom up, not from the top down. The string closest to the floor while holding the guitar, and the thinnest string, is the 1st string.
The first fret is the furthest to your left (if you're a right-handed guitarist). The frets are the metal strips in the guitar, and the furthest from your body is the "first fret." The next one closest to you is the second, the next the third, and so on.

Make sure you guitar is tuned. You can purchase an electric tuner or use an audio guide found on Youtube or Google.;
, Remember that the 5th string is the second from the top, not the bottom. Your ring finger goes between the 3rd and 2nd fret. This note is a C.









The closer you push your finger to the 3rd fret, the better your chord will sound.
 Again, get as close to the fret as you can. Try to use your fingertips to fret as precisely as possible. This is the E note in this chord.
 This is the high C note for this chord. Now you've reached the chord's final shape, and it looks like a diagonal line pointing away from your head towards the ground.









The open note between the 2nd and 4th strings is a G.
 All you need are these three fingers. While it won't be terrible if you accidentally play the top string, the chord will sound much better if you ignore it.
 Take your ring finger off the 4th string and drop it to the 6th string, 3rd fret. Then use your pinky to once again fret the 4th string, 3rd fret. This adds another G into the chord for a thicker, richer sound.
 For the best sounding chords, use the tips of your fingers, placing them as close to the frets as you possibly can. Pick each string individually to see if any of the notes aren't sounding out well, and could use an adjustment.

 The body of your rocket will be made from a plastic water bottle, a paper cone, and two paper or cardboard triangles. You will use three pencils to make a stand. You will also need a cork, water, and a bicycle pump to pressurize the bottle.
 Reduce the drag of the water bottle by taping a paper cone to the top of the rocket (the bottom of the bottle). Tape paper or cardboard triangles on either side of the bottle to act as fins. The triangles should come about halfway up the bottle., Tape pencils around the sides of the bottle to make a stand. Make sure that the pencils are pointing down. This stand will allow you to point your rocket up (or at an angle if you wish). Without a stand, your rocket will likely just flail around near the ground instead of lifting off., You should fill the bottle half full of water. The water will provide the mass needed to propel the rocket during the launch. You can add food coloring for a colorful blast off., Throw away the bottleâ€™s original cap and replace it with a cork that fits into the opening of the bottle. The cork will allow pressure to build inside the bottle. The cork will also pop out allowing the contents to shoot out rapidly and propel the bottle., Use a bicycle pump with a needle. Insert the needle into the bottle through the cork and pump. Once enough air has been pumped into the bottle, the pressure will force the cork out and launch the rocket into the air.

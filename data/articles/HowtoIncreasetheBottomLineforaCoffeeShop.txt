 Profits on espresso drinks can sometimes be 5 times higher than drip-coffee drinks. Offer your customers a free cappuccino or latte to get them to switch. Aim for a total of about 30 percent in coffee sales and 70 percent in espresso sales.;
, Since most people never read through the entire menu, placing your most expensive drinks up top may be a simple way to improve your profits.
 This will boost the customer's overall price and your profit. Feature a flavor that coordinates with the season or holiday, such as peppermint flavor at Christmas or pumpkin spice at Thanksgiving.
 Offer a new flavor every week or suggest flavor shots. Tea is cheap to make, and therefore your potential profit margin is huge.
 Be creative and make it fun. A drink named Chunky Monkey will most likely raise some curiosity, which may translate into an increase in sales.
 You could even get your customers involved with a contest to come up with the best-tasting new drink. Then, consider naming the drink after the customer who thought it up and including it on your menu for a limited time.
 Packaging items together make them easier to sell.
 Very often, coffee shops hand out punch cards that entitle customers to a free drink after paying for 7 or 10.
, You can host poetry readings or open mic nights to lure new customers in.
 Classes like these entertain your customers, and teach them to enjoy expensive products. Charge a small fee for the class or sell your take-home coffee blends and roasting supplies at the event. Make it an experience that customers will remember so they will visit your shop again.
 A dime increase here and there is not likely to make a huge difference to your customer. However, remember to keep your prices competitive.

 Go ahead and find a necklace to trace to get your design out. This necklace below is pretty glammed up, but it works nonetheless.;
, It doesn't have to be too clean cut and the edges don't have to be that smooth; You'll barely even notice after you're done.
 Lay your agate on it wherever you want it; This is the most important step as it lays the pathways for what's next to come in your design.
 Don't put too much or it'll squish everywhere, though!

, Grab some beads while you wait. If you want to be extra safe about the glue, though, wait overnight.
 Make the design as eccentric as you'd like, it's one of the most fun parts of this project!

, It's way easy and quick to do, too.
 You can take some thin ribbon and stitch it into a rectangle tube. Turn it inside out after and then no seams will show. Glue the ribbon to either side.

,, The power wires are connected to the main board just under the right-handed / left-handed switch.



Note: on the photo, the wire has been cut close to the board. If you plan on reversing the process by reconnecting the wires later, you may want to cut it a bit further away from the board.
Note: you can also put a SPST switch on this wire to allow re-enabling the light easily.

 While it might seem difficult and dangerous, you likely know your own shower well enough that you would be able to find the soap with the lights off. Try turning them off right before getting undressed.


The first few times you try this, you could have a (preferably waterproof) flashlight nearby. If you need it, you can use it for a few seconds to find things.
Put the things that you need in a different corner of the shower before you turn the lights off for ease of finding it.;
, If you feel discomfort at the sight of your body, covering the mirror can be a big help. Use a towel, sheet, shirt or (if possible) turn the mirror around. If the top of your mirror is clean, you could potentially use any of the bath towels in the room.
 Washcloths provide a barrier between your hand and your body, preventing you from feeling what you are touching as much.
 Leave underwear on, or a bra. Getting partly clean is much better than getting not clean at all.
 They are thin and you can wash yourself through them. They can even act a bit like a washcloth, helping the soap to lather, although it may be harder to rinse out.
 Get some nice bath products, like bubble bath, bath bombs, or nice smelling soap and shampoo, and make bathing a time to make yourself happy. Find products that you like, and use those. If you can look forward to bath time for a different reason, the dysphoria will be easier to deal with.
 Go for a long run, or work out hard enough that by the time you're done, you're mentally and physically exhausted. A quick shower may be easier to bear when you're thinking more about sore muscles and how smelly you are than anything else.

 The equation for fluid pressure is independent of the mass or volume of the liquid. Instead, fluid pressure is the product of the density of the liquid, the height of the liquid above the object, and gravity. Since gravity and liquid densities are fixed (for the most part), the height of the liquid is the largest variable in the equation.The equation reads as Pfluid = ρgh, where ρ is the density of the liquid, g is the force of gravity, and h is the height of the liquid.;
, To solve the equation, you take the product of the three variables. You can use a calculator, or do the calculations on your own. There are also online calculators that will do this calculation for you.For example, if you had a fluid that with a density of (1.08 x 103 kg/m3) and was 5.00 m high, you would multiply (1.08 x 103 kg/m3) x 9.81 m/s2 x 5.00 m. In this case, you would get the answer of 5.30 x 104.
 Make sure that your results add up logically. You should not get a reading for negative fluid pressure. You also should compare different measurements to see if they follow the expected trends. For example, more dense liquids will exert more pressure at the same height. The same liquid will exert more pressure when the height is higher.Since water is more dense than oil, you can expect water to exert more fluid pressure than oil at the same height.

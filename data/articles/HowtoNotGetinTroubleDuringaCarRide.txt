 Yeah, this is obvious, but so true! Things to bring might include:


Portable audio device. (iPod, d.s, magazines, books, Zune, Zen, Yepp, etc.)






books or magazines






portable DVD player with DVDs






homework (boring, but you have to do it sometime, better to do it in the car then miss something fun for homework, right?)






Portable game system

, Here is an example: Let's say your little sister keeps poking you in the back, whispering that she wants your iPod. Instead of protesting, just give it to her. You'll avoid a messy fight and stay out of trouble. Whatever happens, just go with the flow.
 If you have a sibling or cousin who is known to say things that annoy you, don't respond. If you get in a fight, guess what will happen? Yeah, you'll get in trouble as said in the above step. If you find yourself in a situation where a person is saying stuff like that to you, put in your iPod headphones or something and act like you couldn't care less.
 Your parents will for sure yell at you if you spill chips all over the car floor. Keep it tidy and you will avoid all problems.
 The best thing you can do is keep quiet. There is no way to get in trouble if you just mind you own business the whole time.

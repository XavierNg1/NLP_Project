 Employees want to work for a company that is interesting and exciting in some way. Even if the job description seems like a perfect fit, potential applicants might pass the job over if the company doesn't seem to have a strong mission or goal. To describe your company effectively, ponder the following questions:


What does your company do? What makes it special and sets it apart from competitors?
What is the goal of the company? Is it working toward social justice, striving to be at the top of its field, or aiming to provide an excellent service of some kind?
Why do you enjoy working at your company? Try to think through your reasons for being a part of it as you write up your description.
 Your company's personality should be apparent in the language you use to write the description, whether it's formal or casual.


If the company and the job opening are both on the serious, prestigious side, convey that by writing in well-wrought, complete sentences and using formal language.
If you want to show that your company has a fun culture and personality, feel free to use slang, exclamation points, and company jokes to appeal to job applicants' lighter side.
 Your job description should list the location of the company and whether telecommuting is an option for the job applicant. You may also want to include the size of the office, and how many people are part of the company.

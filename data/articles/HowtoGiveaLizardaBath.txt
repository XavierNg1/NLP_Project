 Reasons for giving your reptile a bath:

They may be in skin shedding season- a bath will help them get rid of their skin.
They may be constipated or unwell and a bath will ease their stomach.
They may be dirty or smelly.
They may enjoy a bath.;
, Use a sink or tub for smaller lizards like small bearded dragons and geckos, and your actual bath for bigger lizards like monitor lizards and iguanas., Do not use any soap because he/she may be tempted to drink from the water!

If the lizard tries to escape the sink or make alarmed hissing noises, the water is too hot.
 Pour it gently over the lizards body, being careful to avoid his/her eyes., As the water will go cold, remember to keep adding more lukewarm water. However, don't run the water directly on top of him/her as this will annoy them., Give them a designated hand towel because lizards carry a lot of germs. Do not leave them wet because they will get cold and if you leave them for hours they could die!, Then put them back in their tank.Â

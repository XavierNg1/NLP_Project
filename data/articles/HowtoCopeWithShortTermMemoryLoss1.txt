 When you get a new type of information, no matter what it is, there needs to be a way for you to associate it with what you know. Linking it with your long term memory is a good way to do it. Locker combinations can be easily memorized. For instance, 3-15-23 could be the number of siblings, graduation year, and Michael Jordan’s jersey number.
Directions work well with linking. North 2 blocks, west 1 blocks could easily be your high school (e.g. Northwest High) and Blackjack.;
, Try breaking down information to the smallest digestible piece. When that doesn’t work, break it down even further. If some step begins with grasping a handle and squeezing, perhaps starting the memorization process with simply putting a hand on the item would work.Shorten sentences. For instance, the first line in the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet is, “But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?” That could be shortened to, “Soft light yonder window breaks.”
Break up larger pieces into smaller pieces. The same line from Romeo and Juliet could be broken down into four 2-word portions: “But soft”, “what light”, “through yonder”, and “window breaks”.
 Stimulate your brain with crosswords or Sudoku. Try memorizing items for no real reason other than to challenge yourself. The key is to do enough new things so you are engaging your brain and keeping it in shape. This will help you absorb new information when it’s provided.

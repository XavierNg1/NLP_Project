There are 3 classes: Class I, II, and III. They are classified based on risk, with Class I being the lowest and Class III being the greatest.
You will find out what pre-marketing submission is required by FDA based on classification of your device. General Controls are assigned as Class I either with or without exemptions. General Controls and Special Controls are assigned as Class II either with or without exemptions. General Controls and Pre-market Approval are assigned as Class III.
Every device has a regulation number. You will need this number to determine the classification of your device. Go to database at website http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpcd/classification.cfm.
Look for a part of the name of your medical device or if you know the medical specialty, enter it where it says Device Panel.;

Go to CFR search page at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm.
Read the information on regulation such as general provision, packaging and labeling and other pertinent information on CFR.



If your device falls under Class I or II without exemptions, you will be required a Pre-market Notification or 510K for marketing.
If your device falls under Class III, you will be required a Pre-market Approval or PMA unless it is a pre-amendments device (which means on the market before the medical device amendments passage in 1976 or an equivalent device). In that case, you will then be required a 510K.

 Some of these excuses could include:


A medical appointment you've been waiting for for months happens to be set at the same time.
Your child's play/rehearsal/game match/dental visit/etc. is at the exact same time.
Explain that you're already double booked and you'd accepted the other invitation prior to this one.
Book a ticket to a concert or event at the time of the party and use that as the excuse. The rarer the event or the more expensive the ticket, the better excuse you have to bow out.;
, Urgent reasons can be tricky because the more involved they are and the more they rely on loss or sadness, the more you'll get grilled after but if you are stuck for a last-minute excuse, you could plead a family loss, a sudden household mishap or needing to be down at the police station to help a relative... Use urgent excuses with caution.
 After delivering your excuse news, act disappointed that you cannot attend. Don't overdo it though, as this may be cause for others to question why you can't be bothered making the effort to shift the arrangements around.

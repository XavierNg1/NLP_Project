Update your website regularly with new pieces. Consider adding a blog page with posts about project updates, your design process and tips for shoppers. Have a professional photographer photograph your work and post these images on your website.

In this case, the gallery keeps a portion of the sale.Tom Dolese of Terra Firma Design credits his relationship with the Northwest Woodworkers Gallery in Seattle for expanding his business from his small town in northern Washington to include many customers in Seattle.

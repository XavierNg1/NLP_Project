 In Daniel, Book 10, the Prophet went on a second, 3-week fast. To quote the Bible, Daniel "ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine." The second fast is basically the same as the first fast, but the text specifically names three things to avoid:


Wine

All leavened bread.

While reintroducing many of the items you've not had during the fast is inevitable, you may want to do so with greater consciousness for quality and portion size. And some things, like fried food and sugar are best kept to a new minimum.

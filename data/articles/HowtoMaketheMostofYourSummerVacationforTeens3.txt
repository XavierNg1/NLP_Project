 Spend some time there reading books that you like and are interested in. Novels, magazines, encyclopedias, non-fiction books, etc. and lot more are all there for you to read for free. Pick what you like and read on. Lots of libraries also have summer reading clubs, so consider joining one of those if you enjoy reading.
 Cooking is a fun and delicious activity to try. Take some classes, ask your family members for help, or find a book or search in the internet for easy cooking recipes.
 Music will calm you down and make you feel happy. Make a summer playlist of all of your favorites to listen to while you exercise, go to the beach, or just relax at home. You'll find you end up associating certain songs with your long vacation times, so pick some good ones for good memories.
 Watching movies with friends is a good way to spend time with them.

 Make sure to wash your can with soap and water before you paint it. This will help to remove the label and any residual food or oils. Let the can dry completely once you have washed it.


You can also wash your can with diluted vinegar to remove any persistent oil residues.
 Purchase a piece of steel wool and rub it against the can. This will help to roughen up the metal, which in turn will help the paint to stick to the otherwise slippery metal surface.
 After the primer has dried you can paint the can with acrylic paint. Try to mix some all purpose sealer into the base coat. Apply several layers of paint.


After the last paint layer has dried, apply a coat of clear acrylic sealer to make the paint last.

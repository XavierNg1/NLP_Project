 The recovery position for an infant, a baby under one year old, is different. You should begin by carefully laying the infant over your arm, face down, and at a slight angle. The infant’s head should be slightly lower than the body.Try to keep the elevation of the body above the head no more than five degrees. This keeps the baby from aspirating any fluids/blockages and encourages drainage.
 When you lay the infant on your arm, you should be sure to support the neck and head with your other hand. So, if you are laying the infant over your left arm, place your right hand under her head and neck to support it., When you supporting the infant’s head, it’s essential that you do not block the mouth and nose unwittingly. Note where your fingers are, and double-check that the infant can breathe., Once you have placed the infant into the recovery position, monitor her breathing and wait for medical help to arrive. If the infant stops breathing at any point you may have to perform CPR.

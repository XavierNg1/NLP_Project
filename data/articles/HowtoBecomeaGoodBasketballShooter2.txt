 Start next to the net, then later work some distance shots in.
, Balance is key to proper shooting. Balance yourself well before you shoot the ball.
, Use the power in your legs to propel you upward and focus your attention on getting the ball through the net. Turn towards your opposite hand 20 to 90 degrees in order to keep your shooting shoulder, hip, and elbow in line with the basket. This also helps get more power on your shot.


When you shoot, try to push far away as you can so you can shoot long range baskets.

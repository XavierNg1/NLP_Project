 You might have heard someone recommend soaking your leather boot to wear it in faster. Even if this works, you risk damaging the material and it may shrink back as it dries.


When stretching your boots with ice, be careful to only use freezer safe bags and make sure the seal will hold tightly.
 They can weaken the material. If the boots do get wet, let them dry naturally rather than putting them in front of a fire to minimize shrinking.


Use moderation when stretching your boots with a hairdryer for exactly this reason.
 If walking in the boot causes you pain, you'll need a stronger and safer method than simply "walking it in." Try stretching it with ice, or use a shoe stretcher for even greater adjustments.

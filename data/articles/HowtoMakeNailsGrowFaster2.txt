 Having good circulation helps your nails grow faster, and the best way to improve your circulation is to move your body more. Get plenty of exercise and use your hands a lot - everything from knitting to cheering at a basketball game can make your blood flow and your nails grow.









Gardening, typing, playing tennis, walking the dog, and any other number of activities can improve the circulation in your hands.

Weight lifting is beneficial for full-body circulation. Consider incorporating weight training into your exercise routine 3 times a week.
 People who live in areas with mild winters and hot summer have faster-growing nails. You may not be ready to give up your life in the northern hemisphere for the sake of nail growth, but you could try taking more vacations south.









Protect your hands when it's cold outside to keep your nails from getting brittle and give them the chance to grow long.
Get plenty of sun, even in the winter, since the sun helps your body create the vitamin D your nails need to grow faster.

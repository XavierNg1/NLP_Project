 You will need to have everything accessible so you can make the soup quickly. You will need the following: 1/4 cup of onion, chopped.
Butter
3 cups of chopped mushrooms
6 tablespoons of flour
2 cans chicken broth
Salt and pepper

, It will need to be large enough to accommodate 3 cups of mushrooms plus broth. Don't heat the butter on very high heat or it will brown quickly.
Try a medium/high heat, making sure the butter coats the bottom of the pan as it melts.
When the butter ceases to foam, it is hot enough to add ingredients.
 You will now brown the onion in the butter. Stir the onions frequently so they cook evenly.
Saut√© them until they become translucent and slightly browned.
Turn down the heat to medium.
 They will cook over the next several minutes. Cook the mushrooms until they are golden and tender.
Avoid overcooking the mushrooms or they will end up having a rubbery texture.
If you want, you can add a little bit of garlic at this stage.
When mushrooms are done cooking, you will then proceed to making the rest of the soup.
 Add this mixture to the mushrooms.Bring the ingredients to a boil, stirring occasionally so that the mushrooms don't stick to the pan.
Cook for two minutes. By this time the mixture will thicken.
If your soup isn't thickened by the end of the two minutes, try cooking it a few minutes longer.
 This is the final stage of cooking. Reduce the heat to low.
Simmer the soup for 15 minutes.
Add more salt and pepper if necessary.
Serve warm.

 This will allow you to customize your streets, buildings, areas, water and land, simply by dragging the slider bar. Play around with the slider bars to change colors of land, water, buildings, streets, etc., and to find the best look for your map.


Click on the button at the very top to hide a certain slider bar.
 Do this by clicking on the third button, "Markers". Then write a title for your new marker. You can also add "tooltip" contents for your marker, which might be details about the place or perhaps an event date and time.


Choose your marker's size by clicking on one of the three options, and add any color if you want. There are also symbols provided; to add one, simply click on it and it will be automatically inserted inside the marker.
When you're done customizing your marker, click on "Add." Then click where you want the marker to be placed on the map and your marker will be automatically added to the map you're designing.
Hover your mouse over the marker. The marker's title and any other tooltip contents will be on view above the marker.

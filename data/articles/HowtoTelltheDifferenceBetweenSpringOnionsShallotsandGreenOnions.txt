 These are onions with such a variety of names that it's easy to be confused. They have long, slender white bases with green tops. Every bit of this onion can be used, both green and white sections, and the green tastes milder than the white.


Green onions are also known as "scallions" or "eschallots". They are sometimes mistakenly called shallots or spring onions.;
, These are also known as "salad onions" and they're the more mature green onions. The bulb is white and sweet to the taste. While the tops of these onions can be used, they have an intense flavour.
 These are also known as "eschallots", "French shallots", or "golden shallots", when just shallots will do really. They are always in a tight cluster and look a little like small brown onions, only far more elongated.

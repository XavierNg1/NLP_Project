Every image will differ. Normally Photoshop will figure out the right amount of shadow and highlighting to apply from the beginning on its own, but you can change it. Like in Shadows, Amount can be set between 20-50, Tone between 40-60 and Radius between 20-40.
 The popup box will close.
 Now you can save it, or change the Opacity,etc.

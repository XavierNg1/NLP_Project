 Yes, there is always something that you've started but never finished because of your duties and social life. But at this particular time when you don't have friends try to finish a painting, a novel or something else that you have been working on. At least you will have something interesting to present to your future friends.;
, Explore the world and everything around you. Enjoy the sun (it's free!), or you can go on a trip that you always dreamed about but never had time before. Read a book, watch your favorite comedy, etc.
 There was a time when you didn't need them, but now you do. Try to reconnect with them and learn something new about them.
 Love can do magic and by expressing your love you will feel better about yourself. Look confident. You never know when true love will come along, or a deeply connected friendship.
 Are you bored with the same room? Paint it in a different color or re-arrange the furniture. You will feel brightened by the change. By doing something active, you often forget that something is bothering you.
 Now you have time to find your soul mate.
 There is no better feeling than taking time to go back to your earlier memories. You had good times, huh? But get ready! Good times are yet to come again, just be patient.
 Music is the best cure. Just enjoy the melody and dive into the magical world of music and melody notes.
 There is no one who will take care of you if you don't do that by yourself. Start a new exercise program, start eating well, etc.
 This will help you to will feel much better. If you're radiating confidence and self-reliance, you will attract new friends.

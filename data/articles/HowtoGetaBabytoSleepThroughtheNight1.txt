 Make sure your expectations are reasonable.;
, High pitched, intense crying for more than three hours a day means that your baby is experiencing colic, which experts believe may be related to intestinal development issues, acid reflux, or food allergies.


Try different resting positions for your baby. The "colic carry," with the baby positioned so that his/her stomach rests on your forearm and his/her head rests in your palm, can be a calming position.
Massage your baby's back to help release pent-up gas that might be causing the colic.
Rock your baby in a steady, relaxing motion. A ride in the car or a walk in the stroller can soothe your baby and help him/her fall asleep.
Colic usually begins when the baby is about two weeks old and ends by the time the baby is 12-14 weeks old.



Place a cold compress on your baby's gums. Soak a wet washcloth in water and chill it in the freezer until it is cold enough to soothe but not too cold for your baby (about one hour). You may also want to soak the cloth in a soothing liquid like chamomile or peppermint tea to help relax your baby or simply place your child's pacifier in the refrigerator.
Apply an over the counter topical anesthetic to your baby's gums. Avoid anesthetics containing benzocaine, as it may be harmful to teething babies.
Medicate your baby with a pain reliever or a homeopathic treatment. Check with your pediatrician about which pain killers are appropriate for your child. Acetaminophen is usually appropriate for babies over three months old, while ibuprofen is allowed for babies at least six months old.
 Don't overheat your baby with too many blankets.


Set the room temperature between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit to achieve a good environment for your baby to sleep in.
 Your baby may be waking up in the night because s/he is hungry. Breastfeed your baby or warm up a bottle to find out if food is what s/he needs.

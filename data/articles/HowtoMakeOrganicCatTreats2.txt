 Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
 Mix the two cheeses by hand until evenly distributed.
 Use your hands or a spoon to mix the yogurt into the cheese combination. The mix should be thoroughly combined with the cheeses look sticky and coated.
 Add 1/4 cup (56.7 grams) of the flour and cornmeal to the cheese mix at a time, stirring it in with a spoon or mixing it in with your hands after each addition. Continue mixing the flour and cornmeal in until a thoroughly combined dough starts to form.
 If the dough is too dry or stiff to work with, you can add a little amount of water to it until it becomes pliable.
 The dough should hold together without too much difficulty.
 Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough to 1/4-inch (0.64-centimeter) thickness.
 Use a knife to cut rows with a width of 1 inch (2 1/2 centimeters). Cut these rows into pieces with a height of 1 inch (2 1/2 centimeters) as well.
 Arrange them in a single layer.
 Allow them to cool before giving one to your feline companion, and save the rest in a sealable container or plastic bag.

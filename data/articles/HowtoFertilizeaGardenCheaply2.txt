 Grass clippings make great organic fertilizer as they provide moisture for the soil and prevent weeds from cropping up. Use freshly cut grass from lawns that have not been treated with herbicides. Sprinkle a Â½ inch (1.27 cm) layer of grass clippings on the soil as fertilizer.Depending on how much grass you have, you may be able to cut grass clippings for your garden every one to two weeks.
 Green manure is a good, natural fertilizer for your garden. Combine wheat, oats, rye, clover, peas, vetch, buckwheat, and broad beans. Then, spread the manure over the soil in your garden. Do this once a season.You can buy the ingredients for green manure at your local gardening store or online.
 Wood ash and sawdust add calcium and potassium to the soil. They can also help to raise the pH of the soil if it is too acidic, making it more hospitable to neutral pH plants like vegetables. Sprinkle wood ash or sawdust to the soil. Use five pounds (2.5 kg) of wood ash or sawdust for every 100 square feet (9 square metres) of soil.You can get wood ash from the bottom of your fireplace or your fire pit.
You can get sawdust from your local woodshop.

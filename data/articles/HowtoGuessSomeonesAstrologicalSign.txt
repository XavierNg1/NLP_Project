 These traits include high set and narrow facial bones, broad foreheads, rosy cheeks, strong, well-proportioned body, above or below average height, and dark or sandy colored hair, strong eyebrows (not necessarily large though, they're often extremely thin but very notable), as well as clear and penetrating eyes which are often close-set.
 Taurus is ruled by Venus so these people will often be very attractive overall. Taurus people usually appear innocent, with childlike eyes, full lips, small/even teeth, with thick hair and strongly defined jawlines. Their bodies tend to be quite square overall. They typically have low foreheads, slightly thicker than usual necks, and attractive faces.

They usually have very rounded bodies. All their features are very soft looking (unlike Aries). Their eyes are typically small, with a small or average sized nose, crooked teeth, and a full mouth. In essence, the upper body is invariably larger in proportion to the lower, which may make for a rather clumsy or top-heavy bodily appearance at times.
 Leos are known for their glamorous, thick, mane-like dark hair, large dark eyes, proud and confident expression which usually results includes their chin going up a little (resembles a lion), Leo is one of the attractive signs, but they can sometimes have bad luck.

 They have strong features, intense hypnotic penetrating eyes that could burn holes in your soul, glowing tan almost oily skin, and a fixed expression. They tend to have very dark hair.

 It is especially important to observe their behavior while they are in conflicts or while working in groups. We all learn to hide our inner feelings to some degree while in public. People usually display their astrological traits in relationships and tense interactions.For example, Aries' first reaction when faced with conflict is to yell or threaten, Gemini will talk his/her way out of it, Cancer usually responds with an emotional outburst, Taurus responds to conflict with silence and a posture of strength, etc.
Cardinal (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn): These people usually responds to conflict with a bold, decisive, instinctive action in an attempt to trump the assault. They are easily motivated to start tasks.
Fixed (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius): These people tend to hold in their reaction and respond that the attempt to hurt them was futile, with passive aggressive behavior or with silence. They concentrate on finishing things well.
Mutable (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces): These people tend to be artful with conflicts, and are known to try to avoid arguments. They are good at motivating people.

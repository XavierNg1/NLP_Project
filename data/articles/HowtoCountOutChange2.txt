 Sometimes a customer will pay with an odd amount (typically more than necessary) because they want to avoid receiving too many small coins. For example, if the price of an item is $33.02, your customer may give $50.02 as payment. In this instance, you can put the two pennies in the register and count up from $33.00. Proceed to count the change as follows:$34.00…$35.00 (2 dollar bills), $40.00 (1 five dollar bill), $50 (1 ten dollar bill).
This makes the total amount of change $17.00.
 Sometimes, depending on the amount owed, you may find that you are giving back multiple nickels and dimes instead of a quarter. Once you have determined the correct amount of change by counting up from the price to the amount paid, make sure that you look over the change and give the customer back the fewest coins possible.For example, if the price was $5.55 and the customer paid with a $10 dollar bill, you would count up starting with nickels. $5.60 (1 nickel), $5.70...$5.80…$5.90…$6.00 (4 dimes), $7.00…$8.00…$9.00...$10.00 (4 dollars). The total amount of change is $4.45.
Instead of giving back 1 nickel and 4 dimes to make .45 cents, you could give the customer 1 quarter and 2 dimes, which also makes .45 cents. This is preferred because you are giving the customer fewer coins.
 Always have a calculator handy so that you can double check your math before giving change to a customer. This will give you peace of mind and confirm that your mental math was correct. It is possible that you may have made an error and the calculator will help catch that. This is especially important if you are working with complex calculations.


You can also use the calculator on your phone to help double check that you provided the customer with the correct amount of change.

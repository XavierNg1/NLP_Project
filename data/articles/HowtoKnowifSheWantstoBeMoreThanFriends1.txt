 Is she looking you in the eyes longer or glancing at you when you're not looking? This is usually an indication that someone is attracted to you.;
, This can range from subtle gestures like letting an arm rest against you to more obvious ones like an extended hug. Either way, consistent physical contact isn't something you typically do with your platonic friends. It's probably a good sign.
 Does she seem to get upset when you're around other girls or try to jump into every conversation you have with one? She's probably jealous of the attention that they're getting from you. This is a clear indicator she wants to be more than friends.

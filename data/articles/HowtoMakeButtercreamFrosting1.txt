If you're still uncertain with the amount of milk or cream to add, you can just add 1/2 a teaspoon first to check. You can also substitute the vanilla extract for 1 teaspoon of a different flavor.

If you would like to make your buttercream less sweet, then add a pinch of salt.
 You can leave the buttercream plain, or you can make it coloring by adding a few drops of food coloring or gel icing coloring. Keep in mind that some flavorings, such as cocoa powder, will already tint the icing darker, so the coloring will not show up.
 This will give you frosting that is light and fluffy. You will need to beat it for about two to three minutes.


If the cream is too thick, add some more cream, milk, or half-and-half. Start with one tablespoon, mix, then add more if necessary.If the cream is too thin, add a little bit more confectioner's sugar

 Remove the screws holding the lock to the door. Unscrew the two screws underneath the door knob, as well as the screws holding the faceplate to the side of the door. Pull out the doorknob and the faceplate. Put all of the parts on a sheet of newspaper or cardboard so that you donâ€™t lose track of anything.
 Use a spray cleaner or WD-40 to clean all of the parts of the lock. Wipe off any dirt or grime from the door knob, cylinder, faceplate and other parts. Get any remaining liquid cleaner or WD-40 off the lock.








If dirt or grime drips out of the lock, make sure you have a rag to catch any drips.
Make sure you properly clean the keyhole and all moving parts.
 Make sure all of the parts of the lock are dry. Then, apply graphite lubricant to all parts of the lock. Squeeze some graphite into the keyhole, as well as onto the cylinder and other moving parts.








Graphite lubricant is less likely to require follow up lubrication.
 Put the latch-bolt and faceplate back on the side of the door. Put the outside door knob on. Then, put the inside door knob on. Put on the faceplate. Tighten all of the screws. Turn the door knob to make sure everything is turning smoothly.

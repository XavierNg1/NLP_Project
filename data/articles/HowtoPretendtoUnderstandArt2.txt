 Once you get to the museum or gallery you’re visiting, choose a piece of art and really look at it. Even if you have no previous knowledge of the artist or the collection, you can ask yourself some questions about it. What is it? A painting, a photograph, a sculpture? What’s it made of? Paint, pencil, plastic? How did the artist approach the medium? Does it look rushed? Like it took a lot of time? Looking at the piece and asking yourself questions can give you some material to work with when you’re talking to your friends., Once you've noted what the piece is, what it's made out of, and how the artist might have approached it, look at the piece as a whole. How do the different elements come together in one piece of art? How does it make you feel? Is there something sad about the medium used? Joyful? Consider the "big picture" of the piece of art and how the smaller components contribute to it. Being able to discuss those things can help you seem like you "get" art., Try to place it in the historical context in which it was created. That’s where those plaques next to artwork come in handy. They might tell you about the artist’s life, why the artist used specific materials, or what was happening in the world when the piece was created. Use those context clues to draw meaning from the art., It’s totally okay to look at a piece of art and decide that you like it – or don’t – based only on your instincts. But if you do feel that way, take some time looking at the piece and trying to figure out why you do or don’t like it. It could be because of the colors, or maybe the shape of the piece, or the way someone or something in it looks. Being able to articulate why you do or don’t like a piece of art can make you seem like you “get” it in conversation with others.

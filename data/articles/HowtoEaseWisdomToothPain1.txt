 Try to be aware of sore locations when you’re going about your daily routines. Be extra careful about brushing and biting on the side where the tooth is growing because you may cause inflammation or even an infection. If multiple wisdom teeth are growing in on both the left and right sides of your mouth, try to identify which spots are the most sensitive, and be gentle with them.Don’t poke and prod with your tongue, as this will aggravate your sensitive and swollen gums, and could lead to infection.;
, It’s important to prevent decay or infection, especially as your wisdom teeth begin to develop. Since your gums may be sensitive or swollen, you might feel the urge to shy away from brushing, but you must keep up with your hygiene routine. New nooks and crannies form with swollen gums and emerging wisdom teeth, and these introduce areas for bacteria to grow. Tooth decay, cavities, and periodontal disease (or gum infection) will only make your pain that much more intolerable and your entire mouth can get sore.
If you don’t keep up with your dental hygiene, your hard-to-reach wisdom teeth might become infected or develop cavities as soon as they fully emerge, which greatly increases the need for their removal. Since they are the last teeth to appear, the enamel is less mineralized. If you have poor oral hygiene, then cavities can easily form and do a lot of harm.
 Ibuprofen and similar over the counter medications are effective for wisdom tooth pain, especially in its initial phases. Always use any medication as directed, and never take more than the directed dosage. Ibuprofen, while effective, also can cause bleeding, so make sure you check in with your doctor or dentist about regular use.

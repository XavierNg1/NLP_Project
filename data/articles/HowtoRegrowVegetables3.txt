For carrots or radishes, measureÂ 1 inch from the top of the vegetable down, and then cut it.
For scallions or leeks, measure 3 inches from the roots up and cut.
 Share container space, so if there is room without the vegetables touching place them in the same container.



When the carrot or radish grows roots, wait 1 more day before planting it in soil.
When the scallion or leek has lots of roots and they are about 3 inches long, plant it.
 You can't grow a carrot or radish/turnip etc. but you can regrow the greens for decorations, salads, or a beautiful houseplant.

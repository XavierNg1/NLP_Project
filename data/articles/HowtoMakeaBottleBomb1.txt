 Tear a paper towel in half or tear off a square of plastic wrap, approximately 7 inches by 7 inches. Measure out about a tablespoon of baking soda and place it in the center of the paper towel or plastic wrap. Set aside.;
, Pour about an inch to an inch-and-a-half of vinegar into the bottle. Be careful not to fill it too full or the bomb may explode before you’re ready.
 Pick up the paper towel or plastic wrap by the corners so that the baking soda is cupped inside. Stuff the cupped paper towel or plastic wrap just inside the mouth of the bottle so that the portion with the baking soda is just past the mouth and the corners of the paper towel or plastic wrap are poking out of the top of the bottle.


Don’t let the paper towel/plastic wrap drop all the way into the bottle.
 You want a place with plenty of open space, away from people, animals, and property. Keep in mind that you’ll be throwing the bottle, so there should be enough open space for you to be able to throw the bottle a safe distance away from you.
 Bring them to the place where you plan to set off the bomb. Push the paper towel or plastic wrap all the way into the bottle. Screw on the cap and vigorously shake the bottle. As soon as you feel the bottle begin to harden from the internal pressure, throw the bottle up and away from you. The bottle should explode when it hits the ground.


Be very careful when shaking the bottle because it could potentially explode in your hands. Take the proper precautions.

You can also get to this menu by holding the "Windows" key and pressing R, then typing "appwiz.cpl" (without quotes) in the box and pressing â†µ Enter.
This menu can also be found in "Control Panel" under "Programs and Features".
 Highlight it (or right click) and select "Uninstall".



If the program still appears in the "Programs and Features" list, try refreshing the list by pressing F5.
 If this doesn't work, or you get an error:

Ensure that you have "Administrator" access to the PC. If a box titled "User Account Control" pops up, you will need the username and password of an account that has admin permissions on your PC or domain.
If the program is from a trusted source (ex: Adobe), refer to any error code that appears during uninstallation.
If the program is not from a trusted source or seems suspicious, download, install, and run Malwarebytes Anti-Malware or refer to your system administrator.

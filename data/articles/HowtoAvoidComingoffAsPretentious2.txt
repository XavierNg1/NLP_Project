 Empathy is the ability to understand how another person is feeling, the “putting yourself in their shoes” feeling. Imagine yourself as the other person in a particular situation, how you would be feeling, and how you would like someone to treat you.For example, think of sitting near a crying baby on an airplane. It is an annoying noise and it is beginning to stress you out. Now imagine being the parent of the crying baby. The parent knows how frustrated other people are at their child and is doing everything possible to get the baby to stop. How would you feel as the parent, knowing people were getting mad at you and the baby? You might feel stressed out, overwhelmed, or helpless. This is how you develop empathy.
 Spend more time listening than talking.This will help you gain understanding and foster connection with others, rather than bulldoze the conversation with your own points of view.


If you have a hard time not dominating a conversation, practice stepping back and letting others take a turn, before you make your point. Sum up the points you heard: “It sounds like everyone wants to get pizza. I’m good with that. Everyone wants pepperoni?”
Ask questions. Be interested in other people and their lives. Most people love to talk about themselves and appreciate the opportunity to share the things they care about with others.
 You are no better than anyone else. We all have our own gifts, and we all have our own struggles, that we bring to the world. Consider that the person you look down upon likely has a life story you know next to nothing about.


Withhold judgment on other people’s lives and choices. Keep an open mind, and use your empathy skills to try to understand where the person is coming from, and why they would make the choice they did.
For example, perhaps the idiot who cut across a lane of traffic to turn was actually lost and in a hurry. Until you know the whole story, it is unfair to judge.

 If you are trying to change your password because you can't remember it, see the Resetting a Lost Password section below.
 This will open your Profile page.
 This will open a new menu.
 This will open your account Settings page.

 You'll need to enter your current password before you can change it. If you don't know your current password, see the Resetting a Lost Password section below.
 You'll need to enter this new password twice in order to verify it.
 Your new password will take effect immediately. You'll be signed out of any other devices that you are currently logged into.

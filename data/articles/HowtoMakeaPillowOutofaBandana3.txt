 They can be different colors and patterns, or they can be matching ones. You can even have a pretty pattern for one bandana, and a matching solid color for the other one., Place the two bandanas together, with the right sides facing out and the wrong sides facing in. Trace a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) square onto all four corners, then cut them out. Make sure that you cut through both bandanas at the same time., The tassels need to be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide and 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) deep. Again, make sure that you cut through both bandanas at the same time. The tassels must match up., Position the slit at the base of each tassel, right where it connects to the rest of the bandana. Make sure that it is centered. Be sure to cut through both bandanas at the same time., Keeping your bandanas stacked, take the first top and bottom tassels on the bottom-left edge. Feed them down through the vertical slit you cut. Tug on the tassels to tighten the knot.It helps to roll the tassels into a tube before feeding them through the slit., If you will be stuffing the pillow with polyester stuffing instead of a pillow form, continue weaving along the top edge; leave the last five tassels alone., You can use a pillow form or even an old throw pillow. You can also stuff the pillow with polyester stuffing instead., Use the same method as before, where you thread the top and bottom tassels down through the vertical slit.

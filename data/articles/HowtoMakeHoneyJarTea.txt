,, The temperature of the water you'll need depends on the kind of tea you're making, if you're a tea fanatic (see How to Make Tea). Leave a little room at the top for shaking later.
 Don't tighten it all the way, because it might explode in your face, making for an unpleasant teatime. Just place the lid on top of the jar to retain heat but to let steam out if it really wants to come out.
 Maybe you can pick out a few images for wikiHow articles, or answer a request.
 Preferably in a compost pile, of course.
 This time, close the jar as tightly as you can and shake for only 5 seconds. Loosen the lid, allow steam to escape, and repeat. Do this until you think all the honey is dissolved. Note that if your jar isn't sealed shut, hot water will splash all over the place and you'll lose some of your precious honey and tea. Note also that if you shake for too long without letting the steam out, your tea might explode in your face, as mentioned earlier.
 Why waste water and energy cleaning another teacup when you've got a perfectly suitable jar to drink out of? Just make sure to cover your hands, because the jar doesn't have a handle (if you haven't noticed) and your hands might get burned.

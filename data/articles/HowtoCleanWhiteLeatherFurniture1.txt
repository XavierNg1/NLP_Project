 Adding a fluid or other cleaning solution will only help the stain set. It’s important to deal with these stains promptly so they don’t have a chance to set.


If the stain has had time to set, you can sprinkle baking soda on it. Leave it for a few hours, allowing the grease to soak into the baking soda. Then, brush everything off with a rag.;
, Take a cotton swab and dip it in rubbing alcohol. Rub at the stain until the ink is lifted. If the stain is particularly large, you might need more than one cotton swab to take care of it., Mix equal quantities of each ingredient, creating a paste. The amount of paste you need to make depends on the size of the spot you’re trying to clear. Slather the paste on the stain, and let it stand for 10 minutes before wiping it away with a damp cloth.

 Buttercream's texture is dependent on light, fluffy butter. It's necessary to start with softened (not melted) butter and beat it until it takes on a pale yellow hue and becomes quite malleable. Use an electric mixture or a stand mixture to beat your butter; it'll be a lot harder to whip in enough air using a whisk.

, Start with 3 cups of confectioner's sugar. Measure it out and dump it in your mixing bowl with the fluffy butter, then beat on low until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Turn the mixer to a higher speed and keep beating until the combination is light as a feather.









If you want to make chocolate buttercream, now's the time to add some unsweetened cocoa powder. Start with 1/2 cup. If you want the buttercream to be more chocolatey, you can always add more.
You can flavor your buttercream with other spices if you're not into chocolate. Consider cinnamon, cardamon, dried crushed rose or lavender - whatever suits your fancy.
 To finish your buttercream, add the vanilla and salt, and start with 2 tablespoons cream. Beat the mixture until well combined. Your finished buttercream should be light, fluffy and spreadable.









If it seems too dry, add another tablespoon of cream - up to four total.
If it seems too wet, add more sugar.
You can use a flavor other than vanilla, like almond or mint.
You can color your buttercream by adding a few drops of food coloring.

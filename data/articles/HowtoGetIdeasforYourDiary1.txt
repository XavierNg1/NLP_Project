 This will make you more excited to write in your diary each day, and give you a clean slate to think of new ideas for your diary.


Cover the diary. A great way to add new flair to a notebook is to entirely cover it with paper or fabric. Lay the notebook out flat on a table on top of the paper or fabric you want to use to cover it. Trace the outline of the notebook on your paper or fabric, and cut it to size. Glue it onto your notebook with craft glue. Use a foam brush to apply the glue to avoid lumps.
You can even recycle an old pair of jeans to add a pocket to the cover of your notebook.
Use stickers, and draw or paint on your diary to add more personalization.;
, It’s also a daily encourager to write, as you can see how far you’ve gotten in your notebook.


You can create a bookmark with almost anything: thin wood, cardboard, ribbon, or paper.
For encouragement, you might write your favorite quote about creativity on your bookmark. For example, you might choose this Elizabeth Gilbert quote: “Creativity itself doesn’t care at all about results—the only thing it craves is the process. Learn to love the process, and let whatever happens next happen, without fussing too much about it.”, If you want to get even more creative and advanced, you can make a notebook diary insert. You can stick these blank books into your existing diary.


This is a great option if you’d like to start adding some drawing or artwork to an existing lined diary but would prefer to use unlined paper.
For an even simpler way to make your own notebook insert, you can cut paper to the size you want your notebook to be. Stack it up like a notebook.
Then, use a three-hole punch to create holes through the paper.
Loop three pieces of ribbon or string through the holes, and then tie them in knots or bows to create your notebook insert.

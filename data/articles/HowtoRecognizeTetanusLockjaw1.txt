 First, you'll feel a headache and a muscular stiffness in the jaw. It will be difficult to open and close your mouth. This is why the condition is commonly known as "lockjaw." Symptoms usually set in about eight days after infection, although the onset has been known to range from three days to three weeks.A shorter incubation period signals a more heavily infected wound. Also, tetanus-infected wounds take longer to incubate when they are father from the central nervous system. Seek urgent treatment if you experience tetanus symptoms within fewer than eight days of exposure.
On their own, a headache and a slightly stiff jaw should not terrify you. This could mean a lot of things. However, it wouldn't hurt to check with a doctor if you're worried.;
, As tetanus worsens, you'll experience a stiff neck, and you'll have trouble swallowing. Other symptoms may include:


Painful hardening of the abdominal muscles
Spasms in the jaw, chest, and abdomen. These spasms can cause painful, hyper-extended back arching, or opisthotonos.
Sweating and fever
Irregular breathing and heartbeat

, Advanced cases of tetanus can severely impair your breathing with spasms in your throat and vocal cords â€“ and these spasms can cause fractures and muscle tears. Muscular stiffness may cause the spine and other long bones to fracture. You may experience high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. Untreated tetanus can cause pneumonia, blood clots in the lungs, and even a coma. Despite the innovations of modern treatment, 10-30% of tetanus patients die from the condition.The mortality rate is highest in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years old. Your chances might be better if you're vaccinated, you have a strong immune system, and you're relatively young. This does not mean that you shouldn't be worried!

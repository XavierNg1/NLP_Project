 A compact disc (CD) can be inserted into either a CD or DVD drive. A DVD, however, can only be inserted into a DVD drive.
 This signifies that your drive has read the disc and is ready to install the software.


If the AutoPlay window does not appear, you can open My Computer or Windows Explorer, right-click on the letter for your CD or DVD drive showing that Microsoft Office or Microsoft Word is present and then click AutoPlay.
 You'll be asked whether to install the program to a default directory or a different directory and may be presented with a license agreement.

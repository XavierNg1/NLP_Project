 Create your first mat in a light color, such as white, that will highlight your photo. Choose a smaller size, such as a 1/4 or 1/8 inch (0.6 or 0.3 cm) border.


Make a larger photo mat in a complimentary, but darker, color. Make it 1/4 to 2 inches larger than your first photo mat. You will need to double the border measurement and add it to your last mat's dimensions before cutting the new mat.
 With this technique, you will want a small bordered mat, a larger bordered mat and a smaller bordered mat on the outside again.


Measure and cut 3 mats. The first mat should be 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) larger than the photo on all sides. The second mat should be a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) larger on all sides than the first mat in a different color. The last mat should be 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) larger than the second mat on all sides in the same color as the first mat.
Glue the mats together and then affix the photo. This mat may need extra time to dry. There are many variations in sizes and shapes for this mat.
 Use the same process to create mats with decorative paper; however, you will need to be more careful when working with decorative paper so that it does not rip.


Alternate using cardstock and decorative paper matting for a beautiful decorative effect. Use less glue on decorative papers so that they do not warp.
 Cut your photo to be 3 inches wide and 3.125 inches high (7.6 by 7.9 cm). This is the standard size of a Polaroid print.


Cut a white mat to be 3.5 inches wide and 4.25 inches (8.9 by 10.8 cm) high. Center your photo so that it is 1/4 inches (0.6 cm) from the top.
Write a memo about the photo on the bottom white portion, just as you would with a Polaroid photo.
 When you measure and cut your mat, make the border measurement several inches wider than it is tall.


When you center your photo on the mat, make sure it is even on either side of the photo. Use this space to draw, add stickers or add jewels.

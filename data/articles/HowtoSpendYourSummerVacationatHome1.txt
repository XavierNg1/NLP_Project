 Summer is the perfect time to head outside. You can enjoy the great outdoors (and get in some cardio) while walking through your neighborhood or running around the block. If you have a bike and a helmet, consider taking a daily bike ride instead.


Look online for a kid-friendly “30-Day” walking or running challenge. This will give you something to work towards every day!;
, Can’t make it to the putting green this summer? Play frisbee golf instead! Set up a course around your house or neighborhood and assign a par to each hole. You and your friends will spend hours competing for the best score.


In your spare time, design a course map and score cards.
 Before tvs, computers, and tablets, kids spent their summer days playing games, like tag, outdoors. The next time you get together with friends, consider playing:


Red rover
Sharks and minnows
Wiffle ball
Four-square
Kick ball
Capture the flag
Hide and seek, Who needs a campground when you have a backyard? Spend the night or weekend at your backyard campsite. After you’ve pitched the tent, sit around the fire (or grill) toasting marshmallows and stargazing.


Ask your parents for permission and help., Sometimes it is just too hot to be outside. On these occasions, move your workout indoors. You can check-out a workout dvd from your local library or use one of the numerous free online exercise videos.This is also a great way to try new exercises!

 It’s important for your pup to interact with people other than you—otherwise, once the dog has matured, it may be openly hostile and mistrustful towards other individuals. Aim to introduce your pup to five new people a day.Taking your pup to a dog park (or a regular park) is a great way to socialize it. Be careful when leaving it on the ground around large dogs, however, as they may not be used to puppies and may play too aggressively.
 The people your dog meets don’t need to all be strangers; invite friends and family members over and ask them to pet, cuddle, and hold your puppy (which they’ll probably want to do anyway). As these people come to your house more often, the pup will soon get used to seeing them and will feel comfortable around them.Don’t overwhelm your puppy with all of the socialization. If it seems tired, or doesn’t want to be picked up and coddled anymore, ask friends to leave the dog along and enclose it in a separate room. This time alone is important for your puppy as well; it will help prevent the dog from developing separation anxiety later in its life., If you only introduce your puppy to people who look, act, and dress like you, the dog will likely be confused or aggressive when meeting people who act or dress differently. Ask your visiting friends to wear large, floppy hats, sweatshirts with hoods, sunglasses, snowboots and other types of clothing your dog is likely to see in the world.Introduce your puppy to people of different ethnicities than yourself, too. For example, if you only socialize your pup with Caucasian friends, your dog may bark or react with fear when seeing a person of color.

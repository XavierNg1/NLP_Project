 CAGR can also be used to predict future growth based upon a historical CAGR.This is done similarly to calculating a historical CAGR. In order to calculate future value, you will need a few essential values. This includes the starting value, ending or finishing value, and the period of time over which you wish to measure growth.


Determine the starting value (SV) of an asset, for example, the price paid for a share of stock or the current revenues of a company.
Determine the period of time (T) you want to study, for example, the number of years, months, quarters, etc.Enter the CAGR percentage as a decimal. For example, the CAGR percentage of 24.9% calculated in method one would be entered here at 0.249.
 Future values can be calculated using the following formula: FV = SV(1 + CAGR)^T. Simply input the values you have decided on and calculate the future value in a similar way to calculating CAGR. You can either calculate this value by calculator or using a computer.


To calculate this on a computer, use a spreadsheet program and enter the program into an empty cell. For example, a potential calculation in Excel would start with SV in cell A1, CAGR in cell D1, and T in cell C1. To calculate FV, enter the following into an empty cell: =A1(1+D1)^C1 and press enter., When using your CAGR to predict future values, keep in mind that no historical data can accurately predict the future. However, using a CAGR can serve as a somewhat reliable estimate of future growth.Keep in mind also that this CAGR represents an average of the growth of the represented values and will likely be lower or higher within the given year or period of time that you are trying to estimate.

 It is south of Gunnar's house, from where the quest Gunnar's Ground Quest took place. She will tell you that her cat, Fluffs ran away, but she can't leave her house because she has children to take care of. Gertrude asks you to talk to her sons.;
, They are located in Varrock Circle (the fountain). They are by the Fur Seller and Benny (the Newspaper seller). Talk to one of them and ask if they have seen Fluffs. He will say that the cat is at their 'secret hideout'. Ask them where the hideout is. They won't tell you, because they're running low on cash. You must give them 100 coins, and they will tell you that Fluffs is at their hideout, the Lumber Mill. The only way to get in is to climb the broken fence on the south side.
 To get there, go to the East Varrock Bank, keep going east until you get out of Varrock. Go north. After a little bit of walking, you will find the Lumber Mill. Find the Sawmill Operator Hut. There's a broken fence, climb over it.
 You will find a ladder. Climb up it, and there is Gertrude's Cat. Try to pick the cat up, but it will scratch you (it won't do any damage).
 Now Try to pick it up, but it will still scratch you. The cat is hungry. Head back to Gertrude's house, and behind you will find Doogle Leaves. Use the Doogle leaves on a Raw Sardine, and you'll get seasoned sardine. Get back to the Lumber Mill, and give the seasoned sardine to Fluffs. Try to pick it up, but it is afraid to leave because Kitten is gone.
 Keep doing it until you find the Kitten. It's in one of the crates at the top left corner of the screen, with a yellow "search" instead of the normal cyan color.
 Return to Gertrude for your reward which is: 1 Quest Point, a kitten, 1525 Cooking XP, a Chocolate Cake, a Bowl of Stew, and the ability to raise cats.

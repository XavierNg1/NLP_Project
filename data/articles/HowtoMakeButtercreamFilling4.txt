 If you use buttercream on a pastry that hasn't completely cooled off, the buttercream will melt and make an oozy mess.
 Spread the buttercream evenly, right up to the edges. Finish up by placing the top layer on the cake.
 After you have spread the buttercream filling over the bottom layer, place some thinly sliced strawberries on top of the buttercream. Try to spread them as evenly as you can, so that none of the buttercream is visible. Once you have arranged the strawberries, spread more buttercream on top. When you are done, cover with the upper cake layer.


You can also use other types of fruit as well.
 Once you have spread buttercream over the bottom cake layer, spread some of your favorite jam over the buttercream. Make sure that the jam is spread evenly, and that there is no buttercream showing. When you are done, cover with the upper cake layer.
 You can use a measuring spoon or even an apple corer. Scoop out a hole on the top of a cupcake. Fill the hole with buttercream. Fit a piping bag with your desired decorating tip (such as a star) and swirl more buttercream on top to cover the hole., Fit the end of the piping bag with a filling tip. Poke three holes into the bottom of the pastry: one at each end, and one in the middle. Squeeze on the piping bag as you poke each hole; this will fill the pastry., Cut a large slit into the side of a cream puff. Put the tip of the piping bag into the slit, and squeeze the buttercream into the puff. Stop when the buttercream starts to ooze out from the slit. Repeat this step for all of the cream puffs.

 If you are playing in front of the school, choose a song that is popular amongst the students. If you are playing in front of all the parents, choose something a bit older, like '70s or '80s rock.;
, If you're playing the guitar alone, try teaming up with a drummer or bassist, as this will make your part sound better. Any instrument sounds rubbish on its own. And if you get on well, you could even start a band.
 This will prove that you are a talented young musician.

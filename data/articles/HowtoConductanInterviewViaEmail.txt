 Call her or send an email explaining who you are, what the story you are writing is about, and the types of information you hope to garner from the responses. Indicate why you think she is a good source for your story. Within the email, include your contact information. Do not proceed until you have permission from the interview subject.;
, No interview subject wants to assume what you're asking. Questions should be open-ended and not be yes-or-no questions. If you do choose to utilize a question with a simple yes or no answer, follow up with another question about why the subject answered the way he did.
 Typically, three to five questions is standard for basic email interviews. By limiting the number of questions, you are being considerate of the subject's time. Any more questions than this may be a bit labor-intensive for your source. However, if the source is the main subject of a feature or more lengthy article, more questions might be necessary. Use your best judgment as a journalist.
 There are times that answers to questions cause a journalist to think of additional questions. If this is the case, feel free to follow up for further information.
 If your story is going to appear in a public publication, let the interview subject know when to expect to see the article on news stands.
 This is not to say, however, that it's appropriate to change the context or meaning of the quote to suit your story or its tone.

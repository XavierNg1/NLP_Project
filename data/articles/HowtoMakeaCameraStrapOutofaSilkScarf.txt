 Mark where you want the silk scarf strap to fall to. Then make another mark about an inch and a half (3.5cm) below this mark to allow for extra sewing room.;
, Using scissors, make a clean cut.
 Fold the scarf end over the keyring circle and sew the free end firmly in place to form a loop that holds the ring. You'll have to attach your camera here, so leave about an inch (2.5cm) of wiggle-room. Do this on both ends of the scarf.
 (See "Tips" for other tube material suggestions.)
Measure the width of the scarf loop end you've just sewn to obtain the right width for the tube. Cut the leather/vinyl to the right width and length, leaving adequate seam allowance on each side and each end, to allow for folding over and stitching.






To prevent fraying, you'll need to stitch the edges of the tube material before sewing the tube together. This can be done by machine, or by hand; use a needle able to stitch leather. Fold each edge over slightly and sew along the entire length of each edge to strengthen.






Sew the tube together firmly. Roll the length of leather/vinyl into a cylinder and stitch the joining pieces together, tucking any additional seam allowance inside the tube to ensure neatness. See image for the completed tube.
 Make sure the inside of the tube with the stitching isn't facing outward when you position it, to avoid it showing when you wear the camera. Turn the stitching around, to face it against your body when worn.
 Grab a needle and hand sew the leather tube onto the camera strap. Sew firmly so that it doesn't come loose and slip down onto the key-chain––more stitches are better than not enough. Note that the tube does not cover the end of the scarf or keyring––these should still hang below the tube (see the image).
 Now you have a new strap (or a clever replacement). Enjoy the luxurious feel of silk and use its strength to keep your camera safely in place.

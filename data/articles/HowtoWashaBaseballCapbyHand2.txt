 The fibres of wool are durable and long-lasting, but they also require different sorts of cleaners. Look for a detergent that says it is meant for wool, or can be safely used with wool fabrics., Mix a small amount (about a tablespoon) of wool-safe detergent into a bucket or sink filled with cool water. Let your wool baseball cap soak in this mixture for about an hour.








If your cap is especially dirty, you can spot clean it by dunking the hat in the water, then rubbing any trouble areas with your hands or an old toothbrush. Just donâ€™t scrub hard, since this can damage the wool.
 Empty your bucket or sink after your cap has had a chance to soak. Hold the hat under cool running water until all traces of suds and grime are gone.
 Wool fabric is especially prone to losing its shape if not dried properly. Set the cap on top of a melon, ball, balloon or other rounded object about the size of your head, and let it air dry.








In a pinch, you can even let your cap dry on top of a round coffee can.
It may not be comfortable, but you can also wear your until it is dry to help it keep its shape.
Never place a wool cap in a clothes dryer.

 Sometimes you just bail a trick down sets to get a feeling of what you need to do, other times you really goof up and bail by mistake. The following steps dictate how to bail in multiple cases.;
, Roll up to the stairs ready to attempt whatever trick you want. If you just bail out and kick the board away, then be ready to squat and roll. If the concrete at the landing is smooth, like a skatepark, then you can slide out but be sure that you roll over onto your side or back, because that's more comfortable.

The squat and roll is what saves you from injuries resulting in shock, and from cuts or bruises. The squat absorbs shock into your legs rather than just your feet, and when you roll you should roll onto your side or do some kind of flip over your shoulder, but make sure you're not going to hurt yourself. Practice the roll on flat ground or in the grass.
 If you caught the trick, but kick out for some reason then do the squat and roll, it's your best bet. But sometimes you stick your trick and you feel like you're going to fall off. If this happens, start crouching down so you don't have so far to fall. You may be able to stop yourself with your hands but be careful, your wrists aren't shatter proof. If you stop yourself with your hands try to spin and slide out.

Sometimes during flip tricks or tricks involving 180s and spins you may land primo or land sideways and slam. It's best to spot your landing and make sure you've caught the flip before you stick it. Try not to stop your falls with your hands if you can help it. You don't want a broken wrist.

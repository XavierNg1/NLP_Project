 First, log into your account with your username and password. Any issues with this can be resolved via a password recovery system involving an email being sent to your email address.;
, When you are on the main page, click on your profile bar located at the top right of your screen and then click on “Settings.”

, Scroll down the page a bit until you see the Email Notifications section.


This will feature a bunch of sliders that you can click on and drag for Yes or No.
 There are many options for setting your email notifications. The top one allows you to turn them off completely if you like.


The next set of options involve getting an email every time someone “Pins your Pin”, “Likes your Pin”, or “Follows you, or one of your Boards.” You can turn each of these on and off separately.
Below those three, you have the option to have the emails sent to you immediately when they happen, or once a day so you are not receiving emails all day long.
There are also other types of emails you can get. The next set involves getting an email every time someone “Comments on your Pin”, “Sends you a Pin”, “Invites you to a Group Board”, or someone from your other social networks joins Pinterest.
The last set of customization involves getting emails from “Price changes for Pins you add”, “Stuff you might like”, “Weekly inspiration”, “Feature announcements and updates” or “Invitations to give us feedback.”
This should help you get a handle if you are receiving an overwhelming amount of emails from Pinterest, or if you are just starting out something you should attend to, immediately

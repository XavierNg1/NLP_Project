Depending on the age and developmental level of your child, they can help cut up the vegetables. Properly teaching children about knife usage, rather than removing them from this step, can actually increase their safety in kitchen environments. Always supervise children with sharp objects!
Children who are too young to help cutting vegetables can help wash the vegetables and throw away the scraps.

This is another great step for your little helper! Form the mixture into patty shapes and place on a plate. If they are too moist, add more breadcrumbs or flour.
 Cook the patties on each side for approximately 5 minutes.


While the patties cool off, prepare toppings and toast the bread, if preferred.
 Dig in!

 Fevers are not dangerous in themselves.They are the body’s natural response to an underlying condition. Many germs cannot survive at higher temperatures, so fevers are actually positive (though sometimes misery-inducing) agents.


The height of the fever does not usually correspond with a more serious illness. Higher fevers are often associated with viral infections.
 You don’t necessarily need to actively try to bring down a child’s fever. In fact, recent studies show that riding out a mild fever might be the best way to deal with one: fevers make certain parts of the immune system work harder, which can help your child get over colds faster than with medication.It can be hard to step back and recognize that there’s nothing more you can or should do as caretaker to bring down your child’s fever; however, sometimes just palliating the symptoms is enough and can go a long way to helping your child bravely endure this rough patch.
 Riding out a fever still involves a checkup of the numbers to make sure that the child’s condition does not worsen. (It's most important to know the temperature in a child under two years old.) Many different kinds of thermometers are available, since you can measure a fever a number of different ways. Typically all you need is a digital thermometer,though other options, such as the more expensive temporal artery thermometers or tympanic (ear) thermometers are also available.


Rectal thermometers provide the most accurate readings for infants.These should have a flexible tip and a wide handle.
Wait at least 20 minutes after a bath or after feeding your child to take their temperature. These are factors which could affect the reading.

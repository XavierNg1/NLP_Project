 The easiest way to quickly see all of your Firefox bookmarks is through the Bookmarks sidebar. Click the clipboard button next to the Bookmark button and select "View Bookmarks Sidebar."

, Bookmarks that you've added will be sorted into different categories. Expand these to see the bookmarks that you have, or search for specific bookmarks using the search box.
 The bookmark will be deleted immediately.


You can right-click bookmarks from any location, including the bookmarks menu, the bookmarks bar, or any other place you may find your bookmarks.
 If you need to delete a lot of bookmarks, the Library will make it easy to find and remove them.


Click the clipboard button and select "Show All Bookmarks," or press ⌘ Command/Ctrl+⇧ Shift+B.
Select multiple bookmarks at once by holding Ctrl/⌘ Command and clicking each one.

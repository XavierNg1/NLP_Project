 For many students, the online course environment may be less clear in terms of what constitutes academic dishonesty. Make sure you establish academic dishonesty policies for your students and give clear examples about what constitutes cheating in an online class., Some online courses will require that students use a webcam when they take an exam. This ensures that the right person is taking the test, and that students are not collaborating with each other on an exam. This might also reduce the chance of cheating.
 Signature tracking is another way to monitor online course participation. This requires a student to verify his identity with photo identification and his unique typing pattern., Some online courses might require students to take exams at a testing centre so that they are monitored and restricted from cheating., There are several programs that will detect plagiarism in written work by comparing the paper with other papers in the database and on the internet. Ask students to submit papers to online programs such as Turnitin.com or SafeAssign.

 Lay 4 - 8 inches (10.16 - 20.32 cm) of dry leaves twigs and straw on the bottom of a closed container. This carbon-rich material will help aerate the bottom of the compost and help keep it moist., Use organic material like lawn clippings or table scraps and layer it on top of your twigs and leaves., Continue to lay down the dry twigs and green organic material in layers until your compost pile is around 3 feet (91.44 cm) deep., The compost materials should remain moist so that it breaks down to form compost. Check on your compost daily to make sure that it isn't drying out from the hot sun. Spray down the organic material every day so that it stays moist., The center of the compost should be kept at 130 -150°F (54.4 - 65.5°C). Use a thermometer to get the temperature of the compost. Keeping the compost at a high heat will increase decay and quicken the time that the material turns into compost. Cover the container for the compost so that animals can't get into it.Without heat, the compost will take anywhere from 6 -12 months to fully break down.
 Continue to keep the compost hot and wet. Turning the compost over once a week will add oxygen to the compost, a necessary component to composting., Continue to turn your compost once a week and water it regularly. In two to three months the compost will ultimately break down. When the compost is ready it will be brown, crumbly, and sweet-smelling. You can now use the compost to promote healthy growth in your lawn and plants.

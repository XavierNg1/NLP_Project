 Nothing is more awkward then revealing, intentional or otherwise, that you like a boy around other people, especially if he is there and doesn't know. But what to do next? You like him, but just said you didn't.
 You need to talk to him privately, possibly by calling him on the phone. While this contradicts a step above, it is OK if you need to correct your mistakes.
 If you don't talk a lot, it might be awkward. Try not to introduce the flirting issue too suddenly. If conversation will be forced, simply come straight out with it.
 Again, DO NOT stutter or mumble. These indicate you are far more emotionally attached to the issue than you want to appear to be. Boys like confident girls, be one. Say something introductory, don't jump straight to, "I really do like you!!" Instead, start with, "You know that thing at lunch today?" He'll probably remember. Continue easily. "Jenny just pissed me off, it's not like I hate you or anything." Mention at one time or another that, "It's no big deal, I just didn't want it to be awkward or anything tomorrow."

, Asking someone out over the phone can be a good way to start things.

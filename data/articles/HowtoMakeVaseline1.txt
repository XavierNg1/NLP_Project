 Add 1 ounce (28 g) of beeswax and ½ cup (118 ml) of olive oil to a small sauce pan. There’s no need to stir the ingredients because they won’t combine until the beeswax begins to melt.It’s usually easier to use beeswax pellets instead of a block. They’re easier to measure and usually melt more quickly.
Be sure to choose yellow beeswax pellets rather than white pellets. White pellets have undergone a refining process so many of their natural properties have been stripped away.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to low. Allow the mixture to heat until the beeswax melts completely, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.As the beeswax starts to melt, stir the mixture occasionally to ensure that the ingredients combine fully.
 Once the beeswax has melted and combined with the olive oil, remove the pan from the heat. Carefully pour it into a glass jar or container, and allow it to cool for a couple of hours. That will allow the mixture to solidify slightly so it has the same texture as Vaseline.Choose a container for the mixture that has a lid so dust, dirt, and other debris don’t wind up in your “Vaseline.”

 Maybe your crush is in the jazz band, or the choir, or on a sports team you can join. Participating in the same groups as your crush gives you an excuse to be around them. It also increases the chances that when you do talk to your crush, they’ll recognize you.Only join organizations or clubs that you’re really interested in. If you’re doing something you don’t really like, it will show, and your crush might become less interested.;
, Flirting with your crush is a really easy way to get noticed and can lead to them befriending you. Flirting can be as simple as complimenting an outfit, the way they’re wearing their hair, and lightly touching their arm as you walk by. All of these subtle hints can let your crush know you’re interested.For example, you could say something like "Steve, is that a new haircut? It looks really nice on you," or "That's a pretty dress, Karen."
You could also lightly touch your crush's arm when you say hello in the hallway or at work. Don't use too much pressure; just lightly rest your hand on their arm to get their attention.
 If you have a class with your crush, try sitting near them. If you work with your crush, you can sit near them during meetings. This increases the chances your crush will notice you and also gives you a chance to talk to them more.You can get even more notice if you ask, "Is this seat taken?" before you sit down directly next to your crush. It can be a great way to get a conversation going and also makes sure that your crush notices you for sure.

 Rinse the strawberries under cool water first, then pat them dry. Chop off the stems, then slice them. Set the strawberries aside while you prepare the ice cream base.

You can use frozen strawberries as well, but you will have to let them thaw slightly first.
 The longer you pur√©e them for, the smoother your ice cream will be. If you want, you can leave some chunks to mimic store-bought strawberry ice cream., You can do this in an electric, stand mixer, or in a food processor fitted with whisks. You can also use a handheld beater. Keep beating the heavy cream until it becomes thick and fluffy. This will take about 1 minute., Keep beating it until it is just mixed in. This will take about 30 seconds., Keep stirring until they are mixed in, and no streaks or swirls remain. If you want a pinker ice cream, like the kind you buy in a store, stir in a few drops of red food coloring., The larger the loaf pan is, the faster your ice cream will freeze. Keep the ice cream covered with plastic wrap as it freezes.

If you want a soft-serve type of ice cream, freeze it for 3 to 4 hours., Once the ice cream is done freezing, you can leave it in the loaf pan, or you can transfer it into something more convenient, such as a plastic, freezer-safe container instead.

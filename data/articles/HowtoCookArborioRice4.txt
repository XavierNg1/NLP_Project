 Combine the three ingredients in a medium saucepan. Set the pan over medium-high heat and allow the water to reach a boil.


It's best to use a heavy-bottomed saucepan. You will not be able to stir the rice much as it cooks, and thin pans are more likely to burn the sitting rice.
 Stir the Arborio rice into the boiling water. Reduce the heat to low, and allow the rice to cook at a simmer for 15 minutes.


When you add the rice to the water, the boiling activity should settle. Wait for the water to return to a boil before reducing the heat.
Do not stir the rice as it simmers. Instead, gently agitate the pan by moving it from side to side every few minutes. Doing so should help prevent the rice from burning.
Continue cooking the rice until it absorbs all of the moisture. Test for doneness by sampling the rice; it should be "al dente" at this point, meaning that it still has some firmness in the center of the grains., Add these four ingredients to a separate medium saucepan. Set the pan over medium heat and bring it to a steady simmer.


You can either do this step while the rice cooks or wait until after it finishes cooking. If you wait until after, remove the pan of rice from the stove while the milk mixture heats up.
 Transfer the cooked rice to the simmering milk mixture. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook the mixture for 10 to 15 minutes.When ready, the rice should absorb most of the milk. The resulting pudding should be thick and glossy.
 Transfer the rice pudding to individual serving dishes. Garnish the top of each serving with a light dusting of cinnamon. You can serve the pudding warm, at room temperature, or chilled.

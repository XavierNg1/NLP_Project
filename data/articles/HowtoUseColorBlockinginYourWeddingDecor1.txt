 When you’re choosing the colors to use in your color blocked wedding, consider what season you’re getting married in. This will give you a good place to start for selecting colors.


Winter weddings tend to use whites, blues, purples, and sometimes a pop or two of red.
Spring wedding color schemes usually use pastel colors – pinks, purples, yellows, oranges, blues, and greens.
Summer weddings usually utilize bright, vivid colors. There are a lot of options here – reds, oranges, yellows, bright pinks, purple, and turquoise are all common summer wedding colors.
Fall wedding color options include reds, yellows, oranges, and browns.;
, Once you know which seasonal colors you like, decide if you want a contrasting or complementary color scheme. Contrasting colors are those those found next to each other the color wheel and can include different shades of the same color. Complementary colors can be found opposite each other on the color wheel.


For example, purple and yellow, and pink and green are complementary colors because they are opposites on the color wheel.
Contrasting colors include red and orange, and purple and blue. They also include shades of the same color, like burgundy, bright red, and pink.
 Once you’ve got an idea of which sorts of colors you might use for color blocking, you’ll need to narrow it down. Three to four colors will give you plenty of variety without overwhelming your guests.


For example, if you're leaning towards a summer color theme using complementary colors, you could choose orange, blue, purple, and yellow.
If you're selecting a spring theme with contrasting colors, you could use purple and pink (which are next to each other the color wheel), but use a couple of different shades of each color.
 Once you’ve selected your colors, you can use them in your invitations. This gives your guests a hint as to your wedding theme, and can also help you work out your design before you tackle things like ceremony and reception décor.

 You can have clip-in highlights put in at a salon, or you can do them on your own. Either way, you need to make sure you choose the right color for your extensions. You can match your extensions with the hair color you already have, or you can dye your hair to match the extensions you desire., Look for hair extensions that will give you the length you desire. The extensions should not be shorter than your current length. It is better to go with a shorter length of extensions at first. Extensions that are too long can be a heavy weight for your neck muscles if you’re not used to wearing them.16” extensions should come to the bra line.
20” extensions come just below the bra line.
24” extensions fall to the back pocket of your jeans.
 First, part your hair the way you normally do. Then, section your hair off from the part down to your ear. Separate the two sections with the ear in the middle. Use clips to hold the two front sections. Next, pull up most of your hair in the back. Secure it with a clip. Leave the bottom inch of hair down.This step will be taken care of by a professional if you’re having it done at a salon.

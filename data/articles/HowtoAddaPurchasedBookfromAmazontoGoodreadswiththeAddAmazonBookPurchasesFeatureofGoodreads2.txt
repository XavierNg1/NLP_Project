Be careful of the app you have selected on your Kindle Fire HDX. Goodreads also has their own separate app that can be downloaded to your device that looks almost identical but doesn't have the feature you'll need in it. If you've selected the app icon with the rounder top and bottom borders, and the letter g on it (or if on the Carousel, the icon that has the word "Goodreads" on it with rounded borders)(and not the one that has the square borders with the g on it), this integrated one is the one you'll want and is the only app on the device that has this feature.

Amazon owns Goodreads and has chosen to sign you in directly on your device when you "register" your device to your Amazon account. If you've signed into your device before and you're able to see the Carousel, you'll be all set to look for this app under the "Apps" tab on your Fire HDX device.
,, It will take a few minutes to display these books, but it should turn up as many as you've used that you haven't added to any shelves yet, but that you've purchased from your purchase history of both paperback/hardcover as well as digital (Kindle) books.


Make sure to give the device at least 5 minutes between the time of purchase on Amazon till the time the book enters this queue on the device for these two to be synchronized and you can receive this item on the list. If you are within the block of five minutes, you won't see the book be added to this queue of unadded items and must wait it out instead; be patient!

, This will add it to your shelves.

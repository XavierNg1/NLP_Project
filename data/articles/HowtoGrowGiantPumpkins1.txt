 Collect some of the soil where you intend to plant your pumpkins.Take the soil to your local agricultural or conservation agency for testing. The test will let you know exactly what nutrients are in the soil. You can then determine what needs to be added. Having the right kind of soil will create vigorous, healthy vines. You can prepare the soil in early spring when the ground begins to warm, but it is best to start preparations in fall. This will allow any amendments you add to break down and work their way into the soil.


You will need to prepare a 25 x 25 x 25 triangular area for each giant pumpkin vine to grow.
Giant pumpkins generally need 2 pounds nitrogen (N), 3 pounds phosphorous (P2O2) and 6 pounds potash (K2O) per 1,000 square feet of growing space. Your soil should fall between 6.5 and 6.8 on the pH scale.






Pumpkins need good, well-drained soil, not wet, dense soil.





;
, If your soil doesnâ€™t have the proper amount of nutrients, fertilizers can help to create the perfect environment in which to grow your pumpkins.


Even if your soil is nutrient rich, adding a granular fertilizer, composted manure, or mature garden compost will fertilize the soil while improving the structure of the soil. Incorporate this fertilizer into the soil several days before you intend to transplant your pumpkins.
 Pumpkins need a fair amount of sunshine to grow up healthy and large. Keep in mind that pumpkins are sensitive and will need shelter from any intense wind.
 Organic matters like manure will help your pumpkins grow up strong, healthy (and large!) You should use four inches of manure. Work the manure into the top few inches of soil.

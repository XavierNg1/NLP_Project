John.Smith@gmail.com is ideal. Shift away from any existing unprofessional email addresses, such as “soccerfan2938@yahoo.com.” If you don’t have an existing formal email address, create a new one with one of many free email services.
 Go to your email settings and create a default email signature with your cell phone number, home phone number if you have one, and email address. Include the URL of your public LinkedIn profile if you have one. This makes your information easily accessible to potential employers.

A good professional voicemail will be something like the following: “Hi, you have reach John Smith. Please leave your name and number, and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thanks.”

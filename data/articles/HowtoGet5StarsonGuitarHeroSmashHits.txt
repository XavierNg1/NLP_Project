 Let's take 'Smoke on the Water' for an example. The example level is Medium.;
, Although it sounds hard to cover, it is really easy on Medium, Easy, or any other level except Expert (for some people, at least).
 It doesn't matter how long your note streak is, or if your Rock Meter is too far off the green (meaning too good for the meter)!

, If you got a score of 4 stars or lower, I suggest start off on Easy (or Beginner in the later games since WT) before any other song. If you got a score of 5 stars with a spectacular note streak and you made the cut, you have had a lot of experience and you followed these instructions the right way.

 Be sure to urinate before massaging your uterus. A full bladder will press against the uterus, making it relax and bleed more extensively. Emptying your bladder will also make it easier to concentrate on the massage., Choose a comfortable spot to lie down for your massage (e.g. your bed or a yoga mat). If possible, choose a quiet room with very few distractions. Lie completely flat on your back., Hold your hand flat and use the entire length of it to press downwards on your abdomen, starting just below your navel. As you press down, rub your hand in a gentle, circular motion. Brace yourself for cramping or extra bleeding, which is likely to occur during the first few moments of the massage.If pain relievers have been approved by your physician, take ibuprofen before massaging your uterus to reduce the pain from cramping.
 Uterine massage helps the uterus return to its pre-pregnancy size, and helps to slow and stop post-natal bleeding. Continue daily uterine massages for a few weeks until the bleeding subsides. You may experience vaginal bleeding for anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks after child birth.Ideally, your uterus should feel firm, almost like a grapefruit. If your uterus feels soft and baggy, it is more likely to bleed heavily and requires further massage., To ensure that you perform post-natal uterine massage properly, ask your obstetrician, nurse, or mid-wife to demonstrate it prior to attempting it yourself. If you are concerned that the massage is not working, or that something may be wrong, contact your physician immediately. Signs of a problem could include:Severe abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Dizziness or fainting
Vaginal bleeding that gets heavier over time (instead of getting progressively lighter)

 This will make it easier to remove the bread at the end. If you don't have any cooking spray, you can use butter, coconut oil, or any other cooking oil instead.
 Place the coconut flour, ground cinnamon, and baking powder into the mug. Add a pinch of salt, then stir everything together with a fork or mini whisk. This will ensure that the spices and salt get distributed evenly throughout the batter.


Coconut flour is a great, healthy substitute for regular flour. It is full of fiber and will give the bread a light, fluffy, cake-like texture.You can also use 4 tablespoons (24 grams) of almond flour instead. This will give the bread a light, spongy, custard-like texture., Measure out the milk, and pour it into the mug. Add in some maple syrup for extra sweetness. If you don't have any maple syrup, or if you just don't like it, you can use honey or agave nectar instead.
 Peel and mash a ripe banana, and add it into the mug. Lightly beat an egg, and add in that as well. For extra crunch, add in some chopped walnuts.
 Use a fork or spoon to stir everything together. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the mug often so that everything gets evenly mixed together.
 Place the mug into the microwave. Cook it on high for 3 minutes. If you used almond flour, cook it for 3Â½ minutes instead. The mug may start to rise as it cooks, but it will deflate once you stop the microwave., Once the bread has cooled to room temperature, you can dig in with a fork or spoon. If you'd like, you can turn it out of the mug onto a plate instead, and eat it that way.

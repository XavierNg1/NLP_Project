 The default is 4, but for most people that is too low. A good range is around 5-8, but everyone's style is different, so try out each in a few games and see which one suits you the best.;
, It is common knowledge that headshots are better and are more respectable, but since it is such a small target, aim for the body until you are more advanced.
 This may seem like something that you already know, but trying to do a no-scope or a quick-scope is extremely harder than it looks. If possible, get an ADS or ACOG scope for increased zoom.
 If you really want to go for headshots, get a laser pointer and aim your pointer on the head and fire. If you are using a pointer, using a scope just slows you down as the laser is as accurate as a scope at close to medium range.
 Just as you are about to shoot someone, click the left trigger. This will make your aim steadier for a few seconds, and making it easier for you to shoot someone.
 These are a brand-name attachments in real life that are inexpensive and greatly increase your range of scoping and quickness.
 This is also another widely known method. When shooting, crouch, as this makes your aim a lot better especially when you are using a sniper or Light Machine Gun.
 Do not attempt these as it will make you look stupid when you are spinning around shooting while someone comes up and knives you. This rarely ever works and when it does it often isn't shown in a final kill cam, making it not worth the effort.

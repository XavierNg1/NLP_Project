 Some makeup companies make mattifying serums that you can apply over any lip color to get a matter lipstick look. Simply apply your lip color as usual and then apply the mattifying serum over the lip color for an instant matte look.








These products are best for regular lipsticks. They are not recommended for lip glosses, but some people have found that they do work with glosses as well.
 You can also use an oil absorbing blotting tissue to make your lipstick matte. These tissues are covered in an oil absorbing powder, so you will not need to use translucent powder if you use one of these tissues.








To get matte lips with an oil absorbing tissue, press your lips onto the blotting tissue and then remove the tissue to reveal matte lips.
 If you don’t want to use translucent powder or don’t have any on hand, then baby powder can also give you a matte lipstick look. The final result will be a long-lasting matte lipstick.








To get matte lips with baby powder, just dust a bit of baby powder over a piece of tissue paper and then shake off the excess. Then, press the tissue paper onto your lips to blot away the shine.

 Apply dry cleaning solvent to a clean cloth or paper towel, and press it against a small, hidden area of your carpeting. After several minutes, take a damp cloth and blot out the solvent. Allow test area to dry, and make sure the solvent did not leave a stain or remove dye from the carpeting.
 Using a cloth or paper towels, press the solvent into the stained carpeting, moving from the outer edges to the middle of the stain. Press hard enough for the solvent to penetrate deep into the carpet fibers. , Then allow the stain area to dry. Try using a fan or dehumidifier in the room to speed the drying process.
 If traces are found, repeat the process described above. You may need to clean the area multiple times before the stain disappears completely. This is normal with oil stains because the oil may seep up through the carpet fibers after the initial cleaning.

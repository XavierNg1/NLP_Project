 Soften the leather by giving it a light coating of water. Use a spray bottle, rag, or toothbrush to spread an even amount of water over it. The leather should be damp but not soaked., Get a cleanser such as Comet or Ajax used on tough household stains. The powdered variety with bleach works best. This substance is mild enough to not ruin the leather. Donâ€™t be afraid to add a lot of the cleanser to the leather. Cover the area you wish to weather.Never use pure bleach on leather.
 Use a wire brush to work the cleanser into the leather. The wire will begin the weathering process and help the cleanser to continue it. Other abrasive objects can be used instead. Remember that more abrasive surfaces, such as sandpaper, can weather the leather too much., The cleanser will have turned into a paste after scrubbing. Allow a layer of this paste to rest on the leather for at least an hour. Afterwards, wipe off the cleanser with a damp cloth.

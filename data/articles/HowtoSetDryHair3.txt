 Work a small amount of styling mousse through your hair before styling your hair to keep body and volume throughout the day. Mousse works similarly to gel except helps set your hair while also allowing the hair to move freely.
 Hair lotion should be applied to your hair while it is still damp. Add hair lotion after a shower to ensure that your dry hair sets. Many hair lotions require you to sprinkle it directly on your hair rather than working it through your hair with your fingers., Once you have styled your hair, applying hairspray can help the hairstyle last all day. Hold the can of hairspray at least 12 inches from your head to prevent the individual hairs from sticking together. Spray the hairspray under the strands and near your roots to give your hair extra volume.

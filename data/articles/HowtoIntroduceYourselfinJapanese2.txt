 You can use the "Watashi wa ___ desu" form to share other qualities, like age, nationality, or profession. "Watashi wa Amerikajin desu," (wah-TAH-shee wah a-mer-i-cah-shin dress) means "I am American." "Watashi wa juugosai desu," (wah-TAH-shee wah ju-u-go-sigh dress) means "I am fifteen years old."

, The Japanese equivalent of "How are you?" is "Ogenki desu ka?" (oh-GEN-kee dess kah). However, this is an actual inquiry into the person's health. If you'd rather avoid a response, say "Otenki wa ii desu ne?" (oh-TEN-kee wah EE dess neh), which means "The weather's nice, isn't it?"

, If you said "Ogenki desu ka," be ready to respond to their reply. When you ask this question, the person will most likely respond either "Genki desu," (GEN-kee dess) or "Maamaa desu" (MAH-MAH dess). The former means "I'm fine," and the latter means "I'm so-so." Either way: they will then ask you "Anata wa?" (ah-NAH-tah wah), which means "And you?" When they say this, you can respond "Genki desu, arigatou," (GEN-kee dess, ah-ree-GAH-to), which means "I'm fine, thank you."


You could also replace "arigatou" with "okagesama de" (oh-KAH-geh-sah-mah deh) which means basically the same thing.
 If there's ever a time when you don't know what to say (or don't know what the person just said) don't be afraid to apologize and say so. You can do this in English, if you must, and use apologetic body language, but it wouldn't hurt to learn how to say sorry in Japanese. If need be, say "gomen nasai"（ごめんなさい）(goh-mehn nah-SAH-ee), which means "I'm sorry."

 When taking photos of moving animals you want to clearly freeze the animal in mid-motion. This can be done by putting your camera in shutter priority mode. You should set the shutter speed somewhere around 1/250 or 1/500 and then adjust depending on how fast the animal is moving.
 Continuous auto-focus will keep your camera in focus as the animal moves closer or farther away. This will allow you to create sharp images even while the animal is moving., This includes two main techniques. Blurring the subject with the background in focus and blurring the background with the subject in focus.Blurring the subject while keeping the background in focus requires you to use a slower shutter speed and steadying your camera on a tripod. This will emphasize the movement of your animal, through the use of blurring.
Blurring the background while focusing on the subject also requires you to use a slow shutter speed, but instead of using a tripod you pan your camera along with the movement of the animal.
Panning involves following your subject with your camera, matching the speed and direction of the subject.
 Shooting a sequence of quick shots while the animal is moving, will capture the animal in different stages of movement. For example, taking a series of shots while your dog is jumping to catch a ball, will allow you to capture the take off, catch, and landing in separate shots.This is sometimes called continuous shooting or continuous drive mode.
For optimal results, you should use a tripod with this option.

 Wooden crates with cracks or holes on their smallest sides are best for this project. Pass a rope through the crate’s small sides, so that it rests against the top of the crate. Install a hook on your wall and hang the crate onto it.

If the crate you’re using doesn’t have holes, you can drill them into the sides.;
, This project doesn’t require much work. Simply find three wooden crates and stack them next to your bed. They don’t have to be stacked perfectly, in fact offsetting them a bit will give the nightstand a better look.

You can stain or paint the wooden crates to better fit with your decor. Make sure to do so before stacking the crates or placing them in the bedroom., Not only will this upgrade the look of your office, it also allows you to build a desk fitting your height. All you’ll need are a few crates and a board, ideally made of plywood. Stack crates up to your desired height at either end. Use nails or screws to secure each stack of crates together, then place your plywood board atop them.You can use mending plates to secure the crates together if you’re worried about the wood splitting.
 Some crates will work better as planters than others. You need to ensure there’s proper drainage so water can flow through, but soil won’t fall out. If the bottom of your crate is completely solid, you can drill holes in it, then cover the bottom with a piece of burlap. This will let water go through, but keep the soil in the crate., This project doesn’t require much work beyond decoration. You may want to start with staining the crates or giving them a coat of paint. Depending on the party, you might then use stencils or other paints to decorate the crates. For instance, if the crates are used for a wedding, stenciling or painting on the names of the bride and groom is a must.Make sure to wash the crate with soapy water if it’s going to come into contact with food.

 All you need is amaretto, bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a beaten egg white. Shake for at least 15 seconds to fully combine the ingredients., This will cool off the ingredients after you've already thoroughly combined them.
 The drink is best enjoyed in an old fashioned glass. For an extra touch, you can cover the rim of the glass in lemon juice and then dip it in sugar to line the glass with sweetness.
 You can garnish this amaretto sour with a lemon peel or maraschino cherries.

 Oyster shells are sharp, and you'll definitely cut yourself if you aren't wearing a pair of tough rubber or canvas gloves when you're shucking them. Don't forego this simple safety measure.
 Use the stiff-bristled brush to scrub the ocean grit from the oysters.


Rinse the scrubbed oysters in cool running water.
As you handle each one, make doubly sure the oysters are alive and fresh.
 The curved side of the oyster should be against the palm of your hand. The point, or hinge, should be facing toward you.
 Point it down into the cup of the oyster. Use a twisting motion to separate the top and bottom shells. You should feel the hinge pop when you twist the knife.
 Work the blade as close to the top of the shell as possible, and run it from the hinge around to the other side of the oyster. Continue using a twisting motion to separate the top and bottom shells.


The shell will be very tightly closed, so be careful not to let the knife slip as you do this.
Do your best not to break the shell into pieces. A few stray bits may get inside, but the shell should stay mostly intact.
Don't tip the shell from side to side or turn it over, or the delicious juices inside will pour out.
 When the top and bottom shells are separated, open the oyster, taking care to hold it level. Run the knife along the top shell to separate any remaining meat.


Check the oyster for shells or grit.
If you wish, carefully separate the oyster meat from the bottom shell, so you or your guest won't have to do so before eating the oyster. Place it back in the bottom shell before serving.
 Place shucked oysters on a bed of ice, still swimming in their juices.

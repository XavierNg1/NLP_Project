 First, cut the side and shoulder seams and split the shirt into four pieces: the front, back, and two sleeves. Then cut off the hem of the shirt. Next, cut four 1.5" wide strips from the bottom of the front section only., Working with the front section of the tee, cut the bottom line of the bikini top by cutting straight across the panel, about 1.5-2" below the armpit. Then, cut the neck and shoulder straps how you want them to look,being sure to leave that ~2" of material below the armpit.
 Working with the back panel. Use an old string bikini or cut up an old pair of underwear to make a pattern and cut it out from the panel.
 Cut side strips for the bottom by cutting panels from the sleeves that are as wide as the sides you cut for your bottom piece.
 Sew together the side strips that you cut for the back piece. Then, attach the long strips that you cut from the front panel to the sides and at the neck of the teekini top you made.
 You're done! Tie on your new string teekini and enjoy the sun!

 On the day you decide to ask out your crush, spend some extra time getting ready in the morning. Knowing that you look your absolute best will help give you the confidence you need to ask out your crush.


Wear an outfit that you know you look good in, but that still is comfortable.
If you're a girl, spend time doing your hair and your makeup. Aim for a look that will last all day rather than one that needs readjusting.
If you're a guy, comb your hair and make sure to wear clothes that look good on you.
 Asking out your crush is definitely a special occasion, but don’t dress in a way that is too formal or over-the-top for school. Aim to be casual and cute, rather than dressing for the red carpet!Also try not to wear clothes that are tighter or more revealing that what your normally wear!

, Think about how you want to approach your crush and when in the day it would be best to talk to him. If you have a general plan, you’re less likely to get flustered or sidetracked when you see him.


You don’t need to have an exact plan of the conversation that you’ll have with him, since conversations are fluid and you can’t plan for everything! Just know where you’re planning to talk to him and how you’re going to ask him to hang out.
 Before you approach your crush, spend a minute pumping yourself up. Think about everything about yourself that makes you proud and that distinguishes you from the other people at school.


Try to visualize yourself confidently going up to your crush and asking him out. Even simple visualization is a powerful tool that can give you courage!Remember that the worst thing that can happen is that he'll say no, and that everyone gets rejected somewhere along the line.

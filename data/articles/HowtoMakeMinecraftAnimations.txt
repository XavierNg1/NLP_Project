 A good starting point is blender, which you can get at blender.org. If you have money and you're serious in doing this, there are 3 more software to use! You can use 3ds Max, Maya, or Cinema 4D.;
, All you have to do is search 'Minecraft Rig' and you'll find plenty of them. But some of them are software-specific. Find blender rigs for blender, or maya rigs for maya.
 For blender, look for a red dot and a pair of keys next to it. Once finding it, you can move the character and animate. For cinema 4D, Look for 2 arrows in a circle next to a question mark. Move the characters and frames to animate!

, This step is for Blender Only; other software users should look at other sources. You should see Output. Have the output be PNG. Create a new folder to put the pictures in. Then, render the animation.
 Then go to "Add>Image". Select the images and insert them into the editor. Have the green line go where you want your animation to end.
 I would prefer Quicktime for mac user, but for windows users, you can choose what you want. Then render the animation again. This will go faster and go through each photo.
 You've finished making your animation! Now, edit it and everything, and show the world it on YouTube!

 You cannot mine diamond with other implements, which means that you have to build an iron or diamond pickaxe first. If you already have an iron or diamond pickaxe and want tips on finding diamond, skip to the next section.;
, Crafting tables are made by placing a block of wood in your crafting area, producing 4 wooden planks. These 4 wooden planks are then put in the crafting area again, yielding a crafting table.
 In your crafting table, put:


3 wooden planks in a horizontal line across the top 1/3 of the grid
2 sticks in a vertical line down the middle of the grid

, With your wooden pickaxe, dig four blocks down into the earth until you find smooth stone. Mine only 3 stone while making sure that you still have 2 sticks left over. In your crafting table, put:


3 cobblestones in a horizontal line across the top 1/3 of the grid
2 sticks in a vertical line down the middle of the grid

, For your next step, you'll need a furnace. Furnaces can be found in NPC villages, or made using 8 cobblestones, lined around the outside edges of your crafting table.
 With your stone pickaxe, start searching for iron ore. Iron ore can be found above ground and in caves. You only need to mine 3 iron ore.


In your furnace, smelt together iron ore and coal to create iron ingot. Alternately, craft a block of iron into 9 iron ingots.

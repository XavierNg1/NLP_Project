 The first signs of moderately low potassium can be muscle aches, cramps and abnormal weakness ((including respiratory and gastrointestinal muscle weakness if severe).Low potassium levels wonâ€™t allow neuromuscular cells to recharge quickly, which prevents them from firing repeatedly, meaning that muscles have difficulty in contracting.


Faintness, muscle spasms, and muscle tingling or numbness can indicate worsening potassium deficiency and should be checked by a physician right away.;
, Extended or severe low potassium can affect the heart. Low potassium levels can cause change in its proper function. This can include irregular heartbeats, such as dangerous arrhythmia in severe cases. Prolonged low potassium can cause structural and functional changes in the kidney.
 If you are experiencing diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, constipation, or weakness, then you may need to have your potassium levels tested. This test involves having blood drawn and getting a basic metabolic panel of tests (BMP)including ones for electrolytes (which include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen carbonate).


Depending upon your situation, your doctor may alternatively want you to have a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP),which adds liver function tests to the basic panel.

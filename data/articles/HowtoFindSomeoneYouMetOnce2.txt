 If you met in a particular restaurant, park, or coffee shop, or public transportation, there is a chance the person you're looking for visits there regularly. Make this location a part of your usual schedule, and you might have a chance of running into him or her again.


Try to visit the location around the same time you first met. If this is part of the person's normal routine, then he or she probably visits about the same time.
 If the person if a regular at this particular location, it's possible that the staff might know who they are. Ask around and see if anyone there knows the person you met. If one of them does, then ask if you can get the person's contact information. Some people might not be willing to hand out contact information, however, so in this case just ask if the worker could pass your contact information on to the person you're looking for.
 Daily and weekly newspapers in a city often have sections for personal ads where people can post exactly this kind of information. If the person you want to find sees the ad, then he or she will have an easy way to contact you.Like with posting ads on the internet, try to post in as many newspapers as possible. You don't know which newspapers he or she reads regularly, so posting several ads will increase your chances.

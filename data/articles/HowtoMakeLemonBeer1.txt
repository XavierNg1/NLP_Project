 There is a reason why many styles of mild wheat beer, such as German Hefeweizens and Belgian Wits, are served with a lemon wedge in the glass. The bright, lively citrus notes pair excellently with the smooth, earthy flavor of wheat beer.;
, Lemon also pairs excellently with light lager-style beers like Pilsner and pale American lagers. In fact, a popular summer cocktail called a shandy takes advantage of this very pairing by combining pale lager beer and lemonade.
 While this combination is not as popular, you may also find that lemon works well with rich, flavorful beers like stout, porter, and IPA. Lemon could provide an energetic lift to the heavy chocolate notes of a stout, while lemon might also blend harmoniously with the grapefruit notes of a hoppy IPA.

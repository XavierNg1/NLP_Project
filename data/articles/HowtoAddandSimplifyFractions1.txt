 A denominator is the number below the fraction bar.If the fractions do not have the same denominator, you cannot use this method.

For example, if you are calculating 24+14{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {1}{4}}}, you can note that both fractions have the same denominator: 4.
;
, A numerator is the number above the fraction bar. Add numerators the same way you would add integers.For example, the numerators of 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} and 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} are 2 and 1, so you would calculate 2+1=3{\displaystyle 2+1=3}. So, 3 is the numerator of your sum.
 Since both fractions you are adding have the same denominator, the denominator of their sum will also be the same.For example, the sum of 24+14{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {1}{4}}} will have a denominator of 4: 24+14=34{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {1}{4}}={\frac {3}{4}}}.

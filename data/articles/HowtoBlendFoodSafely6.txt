 There are several important aspects to proper storage of the blender appliance:

Unplug the blender when it is not in use.There is no need to leave a blender permanently plugged into the electrical switch.
Keep the blender clean. If it is not kept clean, food can mold, grow bacteria or the blades can grow rusty. If bacteria, mold or rust are transferred to your food, this isn't particularly safe or healthy. Always clean after each use, using warm water and gentle dish soap. Never wet the engine part (base) of the blender; do not immerse this part in water.Keep the blender in a safe place. Position it so that the blender cannot be knocked off a bench or shelf. Separate the blender parts if this proves to be sturdier and safer.

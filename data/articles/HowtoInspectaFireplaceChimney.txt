 Brush the sides and bottom with a stiff broom or chimney brush. Vacuum out the loosened ashes and if possible remove the andirons.;
, Lay on your back and slide into the box as far as you need to so that you can shine a flashlight up the flue. You are looking for cracks in masonry, or burn out holes in a metal "insert" type box, as well as the condition of the damper.
 You may want to wear safety glasses here, as the damper may be coated with creosote and ash buildup, which can drop in your eyes. When you are finished checking the damper, be sure it is in the closed position.
 Close the screen and glass doors if so equipped.
 If it has a rain cover or bird screen, you will need to remove this. Before removing it, be sure to have flashing material on hand to seal it back when you reattach it after you finish.
, Unless you buy or rent a chimney brush, you probably will not be able to completely clean the inside of the chimney, but should be able to dislodge enough of the buildup to let it operate safely.
 Most chimneys have a smoke shelf and damper door which prevent this material from dropping all the way to the fire box floor. After cleaning, use the flashlight to examine the flue for cracks and gaps. Most chimneys are constructed with either a metal pipe flue or a clay chimney liner that comes in 2 foot (0.6Â m) sections. If you are satisfied there are no visible cracks, replace the chimney cap if it is so equipped, using the sealant for the flashing removed earlier.
 There will be a flashing here to waterproof the roof system, and often it will become corroded or collect debris which can cause roof leaks, and now is a good time to take a look.
 Remove the drop cloth or protective barrier you installed to prevent the soot and ash brushed from the upper flue from being scattered in your room. You should be ready to replace your andirons and build a pleasant warm fire to enjoy.

 Having diabetes can do a lot of damage to your kidneys; high levels of blood sugar can make the kidneys overwork and filter too much blood. Overtime, overworked kidneys can lose their ability to function properly, resulting in kidney failure., To check your daily blood glucose, you can use a glucose monitor that you can purchase at your local pharmacy. Record each day’s reading. A normal fasting glucose level is generally less than 110 mg/dl. ‘Fasting glucose’ means that the recording is taken before you eat breakfast so your stomach is empty., If you have diabetes, your doctor will have prescribed you with a medication that you can take daily. The medication will either be taken orally or is a shot of insulin. Regardless of the type of medication, make sure that you follow your doctor’s prescription.
 When you have diabetes, you should try to control any spurts of blood sugar levels. This is because these spurts can damage your kidneys, since your body’s insulin is not able to control sudden spurts of blood sugar level. This means trying to avoid very sugary foods as much as possible. You should avoid:


Granulated sugars and other sweeteners.
Soft drinks (sodas) and candy.
Dried fruits.
Cookies, cakes, and other baked goods.

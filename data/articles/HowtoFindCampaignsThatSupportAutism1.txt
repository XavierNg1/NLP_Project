 Some of the most famous autism groups, such as Autism Speaks, do not actually have autistic people's best interests in mind.A search engine may be able to find you some groups that autistic people support, but it will also find many that they say are harmful. Don't assume that a group supports autistic people just because it's up high in search results, or has a nice-looking homepage.


Also be careful of fundraisers for autism. Just because your favorite rock star—even if she's autistic or has an autistic child—supports a particular autism charity doesn't mean it's really helping autistics.;
, Writers such as Cynthia Kim, Ariane and Emma Zurcher, Amy Sequenzia, and others will share links to organizations that they find supportive.
 Try using the #AskAnAutistic hashtag to ask which campaigns and groups are most helpful. This way, individual autistic people can share their experiences and give you starting points.
 If you find one good group, check to see if it has partnered with other autism organizations, or what other projects its leaders are involved in.
 They may bring up things like Autism Acceptance Month and Autistic Pride Day, and mention groups that are hosting positive events.


Sometimes they may discuss harmful events, like Autism Awareness Month.

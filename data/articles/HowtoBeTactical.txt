 For short-medium distance buy a semi-automatic carbine. Train with this gun as much as possible and become efficient, fast, and accurate with it.;
, A sidearm can be your lifeline in a tight situation .
 You will need at least 6 magazines for your primary, and at least 4-5 for your secondary.
 A vest should contain multiple magazine holsters for your rifle and your sidearm. This will allow for rapid reloading and easier transportation of magazines.
 Practice multiple target engagements, rapid reloading, shooting on the move, transitioning to your sidearm and various other situations. Have a buddy come and train with you so you can both critique each other into becoming better shooters.
 Train shooting prone, kneeling, standing, and behind cover.
 There's no "I" in team, and there's no victory in being alone. You will want to bring some buddies along and train together, practice suppressive fire, leapfrogging, concentrating fire and communicating.
 To be truly effective, you need to know how to properly attack or defend yourself on a large scale. Military manuals are great, as is the classic "Art of war" by Sun Tzu.
 There are many instructional videos/manuals on proper room clearing. But most of it consists of sector control. Sector control is assigning a sector to each member in your team, and that is their responsibility to clear and watch. This is important if your team is on foot and on the move, to keep an eye out for threats, when a team member sees a threat they will yell "Contact!" and return fire. While the whole team should return fire, they should always be watching their own sectors to prevent being flanked.
 You have to train to push your failures. A true expert pushes himself/herself to failure, so they can fix the things they aren't good at, therefore constantly getting better.
 The quicker you finish the fight and neutralize any hostiles, the less you will get shot.

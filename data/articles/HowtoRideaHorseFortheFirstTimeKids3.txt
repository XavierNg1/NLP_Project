 Take both of your feet out of the stirrups, hold the reins in one hand, and swing off onto the left side of your horse. Put the reins over your horse’s head so that you’re holding them again, and roll up your stirrups and loosen your girth., When you untack your horse, you should first take off all the horse’s tack and put it to the side. Then, repeat the same grooming steps that you completed while you were tacking up your horse. If your horse is sweaty, you might need to rinse it off with a hose in an outdoor “wash stall.” You could also sponge off its back with a large wet sponge.


However, since it is your first time riding, you should listen to what your instructor says. Different barns have different rules for taking care of their horses, so don’t be afraid to ask questions.
 Cleaning your horse’s tack is really important, especially if you’re sharing tack with other students or borrowing someone else’s tack. Put your saddle on a saddle rack, and hang your bridle up somewhere where you can easily clean it.


Find some saddle soap, a sponge, and a bucket of water.
Rub the sponge on the saddle soap. Dip it into a little bit of water (less is more). Squeeze the sponge to rid it of excess water.
Clean the leather parts of the saddle and bridle with the sponge. You should get all the dust and dirt off of your tack.
Clean your horse’s bit (the part that goes in his mouth) with water. Scrub it with a wet toothbrush to clean off all the grass and debris that was in your horse’s mouth.
 Give your horse a carrot, an apple, or a horse treat. Make sure to give it to the horse with your palm flat so that it doesn’t nibble your fingers by mistake. Pet him again, especially if you had a good ride!


Your instructor will help you lead your horse either back to its stall or to the pasture where it lives.

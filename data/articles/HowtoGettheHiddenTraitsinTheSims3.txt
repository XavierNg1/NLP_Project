 You can either choose between a pyromaniac and immunity to fire. A pyromaniac can set fire to anything they wish, as well as fruit (flame fruit can be made and is edible). The "immunity to fire" trait makes them "invisible" to fire, as they can't be burnt to death.;
, Like the "Neat" trait that older Sims have, children will clean up any messes they make, as well as any messes they see around the house.
 From a parent burglar, this will make them sneak wherever they want to.


Get the opposite by having a child of a police officer. Your Sim child can arrest burglars and have fun with it.
 Adult Sims can also unlock this action by being in the military career.
 From a parent that delivers pizza, the child's hunger level can be well taken care of.

 You aren't quite ready to make your blended lemonade yet, but the pitcher will make it easier transfer everything later on.


This recipe makes an icy, frozen lemonade, similar to a slushy. It won't be smooth like a milkshake or smoothie.
 Stir it occasionally.This will help the sugar melt, and the flavors to infuse into one another.
 You will need 2 to 3 cups (475 to 700 grams) grams of ice. The more ice you add, the thicker your lemonade will be.
 Now and then, pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to scrape the mixture down the sides. This will help everything mix in more evenly. The ice should be all broken up by the time you are done.
 You can serve it as is, or you can garnish it with some mint leaves or lemon zest.

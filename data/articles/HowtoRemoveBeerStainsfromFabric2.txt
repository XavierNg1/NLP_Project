 The first order of business is getting out as much beer out of the upholstery as possible. Getting the beer out will help lessen the stain. Use clean, white paper towels to blot the area, as colorful paper towels could stain the upholstery with dye.While you're blotting, make sure you've found all the stain. Look for other spots on the upholstery beyond the main spill, as beer has a tendency to splash everywhere.
 You'll need a basic cleaning solution to clear up the stain. You can make one from items you have at home, and you have more than one option when deciding what you want to use.The first solution uses rubbing alcohol and white vinegar. Measure out 2/3 a cup of rubbing alcohol. Add a tablespoon of white vinegar to it, and mix it together.
The second solution uses dishwashing detergent and water. In 2 cups of cool water, add a tablespoon of dishwashing detergent. Stir it together.
Either solution will work, so just choose one based on what you have on hand. You may want to test the solution in a discreet area to make sure it doesn't discolor the fabric, as different fabrics may react differently to the solutions.
 Dip a clean cloth into the solution. A white cloth is best so it doesn't stain the upholstery. Apply the cloth to the upholstery. Press it in to help absorb the beer from the upholstery., Continue to reapply apply the solution to the stain. As you do, the stain should begin to lift. You may need to repeat the process 3 or 4 times before you absorb all the beer from the upholstery. Make sure the stain is completely gone before moving on to the next step., Using a new clean cloth, apply cool water to the area. Blot a few times to make sure all the cleaning solution is gone. Once it is, use a dry, clean cloth to blot the area until it's mostly dry.

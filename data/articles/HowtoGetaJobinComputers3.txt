 Sit down in front of the computer and just play and experiment. This is a great way to learn new programs, but isn't the best way to learn how to configure an operating system or write programs. At the very least, you'll become comfortable with computers by doing this.
 You probably know someone who knows more about computers than you do. Learn from them. Once their knowledge is used up, find someone even more knowledgeable to learn from. Soon, you'll be the expert and people will start coming to you!

, There are websites that teach you just about anything to do with computers, from basics all the way through advanced programming. If you Google any specific problem you have, you are sure to find an answer. If you want to find random computer tips, just Google "computer tips" or other phrases like that. Many websites have random tips that help you learn more about computers as well.
 Some companies that offer software (Red Hat, Sun, Microsoft, Oracle and many others) may offer paid official exams. Since they do not teach you and just test your existing knowledge, this is frequently very cheap in comparison to paid courses. This is a great way to prove you understand technologies that a company may be looking for.
 If you already have a computer-related job (but want a better one), find someone at work you can learn from or take on new projects where you can learn as you go along. It will be hard at first, but your skills will improve and you'll become eligible for promotions or for better jobs at other companies.
 This is the most obvious approach, yet many in the industry have had long careers in computing without any formal training. Still, not all computer skills are easy to teach yourself, and as more students graduate with degrees in computer science, the competition will make it harder for the self-trained to land good jobs. A degree, certificate course, or specialized certification such as an MCSE will greatly improve your odds.

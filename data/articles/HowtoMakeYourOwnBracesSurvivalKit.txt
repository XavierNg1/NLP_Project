 Any container such asÂ a pencil box, Tupperware container, or any other container that snaps shut and fits in your backpack or purse will work just fine.;
, This is the best place to buy your supplies.
 Your orthodontist may have provided you with most of these things when you had your braces put on (some items you may already have at home).


A tube of toothpaste (preferably a travel size)
A toothbrush (preferably one that has a cap)
An anesthetic brace relief (orajel works too)
A GUM proxabrush
A teether (for pain relief)
Floss
Wax and/or Gishy Goo
Chapstick.
 Squeeze a small amount of hand sanitizer onto a tissue and wipe the inside of the container. If the container is already clean, skip this step.
, Put your braces survival kit somewhere you will have it during the day, such as in your bag or in a locker. This way you will have it handy at school or work!

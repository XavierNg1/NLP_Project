 These are sturdy objects made from plastic, metal, concrete or wood, intended to prevent the sand and paving stones from drifting out of the prepared area. Lay these out along the edge of the sand bed, pressing them down.


If the soil is poor or the paving stones will receive heavy traffic, consider pouring concrete edges instead.
 Place the stones on the sand gently, with a narrow gap in between them. Do not press or tamp them into the sand, and take care not to walk over the sand during installation.


A few basic patterns were described in the planning section above.
 If any paving stones need cutting, use a masonry saw or splitter. Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from chips. If you cannot access these tools, a heavy hammer and masonry chisel can be used to create rough splits.
 Make several passes over the paving stones with a plate compactor to press them into the sand bed. Repeat until the stones are level and flat., Pour sand over the paving stones and sweep it into the cracks until a level, stable surface is created.


For a more solid, weed-resistant filler, use polymeric sand instead, then water it gently with a hose to activate the binding.
 Sweep any excess sand and dirt off the area. Apply a paver sealer to the joints to extend the life of your pavers and increase their overall durability.

 Prior to storing them, you need to first wash them. Day to day, coats are exposed to germs, oils, food stains, and other messy substances, and you wouldn’t want any of these to discolor the fabric or attract bugs while they’re in storage. Check your coats’ tags for washing instructions.Puffy coats, fleeces, and many other types of jackets and coats can be machine washed, but wool, cashmere, leather and other natural materials require dry cleaning and other special storage care.
Machine washable coats can also typically be dried in your dryer. Use a low setting and clean tennis balls to help keep their form.;
, Double check all pockets for gum, papers, money, and so on before and after you wash them. Fasten all zippers, buttons, and snaps. Buttoning everything up will help the fabric keep its form while it’s in storage., If you and your family have lots of coats with varying materials, you should organize coats into separate categories in order to store each material properly. Use the biggest bed in the house, or another broad surface, to make different piles for wool or cashmere coats, puffy down coats, leather, denim, and so on.Keep them separated by family member as well for best organization.
The less you have to store, the easier it is. Now’s your chance to trim your wardrobe by donating winter coats and clothes you don’t often wear.

 You probably wouldnâ€™t tell a story that deals with delicate topics at a job interview. Likewise, your friends might find a story about your professional accolades boring and self-congratulatory. Keep your audience in mind and tell them a story that appeals to their interests.Save stories about wild nights, sensitive political or social topics, and other potentially inappropriate content for good friends. At work or with people you don't know well, keep your stories PG, or as least likely to offend someone as possible.
For example, you could tell a new coworker about the time the software went down at the worst possible moment and, despite the chaos that ensued, somehow it seems hysterical in retrospect.
 Maintaining comfortable eye contact will help you come off as authentic and believable. However, you should find the right balance. Look at someone for a few seconds, then make eye contact with the next person.Glancing between people or shifting your eyes too much can seem untrustworthy.
Looking away and not making any eye contact is also suspicious.
Holding eye contact with one person for too long can make them uncomfortable.
 While you should rehearse your story, try not to deliver your story as if you were reading off a script. Practice your speech, but make your deliver seem off the cuff instead of stale. Instead of trying to be perfect, give yourself some room to improvise., When you speak as a character in your story, use a different voice to make it clear the character is speaking and not the narrator. At tense or serious points, try lowering your volume and slowing your delivery to put your listeners on the edges of their seats. Quicken your pace and increase your volume to communicate action and energy.

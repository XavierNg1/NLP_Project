 If you can't find the case that your Redbox movie came in, don't worry — you can still return your movie. Handling the disc carefully, bring it back to any Redbox kiosk. Scroll through the list of DVDs and select "replacement case" at the end. You'll be asked to provide payment information. After paying, an empty case will be dispensed from the machine and you'll be able to return your disc as normal.


Replacement cases are usually quite cheap — usually as low as $1.20.
 In the rare occasion that the disc you rented won't play properly, first, try cleaning it gently with a soft cloth and, if desired, water or rubbing alcohol. Rub in a straight line from the center of the CD to the edge. Never use abrasives or harsh solvents — these can damage the disc.If it still won't work, it may be seriously damaged. Report damaged discs via the Redbox website. You may be eligible for a refund., Once you've reserved a title via the online holding service, unfortunately, your order can't be canceled. This means that if you can't pickup the disc before 9:00 PM the day after you reserve it, you'll be automatically charged the one-day rental period fee.


This is necessary because the disc is unavailable to other customers while it's reserved by you. Since others can't rent it, Redbox loses out on the money it might potentially have made from renting it to them.
 If, for any reason, the Redbox machine you visit won't allow you to rent movies, don't worry — help is available. Call the Redbox support helpline at 1.866.REDBOX3 (1.866.733.2693) to speak to a customer service representative. The helpline is open seven days a week from 6:00 AM to 3:00 AM CT.Note that if you're vision impaired, you can also call this helpline for audio assistance choosing your movies.

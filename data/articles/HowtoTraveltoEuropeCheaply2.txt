 If you pack light, you can save lots of money. If you pack carry-on only, you won't have to pay luggage fees on flights. Also, you'll be able to walk for distances instead of calling a cab as you won't have to drag so much along with you.
 There's no reason to bring a large supply of toiletries or food with you.
 Rolling it tight in your luggage will save even more space.
 There are many solid alternatives for common liquids, such as shampoo bars, lotion bars, even perfume sticks. Using these instead of liquid alternatives will make your carry-on more TSA-friendly.
 Make sure it is within the size limits of international carry-on luggage.
 If you're traveling for an extended period of time, only bring a few changes of clothes plus some concentrated powder detergent.

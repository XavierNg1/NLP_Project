 If the gift has their own computer that they use, then go to that computer. Make sure you do this when they aren’t home, or are busy with other things so they won’t notice what you are doing.


Remember to open all the browsers installed on the computer, unless you already know what browser they use. For example, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.
 Although the instructions will vary based on which browser you are in, you will probably need to go to the “settings” or “preferences” tab in the browser.


In Google Chrome, for example, if you go to settings, a new browsing tab will open. On this browser page, you will find the “history” section.
 Again, this will vary depending upon your specific browser, but you will usually see a setting called history. If you click on this, it will show you a list of the websites that have been visited using that browser.
 Once you have found the history page, look through all the websites listed carefully. If you made a list of things you want, you should look for websites that might sell what you asked for.


Remember though, that just because you don’t see anything that looks like it could be your gift doesn’t mean they didn’t get you something online. They may have just deleted the browser history. It is possible to delete a specific website without clearing everything.
Understand that it is unlikely that you will be able to figure out whether they actually bought the gift for you or not using this method. However, it may be able to clue you in on what they have been considering getting you.
 If you have access to their email, you can look through to see if they received any emails that confirm their purchase. If you find any, then you will know exactly what you’re getting.


However, be careful doing this! This is a big violation of privacy, and they may feel very hurt if they find out what you've been doing.

 For this project, you will need:

Your hand-made yarn based work
A tub or a bowl of lukewarm water
A small mat or a blocking mat (found in hobby stores)
Thumbtacks or pins.;
, Make sure the water is room temperature, as cold water and hot water can ruin your hard work and cause your work to stiffen or shrink.,

Blocking mats are more expensive than normal mats. You can place your work on a soft mat, such as a yoga mat. It doesn't make any difference.
 Apply the pins all over your work, until you are satisfied with how it looks. However, be sure to apply the pins straight, because once you block your work, you can't undo anything.

If you are blocking a scarf, using the pins, you can take the edges of the scarf to uncurl them and pin them on so they stretch.
You can get as carried away as you want––apply as many pins as you like. However, make sure you like how your work looks before letting it dry. Once you block it, you can't undo anything.
 Let it dry in a nice place, away from direct sun and too much heat. Once dried, your work is now water-blocked.

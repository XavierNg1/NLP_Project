 You might feel like you are too old to go, but if you throw on a cool costume and wear a mask, your neighbors will never know! You’re never too old for free candy.


If you have a younger sibling or a neighbor who is younger, you could even volunteer to take them trick-or-treating and be their chaperone. That way, you will have a younger kid with you when you go.
 Do a quick internet or library search to find out what places near you have a haunted history, and check them out with your friends on Halloween.


Many cities have historical landmarks that are run as museums, many with haunted histories. Check your community calendar to see if there are any haunted tours of these locations on Halloween.
Make sure you have permission to enter any place you choose to go explore. Don’t trespass!

, Decorate just like you would for a big party, but keep it small and fun! Just invite a few friends over and pile up the sleeping bags on the floor in one room.


Tell some scary stories once it gets dark. Keep the lights low and challenge each other to see who can tell the scariest story.
Play some pranks on your friends and try to scare them every chance you get!
Take turns playing “Bloody Mary” in the bathroom: go in one at a time, shut the lights off, and repeat “Bloody Mary” three times in the mirror. Try not to get too scared!

, Find a dark, creepy place and play hide and seek once it gets dark. Use flashlights and take turns being the seeker. You can do it in your own backyard, or around your neighborhood.


Try using flashlights with different colored bulbs. This will make it even spookier when searching for players in the dark.
Play in teams or pairs. This way, one person won’t be left out in the dark when everyone else has already been found.
Make sure you have permission to enter any place you want to play at, and make sure you aren’t disturbing anyone when you play.

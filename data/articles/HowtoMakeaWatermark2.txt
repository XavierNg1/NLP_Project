 This method will not create a true watermark, but will instead insert a picture into a header or footer.
 In Excel 2003 and earlier, this is done through the Page Setup dialog box. In Excel 2007 and later, this is done through the Insert and Design menu ribbons. After selecting the worksheet you want to display the watermark, do the following:


In Excel 2003 and earlier, select Header and Footer from the View menu, then select Custom Header or Custom Footer.
In Excel 2007, click the Header and Footer button in the Text group on the Insert menu ribbon.
 Choose either the left, center or right section box. In Excel 2003 and earlier, these boxes appear side by side in the Page Setup dialog box.


In Excel 2003 and earlier, these boxes appear side by side in the Page Setup dialog box.
In Excel 2007, the window under the Design menu ribbon displays a spreadsheet with a header section at the top labeled "Click to add header." Click to display the three subsections. (If you'd rather place your graphic in the footer, click the Go to Footer button in the Navigation section.)

, Use the appropriate method for your version of Excel to place the picture in one of the header or footer sections.


In Excel 2003 and earlier, in the Header and Footer dialog box, click Insert Picture, navigate to the image you want to insert and double-click it. You can resize it by clicking Format Picture and using the options in the Format Picture dialog.
In Excel 2007, click Picture in the Header & Footer Elements group in the Design menu ribbon, navigate to the image you want to insert and double-click it. You can resize it by clicking Format Picture and using the options in the Format Picture dialog.
It is also possible to simulate a watermark in Excel by adding a graphic image as a background; however, backgrounds appear only on the screen, not in a printed copy.

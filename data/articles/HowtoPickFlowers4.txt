 Here are some common garden varieties and their best picking times:


Daffodils – while in tight bud
Daisies, dahlias, marguerites - when coming into full bloom; if dusted with pollen, they're not good to pick anymore
Long flowers such as lupins, foxgloves, delphiniums – when the lower flowers are fully open with some of the upper level buds yet to open
Poppies – when the buds have just burst open
Peonies - when the petals begin to unfurl
Chrysanthemums - when the flowers are fully open.

 Pick a plant with environmental concerns and easy care. Using a perennial plant will provide an ecological repair process for your soils. Native grasses have been shown to repair depleted soils faster than any other technique. Native plants are usually more capable of adapting to extremes of weather, provide good root structures for the soil,and are endangered of disappearing.;
, If the plant is from a small 4 inch (10.2Â cm) pot dig a hole the size of you shovel. Do not worry and enjoy the moment. (Worms are sensitive to negative thoughts and will stay away.)

, Fill the hole with a shovel full of the soil amendment. Mix with some of the soil you have dug out. Break up heavy clay chunks. The content of the hole should be well mixed but do not worry .
 Hold the plant level to the surrounding soil and fill in with the mixed soil. Be sure to cover the entire root structure with soil. If the root dries out the plant will die. The roots are the heart of the plant and the soil it's skin. You are the surgeon.....close the patient! (Do not worry. The energy associated with worry attracts destructive insects.)

, A gallon or two of water is enough. It is usually best to use a can or bucket and not a hose because the hose lacks a measuring mechanism creating a tendency to overdo the watering, drowning the roots. (Yes roots like people can drown. They need to breathe.)

, Compost is free and available. It is also the environmentally responsible thing to do.
 There can be air pockets which will cause the roots to dry out and die. Visualize a beautiful and healthy plant. The plant will get the message and begin to shoot for that goal.
 Do not water unless the soil is dry. To determine this put your fingers in the soil. This may take some practice! We have been told to keep our hands clean. The instruction is not helpful when it comes testing the water needs of soil. Add water using your water bucket, not the hose, so you do not drown the roots.

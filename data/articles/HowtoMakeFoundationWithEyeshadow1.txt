 The eye shadow will provide color to your foundation. Select a shade that matches your skin.


Try selecting a color that is slightly darker than your skin so that, when it is mixed with lighter colored ingredients during the foundation-making process, it will lighten to the perfect shade.
While most people argue that mid-range to expensive foundations are better quality products, the benefit to using eye shadow for homemade foundations is that it is less expensive to buy than ready-made foundations. With yearly individual costs on makeup ringing in at a minimum of $100, those of us with a tighter budget may prefer trying something a little cheaper.;
, Either type will work when making foundation. Choose the one that best matches your skin tone.
 You want to be sure to select the right shade, so it is important to test the eye shadow in the store before you purchase it.


Use your finger to rub a small amount of the eye shadow onto your face or hand and blend it in. A matching color will disappear on your skin. Select an eye shadow that is one shade darker than a direct match. Also, when testing, remember that your hands may be tanned darker than your face.

 Start by drawing two flower shapes, one smaller than the other one. Each flower shape needs to have five pointed petals (instead of rounded ones). This will create your poinsettia.
 Consider using two different shades of red to give your flowers more depth. For example, you could use a bright red for the bigger flower shape, and a darker red for the smaller flower shape.For a rustic touch, add a blanket stitch around the edges of the petals using embroidery thread. Choose a different shade of red so that it stands out, but does not contrast., The points of the smaller petals should be between the larger petals; don't stack the two shapes right on top of each other. You can attach the two flowers with a few simple stitches, or with a drop of hot glue.
 You can get really creative here. For something rustic, you could sew on a wooden button to the center of the flower.For something more classic, you could sew on five to six small, gold beads. You could also make five to six dots using gold glitter glue.
 You can make all red poinsettias, or you could add some white ones too. How many flowers you make is up to you.
 The cord needs to be about 12 inches (12.48 centimeters) wider than the window or doorway you plan on hanging the garland in. This will give the garland a nice drape; it will also leave enough cord on either end so that you can hang the garland.
 Turn the flowers over, and space them however far apart you want them to be. Working one flower at a time, draw a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) line of hot glue on the back of your first flower, then press the cord into it. Move onto the next flower, and repeat the process. Keep gluing the flowers to the cord until there are none left.

Leave a few inches at the beginning and end of your cord so that you can hang the garland.
 You can use small wall hooks or thumbtacks to hang the garland.

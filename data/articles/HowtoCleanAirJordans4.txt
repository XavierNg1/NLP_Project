 To remove odor from your Air Jordans, place 3 teabags of your choice in each shoe and let them sit for 24 hours. The tea bags will draw out the moisture from your shoes that leads to odor-causing bacteria. Opt for a fresh flavor of tea (e.g. peppermint or lavender) for especially clean-smelling shoes., In a spray bottle, mix together equal parts water and white vinegar. Spray the inside of your Air Jordans. Place the shoes in front of an electric fan to dry. , Avoid sprinkling baking soda directly into your Air Jordans, as direct contact with baking soda can cause certain materials to become brittle. Pour a tablespoon of baking soda inside a coffee filter, dryer sheet, or piece of cloth and tie the bundle together with an elastic. Place one of these bundles inside each shoe for approximately 24 hours to freshen them.For heavy odors, place 2 or 3 baking soda bundles in each shoe to deodorize them.

 You'll need a cigar, marijuana mix, a knife or scissors, grinder and lighter.
 Lick your cigar to make it moist. Take a blade or scissors and cut it lengthwise from butt to tip. With your thumb, slide the insides out. Do it slowly and gently so you don't tear the cigar wrapper.
 Creating this rectangular shape helps to decrease the chances of the wrapper rolling shut prematurely. Separate and use only the innermost layer of the cigar wrap so you'll get less nicotine

, Then fold the wrapper down the center like you would when rolling a regular joint.
 Be generous. You have to use enough mix to support the size of the wrap; otherwise, it'll collapse in on itself while you’re trying to smoke.
 Carefully fold and roll the blunt upward, shaping it as you go. Tuck the shorter side of the wrap around the mix and continue rolling. Be careful not to pinch the ends shut. Lick the remaining paper lengthwise and press down carefully.
 Run the flame of your lighter up and down the length of your blunt in order to “bake” it. Spin the marijuana cigar as you work. Your goal is to darken the color slightly and dry the wrap without setting the blunt on fire.
 Hold the flame to the tip of the blunt. Spin it around to evenly distribute the heat and minimize the chance for developing a run.

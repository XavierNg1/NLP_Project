 How often you need to change your oil depends on the type of car you own. Some cars need an oil change every 3,000 miles (4,800 km), while others can go up to 10,000 or even 15,000 miles (24,000 km) without an oil change. Research your car and talk to the manufacturer or your mechanic to determine how often your oil should be changed.
 Changing your car's oil can save you between $25 and $75 dollars. If you don't have an aptitude for working on cars, there's no reason why you can't do it yourself. Make sure you have the right oil and tools before you begin.
 Most people take their car to a garage to have the oil changed. Simply drive up to an "oil and lube" facility and let the mechanic there know that your oil needs to be changed. The service usually takes about half an hour and is done by a mechanic while you wait in the lobby.

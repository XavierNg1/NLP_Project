 Before your puppy or puppies arrive, go through your entire home and put away any dangerous chemicals. This includes cleaning products, solvents or automotive oils and lubricants. You should also keep any medications in a place that the puppy cannot reach., Because puppies are rambunctious animals, they are likely to bump into things and cause accidents. If you have any fragile objects in the area where your puppy will be living, you should move or find a way to secure those items. You do not want those things breaking or falling on the puppy and hurting it.Consider putting up gates to keep your puppy or puppies in a certain part of the house and moving your delicate objects somewhere else.
 Puppies love to chew on things, and one dangerous item that they sometimes chew on is electrical cords. These cords can shock, burn and even kill puppies that bite into them. Make sure that you properly hide or cover any cords in the area where your puppy will be living.


Consider covering the cords with duct tape or covering them with commercial cord concealers.
You may also want to cover any electrical sockets to prevent your puppy from getting electrocuted.
 In general, try to keep things off the floor or any other surfaces the puppy can reach. Puppies will chew on nearly anything, and sometimes they can choke on or get strangled in loose items around the house. Try to clean up your home so that it is clutter free once the puppy arrives.Put away any trashcans and make sure that rest have lids.
Put your clothes in hampers and keep all shoes on racks or in closets.
 If you have a backyard, you will want to fence it off. This will keep your puppy from running away and, once your puppy gets a little older, destroying other peopleâ€™s property. It will also prevent any stray or wild animals from coming into your yard and hurting your puppy. Putting up a fence will give your puppy a safe space to play outside.

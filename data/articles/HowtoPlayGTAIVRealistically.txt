 Drive normally and don't crash your car. Pay all the tolls.


You can drive recklessly only when you are at wanted levels or you have to be at a destination at a certain time. Try not to kill people or crash into objects or other cars violently.;
, Use taxis and don't skip the ride, or use the subway trains. Or use the cars you get in missions. Walk most of the time to a destination.


To not waste money on taxi fees, unlock Roman's special ability (free cab rides).
 Like let's say 13:20 PM (1:20 PM). Large shoot-out ones are perfect late at night.


Have a realistic sleeping pattern. Save the game at 22:30 PM (10:30 PM), for example.
Don't play missions on the weekends.
 Your clothes will depend on the weather (e.g. rain)

, Don't just do this if you need to replenish your health.
 Take a break after a "big" mission. For example, Roman's Sorrow or Three Leaf Clover.
 Don't resist arrest. Don't kill innocent pedestrians or get in trouble with the police.
, Have a pistol, SMG, a thrown weapon, and a melee weapon. Carry and use a pistol most of the time. Try not to use an RPG.


Turn HUD and Auto-Aim off.

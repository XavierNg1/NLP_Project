 Blossom blight is one of the more common fungi affecting strawberry plants. You can identify blossom blight as a gray mold covering the blossoms and flower stalks. Blossom blight spreads by touching another plant infected by the fungus, so one sick plant can poison your garden. Inspect the blossoms on your strawberry plant before purchasing, and avoid any sickly gray flowers., Unhealthy strawberry plants will have dull, short leaves because of stunted growth. Avoid buying plants with yellowing leaves or browning around the edges, which indicates that your plant did not receive enough water or nutrients while growing., If a strawberry plant is infected with fungus via spores or other infected plants, it will develop spotting on the leaves and stem. Spotting will look like tan, gray, or white spots. Once a plant is severely infected, very little can be done to reverse damage. Do not buy a plant with mild or moderate spotting.The fungus that causes spotting prefers hot, wet climates, so be on the lookout if you live in a humid environment.
 Beetles, slugs, fruit flies, and weevils are all common strawberry plant pests. If the strawberry plant you choose at the nursery has plant pests, you can still purchase it. Just remember to remove these insects before you plant it in your garden to avoid adding more pests to your garden.Because so many pests have been reported on strawberry plants, purchase garden-safe insect spray at the nursery when you purchase your plants.
 Strawberry plants, especially those raised in dark and moist spaces, are at-risk for mildew development. Mildew spreads quickly and can easily ruin an entire garden. Check potential plants for a powdery growth covering the leaves and pepper-like black spots on the plant's underside.

 Once the chicks are dry transfer them to a previously set-up brooder. The brooder should contain shallow water (stick marbles in the container to attract them to the water), chick crumbles (baby chicken food works best) and a heat lamp.
 Wait a while after the hatch due date just in case you get some late hatchers, after that discard of unhatched eggs including dead chicks.
 You'll need to feed them, provide them with water, check on them and clean the brooder daily. Also keep in mind the set the heat lamp below 5 degrees each week until it's at room temperature.

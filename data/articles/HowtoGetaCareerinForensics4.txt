 As you will be called to speak in a public courtroom, it is important that you are a self-assured communicator. You can improve your speaking skills through classes and by joining a Toastmasters club. You will need to write technical reports and organize databases and samples. If your writing is weak, hire a writing tutor.
 In order to work for some agencies, you might need a professional certification from an entity like the American Academy of Forensic Scientists, the Forensic Science Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry, or the American Board of Criminalistics. Certifications often require a test, a membership fee, and continuing educational credits. Being certified can distinguish you in a pool of potential employees.
 By visiting a conference, you will learn what is new in the field regarding research and professional practices. Conferences are also a great place to network and meet contacts who could help you find your first job.

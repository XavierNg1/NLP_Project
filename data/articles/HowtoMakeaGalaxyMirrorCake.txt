 Slice the round dark chocolate cakes into a half using a cake cutter. You will be left with four cake pieces.;
, Place one of the cake layers on a cake turner or cake stand. Frost and stack each cake piece using the vanilla buttercream frosting. Spread out the frosting using a large butter knife.
, Use an offset spatula to evenly spread it around.
, Pour the cold water with the gelatin and stir well until the mixture has the texture of applesauce. Set it aside for about 5-10 minutes to allow it to bloom.
 Whisk well until fully combined.
 Allow it to boil so the sugar can dissolve.
,,, Allow it to sit for about 2-3 minutes until the hot mixture melts the chocolate, and the chocolate begins to soften.
, This helps remove any excess air bubbles and will keep the glaze smooth.
 Add a couple of drops of food gel into each bowl and stir to create the color. Use the black food gel and white food gel to make the colors darker or lighter. Mix well.
 Place a vase or large glass on top of a baking tray where the cake can stand when you apply the glaze. Remove the chilled cake from the fridge and place it on the vase or glass.
 Gently swirl it around with a spoon but do not mix.
 The cake will begin to drip down on the sides and will fall onto the baking tray. This is normal to help let the glaze spread.
 Swirl the rest of the colors on top of the cake using a spoon. Feel free to add the remaining colors anyway you like so be creative when topping off the galaxy mirror cake.
 This helps blend in the colors together to form a galaxy-themed look.


Be sure you brush off the glaze carefully. Spreading too hard will cause the frosting to expose.
, This is optional but creates an extra galactic look.
, Cut a slice of galaxy mirror cake with a cutting knife. Lay the cake on a serving plate. Garnish with extra edible glitter or disco dust, if desired. Enjoy!

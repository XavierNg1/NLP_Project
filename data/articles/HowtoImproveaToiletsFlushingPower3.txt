 Very old toilets may accumulate hard water deposits that narrow their passages and cause water to drain out only slowly.  If your toilet's flush seems more hesitant than your friends', try some muriatic (hydrochloric) acid or other calcium remover, adding a little water at a time to push it into the bend to attack the deposits.,  Run the vent, and flush the toilet before using.

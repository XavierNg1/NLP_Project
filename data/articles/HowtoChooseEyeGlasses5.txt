 Lenses come with a number of added features, such as scratch-resistant coatings and color-changing features meant to offer ultraviolet protection. While many of these features do effectively provide what they offer, they are also largely unnecessary. If you have a tight budget, skip the extras and stick with a basic prescription lens.

 Many carriers cover a portion of the cost for eyeglasses if you buy them at specific places. Depending on your coverage, you could have more or less choice available to you.

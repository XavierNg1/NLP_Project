 In the early spring the daylily will begin to grow shoots out of the ground. These shoots will grow throughout the season, until the plant begins to flower in the early summer. These small shoots are edible and can be harvested for food., For the best tasting daylily shoots, you should harvest them when they are approximately 8 inches (20 cm) tall or smaller. Measure the shoots from the soil to the top. If they are taller than 8 inches (20 cm) the flavour will be stronger and they will not taste as good., Use a pair of clippers to cut the daylily shoots just above the soil level. Once they have been cut the plant will regrow the shoots. Harvesting daylily shoots does not kill or damage the plant.If you donâ€™t have clippers, you can twist the shoots to remove them from the roots., Once you have picked the daylily shoots, you should peel back the outer leaves until you reach the tender inner portion. Wash the shoots to remove any dirt or insects that may be found on the leaves and store the in the refrigerator before eating.Shoots will last in the refrigerator for a few days.

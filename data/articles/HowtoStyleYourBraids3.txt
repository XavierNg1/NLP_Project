 Flip your box braids so that they fall in front of your shoulders. Use your hands to bring the right half of these braids to the front of your face.


Keep the left half in front of your shoulders, but do not bring it down across your face.
 Divide the front half of your braids in two. Take the right-side portion and twist two to four large braids from it.


Braid tightly throughout the entire process to keep the style secure.
As you work your smaller box braids into one large braid, bring the hair over toward the left side of your face.
Do not braid the entire right half of your front section. Only braid until it naturally meets the left half of the front section.
 Continue braiding your hair, but add the remaining box braids from your separated front section into the large braid as you create it.


As before, you should only work two to four large braids during this step. Do not braid the entire front section down to its ends.
 Continue braiding your box braids together in a similar fashion. Every two to four braids, grab more hair from the back section and work it into the braid.


Repeat this procedure until all of your hair is included in the braid.
Once all of your hair is in the large braid, continue braiding until you reach the tips of your hair.
Keep the entire large braid positioned over the front of your shoulder. Do not let it fall back behind your shoulder.
 A tightly braided ponytail may not need to be secured, but if it feels loose, you can secure the ends with an elastic hair band.


After finishing this step, the style should be complete.

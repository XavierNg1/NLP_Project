 If your ex gave birth, she might have posted pictures on her Facebook or other social media accounts. You should check those social media accounts to see if she has posted anything about your child. You should also check the social media accounts for her close family, such as her mother, father, and siblings.


Your ex might have protected her social media account.If so, then ask a common friend whether they could check to see if she has posted information about the birth.
Don’t try to hack into your ex’s social media account. Even if you know the password, you shouldn’t log in unless she has given you permission.
 Social media might not yield any clues. However, you can also do a general Internet search. Type your ex’s name into a search engine and see what comes up. If too many records show, then also add the word “birth” to narrow the search results.


It is possible to obtain official birth certificates online through the VitalChek website.However, these records are restricted to people who are close family. Also, you have to request the birth certificate by entering the city of birth as well as the child’s name and birthdate, which you may not know.
Nevertheless, you can perform a basic Internet search. The birth might have been reported on an online newspaper.
 Births are often recorded in local newspapers. Find the newspaper for the county or city where your ex was living when she gave birth. You might be able to find the newspaper online.


You might also stop into your local library to see if they carry a copy of the printed newspaper. Estimate when your child was likely born and go through every issue of the paper one month before the estimated birth date. Also go through newspapers a month after you suspect the child was born.

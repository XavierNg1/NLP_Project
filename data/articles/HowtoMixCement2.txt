 Be sure to measure out a known amount, so that you can replicate the same consistency with successive batches of concrete.









If pouring your water into a bucket before incorporating into the dry mix, mark the water level on your bucket with a marker. This way, you can quickly fill the bucket without measuring out the water each time you mix a new batch.













Cement that contains too much water is about half as strong as properly-mixed concrete. While it's tempting to just eyeball the amount of water, it could compromise the integrity of your structure. Be sure to read manufacturer's labels when adding the correct amount of water.
 In a wheelbarrow or other mixing container, agitate about 3/4 of the dry mix with all of the water. This first mix will appear a bit soupy because of the excess water, but it should be easy to mix. For best results, mix with a rake.
 Mixing will become a little more difficult at this point, but a trusty rake should make the job easier. Mix until the finished cement is thick and wet but no longer soupy.
 This step needs to be completed as soon as possible after mixing.
 Ideally, one partner starts on clean-up duty while another partner lays the concrete. But if that's not possible, submerge the wheelbarrow or cement basin with water immediately upon finishing. Then, scrub the wheelbarrow or basin with a stiff-bristle brush until it has been completely freed on any cement.









Dump the cement water somewhere inconspicuous, preferably where there isn't grass. (It will kill grass.) You can even dig a small hole, dump the water in, and then fill the hole afterward.

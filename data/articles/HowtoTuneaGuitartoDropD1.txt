 Regardless of whether or not you get your guitar into Drop D with a tuner, it's usually easiest to start from ordinary EADGBE tuning. This is because only one note is different between the tunings — change this note, and you're ready to play. This guide assumes that you're familiar with the notes in standard tuning; as a reminder, here are the notes you'll want each string tuned to (reference tones for these notes are readily available from tuner programs online):Sixth (thickest) string: E



 


Fifth string: A






Fourth string: D






Third string: G






Second string: B






First (thinnest) string: E (two octaves up from the sixth string E)





;
, Next, use your tuner to play a D. In a pinch, you can use the D note that's normally used for the fourth string — if you do this, don't forget that your sixth string will be exactly one octave below this tone. Some tuners, however, can be adjusted to give you the proper drop D tone (this tone is technically called "D3").


If your tuner can't be adjusted to play D3, note that this reference tone can easily be accessed with any number of adjustable online tuner programs., Since the only note that is different between standard tuning and Drop D tuning is the sixth string, your guitar should now technically be in tune. However, it's a very good habit to give the rest of your strings a quick tuning anyway just to ensure that they're perfectly in tune with your new bass note — even a minor inconsistency can produce ugly-sounding chords.


Keep in mind that, since your sixth string is now tuned to D, you'll use its seventh fret (not its fifth) to tune the fifth string. The rest of the strings can be tuned as normal for standard tuning.
 Congratulations! Your guitar is now tuned to Drop D and is ready to play. As a reminder, its strings should now be tuned to the following tones:


Sixth (thickest) string: D

Fifth string: A

Fourth string: D

Third string: G

Second string: B

First (thinnest) string: E

 If itâ€™s something else, you will probably need to visit the doctor to check what it might be. Chest pain, particularly coupled with arm pain or shortness of breath, might be a heart attack. Classic GERD symptoms include:Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing
Hoarse or dry throat
Difficulty swallowing
Acid reflux (food or sour liquid coming back up into your mouth)

, This would mean if you are having to take antacids or other heartburn remedies more than twice a week. Keep in mind that many women experience these symptoms during the early stages of pregnancy -- GERD and morning sickness often present as the same ailments.
 If you have made diet and lifestyle changes that should keep the GERD in check, yet it continues, seek medical attention. Discuss possible next steps with your doctor. In some cases, GERD will require surgery to completely cure it.Surgery to cure GERD would fix the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing it to close properly after your body has processed your food. It can be performed laparoscopically, requiring minimal incisions and requiring a short hospital stay.Without treatment, GERD can eventually lead to more dangerous complications. One of the most common is "Barrett's esophagus," a condition that increases the risk of esophageal cancer.

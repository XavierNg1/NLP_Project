 Give your vet a call and tell them about your outdoor plans. Ask if they’re familiar with flea, tick, heartworm, and other health risks associated with your camping or hiking location. If the location is far away or your regular vet is otherwise unfamiliar, consider getting in touch with one located near your camping or hiking spot.Apply parasite preventatives and any other vet-recommended medications before heading out on your trip.
 While camping or hiking with your dog, try to be even more thorough about all routine safety precautions. Keep your dog leashed, supervised, and don’t let it chase or otherwise interact with any animals you encounter.Keep your campsite clean: keep all human and pet food in wildlife-proof containers, don’t leave water out, and clean up after your dog when it goes to the bathroom.
Bring wildlife hazing items, such as an air horn or other noisemaker.
 You’re more likely to meet a larger predator, such as a wolf or bear, when camping or hiking than on a walk through your neighborhood. Remember to secure your large dog’s leash or slowly pick up and hold your small dog in your arms. Make yourself appear as large as possible by standing tall and, if you have a free arm, raising it above your head.Use your noisemaker to scare it away or shout, “Hey! Go Away!”
Consider bringing bear or pepper spray with you.
Dangerous encounters with larger predators are fairly rare, so you shouldn’t worry or let the possibility keep you from doing a fun outdoor activity with your pet. However, it’s still best to be aware of both encounters with dangerous wild animals and risks like parasites or diseases when camping and hiking with your pet.

 Then, rub a paste made of baking soda with a little water over each cloth. Let sit for a half hour. The baking soda will absorb odors and start cleaning the cloths.
 Dip the cloths in and gently scrub them between your hands. Remove all of the baking soda paste and dirt that lifts with it.
 Use cold or warm water to rinse, whatever you prefer.
, They will be lovely and clean again.

 This is a place that takes place in a dry desert, and as said before, is the only adventure that actually rewards spikes straight off. You can also get a number of different rares from here. Some examples are:


Den betas
Clothing betas
Rare bows and arrows
Neon bows and arrows
Worn blankets
Rare fox hats
Rare viking hats
Top hats (includes solid black top hat)
Party hats (extremely low chance of getting one)

, These are also known as quartz and sapphire. They present the most likely chance to get a spiked wristband, or a spiked collar. However, do not go for the diamond shop ones. As it suggests, many rumors showing dancing or sitting backward on the last cacti will give you black longs or rares. However, this isn't true. It may have worked sometimes, but those were just coincidences.
 No matter what anyone says, you should always open ground chests. Jammers think the rumor about opening ground chests make the regular prize worse, but this is not true. Believe it or not, it is possible to get spikes from ground chests themselves. The proof is on the animal jam wiki.
 It's a low chance, but you can get spikes from yellow shards. Either way, good rares and den betas can still be rewarded from those shards.
 Jammers sometimes think that founders' hats, headdresses, and glitched rings can be rewarded from here. This is not true. Those items are on clearance - most clothing clearance items cannot be won from the forgotten desert. Purple shards do have the highest chance of winning spikes, even though it's a waste of time.


If you are somehow fast enough to find all the shards (it is possible), go back to Liza and talk to her. A chest will appear and will reward a free long spiked collar.

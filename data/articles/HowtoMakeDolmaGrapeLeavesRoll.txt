 If you are using raw grape leaves, you will have to prepare them. To prepare raw grape leaves, bring half a gallon of water to a boil and add salt to it. Put the grape leaves in the boiling water for about 15 min. take them off carefully, put them in a cold-water bath, and let them soak. Otherwise, go directly to mix preparation.;
, In a mixing bowl, mix together the rice, tomato paste, allspice, black pepper, garlic, meat, onion, and 1/4 cup of water. Keep mixing until all the ingredients are well distributed (see picture).
 Take about a teaspoon of the mix and put it on the middle of the grape leaf. Then, spread the mix evenly as a half a cylinder. Remember to leave about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) space from each end of the leaf. This will make folding the leaf easier. Now, fold from the stem end of the leaf. Then, tuck in the empty sides toward the center. After that, keep folding until you have a completer roll of a grape leaf(see picture). Repeat the folding procedure on the rest of the mix. Finally, start laying the rolled grape leaves in a pot. make sure you lay them close to each other.
 Put the pot on a stove and pour about 2 cups of water in the pot. Then, spread the butter evenly on the top of grape leaves. Cover the pot with its lid and cook on high for about two hours. Usually, the cooking time depends on the stove and the material of the pot. However, cooking can be about one hour and fifteen minutes after the mix has come to a boil. After the cooking is done, turn off the stove and let stand uncovered for about 10 minutes.
 On a serving plate, take out one grape leaf at a time and arrange them as desired. Preferably, Dolmas are served hot.

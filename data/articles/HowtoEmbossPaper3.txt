 You will need an embossing machine, an embossing folder, and a piece of cardstock or watercolor paper with measurements of 4 ¼” x 5 ½” so that it fits the embossing folder., Place the embossing folder at the entrance of the embossing machine and crank it through the machine. The roller applies pressure to the paper or cardstock, which creates raised areas onto the paper from the embossing folder.Get your cardstock situated. Place your card face side down over the stencil. Check to make sure you have both the stencil and the card aligned as you desire.
For a deep impression of the stencil, pass the embossing folder through the machine two to three times., Take the embossing folder from the machine and lift it open to reveal the completed embossed paper. If you are using cardstock, consider adding more character by sanding the cardstock with sandpaper to reveal the cardstock’s lighter core. This can add a new design element to its appearance.

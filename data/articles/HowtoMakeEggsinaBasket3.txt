 Cut fresh brussel sprouts into halves or small slices. Grate or slice a sweet potato into small slices. Saut√© the vegetables in coconut oil for about 3-5 minutes.


Add seasoning if desired. Salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika, curry powder, chili powder, or anything else you'd like.
For the no-carb version, you will be using vegetables instead of bread. Choose two vegetables of different nutrient contents. Try brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, or any other of your favorite vegetables.
 Reduce the heat and hollow out holes in the vegetables for the eggs. Crack an egg or two into the holes. Cover the pan and let cook. The eggs will be steamed, which takes about 5 minutes. Keep a check on the eggs until they reach your desired level of doneness., Use a spatula to remove the egg and vegetable dish from the pan and place on a plate. Sprinkle with seasoning if you wish.


You can also sprinkle a light amount of cheese or bacon into the vegetables while you are cooking, or add cheese and bacon on top. If you are doing this, make sure to choose high quality, nitrate-free, center cut bacon and all natural cheese.

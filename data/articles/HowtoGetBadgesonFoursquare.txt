 The more you use the app, the more likely you are to gain badges. Badges are usually connected to checking in. This is why the more locations you check in from, the more badges you will earn. For example, You will earn the “Newbie” badge the first time you check in. You will also receive a badge for 10, 25, and 50 check ins and for checking in for a number of days in a row.

, Checking in from different locations may earn you a badge. For example, checking in from three different “Photo Booth” locations will earn you the Photogenic badge.
 Some badges are only available for a certain amount of time, such as during a festival or other event. For example, checking in from the Consumer Electronics Show this year would have earned you the CES 2010 badge.
 If you only check in from gas stations in the morning for example, you will decrease your chances of earning badges. Some badges can only be earned at certain times of the day.
 Some badges, such as those earned by checking in from a retail store, can only be earned once you have followed the company or brand.
 Some TV shows or other media outlets will have promotions in conjunction with Foursquare allowing you to earn badges for a certain period of time for performing certain tasks.

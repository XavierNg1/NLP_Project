 Most rock is electric guitar driven so focus on having a tight sound because you are the sound!;
, The material you learn will be very important. Depending on what type of rock you want to play. Look through classic rock, blues, jam bands, etc. To prepare for a try-out for this type of band, listen to giants of these genres.


It's also important to dig to the roots of the music you like. If you want to play metal you should know how metal started, who its founders were, and when they played (for example, if you like Widespread or Phish, you should know something about the Grateful Dead). This is important because your band will most likely end up covering a lot of the songs you've heard.
 Understanding these thoroughly will greatly help your knowledge of music theory.
 Loud is good, but not being able to understand the words or hear the bassline because your gain is on 11 isn't. And remember, you will be able to understand the words better than the audience because you know all the songs.


If you have 2 guitarists, make sure to variate your chord voicings (positions) so you aren't playing the same riff and the other guy except during solos.
 Pedals and processors and be a good thing but before you go spend $1000 on that make sure you have a legit guitar and amp 1st. For blues, rock, country, jam bands, and reggae, an all tube amp is recommended. Not so much for metal and hardcore.


Whether you have a guitar now or not, research how different guitars are suited for different styles. Strats and Les Paul's for blues, Tele's for country/folk or whatever. You don't want to cover metallica with a semi-hollow body Ibanez.
 It's all good if you have to cover a song you don't like. And if you take nothing else from this just remember IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC!

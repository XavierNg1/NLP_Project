 Don't choose one of those disposable cameras, get a digital camera with good zoom, handling, and different settings for different scenes and times.;
, Think of different poses as of what the person will do or different places to be. You might even have the person/s do something while the picture is being taken.
 Most people won't be able to see what you are thinking about so you will have to tell them specific instructions. Guide them with your hands unto where you want them to go.
 Unless the family wants the sun, block it out. This can cause glare in lenses or your camera. IT may also cause people to squint or blink.
 No one likes a picture where people are smiling. Babies are especially hard since they can't understand you. Hold up their favorite toy or character.
 Again, babies tend to be difficult while doing this, along with dogs. Hold out toys or squeak a squeaky-toy to get the dog's attention.
 Don't take all of the pictures in one area, take some in one area, move to another, and take some more. Try to keep close, as most families like to stay close to their home.
 Edit out red eyes, blemishes, and glass glare. Add touch ups like borders and backgrounds. Don't do anything without the buyer's consent though.

 The absolute most effective and permanent way to eradicate gynecomastia for good is through elective cosmetic surgery (plastic surgery). Surgery to reduce breast size is called reduction mammoplasty in the medical world. A skilled surgeon can open up the breasts, examine them, and remove the offending tissue. Unfortunately, gynecomastia isn't exactly a life-threatening medical condition, which means you'll have to pay for it yourself. Assume a cost of at least $5,000; call your chosen practitioner for a more accurate estimate.
 For many men with gynecomastia, surgery is the only way to completely get rid of it. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that male breast reduction surgery, like all surgery, has some inherent risks. Speak with your surgeon ahead of time and be sure you're completely clear about potential complications during and after the surgery. Follow any advice he or she gives you to the letter to minimize your risk.
 The surgery will begin with anesthesia, and then take one of two directions.


Liposuction: If the source of the gynecomastia is primarily fatty deposits, liposuction will be used to remove them and lower the profile of the breasts.
Excision: In cases where mammary glands are causing the condition, the excess tissue from them will be carefully excised with a blade.
 Recovery from reduction mammoplasty typically takes some time, as the incisions need to heal and scar, and any fluids building up underneath them will need to be drained. However, this surgery is not considered particularly invasive, so any hospital stay is likely to be minimal. Your surgeon will give you specific recovery instructions; follow them closely. Be aware that the surgery will leave faintly visible permanent scars, typically on the underside of the breast area.

 If you downloaded it from online, it's likely in your "Downloads" folder, to which you can navigate by clicking the Go tab and then selecting Downloads.


Other likely locations of your ZIP folder include the desktop and your personal documents folder (if applicable).
 When you extract the files from your ZIP folder, they will appear in an ordinary folder in the same location as the ZIP folder currently resides. You can move your folder by clicking and dragging it into a different location (e.g., your desktop).


For example, extracting from the ZIP folder on the desktop will place the unzipped folder on the desktop as well.
 Its contents will begin extracting to the current directory.
 Depending on the size of the ZIP folder, this process' length will vary. When your files are done extracting, they will be in a typical, blue folder in the same area--and with the same name--as the ZIP folder.


You can open the new folder by double-clicking it.

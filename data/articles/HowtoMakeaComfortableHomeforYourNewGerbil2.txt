 In their natural habitat, gerbils dig complex burrow systems, and gerbils (like any animal) are happiest when they can emulate natural behaviors demonstrated in the wild. Aspen wood and Carefresh make excellent substrates, although Carefresh must be mixed with hay to support burrows. It doesn't hurt to also provide small disinfected stones, as the gerbils will use these to provide further support to their burrows. For nesting material, rip facial tissues or toilet paper into strips. (toilet paper works best)

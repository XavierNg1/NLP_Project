 Find other people with similar interests. By surrounding yourself with others who are like you, you will create a positive, uplifting, and inspiring environment for yourself. For example, if you like learning foreign languages, consider joining a French, Italian, or Spanish language club. Or, if you like learning about environmental issues, try joining an environmental club. Look for these clubs at school, in your local community, or online. Joining these clubs and communities will help you feel supported in your interests.
 Try not to be discouraged, depressed, or enraged by those who ridicule you. Instead, get involved in artistic activities where you can express yourself, acquire a sense of mastery, and interact positively with others. Find a local painting, music, poetry, or dance class through your local adult education service or local community center.
 You may be used to being labeled “different." Turn this into a positive: your unique interests give you the ability to see things differently and to be in tune with the things going on around you rather than conforming to the mainstream. Remember that being a unique individual is a virtue that many people admire. A way to stand out from the crowd is to wear an outfit, a hairstyle, or jewelry that reflects you and your interests, no matter how different you may look.
 Aspire to be honest, compassionate, and kind by offering to help others who are bullied or teased for being “different.” Knowing that someone else is on their side can make a big difference in the lives of those who are bullied. Offer to hang out with them or invite them to have lunch with you.
Speak up for them if you hear someone teasing or bullying them.
Help stop rumors and gossip about them by interjecting, if appropriate, when somebody badmouths them. You could say "Sam is actually really great - she helped me make new friends when I first moved here."

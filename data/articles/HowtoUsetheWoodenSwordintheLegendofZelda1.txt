, Look for the sword on your item inventory list using the arrow buttons on your controller. When you find it, press the “Action” button on your controller where you want to assign it. Press the “Start” button once more to go back to the action phase of the game.
 To do the most basic attack with your wooden sword, simply tap the Action button where you assigned it to do a quick slash attack.
 The second type of attack you can do is the spin attack. Press and hold the Action button and wait for the wooden sword to light up. Once it does, release the Action button and Link will do a 360 degrees sweeping motion with the sword.

 Kumite is Japanese for "fighting." There are two types of kumite: point kumite and street kumite.
 Point Kumite is used at tournaments. There will be two opponents (same rank category, same age category, same sex) both wearing padding on their head, hands, feet, and groin for the boys. Punches and kicks can only be thrown to the side of the head, front of the body, side of the body, top of the head, and a controlled punch to the face (coming no closer then an inch). If opponent strikes to any other area then listed, or makes contact to the face, depending on the division their in, they will either get a warning, point will be awarded to other person, or disqualification. No grappling is allowed, and no kicks to the groin. Any draw of blood leads to immediate disqualification.


If someone falls on the ground:

They have 3 seconds to get back up until the center judge says got back to the center.
Opponent may still trow punches and kicks, but absolutely no strikes to the head are allowed, not even a simulation!
Person on the ground can strike if they get the opportunity.


How to determine a winner:

Normally whoever gets the most points in 1 minute wins



, Street Kumite is totally different from Point Kumite. In Street Kumite, anything goes. Grapples, takedown, armlocks, full contact. There is no Street Kumite at tournaments, it is only trained in the Dojo, and there are no points involved, even though sparring gear is still used.

 Go to your local hair care store, and you can find extensions for your hair of all different colors and textures. Choose whatever type of synthetic braiding hair suits your liking. Some popular brands for micro braiding are Wet and Wavy and Milky Way Que.
 Rat tail combs are perfect, but any comb with a sectioning tool at the end will work. If you don’t have this kind of comb, you can buy one from a hair care store, or you can use a regular comb and the end of a pen or a bobby pin to part and section your hair., You will use these scissors to trim the loose pieces of hair from the ends of the braids. If you do not have hair cutting scissors, you can use regular scissors as well., You will use the spray bottle to wet the roots of your hair so that you can part your hair into clean sections. If you do not have a spray bottle, you can wet the section of hair with your fingers and water., Any plain hair gel will work. You will use the gel to slick your hair before you add the extension to your hair and braid. The gel can also be used on the ends of your new braids to keep them slick., You want your hair to be as healthy as possible before you braid your hair because putting micro braids in your hair can damage it. Deep condition your hair a few times before you do your micro braids. You can also do a hot oil treatment on your hair to protect it against damage., Once again, you want your hair healthy, and you don’t want to braid your hair with split ends. So go to a hairstylist, and tell him/her that you are getting your hair cut for micro braids. You will probably just want to get your ends trimmed.

Avoid any hair cuts with layers or thinning.

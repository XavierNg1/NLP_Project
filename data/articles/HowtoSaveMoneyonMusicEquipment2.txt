 Before you start splashing out all your money from last payday, set yourself a nice budget. There are two ways to do this:


You could take the list of all the things you wanted and set a budget for each item. This will stop you from spending too much on something little.

The other way is to set a budget for everything overall. This will stop you from going bankrupt. The only downside of this is that you may find yourself thinking "I'll spend more on the guitar and even it out by buying a cheap amp". That could leave you with loads of items of varying quality.

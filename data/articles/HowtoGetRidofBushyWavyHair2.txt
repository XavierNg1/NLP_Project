 Blow drying too often can damage your hair and lead to unnecessary frizz. You can protect your hair by purchasing a heat protecting spray.After you've applied product to your hair, make sure it's about 75% dry before you start blow drying.Try drying just the roots of your hair to give it some lift and avoid damaging your hair., While your hair is still wet from the shower, apply a cream hydrator from the roots of your hair to the tip. Warm the product between your palm and fingers and wrap your curls around your fingers to shape them.








If you have a hair diffuser attachment for your blow dryer, use it to dry your hair. Set it for a low speed and point it away from your roots to keep from frizzing your hair., You can use an anti-frizz serum after your shower, or you can keep it on hand to use throughout the day.








If you have thicker hair, apply the serum from root to tip. If you have thinner hair, apply the serum from about the middle of your hair to the tip. Avoid using serum near the roots to keep your hair from looking oily., Alcohol will dry your hair out and lead to more frizz. A lot of hairsprays and mousse contain alcohol, so your best bet is to give them up or switch to an alcohol-free brand.Switching to alcohol-free brands may mean looking for salon quality products. These are likely to be more expensive than your everyday products.

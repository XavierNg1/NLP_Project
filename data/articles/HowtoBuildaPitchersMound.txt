 The location should feature a clear path more than 60 feet (18.29 meters) away from home plate.;
, A regulation pitcher's mound is 18 feet (5.49 meters) in diameter. The center of the mound is 59 feet (17.98 meters) from the back of home plate. The pitching rubber (or pitcher's plate) is 18 inches (0.46 meters) behind the center of the mound or 60 feet, 6 inches (18.44 meters) from the back of home plate.
 Use chalk or flags to indicate measurements on your field.
 Fill in the area around the pitching rubber with a clay, sand and dirt mixture. The pitching rubber should be 10 inches (254 mm) higher than the playing field.
 Situate the bricks in the pitcher's landing area, which is the approximate spot where the pitcher's legs land after throwing a pitch. The pitcher's landing area is the most stressed area of the mound. Burying clay bricks will provide durability to your mound and reduce the need for frequent maintenance.
 The slope from the pitching rubber should begin 6 inches (152.4 mm) in front of the rubber, and slope toward home plate 1 inch (25.4 mm) for every foot (0.3 meters).
 Once the mound has taken shape, pound the surface area of the mound with a tamp, or a hard, flat surface, to ensure there are no loose areas.
 Raking the mound will remove any pebbles or chunks of grass.
 The water will soak into the mound and firmly set the clay. Regular watering also will prevent your mound from cracking or eroding.

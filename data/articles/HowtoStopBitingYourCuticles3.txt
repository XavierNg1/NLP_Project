 Keep your nails neat and clean. You can do this at home or at the salon. Either way, you’ll want to clean, moisturize, and soften the cuticles regularly. This will help them heal from any damage your teeth have done. You may also feel less likely to bite if your nails if you know that biting will ruin your manicure.
 Cutting cuticles is a common practice, especially in nail salons. Cutting will make cuticles hard, more likely to break, and more tempting to pick at. Instead, use a wooden orange stick to gently push the cuticles back.Tell your manicurist. Before they reach for the clippers, try saying, “Just push the cuticles back please.”

, Unhealthy cuticles can result from a poor diet. Keep your skin healthy by drinking at least eight glasses of water per day. For general skin health, eat fresh vegetables and avoid processed foods.

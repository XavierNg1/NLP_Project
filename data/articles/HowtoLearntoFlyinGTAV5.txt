 Okay, it’s time to put all that you have learnt to the test. Try flying freely for a while to gain experience and improve your character’s Flying Attribute before you go into this lesson.

Basically, this lesson is a short route that involves takeoff, low altitude flying, sharp banking, and then finally landing. It is a complete course that requires careful handling. If your character is inexperienced in flying, he will have difficulty in controlling the aircraft due to turbulence.


Don’t stress yourself by trying to fly directly through them – they have a radius of effect that extends beyond their outer parameter, so it’s okay even if you aren’t exactly aligned.
There are certain sharp turns between ring number 8 to 11, 12 to 13, 15 to 16, and 17 to 18. Use a combination of aileron banking and rudder yaw, while pitching up slightly every time you bank to maintain your altitude.
 There is no reason to fly above the altitude of the rings, but if you do fly with the rings, you need to make sure you don’t lose altitude or you might crash into terrain., The turn between rings 15 and 16 is the most difficult turn, and you will like get very close to the water as you perform a knife. Make sure to use your rudder pedal. Turn between 17 and 18 is also fairly challenging and will require similar maneuvers., You don’t need to land the plane, so hopefully you can breathe a sigh of relief when you are done. If you chipped in a few hours of random flying out of the school before this lesson, you will have better control and hence higher chances of a Gold rating.

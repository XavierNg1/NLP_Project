 Accenting a neutral outfit with a vibrant purse or bag is another easy way to spice things up a bit. Since the accent will immediately draw eyes to it, choose a purse or bag that has interesting or unusual details. For example, you could pair an electric blue purse with quilted details and silver accents with a neutral outfit.You could also show off a bright pink or green backpack by wearing it with dark black and charcoal pieces.
 Toss a fuzzy red scarf over your outfit to instantly liven things up. You could even look for one with unusual detailing, such as red faux fur trim, to make even more of a statement. Don’t be afraid to try bright stripes or other patterns, as well.


For example, you could wear a neon striped scarf with a black coat and dark neutral solids to emphasize the bright pattern even more.
 Try pairing a pair of red leather booties with black skinny jeans and a black leather biker jacket for an edgy look. Combat boots come in a rainbow of colors, as well. Go for an electric blue pair and wear them with black or dark gray pants to emphasize them.
 If you’re feeling uninspired by your winter wardrobe and need a quick fix, try experimenting with a range of bright nail polish looks. Go for a bright blue, a glittery violet, or a metallic shade to accent an otherwise neutral outfit. Cherry red polish is a classic – pair it with a black outfit and matching red lip to create a glamourous retro vibe.

 Measure in the cayenne, black pepper, salt, and any other seasonings you wish to incorporate. Stir them into the gumbo. Taste the gumbo and decide whether to add more seasonings. Simmer the gumbo for another hour to give the flavors time to meld.
 In a separate pot or in a rice cooker, cook the rice. When it's finished cooking, use two forks to fluff it up.
 When the gumbo is almost finished cooking, stir in the shellfish and let it cook for another 10 minutes. This keeps the shellfish tender.
 Spoon the rice into bowls. Ladle the gumbo over the rice and serve it hot. Many Cajuns enjoy gumbo with Louisiana hot sauce on the side.

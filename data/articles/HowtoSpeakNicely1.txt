 People range in their ability to hear and understand language, and you have a greater chance of being heard and understood when you speak clearly. Practice with a recorder or ask a friend to help you learn to pronounce your words with more clarity. Things that can help include slowing down, lowering the tone of your voice, listening to and borrowing from actors whose accent or tone you like, etc.


Avoid using a monotone (no variances in your speech). This suggests that you don't have confidence in what you're saying and it tends to bore people after a short time.
Avoid mumbling. People feel very embarrassed when they continually fail to "catch" what is being said and will soon find and excuse to get away from someone who is mumbling a lot. If you mumble as a result of shyness, it's important to address this cause; for example, see How to overcome shyness.;
, Try to tone down any hint of aggression or loudness in your voice when talking to others. Loudness causes people to be on the alert and even on the defensive, and can set them on edge. As for aggressiveness coming through the voice, few people will miss this intent and will feel very uncomfortable.

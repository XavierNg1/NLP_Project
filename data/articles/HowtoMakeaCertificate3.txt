 It's a good idea to find a professional certificate template you like and can use quickly and effectively to fill out for whatever event or occasion in which people will be honored with a certificate. Lots of simple and elegant certificate templates can be found here and here.
 Open it in Microsoft Word, preferably the '07 version or later, when you've found one that seems appropriate for your purpose. You'll be able to use the same one for annual awards or other achievements in the future.


Select the template and right-click to open the menu, then select Word to open the document.
 In each section, labeled "Name" or "Date" you should be able to click in and type the information for the person or persons being recognized. It should be quick and easy.


If lots of people are going to get the same award, you might consider saving a version of the template with some of the information filled out ahead of time to save a little bit of time. Then all you'll need to do is fill in the names.
 After you've got the name and specific information filled out, you should be ready to print them and present them. Use good-quality cardstock as opposed to regular printer paper to give them a more professional finish and quality. You can get this at most any office supply store for a few extra dollars.
 It's usually nice for certificates commemorating specific achievements to be hand-signed by the awarding party. If your boss assigned you to run off some certificates to give out at the office, present them ahead of time to give your supervisor enough time to go through them and sign them personally. It's a good idea that'll only take a few extra minutes and make the certificates mean a lot more.

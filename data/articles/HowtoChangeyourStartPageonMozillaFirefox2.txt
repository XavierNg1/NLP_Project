 On some versions of Windows, the top menu bar is hidden by default. Display it with one of the following methods (you may need to try more than one):


Press Alt.
Press F10.
Right-click a blank space on the tab bar and select Menu Bar


, Click the word Firefox from the top menu bar, then Preferences from the drop-down list. This should open Preferences in a new tab or a pop-up window.


Some versions of Firefox use the term Options instead.
 Visit the Preferences tab and look for the words "When Firefox starts:" followed by a drop-down menu. Click this drop-down menu and select Show my home page.


If you do not see this option, click the General tab.
 Just below the "When Firefox starts:" menu, look for the words "Home page:" followed by a blank space. There are several ways to set your home page here:


Type the URL of your desired home page into the blank space. If you want multiple pages to open when you start Firefox, separate multiple URLs with the pipe symbol: |.
Click Use Current Pages to make all of your currently open tabs appear when you start Firefox.
Click Use Bookmark... to select one of your saved bookmarks as the home page.
Click Restore to Default to return to the default Mozilla start page.

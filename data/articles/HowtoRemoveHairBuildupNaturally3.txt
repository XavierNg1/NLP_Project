 In this recipe, you will be using a baking soda paste to remove hair product build-up from your scalp. Here is what you will need:2 tablespoons of baking soda
Â½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of warm water
A small bowl or cup to hold the paste

, Pour the warm water into a small bowl or cup, and add in the baking soda. Gently stir the mixture until you get a thick paste.
 Gently massage the paste into your scalp with your finger tips. Do not apply the paste to your hair.
 During this time, you can wash the rest of your body.
 Tilt your head back and rinse the paste. Massage your head with your fingers to get all of the paste out. The paste will also run down your hair, and help remove any buildup.
 Once you have removed all of the baking soda paste, you can wash and condition your hair as you normally would, using shampoo and conditioner. Be sure to rinse your hair out well.

 Before buying or adopting a cat, it is important to think about your lifestyle, personality, and needs so you can select a cat that will fit in with you and your family. Consider how often you are away from home and what type of interaction you hope to have with your new pet.You may not be able to predict what qualities a mixed breed cat will have. Consider getting a mixed breed cat if your lifestyle is adaptable to the cat’s needs.
If you are gone for several hours each day or travel a lot for work, consider finding a breed that is independent.
If you wish to have an affectionate cat, consider researching breeds that are more likely to sit in your lap.;
, Your personality can help you decide if you would like a purebred or a mixed breed cat. If you want your cat to have particular, anticipated qualities, opt for a purebred cat. It is easier to predict the coat, color, pattern, and personality of certain breeds. If you are more flexible and are willing to watch your cat’s personality develop, consider getting a mixed breed whose traits are not predictable., Although it is impossible to determine what type of cat will be the healthiest throughout its lifespan, a mixed breed cat may be more likely than a purebred cat to have better health overall. This is because the mixed breed cat usually has a larger genetic background. A healthy cat may incur a yearly veterinary bill that ranges between $50 and $200 U.S. for routine care and check-ups.If you choose a purebred cat that is prone to developing diabetes, for example, that cost may increase due to more frequent visits to the veterinarian.


A diabetic cat may need to have a blood glucose test while visiting the clinic. That could increase your bill by $100 for each test.

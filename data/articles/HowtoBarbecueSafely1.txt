 It is important to keep the food refrigerated until you cook it. This means that it is better to barbecue in batches rather than leaving meat and other barbecue foods sitting out waiting in the open, uncooked. Bring each new batch for cooking direct from the fridge to the barbecue every time it is ready to be cooked. If you are marinating your meat be sure to let the meat marinade in the fridge. Don't re-use the marinade.;
, Cover the cooked food to keep the insects landing on it.
 Ensure that all meats are cooked through. In particular, ensure that pork and chicken are properly cooked. It can be a little deceptive sometimes to see a charred outer casing of the meat, only to have uncooked flesh inside. Follow the cooking times suggested for each meat type.
 It is important that you keep raw foods and cooked foods apart from each other. In particular, raw poultry, raw pork and raw eggs should be handled very carefully on separate boards or work spaces and kept on separate dishes in readiness for cooking. Always clean preparation areas and items thoroughly before using with other food.
 Once you have cooked you meat to the right temperature keep it hot until served— 140 °F (60 °C) or warmer.

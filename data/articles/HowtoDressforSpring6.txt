 Nothing says you have to lug around a boring, drab umbrella with you on rainy days. Treat your umbrella like an accessory buy choosing one with a fun print or in an unusual shape.
 Once the rainy months clear up, prepare yourself for sun. A trendy pair of sunglasses keeps you looking stylish while protecting your eyes from harmful rays.
 If you stock your wardrobe up with tunics and other loose-fit blouses, add figure-flattering structure by wrapping a sash or skinny belt around your natural waist.
 Think lightweight cotton and straw. Look for cute caps, or hats with a wide brim that can block the sunlight.
 Introduce a splash of springtime color into blander outfits by wearing bright necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and rings.
 Look for pendants and charms shaped like flowers, leaves, and feathers. Spring is when nature starts returning to life. Acknowledge this fact by choosing jewelry pieces with a nature theme.
 For chilly days during the early spring, you may want to wear a pair of leggings beneath your A-line skirt or dress to prevent your legs from getting chilly. Leggings also work well beneath many longer tunic shirts.

 Choose fabric according to the end use for the bow. For example, you might choose fabric that matches an outfit, suits a party theme or goes with the wrapping paper.


Scrap fabric is ideal for practicing with, and for making any cloth bow with.;
, For a larger bow, cut a wide strip; for a smaller bow, cut a narrow strip. Ensure that it is cut to a good length too; you can always cut off excess if needed but can't add more if you didn't cut it long enough to begin with.
 Pick up the fabric in two places, at an even distance from the center of the fabric strip. Using these sections to draw up the ribbon, form two half-loops each side.


The left side loop becomes "A", while the right side loop becomes "B" (or vice versa, whichever way you're most comfortable with).
 Then bring loop A back through the middle. This forms the basic bow shape, and a middle knot forms in the center.
 This tightens the bow and allows it to hold its shape. You may also need to pull on the tail ends of the bow. Adjust to be even both sides.
 Either cut the tails in a "V' shape or diagonally. This looks neater and prevents the fabric from fraying.
 You can make as many as you need using the same method; the more you make, the easier this becomes.

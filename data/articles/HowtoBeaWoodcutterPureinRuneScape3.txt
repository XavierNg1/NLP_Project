Willow trees can be found north of the chicken farm near Lumbridge or at the Barbarian outpost (Members only)or in Draynor, as the bank is pretty much right next to them.






Maple trees become available at level 45 (only found for non-members on woodcutting island.)(Which requires level 30 Dungeoneering). These can be found at Camelot behind the bank or near the WC Expert.






Teak trees provide the faster experience of all trees. Complete the Monkey Madness quest, equip your monkey greegree, and go to Ape Atoll.

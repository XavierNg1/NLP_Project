 Some of the ways to start looking at it, before you actually flowchart it, are:



Brainstorm (software, online, paper)

Mind map it
'Inventory' your job;
, Consider it the way someone walking in the door would when they tried to figure out just how you did the job.
 E.g.:


Check and process email
Review objectives/requirements for the day, etc.
 In the process, you will be amazed at the steps involved in your job that you do by rote.
 Everything changes, nothing stays the same. That is the advantage to using software. Much easier to change.

 Use a video camera, then review it later on. This is much better than practicing in front of a mirror. In front of a mirror you will constantly focus of yourself and how you look, while in a public speaking you should be thinking about the message and the audience instead of yourself. Once you are through with your practice, you can review the recording and “be the audience”; you will find things you like, keep it up; you will also see things you – as an audience – don’t like; make a note to improve it next time.
 Next time you attend a meeting, try to come with some issue to raise or comment on and contribute to the meeting. It may not seem like much, but if you do this consistently, it will increase your confident as well.
 If you present something in a meeting, notice how the audience reacts: do they look bored or interested? Do they seems to understand or just plain confused? If you are not sure, ask your friend or trusted colleague to give you inputs. Even if they may criticized you, it is still better then don’t have any feedback at all.

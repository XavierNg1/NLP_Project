 With Google Chrome, blocking pop-ups is easier than using the stock Android browser with pop-ups blocked, as it helps to block nasty data-hogging ads too. Instead of blocking the pop-ups, enabling Data Saver is a better option.


Data Saver not only blocks the ads but also compresses the aspects of all the websites that are not necessary in browsing. It offers smooth navigation and saves data usage as it minimizes the data by removing the advertisements and all the animations that you can see while browsing.
If you don’t have the Chrome browser on your Android device, get it for free from Google Play.
 This will open the browser menu.
 Do this by scrolling down through the drop-down menu to “Settings,” and then tapping this option.
 Scroll through the Settings menu to “Data Saver” and select it. Move the slider at the top right corner from “Off” to “On” to enable the feature.

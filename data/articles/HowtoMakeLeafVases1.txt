 The leaves may not adhere properly if there is dirt, oil, and other debris on the outside of the vase. Wipe down the surface with rubbing alcohol on a piece of paper towel to ensure that it’s clean.You can use a clear or colored vase, depending on your preference. However, be sure that it’s made of glass or ceramic.
If you don’t have a vase, you can use a mason jar and turn it into a vase.;
, In order to position the leaves on the vase, they need to be slightly bendable. Wet the leaves lightly to loosen them up so they’re easier to position.Don’t overwet the leaves. Instead of running them under the faucet, try using a spray bottle filled with water to lightly mist them.
For the best results, use freshly fallen leaves that aren’t too dry or fragile.
The vase looks best if you remove the stems from the leaves.
You can use faux leaves if you can’t find any real leaves that you want to use.
 When you’re ready to place the leaves on the vase, use a hot glue gun to place several dots of glue on the back of the leaves. Next, press the leaves to the vase, smoothing out any air bubbles. Hold them in place for 5 to 10 seconds to give the leaves time to adhere.You can add as many or as few leaves as you like. Covering the entire surface of the vase with leaves creates a distinctive look, but having some space between the leaves can also be pretty.
It’s best to apply a single layer of leaves. If you try to place several layers on the vase, the leaves may fall off.
 Once you’ve placed the leaves on the vase in your desired arrangement, allow the glue to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. If desired, you can tie raffia or a ribbon around the neck of the vase to complement the leaves.Using ribbon that matches the color of the leaves creates an simple elegant look for the vase. However, a ribbon in a contrasting color can make a bolder statement.

 Step down a little and physically go to his or her level. Get on their level so you can look them in their eyes. It's like you to enter to their little worlds, their space by kneeling, placing them on your laps, etc.;
, Don't scold or hit.
 Really pay attention to what they have to say. Some of it will be silly. Some of it will be repetitive or less than sensible. Then, go with it. Joke and be silly, explain, answer their questions as best you can, or ask them some questions of your own to get them thinking.


Ask them what are they thinking about? Prepare yourself because you may be surprised! If they can not put their thinking in words, you may think of simple emotions or thoughts.
 This will make them think you're cool. Let them stay up late, or invite all kinds of friends over. Let them get into the chocolate, watch the big kid movies or a TV show that is on a little late.
 Get off your computer, and play some childrens' games like "Mother May I", "Red Light, Green Light", or board games.
 A good story is a great thing to share.
, When kids are getting some exercise and fresh air, their behavior is better than if they are playing video games all the time. The best way to convince them to get outside is to announce "in half and hour we're all going outside, so you have a half hour to play video games" then in 10 minutes time, remind them again. Then, when they have to get off there will be less likelihood of all the screaming and "I hate yous".
 Cheer them on with phrases such as "good job". Give high-fives. This will get them excited and will make them feel appreciated.
 Playgrounds, libraries, amusement parks, skating rinks, lakes, movies, museums, anywhere where they can explore, learn, and/or have fun.
 Dance, laugh, sing, shout, tell jokes, tell secrets, be a kid yourself!

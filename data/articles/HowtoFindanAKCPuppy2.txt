 Many people will get any dog because they are cute. However, not all dogs fit with your lifestyle. Some dogs require a lot of physical exercise or mental stimulation, some do better in certain climates, some come with specific health problems, and others are not good with small children or other pets. Ask yourself these questions as you search for a puppy:


Can I financially support a dog?
Do I have size limits, such as yard space or the size of my home?
Do I have the capabilities to pay for extra veterinary bills, such as treating hip issues in golden retrievers?
Are there any laws against the breed I am looking at?
Can I cope with extra expenses, such as new carpeting or new furniture? Can I afford vet bills and food for my dog?

, If you have never owned a dog, or you are interested in a breed you have never owned, you may want to start with the breed selector offered by the AKC. After answering a few basic questions about your lifestyle, the AKC offers breed selections that will fit with your family.They ask your zip code, how many children and other pets you own, whether you live in a house or an apartment, how physically active you are, and how neat your house is.
The selector gives you five matches they think will fit your lifestyle. However, you may also read about all the breeds on the AKC breed page.
 No two breeds are the same. Each breed has their own strengths and weaknesses, health problems, temperament issues, activity level needs, and other needs. This means not every breed is for you. As you decide on a breed, make sure you research it to make sure you understand what is required of you as the owner.The American Kennel Club has a list of dog breeds with information to help dog owners learn more about their breed. It covers everything you will need to know to get you started.
Breeders of certain types of dogs won't allow you to buy the dog unless you understand the needs of the breed so you can properly take care of them.

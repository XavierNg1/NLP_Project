 Write what you'd normally write for a blog post, in the language you're most comfortable writing it in.;
, If you're able to do this yourself, that's great. If you know you'll make errors, just let readers know it's your second language and that you'll appreciate hints on improving. If you have a friend or family member who speaks the other language well, ask them to read through your translation; they may even be willing to do the translation for you but remember that you won't be able to rely on this for always, unless they partner up on the blog with you.


How much you translate will depend on which option you opt for (read Part 2 below).
 In some cases, you may need to vary the translated content to account for differences in language and cultural context. Bear this in mind when translating the content.
 Stop, then write the remainder in the other language, to complete the bottom of the post.
 You don't want to make your readers confused, so explain why you do this somewhere in the blog's FAQs and in each blog, make a delineation of some sort. To do this latter effect, you can simply put a line between each language or you can make each language written in different format to distinguish one another. For example, language one in normal font, language two in italics.
, If your post is long, you can add a "page jump" to help your readers skip ahead to their language.
, Add it on your blog sidebar to organize them and to help readers to find all posts in specific language more easily.


You can also add a link on each post or page to send readers to the same content in the other language.
, Keep the blog names easy to remember and simple enough. You can also opt to leave your normal domain for language one and add certain domain in language two. For example: www.YourAddress.com and www.YourAddress.com/En.
 Make it obvious and easy to find.

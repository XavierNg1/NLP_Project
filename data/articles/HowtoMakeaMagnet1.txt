 A simple temporary magnet can be made with a tiny piece of metal, such as a paperclip, and a refrigerator magnet. Gather these items as well as a smaller piece of metal, such as an earring back or a tiny nail, that you can use to test the magnetic properties of the magnetized paperclip.

Experiment with different paperclip sizes, and uncoated versus coated paperclips.
Gather smaller objects in a range of sizes and metals to see which ones will stick to the paperclips.;
, Move it in the same direction, rather than back and forth. Use the same quick motion you'd use to light a match. Continue rubbing the paperclip with the magnet 50 times as quickly as you can.
 Does the small piece of metal stick to the paperclip? If so, you've successfully magnetized it.

If the metal won't stick to the paperclip, rub it 50 more times and try again.
Try picking up other paper clips and larger objects to determine how strong the magnet is.
Consider recording the length of time the paper clip stays magnetized after a certain number of rubs. Experiment with different types of metal, like pins or nails, to see which one makes the strongest, longest-lasting magnet.

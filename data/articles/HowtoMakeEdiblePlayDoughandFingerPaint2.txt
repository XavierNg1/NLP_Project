 The secret to making this dough is to mix well. Consider combining ingredients in an electric mixer for best results.


Combine the sugar, corn starch and water in a pan and simmer over low heat. Whisk frequently until mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency.





Remove from heat and allow it time to cool. Once it has cooled you can either separate into bowls and add color or make one batch of a single color.
 For both the play dough and finger paint activities, give the kids plenty of room to work in a well lit area. Also, supportive items work well too–food to support building with play dough and even brushes and other food items (such as gummy worms or small M&M’s) for finger painting.

 Wall colors like gold, purple and teal are perfect. Give her a huge bed and lots of furniture!, But don't give her a spider! Cleo is afraid of spiders!, Don't take this too far, as she wouldn't ever bully someone or take their food, but have her act like she owns the world. Occasionally, have her show her truly nice side and go out of her way to help someone else., Never have her do something that would hurt her pride! Always have her doing everything properly and better than perfect, but have her occasionally fail so she doesn't become a Mary Sue character., Never leave Cleo in the dark because she would freak out.

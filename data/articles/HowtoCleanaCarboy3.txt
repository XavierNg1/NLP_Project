 If your carboy does not completely clean after a general wash or soak, then you may need to use some elbow grease to scrub the sides of the carboy. Combine a small amount of either OxiClean or PBW with water. You only want to fill the carboy until it is half full., If you have a glass carboy, you can use a carboy brush to scrub the sides of the container. Typically these brushes have long wire handles that can be bent to get hard to reach places. They also have plastic bristles.If you are worried about scratching the carboy, cover the bristles with a soft cloth.
 If you have a plastic carboy, you should not scrub the sides using a traditional glass carboy cleaning brush. These brushes have rough bristles and metal handles that can scratch the plastic sides. Bacteria can enter the scratches, spoiling any beer or wine that is made in the carboy.Instead, insert a small soft cloth into the carboy. Then shake the carboy with warm water, cleaner, and the cloth inside. The cloth will help remove any grime that has developed on the sides.
Turn the carboy upside down to pour out the liquid and grab the cloth with your fingers.
 Fill the carboy about halfway with warm water. Shake the water around so that it touches all sides. Then, dump the water down the drain. Repeat this process until all of the cleaner has been removed.

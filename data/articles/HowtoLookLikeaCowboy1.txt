 One of the most identifiable elements of the cowboy style is a good leather boot with a hard wooden heel (Not actually wooden, is stacked leather). They can take some getting used to, since the heels and sharp toes are designed for fitting a on horseback. If you’re the kind of cowboy who doesn’t use his boots for much more than walking down the street, there are plenty of intricate and comfortable designs available.;
, When a cowboy is working, he needs pants that are both comfortable and durable. Most cowboys favor simple jeans, with straight legs or boot cuts.
 A hat is more than just an accessory for a cowboy – it performs essential functions. A cowboy hat is traditionally worn to keep a cowboy’s head cool, to keep the sun off of his face, and to keep flying dirt out of his eyes. Fancy designer hats are readily available, but a real cowboy prefers an old, worn in hat, whose shape has been formed only over years of hard and constant use. For a true cowboy hat, look for the Stetson or Bailey brands. Choose a beaver fur felt hat for cold weather, and a straw hat for the warmer seasons.

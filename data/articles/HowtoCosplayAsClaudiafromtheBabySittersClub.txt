 Claudia has long hair and is Asian, so a long black wig is a must for this. Even if you are not Asian, you can do this with a long black wig! Extra points for ponytails.;
, Claudia has one hole in one ear and two in the other, but you can use one pierced pair and one clip pair or three clip earrings.
 This is one of Claudia's trademarks.
 Claudia thinks things from health food stores are for the birds - literally. Rather, Pop Tarts are a good breakfast if you want to cosplay as her. Pizza is another good food choice for this cosplay, as long as it has no anchovies and none of such things as spinach or broccoli. Mushrooms, olives, onions and meat toppings are all great for this (best if it has all four!).
 Claudia is an artist to the nth degree. Here are some ideas for things that she may make, but feel free to make your own objects:



Paper doll food. Best for Claudia would be bacon, pizza, cookies, and burgers.

Paper people. Extra points if the person looks Asian or if it is an elderly woman (which would then represent Claudia's grandmother Mimi, who dies in book 26 of the series).

Clay dragons. This would also show off how proud she is of her Asian heritage!

, These are her favorite books.
 Claudia would never in a million years be caught doing nerdy things, and she hates studying.
 Claudia's skin is pretty much flawless.

 You can't help your teen if you often come across as angry, suffocating or unreasonable. You're seeking change - letting your emotions take over your logic may exacerbate the problem.


Remove yourself from the parent/child relationship. They aren't going to listen to you just because you're their elder. Think of how you would treat the situation if they were your equal. How would you try to get through to them? Staying level-headed will help you think clearly and make the best decisions.
 If you are losing sleep over this, you're not in the best shape to conquer these issues. At the end of the day, it's your teen who needs to overcome this, not you.


Don't feel guilty for taking time to yourself. It's important to rejuvenate and energize yourself before you try to take on topics that are exhausting. If you're beat down, it'll show. You'll become more easily exasperated and more likely to give up. Your teen needs you to stick with them. Take the time to be able to do just that.
 You may be making a mountain out of a molehill. What were your teenage years like? Your friends' and family's? Most acts of rebellion come in phases. Though you should take your son/daughter seriously and address the issues at hand, knowing that "this too shall pass" will be incredibly beneficial to your overall stress and ability to cope.


Happiness is contagious. If your teen sees that you're overwhelmed, exhausted and bitter, there will be no example for them to follow. They are still at an age where they need someone to copy; you can be that person.

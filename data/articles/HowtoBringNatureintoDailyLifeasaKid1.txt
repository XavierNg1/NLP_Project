 When you have uneaten food (which you shouldn't have), compost it! Make sure that you can recycle most of your products that you don't need!;
, Don't buy artificial products. Instead, learn how to cook or eat a raw carrot for a snack! Healthy trail mix can be a good snack, but make sure to also eat things like cabbage and apples! Even better, plant a tree for food!

, Sorry to disappoint you, but one kid isn't going to make a difference. Make posters about why you should protect the planet, and be proud of them. Spread them out in legal places, like home, school, or even an extracurricular. Have permission first, of course! You don't want to ruin our clean and tidy reputation with your troublemaker attitude!

, Try, as a family, to have a day without any electricity. For studying, get an encyclopedia. For games, try a board game. Use physical books to read. For food, pick crops; for heat, light a fire! However, make sure you have protection, or fire will spread.
 Â Have like-minded people who do good things for the environment in it. Have your plans for events and more. You can even have bake sales for nature! Be creative! Now, you have both protected the environment, and found many new friends to be with! It is a win for both sides of life!

, Don't have too much print on your T-shirts, and try and make them recyclable. Even if you see something in the Earth style that is bad for the environment, don't wear it. You can do better than to give in to that trash!

 When you have a greater understanding about various religions you would have to write pros and cons about each religion that has caught your interest. Making the list will simplify the choice of which religion to embrace. Remember, this is your list, not others'. Include only your opinions about the different religions. Religion is a very personal matter, so trust in what you believe yourself.


Truly think about which you believe to have the most merit, the most truth.
Think about which religion makes you feel the best, and the one you understand.Ask yourself which religions are to blame for the problems, hatred, and bloodshed of the era.
 The decision to choose a religion may not necessarily be personal. If your partner believes in a different religion, it could cause familial problems. If a new religion requires considerably more time than you are capable of devoting, it may be stressful to adopt.


If there is a preponderant religion in your country, culture, or family, you should seriously consider how it could negatively affect your life.
 What do you wish upon your death-bed for your future religion? Each religion handles the question of death differently. Some believe in reincarnation, others nirvana, Heaven, Hell, and every variation in between. If you live your life according the tenets of the religion, and believe wholeheartedly, whatâ€™s your preferred outcome?, Once you make the decision, religion requires commitment and faith. Make changes in your daily life that supplement beliefs and improves the trust you have in your religion. Consider a few of the following possible changes:


Pray more often. Prayer has been found to have a profound effect on people.
Increase your involvement. Go to more services, join choirs, study more regularly.

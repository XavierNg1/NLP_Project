 Find a stick that is between 12 and 18 inches long, and about as thick as your finger. Use sandpaper to smooth away any rough spots, especially on the top and bottom of the stick. Decorate your stick with silk flowers, fake leaves, glitter, and ribbon. You can add a large fake flower or butterfly to the top of your wand.
 Find a wooden dowel that is between 12 and 18 inches long. Draw squiggles and vines over the dowel using hot glue. You can also glue on some beads or jewels onto the dowel as well. Wait for the glue to set, then paint the entire wand a solid color using acrylic paint. The glue will give the wand an embossed look.


To create shadows, take a slightly darker color than the one your used for your wand, and apply it to the nooks and crannies of the designs. You can use a small paintbrush or even a Q-tip.
To create highlights, dip a folded paper towel into a slightly lighter color than the one you used for your wand, and gently rub it over your designs. You can also use silver or gold for this technique as well.
 Take two differently colored pipe cleaners and twist them together to make a striped stick. Bend another pipe cleaner into a fun shape, such as a star or heart, and twist it to your pipe cleaner stick using one of the loose ends. Tie a few long pieces of ribbon around the top of your wand, just under the fun shape.
 You can use anything you want for the topper, but don't decorate the glowstick itself. When you are ready to play with your wand, snap the glowstick and shake it to activate it.

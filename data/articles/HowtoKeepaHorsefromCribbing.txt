 Cribbing is often associated with boredom, so consider turning your horse out more with some other playful horses. Or, make his stall more interesting with some stall toys or constant access to quality forage. However, if your horse has been cribbing for a while, he may prefer to crib than play or eat.;
, These can be purchased at your local tack store, and are attached tightly around your horse's upper neck. They prevent your horse from breathing in very deeply, so he can no longer get the effect he seeks when he cribs. When he finds that there is no way to get high, he will stop chewing. However, he will never be cured, so he has to wear this collar whenever he is in his stall or turned out (if he cribs during turn-out). Be sure to remove the collar he is exercising, though, or he could potentially suffocate.
 These are quite simple: just scoop the right amount onto his feed once or twice a day. You might still want to use these in conjunction with another method, though, to guarantee success.
 They can't crib on something that isn't solid, and the bristles will give them a little reminder poke when they try to crib anyway. You could also try painting anti-chew treatment on the cribbed surfaces, or lining the surfaces with metal, as some horses find the metal uncomfortable to bite.
 Due to the way they have evolved, horses have a psychological need to chew almost constantly, but they should not be chewing on something that isn't edible.
, But don't try this with everything, as where their stall is might not be the problem.

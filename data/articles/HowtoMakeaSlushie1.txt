 Dissolving the sugar before you begin will help you avoid a grainy texture. Pour the sugar and water into a bowl and stir until you no longer see individual grains of sugar.;
, To imitate the classic slushie, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of your favorite flavored extract (like raspberry, strawberry, lemon, lime, coconut or vanilla) and 5 or more drops of food coloring. Use a long-handled spoon to stir it all together. You can add a little more flavored extract or coloring to taste. /images/thumb/4/4d/Make-a-Slushie-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Slushie-Step-3-Version-3.jpg

Do you love soda-flavored slushies? Make one by freezing you favorite soda to make ice cubes. Replace the water and ice with cold soda and soda ice cubes, and leave out the sugar.
Don't have time to buy flavored extract? You can use a packet of Kool-Aid powder in place of flavor and food coloring.
 Just pour the sugar water into your blender and add 2 cups of whole ice cubes. This method works best if your blender is powerful enough to grind ice finely, creating the classic slushie texture.

You might want to test-grind some ice cubes to make sure your blender can handle it; if not, just try another method.
If you like your slushies thinner, add another 1/2 cup of water. If you like a thicker, icier texture, reduce the water by 1/2 cup.
 Depending on the strength of your blender, it can take just a few pulses or several minutes to get the texture of a slushie. Keep going until the ice has been crushed and the mixture takes on the right consistency.

It can help to periodically stir the mixture with a long-handled spoon to help the ice circulate.
If your blender isn't quite powerful enough, transfer the mixture to a food processor and process it in batches.
 If you're happy with the flavor and level and sweetness, the slushie is ready. Add more sugar, flavoring, or food coloring to make the slushie just right. If you add extra ingredients, be sure to blend the slushie thoroughly., Divide the mixture into glasses and drink it through a straw for an authentic slushie experience. You'll have enough for two large or four small slushies.

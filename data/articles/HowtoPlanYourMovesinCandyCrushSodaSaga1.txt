 In this mode, the main goal is to match and clear the required number of soda bottles. The number of soda bottles you need to match and clear is indicated in the upper portion of the screen.;
, The soda bottles can be positioned in various parts of the board. Find them so you will know where to focus your matches.
 There may be levels where the soda bottles are located behind some obstacles. Clear out the obstacles as fast as you can so you can free up the soda bottles.
 Soda bottles can be cleared just like any of the candies, by matching it with similar-colored candies. Each soda bottle you clear increases the soda level.


You can also use the special candies to help you clear them faster.
Don’t pay too much attention to the other candies or obstacles on the board. Your sole focus should be on matching the soda bottles. Don’t waste your moves on matching the other candies.

They are also useful in reaching those hard-to-reach soda bottles on the board. Match these special candies with each other to get more awesome results.



Striped candy — A Striped candy is a special candy that results from matching four candies in a row. When you use a Striped candy as part of a match, it will clear out a whole row or column from the board. The direction is dependent on what direction the stripes are on the candy. Striped candies are useful in removing jellies and chocolate, when placed in the right position.

Wrapped candy — A Wrapped candy is a special candy that results from matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. This one’s more challenging and difficult to get as compared to a Striped candy. When you use a Wrapped candy as part of a match, it will first explode and knock out the nine candies surrounding it, and then it will drop and explode again, knocking out another nine candies the same way. Wrapped candies can be useful in removing obstacles within their explosion area, which can otherwise be difficult to get to.

Candy Bomb — A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place to swap with to form the five-in-a-row. Color bombs do not need to be matched in order to be used. You can just swap it with another candy, and all similar-colored candies will be removed from the board.

Jellyfish — A Jellyfish is a special candy that results from matching at least four candies in a box of 2 by 2. When used, a Jellyfish attacks an obstacle or a soda bottle, depending on the level. Jelly Fishes can be useful in removing obstacles or soda bottles from hard to reach areas, though they move in random.

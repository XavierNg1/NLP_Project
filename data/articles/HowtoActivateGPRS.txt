 You cannot activate GPRS on a phone that is not programmed for GPRS services. If you do not have the correct type of phone and/or SIM card, you will have to get a new one.;
, GPRS is available in over 200 countries. Shop around for a mobile phone service that provides GPRS and GPRS-equipped phones.
 The customer care department should be able to guide you through the steps necessary to activate GPRS services on your phone. The activation process generally requires 1 of the following 3 steps:


Calling your provider's automated GPRS activation service using the appropriate number code.
Sending an SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to activate GPRS. The message text will be a number or code word that your service provider can give you.
Accessing GPRS services settings through a menu on your mobile phone. Once your service provider gives you instructions to guide you to the appropriate menu, you can control the GPRS services settings on your phone, and sometimes access GPRS applications, depending on your service provider and the mobile telephone model you are using.

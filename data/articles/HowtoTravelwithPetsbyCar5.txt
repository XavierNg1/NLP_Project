It is important to ensure that your bird is secured in either a cage or a carrier suitable for its size.
If you own an avian harness, it is a great idea to put it on the bird so it can't fly about the car.
It is important to keep a consistent mild temperature so the bird will be comfortable. Any large changes in temperature can be harmful for birds.
 Use either seat belts, bungee cords, or other forms of suitable restraints. Secure the cage or carrier to the car so that the cage won't tumble, fall, or break open if a sudden change in motion is required while driving.

These are also known as baby carrots but don't confuse them with the small stubby carrots that are whittled down by machine for dipping and children's snacks. These are the whole carrot, at their young stage.
 Add a little oil and the salt. Crush the other thyme sprig and add to the carrots in the bowl. Stir it around a little to help the salt and thyme infuse the oil and coat the carrots., Add the carrots to the pan and cook. When one side of the carrots has caramelized, turn the carrots over and cook the other side. Each side will take around 4 to 5 minutes but keep an eye on it at all times. The carrots should be soft on the inside and crunchy and caramelized on the outside., Place onto a serving dish. Add salt and pepper, the lemon juice and the thyme oil made at the start. The carrots are now ready to be served.

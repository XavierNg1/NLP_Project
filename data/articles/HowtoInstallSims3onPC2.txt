 Origin is EA's digital distribution client. You can use it to purchase, download, install, and play Sims 3 and all of its expansions. You can download the Origin installer from origin.com/download. Origin is available for both PC and Mac.
 In order to start using Origin, you'll need an Origin account. If you already have an EA account, you can use it to log in. If you don't have one, you can create one for free when you launch Origin.
 You can use Origin to purchase Sims 3, or you can redeem your code for your physical version so that you don't need the disc. If you already own the disc version of Sims 3, or you purchased it online from another store, you can add the registration key to your Origin account.Click the Origin menu and select "Register Product Code". If you're using a Mac, click the Games menu instead of the Origin menu.
Enter the key that is printed in your game case or that came in your confirmation email.
 Sims 3 will typically begin downloading as soon as you add it to Origin. If it doesn't, find it in your My Games list. Click Sims 3 and then click the Download button that appears. The download may take a while, depending on your connection.


Origin will keep your copy of Sims 3 up to date with the latest patches automatically.

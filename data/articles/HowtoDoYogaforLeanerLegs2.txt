 Warrior III can be a bit harder than I or II, so try to get those two down first. Start in warrior I with your hands stretched upward. Lift the leg behind you into the air. At the same time, bring your torso forward. Your leg and your torso should end up in a straight line. You can continue to stretch your hands above your head (meaning out in front of you now), or you can move them to your side.Try holding this position for eight to ten breaths. Don't forget to do the other side, too.
 Bring your left knee up to your chest. With your right hand, grab your left foot. It's best to grab your left foot on the outer side. Use your left arm for balance by extending it backwards, then bring your left leg out in front of you. Go as far as you can, and hold for five breaths. Switch to the other side., For this position, you start in a squat. You knees should be far apart, but your toes should be touching. Place your hands flat on the floor in front of your feet. Using your inner thighs, put pressure on your arms with your thighs. Don't forget to keep your back straight.For an extra challenge, you can move into an arm balance, maintaining the squeeze on your arms, while you push your weight up onto your hands. Straighten your arms out and lift your body into the air, with your knees bent and balanced on the back of your upper arms.

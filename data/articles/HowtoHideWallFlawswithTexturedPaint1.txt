 Before applying any paint to a damaged wall, you need to clean the surface. If you don’t clean the surface, your paint job won’t be as effective as you want it to be. In the end, you might create textures you don’t want to create. Clean by:


Removing any dust, pet hair, or other grime from the surface. For example, take a vacuum or shop-vac and vacuum up spider webs or dirt.
Using a damp rag to wipe down the wall before you paint it.
Making sure to use soap or vinegar to remove any substantial dirty or scum from the wall.;
, While texture can hide minor or even moderate wall flaws, some flaws require you to fix them before painting. Fortunately, you won’t have to spend too much time fixing the hole because your textured paint will hide imperfections.


Either cut a new piece of drywall or use spackle to fill the hole.
Use joint compound to smooth over the patch.
Apply a second coat of compound, if you want.
Either smooth over or leave the compound or spackle textured., After you’ve cleaned the surface and fixed any major issues, you’ll need to choose how you’ll apply the paint to the wall. This is perhaps one of your most important decisions, as its perhaps the simplest way to add texture to your paint job. Decide what you want to use and:


Pick a roller with the type of texture you want. You can choose a smooth roller and apply your own texture after painting or you could pick a textured roller.
Use a brush to paint your wall. The brush will leave a light texture and you can go back later and add more.
Spray your paint on and apply more texture later.

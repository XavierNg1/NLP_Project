 For this method you should begin with cubic feet and end up with cubic yards. This method does not work for the opposite conversion (cubic yards to cubic feet). Make sure you are using cubic units and not square units, as the conversion rate will be different.
 For every 1 cubic yard, there are 27 cubic feet. This means that a cubic foot is 127{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{27}}} of a cubic yard. To find the conversion rate, you calculate 1รท27=.03703704{\displaystyle 1\div 27=.03703704}., This will give you the number of cubic yards that are equivalent to the given number of cubic feet. Since feet are smaller than yards, you will end up with fewer yards than feet after converting.

For example, if you want to convert 600 cubic feet to cubic yards, calculate (600)(.03703704)=22.2{\displaystyle (600)(.03703704)=22.2}. So, 600 cubic feet is equivalent to 22.2 cubic yards.

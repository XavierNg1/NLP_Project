 When you pull the trigger, there is no "click" (or "boom"). Sticking out the chamber is visible brass. This brass is what gives the type-2 malfunction the name "the stovepipe". It is also known as a failure to eject.
 The solution is the same as a type-1 malfunction: tap, rack/flip.

Load a full magazine into the gun.
Point at the target, pull the trigger, take note that there is no "click".
Visually see the brass sticking out of the chamber.
With the heel of your palm hit the bottom of your magazine (with some fervor â€” this is the "tap").
Then twist your gun 90-degrees to the right (so the ejection port is down) and...
Rack the gun by pulling the slide straight back and letting go; do not ride the slide forward, let it slam (this is the "flip" and "rack" part of the drill). This will drop the brass out of the chamber and load a new round into the chamber.

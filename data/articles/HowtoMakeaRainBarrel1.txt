 This is trickier than it sounds.


You will usually be placing your barrel under, or attached to, one of your existing downspouts. However, you need to ensure that the rain barrel uses a diverter or has an overflow to get rid of water pooling at your home's foundation.
A full rain barrel can weigh more than 400 pounds, so make sure you don't place it on anything that can't take this weight, or where it might do damage if knocked over.;
, This will depend on the size of your property, but the standard size is 55 gallons (208.2Â L).
 You can use plastic, rubber, or even wood. Metal can be used but is often not recommended. Just make sure your material is sealed and treated to hold water for a long time without leaking, rusting, rotting or decaying chemicals into the water.
 This may not be a big deal if your barrel is new, but make sure you remove any debris that may be left inside.
 A rain barrel is just a barrel with a hole in the top or side allowing water to enter from the downspout. It can have a filter or closed system to keep out debris and mosquitoes. It always has a spigot and/or drain valve near the bottom to connect a hose to or fill a bucket from. The rain barrel should also have a way to control overflow.

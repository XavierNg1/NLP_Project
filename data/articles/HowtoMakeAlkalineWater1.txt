 Before and after you alkalize your water, you should check to see what you water’s pH level is. Doing this will tell you how much of an adjustment will need to be made to your water. Water is naturally a 7 on the scale, but impurities in the water tend to tip the scale toward the left (more acidic). The ideal pH level for pure drinking water is an 8 or a 9, which is achieved through alkalizing the water., You can buy a pH kit at most health stores. The kit should come with pH strips and a pH color chart.
 Let the strip sit for a moment, and then compare the strip’s color with the colors on the chart. Note what your water’s pH level is and then alkalize your water by performing one of the methods listed below. After you alkalize your water, your water should be roughly 8 or 9 on the pH scale.
 When water is above a 7 on the pH scale, the water is basic, while water below a 7 is acidic. You want your water to be somewhere between 7 and 9.

 Lift the sofa forward so the back faces straight up into the air. Many upholstered sofas have a detachable back panel that you can lift to expose the inner frame. Locate and unfasten the velcro strips or snaps that secure the fabric to the frame’s base, then lift up the upholstered panel., Check the frames on each side of the sofa’s seats for the locking levers. At each side of the sofa’s main body, around where the top of the arm and back join, you should see a metal lever pointing in a downward position. If your sofa has a center console, you should see levers on the frames between it and the seats., If your sofa doesn’t have detachable strips of fabric that expose the frame, stick your hands into the rear seams on the sofa’s left and right sides. Check the seams between the center console and seats, if any are present. Feel within the seams for the locking lever pointed in a down position., Use a flat head screwdriver or, in a pinch, your fingertips to loosen and raise each lever and release the seat backs. After unlocking the levers, return the sofa to its normal position and carefully lift the back out of its frame.If your sofa has a pair of seats divided by a center console, lift each individual seat and console back out of its housing.

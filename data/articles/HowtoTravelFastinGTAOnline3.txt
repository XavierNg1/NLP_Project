 The entire state of San Andreas is an island; this means that you get around the island just by using the water. To find a boat, simply head to one of the docks that can be found all around the edge of San Andreas.
 Approach a boat you see on the docks and press the triangle (for PS4) or the Y button (for Xbox 360) on your controller to get in.
 Operating a boat is pretty much like driving a car: go forward, backward, left, or right using the arrow keys on your game controller. Boats can take you fairly quickly to where you need to go without having to drive through all the traffic in the city.

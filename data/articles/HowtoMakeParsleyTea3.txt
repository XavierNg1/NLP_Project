 Fill a small saucepan or tea kettle with 1 cup (250 ml) of purified water. Set the pan on the stove and bring the water to a steady boil.
 Rinse the parsley root under cool, running water, then use a sharp kitchen knife to roughly chop 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of parsley root.


While you can technically use the roots of leaf parsley, it's more common to use Hamburg root parsley, a separate cultivar with a much thicker root that resembles a white carrot.
If the parsley root appears dirty, rinse it under cool, running water and scrub away as much dirt as possible. You can also peel the root, but doing so isn't usually necessary.
 Place the chopped parsley root in the bottom of one teacup. Pour the water into the same cup, then steep the tea for about 10 minutes.


The taste of parsley root tea is somewhat milder when compared to parsley leaf tea, so it's usually best to wait the full 10 minutes to allow the flavor to develop. You can adjust this time to your personal tastes, however.
 Pour the contents of the teacup through a fine mesh strainer, catching the pieces of chopped parsley root inside. Collect the liquid tea in a separate teacup.
 Drink the parsley root tea immediately. You can serve it sweetened or unsweetened.


Consider using raw sugar or locally sourced honey in your tea for greater health benefits.

 This tab is on the ribbon menu, just below the highest row of icons.
 With Document Elements selected, Equation is the option farthest to the right, with a Ï€ icon. There are three options here:


Click the arrow next to the Equations icon for a drop-down selection of common equations.
Click the arrow, then click Insert New Equation to type your own.
Click the icon itself to open up a larger menu of equation options on the ribbon.
 If you prefer to use the top menu, select "Insert," then scroll all the way down to "Equation" in the drop-down menu.


Your text cursor must be at a blank point in the document to access this command. (For example, if you have an existing object selected, this command is greyed out.)

, Click the downward-facing arrow to the right of the equation box. A drop-down menu will appear with options to alter how your equation is displayed.


This menu also includes the "save as new equation" command, useful for equations you plan to use frequently. This adds the selected equation to the drop-down menu when you click the arrow next to the Equations icon.

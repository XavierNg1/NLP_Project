 A wolf. If you are a member, you can use a cheetah. If you remove some markings, it is the closest in shape and color to a cat. You can also use a fox, as cheetahs are not currently in stores. If you want to be logical, be a tiger because tigers are feline, while wolves are canine. Use bunnies for kits and apprentices.


Some suggestions: For a kit, choose a bunny. For an apprentice, choose a fox. For a warrior and higher ranks, choose a wolf.;
, Brown, black, yellow, orange, grey, blue-gray, or white will do. Underbelly colors like white, light grey, and peach are good.
 Names such as "delicate rosebush" or "power cat" will not work. Choose names that go with nature, or basic colors, also body parts of a cat. For example: Brackentail, Thistleclaw, Whitestorm, Flametail, etc. If you have not read the books, names ending in "paw" is for apprentices, and "kit" for kits(kittens).
 Say things like "grooms paws", "eats prey", "flicks tail", etc.
 Go to Jamaa Township or Sarepia Forest, and say "needs clan". this way, it will be easier to find a clan., This is for warriors and older apprentices. You can practice with you fellow clanmates. For example, you can say "pounces on" and the other cat can say "pins down"., you should go hunting with several other members of your clan. Most clans would go for voles, and rabbits., This is an uncommon occasion, but it does happen. This is what all your training paid off for, so used the best of your skills to battle other clans!, This happens at least once a week. It's when a bunch of clans come together and talk about new events in their clan. For example, the leader of your clan says "Leafkit has just become an apprentice. he is now Leafpaw!" During a gathering, there shall be no fighting or the truce will be ended.

Now on the edge, cut a ¼ circle. But before you cut, draw out with a marking pencil. This will be the skirt.;
,, Though you can use any design and pattern of your choice, I tried to make it simple and hence cut it normally with a general neckline and sleeve. But a measurement is a must, so before you cut the top, get the perfect measurement of your body – chest and sleeve length.


When cutting the top portion, fold the cloth equally in half, this can be easy as everything is equal.
If you cut in this way, then you have to cut ¼ of your actual measurement, but cut a bit bigger for the seam allowance.



Stitch the part into the neckline and fold it inward to get the proper finish line.



To get the perfect and similar measurements for the hands, take the cloth and make 4 folds and cut the sleeve. Layer two pieces of clothes in half and cut into a crescent shape.
You can make ruffles with the cut out portion of the sleeve.
When you are done with this you can either pin it to the arm and sew it later, or sew at this time only.



For the skirt part, I cut out couples of strips of white fabric and lay it over the skirt, in the way I showed in this picture. Ruffles will be made out of this.
It will look something like this.
You need to sew the edge of each fabric, and then sew it to the main cloth.
When sewing it to the main cloth, you need to arrange this in a circular bottom.
Repeat this step for every layer.
Now just sew the side edges of the ruffles.



You can also add lace to the sleeve and neckline.

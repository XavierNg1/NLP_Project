 The "loop" is one of the most popular and traditional ways to tie a blanket scarf. Fold your scarf in half. Gather it in the center and place it around the back of your neck.Allow one side to hang down a little more than the other by about four to five inches., Bring it all the way around, so that it’s in front again. Drape it loosely – you don’t want it to be too tight. You’ve now created the loop, which should be right under your neck in the front. Slide the long end of the scarf through the loop.Adjust your scarf accordingly. If you aren't happy with the initial result, undo it and try again. It takes a bit of practice to get right!
Feel free to allow the long end to hang over your shoulder rather than slipping it through the loop at the end, which is the most basic scarf look., Also known as the bandana, the kerchief is another standard blanket scarf look. Fold your scarf from corner to corner to create a triangle. Pick up the scarf, one corner in each hand. Pull it up around your neck and cross the ends behind your head. Then pull those ends back around to the front again.You can leave the ends dangling in front if you like. You can also tuck the ends under the rest of your scarf for a more polished look.Make adjustments as needed.
 This is also known as the cape look. It’s very simple and will keep you the warmest because it covers most of your upper body. Hold the scarf out in front of yourself, then swing it around so that you’re holding it behind you like a cape. Drape the scarf on your shoulders and pull each end around to the front.


Allow both ends to dangle in front. Both arms should be covered from shoulder to forearm.
Make your adjustments until you’re satisfied with the results.

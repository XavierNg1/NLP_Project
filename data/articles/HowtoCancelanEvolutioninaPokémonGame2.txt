 This is a special item that gives you a more efficient way to prevent a Pokémon from evolving. While the Pokémon "holds" the Everstone, it will not evolve, even if all of the normal conditions for evolution are met.


Everstones are only in games from Generation II onward.In other words, they do not appear in the original Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow games.
 Open the Items menu and assign the Everstone to be held by the Pokémon you want to evolve. The Pokémon can hold the item the same way it would hold a berry or similar item. While it is holding the Everstone, it will not evolve from leveling up.
 There is one important exception to the Everstone's effects. Pokémon like Eevee that require an evolutionary stone to evolve will still evolve if you use the stone on them, even if they're holding the everstone., In these games, you can find Everstones:

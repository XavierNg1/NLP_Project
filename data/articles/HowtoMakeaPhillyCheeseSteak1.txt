 A thin cut of steak will cook very quickly and will let the different flavors — cheese, onions, peppers — intermingle, with your bread as the bed.


You can cut the partially-frozen steak with a large, sharp chef's knife, or you can use a commercial meat slicer for easy preparation and uniform thickness. Most people won't have a meat slicer; a sharp knife will do just fine, even if it takes a bit longer.;
, In a large skillet coated with a neutral oil, fry the onions and (if desired) peppers until both are translucent and barely browned on the edges. Stir occasional and salt as necessary. Remove and set aside when finished.
 Allow the meat to brown without stirring or agitating. At a high enough heat — and depending on the thickness of the meat — this process should only take one or two minutes. Do not overcook.
 Once the steak is chopped into smaller bits, turn it over to ensure that it's cooked on both sides. Cook for no longer than 30 seconds.
 You are going to be placing your roll directly on top of the steak, so make sure that your mound of meat is roughly the size of the roll.
, What kind of hoagie roll should you choose? In the Tri-state area where cheesesteaks are king, Aversa, Amoroso, and Vilotti-Pisanelli are commonly used as hoagie rolls.


If you can't find any of these brands, however, you can try making your own Italian roll or using French bread. French bread is a little crispier than what is usually used, and it's not ideal, but it won't fall apart easily and is a pretty substantial bread.
 The contents of your cheesesteak should fit nicely inside your roll.

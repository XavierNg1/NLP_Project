 Find the power switch for your combination amp and set it to the on position. Make sure that your amp is plugged into a power source before doing this. Check the gain and volume knobs on both your amp and your pedal before turning your amp on. Make sure that these knobs are all turned down, or you may get feedback when you plug in your guitar.
 Turn the pedal on and off by pressing down on it with your foot. There should be an indicator light that looks similar to the indicator light on your combination amp.
 When working with multiple pedals, you can connect them together to create various effects. Do this by connecting small instrument cables from the output of one pedal into the input of the next pedal. You can chain pedals like this to create different kinds of sounds, or to have different effects at your fingertips.Common pedals include tuner, reverb, overdrive, blues, and loop pedals., Some rules and techniques when chaining your pedals together can improve the sound. For example, tuner pedals should come first because pedals that alter the tone of your guitar may throw off the tuner. Pedals that amplify noise like overdrive, compressors and wah pedals should go next. Pedals that modify the tone, like chorus and tremolo pedals should go after amplifier pedals, and should be followed by pedals that adjust the guitars ambiance, like reverb or delay pedals.


Pedals that amplify the tone or volume should go before pedals that adjust or modify the tone, though you can mix this up to get some interesting effects.

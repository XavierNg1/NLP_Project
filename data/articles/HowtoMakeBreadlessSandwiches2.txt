 You can either grill or broil the mushrooms. To grill, preheat the grill to 450 °F (232 °C) (232 Celsius). Alternately, you can preheat your oven broiler and put the rack on the top third of the oven. While you are waiting for the oven or grill to heat up, remove the steps of the portabella mushrooms. Brush the mushrooms with the olive oil and sprinkle a bit of sea salt on top of them. Grill or broil them for four or five minutes per side., Slice the halloumi into desirable, relatively thin slices (e.g., half an inch thick). Grill it for two minutes per side on high heat. The halloumi should be soft and emit an aromatic, salty smell., The portabella mushrooms will be your bun. On top of one portabello mushroom cap, place the grilled hallumi cheese, slice of tomato and basil leaves. Add the balsamic vinegar and the freshly ground pepper. Then, place the other mushroom cap on top. Repeat this process for the other burger.

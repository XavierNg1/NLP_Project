 Although yielding may change based on the situation, the general rule is that cyclists yield to both hikers and equestrians, while hikers yield only to equestrians.Look for posted signs at the trailhead (or along the trail) that will dictate who should yield to who.
To yield the trail to a horse and rider, either move far to the side of the trail, or step off on the downhill side.
 If a horse—or group of horses—are approaching you from behind, it is the lead rider’s responsibility to call out and alert you. Be courteous, and step off the trail if the rider asks you to.


Even if horses are approaching from behind you, they still have the right-of-way on the trail.
 This will comfort the horse, by letting it know that you are a person, and not some strange object beside the trail. You can also check with the rider to see if the horse is skittish and needs plenty of space to pass, or if it’s comfortable and you can stay on the trail.


Say something like, “Hi. I’m happy to stay off the trail until you pass, but let me know if your horse is comfortable with people and I’ll keep walking.”
When yielding the trail to a horse, stay in full view. You may scare the horse if you step behind a tree or boulder., If you’re hiking as part of a large group, make sure that all members of the group have a similar understanding of trail etiquette.All members of your party should yield simultaneously. If the lead hiker encounters a horse, she should communicate that all members of the hiking group need to step off the trail.
 Once you have stepped off the trail (or to one side, if it’s wide), don’t more around much or make loud sounds (including shouted conversation).Horses can still get spooked by people or things on the side of the trail.


Be courteous to both horse and rider by standing still and relatively quietly.
Once the horse has moved 15-20 feet down the trail, you (and your party, if applicable) can resume your way down the trail.

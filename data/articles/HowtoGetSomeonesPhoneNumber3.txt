 Once you’ve gotten their phone number, don’t linger. Instead, walk away calmly and either leave the scene or hang out in a different area.
 Although you have their number now, don’t take that as a sign to call them immediately. Wait at least 24 hours before making a move and giving them a call.
 Although texting offers an emotional shield, it is distancing and impersonal. For a much more personal conversation, call them. This goes for the first or the fortieth time you get a hold of them; calling is almost always preferable to texting.
 This is just another person, right? So don’t become anxious and worried the first time you actually use their number. Keep calm and collected and it will show, making you even that much more attractive to them.

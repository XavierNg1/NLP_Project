 You need to realize that even if it's a cloudy day, the sun rays can still affect skin the same on a sunny and clear day.;
, Riptides and undercurrents can make a seemingly gentle ocean suddenly become dangerous when they start pulling people out to sea. 80 percent of lifeguard rescues are due to rip currents. Checking surf reports to see if there are any storms that can churn up the ocean is also important if you plan on snorkeling or sailing.
 This is extremely important if children are coming. Remember, just because there are lifeguard towers, doesn’t mean they will be on duty while you’re swimming. Some lifeguards are only on duty until 5 or 6 PM. Ask the lifeguards where the safest places are for children to swim.
 Make sure you are fully equipped with everything you may need including:


Fully stocked first aid kit
Prescription medications including inhalers or Epipens.
Swimsuits and shoes
Sunscreen of at least 30 SPF
Map of the area
Umbrellas for shade
Beach towels and blanket
Cooler with ice, drinks, and bottled water
Food like sandwiches, jerky, crackers, trail mix, cookies, and fruit.
Chairs
Beach toys

, Never leave a child unattended at the beach. Even though lifeguards are present, never assume they will watch over little children or specific individuals. They are there to scan and watch the waters for animal and water dangers, as well as the general beach-goers.
 To protect your head and spine, always go feet first. It may be more shallow than you estimated and there may be sharp rocks below.
 Prolonged sun exposure and sweating can leave you dehydrated before you even realize what’s happened. Avoid tea and caffeinated sodas because they act as diuretics and can dehydrate you even more. Water and sports drinks like Gatorade are good for replacing lost water and electrolytes.
 Many beaches prohibit alcohol, pets, fishing, campfires, and restrict vehicles on the sand.

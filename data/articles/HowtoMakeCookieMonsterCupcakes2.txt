 Use your favorite cupcake recipe and bake as many as you'd like to decorate as Cookie Monster. You could make vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, or a combination of these. Ensure that you let your cupcakes cool completely on a wire rack before frosting or decorating them.


You can bake the cupcakes a day or two before you need to frost and decorate them. Just store them in an airtight container at room temperature until you're ready to decorate.
 Dip your offset spatula into a small bowl or can of blue frosting. Scoop out enough frosting to easily spread over the top of each cupcake. Ensure that you spread frosting evenly over the tops so that the entire top is covered.You don't have to be too detailed with perfect frosting technique since the cupcake will be covered with sprinkles and decorated.
 Shake about 1/2 cup of blue sprinkles into a small bowl. Hold each cupcake near the bottom and turn them upside down. Dip the tops of the cupcakes into the sprinkles and twist them around so that the frosting is completely coated in blue sprinkles.Try to choose blue sprinkles that match the color of Cookie Monster.
 Dab a little frosting onto the backs of white chocolate buttons. Set two white chocolate buttons on each cupcake for the eyes. Use your tube of black icing to squeeze little circles on the buttons to make the pupils. You should also use the tube to squeeze a mouth onto each cupcake.If you really want the mouth to show up underneath the cookie, you'll need to make it very large or wide.
 Break one chocolate chip cookie and stick one half directly onto each mouth. The chocolate chip cookie should be sticking out a little so that it looks like the Cookie Monster is eating it.You could also use a chocolate sandwich cookie instead of chocolate chip.

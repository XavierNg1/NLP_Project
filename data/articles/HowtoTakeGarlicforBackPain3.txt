 Fry 10 cloves of garlic in 2 oz. (60 ml) of coconut or sesame oil. Heat the oil on low heat in a frying pan, and keep the cloves of garlic in the pan until they are brown.


Strain the garlic cloves away and keep the oil in a small glass jar. This can be used for a few days after making it.
 Massage the garlic into the skin.
 Wash it off with soap and water. Try taking a warm bath to increase the effects of the oil on tight or sore muscles.

 In Chicago style, you provide almost a whole reference page citation as a footnote instead of just using the author’s last name. Click at the end of the sentence where you want to cite your source. Use the author’s first and last name. For example:


“Ashley Hess,”.
 Follow the author’s name with a comma and then write out the name of the book that you are citing. Make sure to write the title in italics. For example:


“Ashley Hess, Evaporation”

, Use parenthesis next, and inside the parenthesis, put the place of publication, a colon, the publisher, a comma, and the year of publication. For example:


“Ashley Hess, Evaporation (Sedona, Arizona: Dry Books, 2003),” Follow that with comma.
 Finally, add the page number where you found the information: “Ashley Hess, Evaporation (Sedona, Arizona: Dry Books, 2003), 33.”

 This only applies to hydraulic brake systems. If you have hydraulic brakes, then the fluid will occasionally need to be bled and replaced.








Make sure you don't get a lot of air bubbles in your replacement fluid. This can lead to the brakes feeling soft.Never use mineral oil as brake fluid if your user's manual specifies DOT (Department of Transportation-approved brake fluid).Likewise, never use DOT if your manual tells you to use mineral oil.' If you mixed up your fluids last time you bled the system, then that might be your problem., There are several kinds of hydraulic systems, and each is a little bit different. Look to your manual for step-by-step instructions. If you can't access your manual, try to figure out exactly what type of hydraulic system you have, and then find online instructions for that specific system. If you're still having trouble, then consider visiting a bike shop.
 The calipers are the part of the bike that actually squeeze the brake pads to the tire. Here's how to adjust them:









Unscrew the brake pads, located on the inside of the brake calipers above your tires. The brake pad is the small piece of rubber on the lower inside of the caliper that actually comes into contact with the wheel.Adjust the brake so that it is 3 - 5 mm from the rim.
Tighten the brake pad. Spin the wheel in the air and test the brakes. Adjust further as needed., If all else fails, then it may be most efficient to ask a professional to fix your brakes. Look for a reputable bike shop or mechanic in your area.


Read bicycle shop reviews online before you visit. You should be able to get a good sense for whether the mechanics there are helpful.

 Assuming you are not a member, you should highly consider this option. For only around $6 a month, you could greatly increase your characters skills and equipment, as well as have more fun!;
, This could take a few months, however.
 90-100 is a good level for barrows armor. If you have 70 defence, consider saving up to buy a set. The best protection is Torags, while also being the cheapest. However, the other sets offer a special ability. If your one of the wealthier players, you should look more into this.
 Good weapons mean high levels of strength and attack. Try getting these both up to at least 70. Then, you could use the weapon provided with your barrows set, or even get a whip if your richer. Whips are extremely powerful, and even higher-level players use them. Also, carry a DDS(Dragon dagger), preferably with the highest application level of poison. They're special attack is devastating, and the DDS is extremely cheap.
 My favorite place to train at is the Ankous in the highest level of the Stronghold of Security, in Barbarian Village. These are great exp and they also will drop up to a few hundred K gold every hour, if your a high level. Also, if you have guthans you may never have to go bank for a long time. Always pick up the battlestaves, they are 10k each., Woodcutting, fishing, and mining are ideal. Barrows is also a great place to get cash, if you have luck.
 If you enjoy the game you won't give up on the game. Listen to music as you play to spice up your gameplay, as the RuneScape music can be boring as hell. Eventually, through perseverance and determination, (and time), you will be a high level with great equipment, and a huge sum of cash. Don't give up!

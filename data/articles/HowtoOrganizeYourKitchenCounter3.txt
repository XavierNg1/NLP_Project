 Your kitchen counter will become cluttered if you do not put things away after using them. Make a rule in the kitchen that everything gets put away after it’s used.For example, if you pour cereal, put it back in the cabinet. If you pull out three spatulas to find the right one, put them back in the draw. Make a rule that nothing gets left on the counter when it already has a designated spot.
 The kitchen counter may also be a catch-all for junk mail, kids’ homework, car keys, and electronics. Clear these items off of the counter and move them where they need to go. Make a rule that if it isn’t used in the kitchen, it doesn’t get set on the counter.It also helps to have a basket designated for this type of stuff, so that it is at least corralled into one spot.
 Counters become cluttered little by little. Avoid ending up with a pile on the counter by clearing it off each night. Removing one day’s worth of dishes and other assorted items is easier than cleaning off a week’s worth. Remove everything and put it where it needs to be. Then give the counter a quick wipe with a wet rag.

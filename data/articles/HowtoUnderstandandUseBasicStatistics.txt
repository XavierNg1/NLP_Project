,,,, How that is done will depend on your software. Chances are, it will have a grid like appearance.
 Basically, you are asking the program to come up with (in this instance), the mean (5.5), the mode (6), and the median (6).


Note that the software doesn't have to lay the information out in a straight line to come up with the answer.
 These numbers indicate that if this was a room full of children (24 of them), that the average age (the mean) is 5.5 years old. The mode of six would indicate that there are more six year old children than any other age in the room. The median is indicated by taking the set of (1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9) and counting 12 in from each side. In this instance, it puts you straight in the middle of the sixes and therefore the median is six. You would add the numbers (in this case 6+6), then divide by two, which of course, would be 6.
 You can use stats to tell about percentage of games won, percentage of games won versus another team, etc.
, Divide the number of wins by the total number of games.
 Divide the number of losses by the total number of games.


Divide one by four to get a win percentage of 25%.
Divide three by four to get a loss percentage of 75%.


Washington Redskins with 3 wins and 2 losses. This would, seemingly, be comparing apples and oranges, because of the different number of games played.

Divide three by five for a win percentage of 60%.
Divide two by five for a loss percentage of 40%.


With this information, you can tell that the Redskins are easily outplaying the Vikings at this juncture.

In the 2000 census, Thurston County, Washington had a median income of $46,975, compared to a national median income of $41,994. By dividing 46,975 by 41,994, you can figure out that Thurston County's median income is 11% higher than the national median income.
Also in the 2000 census, McDowell County, West Virginia's median income was $16,931 and the national median income was $41,994. Divide 16,931 by 41,994 to see that McDowell County is 40% below the national median.

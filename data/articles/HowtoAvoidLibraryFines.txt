 If this isn't clear, ask the librarian. Just taking notice of this is important, as it settles deep inside your subconscious as a reminder.;
, You have to read at a pace that's good for you. Even if you did pace yourself and still need some more time, just renew the book! Next time think about reading a little more each night.


When you're too lazy to read one day, then make up those missed pages the next day, so you always are on track!







, That will help you to remember when it's return time., Mark when the book is overdue, so that it's impossible to miss the return date. If you have a cell phone, set a reminder there too, just to be extra safe.
 Go with a friend to the library, if you want read the same book. Or get a different book that has close to the same amount of pages. Make sure that you both have the same overdue dates. You guys can read together and tell each other your point of view about the respective book.
 For example, on your bedside table, or in your schoolbag (it depends if you need the book for school or if it is just for leisure). This way, you will always see the book.


If you have it in your schoolbag or other bag, make sure you don't leave it at school in a classroom or at work on your desk. This could cause you to lose the book, and gain an even larger fine.
 Set a regular weekly time to look up your library account online, to see what books you have checked out and when they're due back. That way, you'll always be across the due dates and know what's coming up for return shortly., If you don't have a ride, walk, ask a friend, or take a bus.
 The staff will remember you and you will start to like going there again.

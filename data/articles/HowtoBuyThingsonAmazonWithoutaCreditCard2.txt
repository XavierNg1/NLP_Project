 If you have a US-based checking account, you can link it with Amazon and deduct purchases directly from your bank balance. You'll need to create an Amazon account if you don't have one already.


You cannot use savings, corporate, or business bank accounts., You can find this by hovering over your name in the upper-right corner of the Amazon home page and selecting "Your Account."

, You'll find this in the "Amazon Wallet" section of the account page.
 A form will appear.
 Refer to one of your checks to find your routing number and your account number. The routing number identifies the bank.


The routing number is the leftmost number at the bottom of your check and is nine digits long.
The account number is located to the right of the routing number. Make sure you don't include the check number on the right end.
 This is required for purchases made with a bank account as a way to identify you.
 Amazon will verify that you've entered the correct routing number, and the payment method will be added to your account.
 Now that you have your bank account associated with your Amazon account, you'll be able to select it as the payment method when making a purchase.

 The polygrapher may try to convince you that he or she is on your side and will help you out if you’ll just be truthful. This is deception; don’t buy it.
 Polygraphers will frequently attempt to instill fear in the subject or convince the subject of the accuracy of the polygraph machine. The theory is that the more you fear that you may be caught, the greater your physiological reactions will be. Don’t believe the hype. The polygrapher may also try to elicit reactions from you based on fear. For example, he or she may say that you need to wash your hands so the machine can accurately read your sweat output. A hidden camera in the bathroom may then catch the subject going into the bathroom as directed, but not washing his or her hands.

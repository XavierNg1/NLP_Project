 Princeton University developed a Chrome plugin called Facebook Ad Highlighter that partially hides Suggested Posts by fading them to a near-translucent state.The extension also ads the text “This is an ad” to help you distinguish ads from regular posts. This should make ads easy to ignore.


This method will not work on mobile devices.
Use this method along with Adblock Plus to get as close as possible to an “ad-free” Facebook.
 A list of Chrome apps and extensions will appear.
 Type “Facebook Ad Highlighter” into the search field and press ↵ Enter or ⏎ Return. Scroll down to the “Extensions” section, where you’ll find Facebook Ad Highlighter in the search results.
 A pop-up window appears, asking you to confirm that you want to install the extension.
 This icon indicates that the extension is now running.
 Scroll down your news feed to see the new look of Suggested Posts.


You can use Adblock Plus to hide other ads on Facebook, such as those shown on the right side of the screen.

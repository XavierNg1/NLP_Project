 Once everyone is in the water the Shark yells, "Sharks and Minnows!" or "Shark attack!" at any time to start “tagging” players. When the Shark yells this, the Minnows' goal is to reach the other end of the pool without being tagged by the Shark.If the Shark tags a Minnow, that Minnow becomes a Sharkand joins the Shark's team. They now begin tagging Minnows to turn them into Sharks.
When the Minnows have made it to the other side of the pool without being tagged, they wait. The Shark calls “fishy, fishy...” again and they try to return to the other side of the pool. The original Shark calls, "Shark Attack" and the process repeats.
 The last remaining Minnow is the winner. This player becomes the Shark in the next round.It becomes harder as more and more Minnows become Sharks. The game lasts until there is only one Minnow left.


If you started out with more than one Shark, the last two Minnows become the next Sharks.
 Begin the next game with the winner from the last round, the new Shark. They now stand in the center of the pool and the Minnows line up on the pool deck facing the Shark. Let the game begin.

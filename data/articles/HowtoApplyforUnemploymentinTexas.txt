 Texas, like other states, requires that you meet a certain minimum taxable income in order to qualify for unemployment benefits. They will look at the first 4 of the last 5 quarters as a "base period." Essentially, then, you must have made at least a minimum income for the full year preceding the last quarter, before you applied for benefits. If you do not have enough taxable wages from employment in the base period, you aren't eligible for unemployment benefits.
You must have wages within more than 1 of the 4 base period quarters to be eligible.
If you've ever previously qualified for unemployment benefits in Texas, you must have earned at least 6 times your new weekly benefit amount since that time. What that means is that if you were previously receiving unemployment, then got another job, before losing the new position, you will need to have earned a certain amount in order to requalify. For example, if you made an average of $200 weekly, you must have earned at least 6 times that amount, or $1200, in the interim time before becoming eligible for unemployment benefits again.;
, If you quit your job, or if you were fired for cause, you will not be eligible for unemployment benefits. If you were laid off, or lost your job because of a "reduction in force", you may be eligible for unemployment benefits/If you left your job due to domestic violence or stalking, you may be eligible for unemployment benefits.
If you were forced to quit your job rather than be fired, you may be eligible for unemployment benefits.
If you chose to leave your job to move with your military spouse, you may be eligible for unemployment benefits.
 This means that you must register with the state workforce center, and apply for a certain number of jobs per week.

If you are offered a job while receiving unemployment benefits, you must accept the job.If you have a disability, you may not qualify for unemployment benefits unless you can prove that you are willing and able to work with necessary accommodations.
To qualify as "able" to work, you must be legally considered physically and mentally capable of work. Most people are considered able to work unless they qualify for disability support.

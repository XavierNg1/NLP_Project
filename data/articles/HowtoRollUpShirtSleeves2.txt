 Unbutton any "gauntlet" buttons up the sleeve, too. If you're wearing cuff links, remove them.
 Flip it back so that the inside fabric is showing. The fold should be right where the cuff meets the sleeve of the shirt.
 Fold the cuff back once more at a width equal to the initial fold. Making sure both folds are equal gives this look a neater appearance.
 Examine the cuff to make sure the corners are tucked in so that the folds will stay in place. If you're wearing a shirt made of slippery fabric, secure the cuff in place with a safety pin. Repeat on the other side.









This type of cuff looks good if you're wearing a sweater over your shirt. Hike up the sweater sleeves a bit before you begin, then adjust them so that the tips of the sleeves fall just above the cuffs.
This type of cuff is also a good option for a dress shirt that you don't want to wrinkle by cuffing it all the way up to your elbow.

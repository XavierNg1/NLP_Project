, Spread the mixture as evenly as possible. Aim to have crust about a third of a centimetre or one eighth of an inch thick.
 This will allow it to set and harden before adding a filling of your choice.
 It may need to be returned to the refrigerator to chill the filling to the same temperature as the crust or you can keep the pie in the refrigerator until serving time for the sake of keeping it at the right temperature.
 To serve, simply cut as for a normal pie, into pie slices. Use a spatula to remove a slice and slide it onto a plate.

 It's located at https://www.facebook.com/. If you're already logged into Facebook, doing so will open your News Feed.


If you aren't logged into Facebook, first enter your email address (or phone number) into the top-right corner of the screen and click Log In.
 This arrow is in the top-right side of the Facebook page, to the right of the question mark icon. There are a couple of settings options in the ensuing drop-down menu:



Activity Log - View and, if necessary, remove likes, comments, and posts you've made anywhere on Facebook from within this menu.

News Feed Settings - Change the priority order of posts in your news feed, choose which content you don't want to see, and unfollow people.

Settings - Your Facebook's general settings, privacy constraints, payment information, and notifications preferences all live here.
 Doing so will take you to that option's page, allowing you to review (and make changes to) the settings there.


You will need to click Save on most pages on which you make a change in order to save your preferences.

 Some lizards can move fast, while others move slow. If you find a lizard, you will need to act quickly to catch it. If it scampers off -- behind a piece of heavy furniture, for instance -- you will need to wait for it to reappear before making your move.


If the lizard is hiding out somewhere for a long time, you may need to resort to using a trap.;
, You should move your hands around and toward it to guide it in a certain direction. For instance, if you want it to go to the right, move your hand toward it from the left. Keep it away from doors, windows, and air vents. Direct it to an area free of clutter with a good line of sight. When you’ve cornered the lizard, it will not be able to escape.


Slowly make your way towards the lizard. If it starts to run, stop moving and it will probably stop running.
You can quirt cold water on a lizard to get it to slow down or stop entirely.
 Aim the open face of the box toward the lizard. If the lizard is climbing a wall, you or a friend will need to hold the box in place along the lizard’s path.


Once the lizard has entered the box, cover it with another piece of cardboard to keep the lizard trapped within. Ensure the lid has several small holes punched in it so the lizard can breathe.
If the lizard is not interested in entering the dark cardboard box, you can direct the lizard into the box by shooing him inside gently with a broom. Push the lizard toward the box with the broom, touching only its side, tail, and back legs.
Do not hit the lizard with the broom.

You must have a GPA of 2.5 or higher to pursue most anti-money laundering certificate programs after obtaining you associate’s degree.
 Some universities offer certificate programs specializing in anti-money laundering investigations. Enroll in one of these and complete the required courses.An average certificate program for this field requires about 18 credit hours of specialized course work.
The courses may be offered online or in person.

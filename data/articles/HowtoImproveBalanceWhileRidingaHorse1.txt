 Once you have mounted, you can start to find your balance. Sit in the lowest part of the saddle.Do not lean too far forward or back or your balance may be off. If the horse won’t stand still, you can have another person hold the reins while you mount and find your balance.;
, Place your feet in the stirrups, with the balls of your feet pressed against the stirrups and your heels pointed towards the ground. Your legs should not be in front of your body. Imagine a straight line drawn down through your ears, shoulders, hips, and heels.Your body should not be rigid. Make sure you’re sitting up straight and keeping your shoulders relaxed. Allow your body to communicate with the horse so that you can adjust your balance as you ride. Do not arch your back or hunch.You may find it helpful to have someone take a photo of you in the saddle so you can see and analyze your own alignment. This allows you and your trainer to critique how you’re sitting and make any changes.
 Do not rest your weight entirely on your seat or tail bones. Instead, allow your whole body to help you maintain your position on the horse. Keep your shoulders rolled back and your gaze looking forward to keep this posture.It may be tempting to squeeze the horse with your thighs, calves, or knees. Instead of pressing in on the horse with one part of your leg, each part of your leg should have an even amount of contact with the horse., If you do not have strong balance on a horse, you may be tempted to clench the reins or hold them tightly to yourself. This interferes with the communication between you and the horse. Instead, hold your elbows so that they line up with the horse’s mouth. Hold the reins tightly enough to control the horse, but do not yank or restrict the horse’s movements.

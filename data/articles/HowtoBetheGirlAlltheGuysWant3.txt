 Don't give away too much information about yourself, and try to allude to fantastic or strange things you have done. You don't have to lie or be disingenuous, you can tell a story that expands upon your experiences in a thrilling way.


For example, instead of explaining how you know an obscure fact about baseball, instead laugh, say, "A girl has her ways. Maybe I'll tell you sometime," and breeze forward in the conversation.
 You don't have to arbitrarily shoot down plans or minimize your time with the boys to next to nothing, but by making yourself scarce you'll make the levels of dopamine (the pleasure chemical) rise, which will make finally being able to see you a real treat., It is important to avoid getting too emotional when you are first getting to know someone. You don't have to be cold or make him feel like his accomplishments are nothing to be proud of, but an excess of emotion may be a little overwhelming. Try to play it cool as much as possible. This will only increase your air of mystery and make him wonder if he really can win you over as his girlfriend.


For example, don’t jump up and down and scream if he asks you on a date. Instead, try smiling and saying something like, “Sure, that sounds fun. What did you have in mind?”

, This can work well with your mystique, as you can allude to a vague appointment. Be polite, cheerful, and assure everyone you'll meet again soon.


You could say: "I promised a friend of mine I'd help her with a little project. Nothing serious, but really, it's kind of a long story. I hate to leave, but I'll see you soon, for sure."

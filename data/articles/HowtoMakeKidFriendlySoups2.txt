 This soup can be made on the stove in 45 minutes. Start by placing the chopped bacon in a skillet that has deep sides and cook over medium-high heat. Turn them occasionally with a spatula so they brown evenly for about 5 to 8 minutes.

Once theyâ€™re done cooking, drain the bacon onto a paper towel-lined plate. Keep 1 teaspoon of the bacon drippings.
 Lightly salt the water and let it boil over high heat. When the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked but still firm to the bite. This should take about 8 minutes.

Once the pasta is done cooking, drain it into a colander in the sink and set aside.
 Pour the bacon drippings into a large saucepan over medium heat. Put the onion in the bacon drippings and cook them until they are translucent. This should take around 5 minutes. Then, stir in the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, until the garlic is softened., Add the bacon bits, the chicken broth, the cheese sauce or grated cheese, the chicken bouillon granules, the ground red pepper, the ground black pepper, the red pepper flakes, and the macaroni. Stir everything around with a spoon so it is combined., Stir the soup occasionally to help the flavors blend. Let it simmer for about five minutes.

Serve the soup hot with a healthy salad or bread on the side.

 The audience will determine the level of detail you need to provide as the breadth of information you should cover.A how-to guide for making a mango mojito directed at bartenders would differ greatly from the same how-to guide written for people without bartending experience who wish to make a mango mojito at home. The lay-person’s guide would likely be more detailed without using any beverage service “slang.”;
, Before you write, you should be able to do the process yourself several times. Even if it is something you have done repeatedly, try doing it again, thinking mindfully about each step that you are taking as you go through the process.


If you pour yourself a mango mojito at the end of every day, you likely don’t have to think about the proper ratios, and you may take parts of the process for granted (like getting out a glass and filling it with ice).
 Your own experience can be a great basis for a how-to article, but it never hurts to supplement your experience with research.Try searching for the topic online and see how other people do what you are doing. You may want to integrate others’ approaches into your guide by suggesting alternate approaches. Be sure to credit any sources that you draw from directly.


If you have a signature mango mojito recipe, your how-to article can only be improved by searching other recipes for the same drink. You may find a shortcut, an alternate ingredient, or an aesthetically pleasing garnish that you never considered.
 Before you start writing, collect material and information that you wish to include in your guide.This may mean taking photographs that document the process at each step or creating flowcharts or graphs that complement your written material.


For your mango mojito guide, you might want to photograph the ingredients before you begin, then take action shots of each part of the mojito creation process. You may even want to recruit another person to take the pictures for you.

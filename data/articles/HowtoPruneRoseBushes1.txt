 Depending on where you live, this might be late January or February, or it could be some time in early spring.

If you don't know what rose variety you have, look for these signs that may indicate when to prune your rosebush:









If the rosebush produces new growth in the spring, and the blooms come from this new growth, that means the rosebush should be pruned while it's dormant, right when the buds have begun to swell. Wait until next spring to prune.
If the rosebush blooms come straight from the old canes, rather than from new growth, the bush should be pruned after it flowers instead.

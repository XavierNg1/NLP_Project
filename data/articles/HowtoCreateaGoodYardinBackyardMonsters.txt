 There are several defensive towers to choose from, but knowing which one is the correct one to use is crucial. Be sure to place towers in a way that will defend your town hall, resource harvesters, silos, and any other important buildings. Towers with long ranges should be placed towards the center of your base. Towers with lower ranges should be placed on the outer area of your base. (long range towers: Sniper, Teslea, and Aerial Defense.) (Short ranged towers: Laser, Cannon, and Railgun.);
, If somebody attacks you and defeats you, note which buildings are to heavily guarded, and note which buildings are not guarded well enough. Using a wild monster baiter is quite helpful.
 Most people use blocks as walls, but also be aware that blocks can be used to channel attackers. Creating a pathway is a good strategy, and placing booby traps is also quite helpful.
 Notice that certain monsters attack certain things. Use this to your advantage. When monsters are attacking a certain building, you can place towers to fire at them while they are distracted.
 Building a yard planner is also key. The new yard planner features save slots. Use these to try out different layouts if one just isn't working. You can also delete everything and start from scratch.

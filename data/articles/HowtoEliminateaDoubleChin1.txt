 Start with a clean palette by using your normal face washing routine, followed by moisturizing. Then, get out your makeup and brushes. You will need:


A foundation that is one shade darker than your normal foundation.
Bronzer. If you have medium to dark skin, use a gold-toned bronzer and if you have fair skin, use a rose-toned bronzer.A large makeup brush;
, Use your fingers to put on a light amount of foundation along your jawline, just above your neck. Do not use foundation that is too dark â€” it should only be one shade darker than your normal foundation. Dark foundation may end up accentuating, rather than hiding, your double chin.
 Using a small amount of bronzer, use your makeup brush to apply the bronzer in a downward motion along your jawline. Blend it so there are no obvious lines or marks and the bronzer mixes well with your skin.


Once you have blended the bronzer well along your jawline, move on to applying the rest of your makeup. Play up your eyes with eyeliner, rather than put bright lipstick on your mouth, to avoid bringing attention to your chin.
 This will improve your posture and minimize the appearance of your double chin. Avoid dipping your head down in photographs, as this will only highlight your double chin. Instead, tip your chin out and up to extend your neck and jawline., Low-angled photos can highlight your double chin and are flattering for almost no one. Instead, take photographs that show off your profile, or one side of your face. When someone is taking a picture square on you, tilt your head up and to the side and look beyond the camera or just to one side. And of course, don't forget to smile.

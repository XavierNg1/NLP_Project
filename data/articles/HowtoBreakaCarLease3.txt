 Become familiar with the terms of the early termination clause of your lease agreement before you contact the leasing company. Keep in mind these clauses are usually designed to protect the finance company, not benefit you., Find out exactly how much early termination will cost you, and what additional fees are involved. Many companies charge a substantial early-termination fee that is roughly equivalent to making all remaining lease payments at once. In addition, they’ll tack on predetermined penalty fees or other fees for “restocking” or “processing.”

, If your only reason for needing out of the lease is a financial one, your lease company may have relief programs for people with verifiable financial strain.


If you’ve lost a job or experienced a death in the family, it might be possible to get a forbearance on your payments. You’ll be expected to make up the difference at a later date, but it might help you in the meantime.
Some companies will let you “trade-in” your lease. For example, if you were leasing a more expensive car and want to save money, you could trade in your luxury sedan on a cheaper economy car.Trade-ins often come with additional fees, and a trade-in typically is still considered an early termination of the lease for credit reporting purposes.
 Some leasing companies will assess additional fees for body damage or general disrepair.

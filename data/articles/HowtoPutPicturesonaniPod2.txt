 The most popular iOS file manager is iFunBox. This program allows you to import photos directly to your iPod. You will need to have iTunes installed as well, but you don't need to set up any syncing relationships with it. iTunes just allows iFunBox to recognize your iPod.
 You should see it appear in the iFunBox window. If it does not appear, ensure that you have iTunes properly installed on your computer.
 In the "Import Files and Data" section, click "Photo Library".
 You can add photos by browsing your computer for folders and files, or you can drag and drop them into the iFunBox window. Pictures will be added to your iPod automatically as soon as you add them to iFunBox.
 Open the Photos app on your iPod. Your photos will appear in the Photo Library album.

 As mentioned above, re-hydrating yourself is a key player in your battle against the dreaded hangover. Some liquids will help to restore your electrolytes, rehydrate you, and settle your stomach more quickly than others.
 This is a perfect time to clear your fridge of that flat bottle of soda you’ve meaning to throw out. Drink it instead--ginger ale is a great way to soothe your stomach.
 While you may be thinking, ‘isn’t pedialyte for children?’ your body will be feeling better in no time. Pedialyte contains more sodium and less sugar than sports drinks, so it re-hydrates you quickly. It is also rich in vitamins and tastes pretty darn good (which is why parents give it to their kids). Your inner hungover child will thank you., While you may not have just gone on a 10K run or played a game in the NBA, your body probably feels like you did. Sports drinks like Gatorade are meant to rehydrate and replenish lost nutrients., If you can’t bring yourself to drink anything, ice pops are a great way to begin the re-hydration process. They will also keep you from feeling bloated (like some people do when they chug a whole lot of sports drink when they first wake up after a night of drinking.)

, Your body is craving vitamins and juices such as orange, pineapple or mango are a great way of going about restoring your health. Just remember to drink slowly--you don’t want to chug a whole carton of OJ.

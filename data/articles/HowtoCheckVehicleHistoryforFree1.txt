 The Internet has many commercial sites that provide VHRs. The free information, however, is limited. For example, CarFax advertises a free “myCarFax.com” report, which provides your car’s service history, upcoming service alerts, and information about recalls.Other sites with free reports provide similar information that is based generically on your car’s make and model, but is not specific to the car’s VIN. Free reports typically provide the following generic information:manufacturer
model
manufacturing details, such as chassis type, engine size, country of assembly, and engine power
a general summary of what the full report would contain if you choose to purchase it.;
, The five most commonly used sources for purchasing a VHR are CarFax, AutoCheck, the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), and the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS), which has two different sources.A full VHR, which you can usually purchase for a fee that ranges between $10 and $40, includes the following information about the specific car, based on its VIN:ownership history
clean title/ownership verification
periodic odometer readings
maintenance records
history of rental or lease
accident repair history
flood repair history

, Until recently, full VHRs have only been available for purchase. As of December 2015, however, a source called Vehicle History (web address www.VehicleHistory.com) is offering a full VHR for free.The report from Vehicle History contains the following information:vehicle ownership records
vehicle information
government records
public records
background history
historical records
state records

, If you are considering the purchase of a used car, the information that is available in a full report is generally worth the cost of the purchase. Purchasing a full VHR is usually less than $50, which is very small compared to the price of the car itself. As Consumer Reports points out, even if a mechanic tells you that the car is in good condition, the history of an accident, flood damage, or some similar incident in the car’s history can greatly reduce its value.VehicleHistory.com appears to offer a full report for free. However, this is a relatively new resource, and less has been written about the validity of VehicleHistory.com than the other sources. Consumer Reports recommends that buyers consider comparing reports from multiple sources.

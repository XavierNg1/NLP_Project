 Apply a small amount of distilled white vinegar to the scratch with a Q-tip or small cloth. The vinegar will swell the scratched area in a collagen-like manner. Let it dry, then gently buff the area with a colorless shoe polish., Treat a scratch in leather with either orange oil or olive oil. Using a damp cloth, rub the oil into the scratch and surrounding area using buffing motions. This treatment will have the added bonus of conditioning the leather.Use oil sparingly, as it might deteriorate the leather over time if used in excess., Heat can be bad for leather, but in small doses it may be beneficial. Turn the blowdryer to a medium setting and use it on the section of scratched leather, gently rubbing the scratch with your free hand. The heat should bring dyes applied to the leather at the tannery back to the surface, thereby reducing the appearance of the scratch., Treat your leather goods with a weather-resistant protection spray and reapply every three months. Keep leather away from water as much as possible, and be sure to be delicate about drying it if it does get wet (i.e. avoid direct heat, and air dry). Use a leather conditioner to moisturize leather every few months, or whenever it starts to feel too dry.

 When you’re ready to clean your lips of lipstick, take a tissue and blot it against your mouth to remove the top layer of lipstick. Gently press the tissue against your lips until you’re no longer getting a lot of color off.Make sure not to rub the tissue over your lips, or you may wind up smearing the lipstick around your mouth.
 When you’ve removed the top layer lipstick with the tissue, spread a thick layer of petroleum jelly over your lips like a mask. Allow it to sit on your lips for 1 to 3 minutes, leaving it on the longest for dark, matte lipstick shades.If you don’t have any petroleum jelly on hand, you can also use coconut oil or baby oil. However, apply just a thin coat to your lips or you may wind up with lipstick-colored oil running down your chin.
 When you’ve let the petroleum jelly sit on your lips for a couple of minutes, take a cotton pad and dampen it with warm water from the sink. Wipe the pad over your lips with firm pressure to remove the remaining lipstick.Don’t use cotton balls to wipe your lips. They’re usually too fuzzy and can wind up sticking to your lips.
Be careful when you’re wiping the cotton pad over your mouth to make sure that you don’t rub it beyond your lip line -- you can wind up smearing lipstick on your face that way. It helps to “wrap” the pad around your index finger to keep it confined to the lip area.
 If you just want to clean your lips of lipstick so you can put on a new shade, you’re ready to go. If you’re removing the lipstick at the end of the night, follow up by washing your face with your favorite cleanser. That will remove any lingering lipstick or smudges around your mouth.

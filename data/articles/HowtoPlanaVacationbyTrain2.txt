 For most people, train vacations will entail traveling in legs between different destinations. Print out a map and highlight the places and number of nights where you will be staying for an extended amount of time.
 If you are traveling in the United States or Canada, use the Amtrak Route Atlas, at amtrak.com/interactive-route-atlas. If you will be traveling in Europe, browse the Inter Rail map at interrailnet.com/planning.


If you are going to a different area of the world, search online using the search terms "country" "rail" and "map." Most large railway providers list their maps and schedules. You can also try ACP Rail International and East Japan Railway Company for Japan tours and ACP Rail International and Rail Australia for Australian train schedules.
 A leg is a day spent in transit to another destination. This will tell you the number of train tickets you will need to buy for you and your friends or family., For example, visit independenttraveler.com/travel-deals/train and amtrak.com/deals for the latest offers from providers. If you find a good special, you may need to change your itinerary slightly to make sure you receive the offer.

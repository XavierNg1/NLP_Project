 If your windshield washer jets are not spraying washer fluid onto the windshield, it may be due to a severed or kinked hose running from the windshield washer fluid reservoir to the jets. Look over the lines for signs of blockages or damage.Start at the reservoir and follow the lines all the way to the jets attached to the hood.
Look for signs of leaking, kinks or other forms of damage.
 If the hoses appear to be intact, the issue may be a clog inside the one of the lines. Pull the hose off of the nozzle at the jet as well as the nozzle at the reservoir, then use an air compressor or can of air to force air through the line and remove any blockages.If the air cannot pass through the line to unclog it, you will need to replace it.
If the air passes right through the line, reinstall it.
 If you are unable to clear a blockage in the hose, you will need to install a replacement. You may be able to purchase direct replacements at your local auto parts store, otherwise take the clogged hose with you and find a rubber hose with the same inside diameter. Purchase a length of hose that matches the one you need to replace.Simply attach the new hose to the same nozzles you removed the old one from.
Test your jets once more after replacing the hose.

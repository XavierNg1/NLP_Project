 Check leaves of trees and plants for lots of little holes, which show where inchworms have been munching. Also look for leaves that have been stripped totally clean. They’ve probably moved on from that leaf by now, but this shows they’re in the immediate area and will help narrow down your search.Since you’re probably searching during the spring, plants and trees may still be blossoming. If so, you can also check the buds for signs of munching, since inchworms will eat those, too., Lots of animals feed on inchworms, so expect them to hide. Check the underside of leaves to see if any are clinging directly to them.Also check for them in midair, since they spin webs just like spiders, and may be dangling well below leaves and branches.You may also find them on the ground, but this usually happens when they’ve fully matured and are ready to cocoon underground. So if you’re looking for inchworms to keep as pets, these are no good, since they’re ready to change into moths.
 When an inchworm is done feeding on a leaf or plant, it spins a web long enough for it to swing to the next, like a rope.So look where the leaf cover is pretty dense, where they can do this more easily. Also, since each type of inchworm feeds on different types of food, look in areas with lots of the same type of plant or tree.If you’re looking in trees, also check the plants growing around its base. The inchworms may have worked their way down to them., Start searching in the daytime, since it’s easier to spot where they’re feeding in natural daylight. Some inchworms feed during the day, so you may find them right away. If not, this particular type may be nocturnal, so grab a flashlight and double-check after dark.

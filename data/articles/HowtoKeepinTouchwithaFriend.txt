 A quick text means, "my phone is working; I'm alive, and I have not lost my fingers.";
, This is a great way to stay in touch. Use instant messengers such as gChat. This, too, shows that you are alive, and have not lost your fingers in some freak accident.
 Pick up that phone, and call when you can. It doesn't have to be a long phone call. In fact, on occasion, long phone calls can be annoying. Just a quick call can get you caught up. He/she is probably interested to hear about what you're up to (or have been up to), too!

, It's fun to get mail that's not a $500 oil bill or eviction notice. Letters can be a great way to let your pal know what's going on with you. It's easy! Don't be afraid of being boring. Finish your letter off with smiley faces, spilled beer, drawings, x's and o's, pieces of food, dog footprints - whatever seems suitable.
 It's a non-time-consuming way to let your buddy know you're thinking about them. Pick something that you think will make him or her laugh. Then, add a quick message, just sign your name, and send it off!

, Books, magnets, bookmarks, your old junk mail, student work you don't want to keep - anything goes! Sometimes the littlest things can show that you're a living and breathing human.
 This can be original or singing. While this could be taking it a bit too far, you may get quite a giggle.

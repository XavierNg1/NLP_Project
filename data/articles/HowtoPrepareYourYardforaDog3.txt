 If you let your dog spend long periods of time in the yard, you must provide it with some protection from the weather (i.e. shelter from the heat on a scorching, sunny day.) If your yard doesn't have a lot of trees or shade, build a dog house to protect your pet and provide it with an outdoor den. You can also purchase a dog house at hardware stores or department stores., To keep your yard clean and friendly for the whole family, designate a specific "potty area" for your dog to relieve itself in. This area will essentially be a boxed-in area filled with layers of small pebbles and gravel, and fiberglass screening; the pebbles and gravel allow for easy drainage when hosed down. To train your dog to relieve itself in this area, lead it there on its leash, prompt it to go, and then reward it with treats and play when it does., To stay cool, hydrated, and healthy, it is important that your dog has access to water when it's outdoors. Consider installing an outdoor fountain, which would be both a fun decorative element for your yard and a source of refreshment for your pet. You can also consider building a small pond for your dog to enjoy, particularly on hot summer days. Make sure that the pond is shallow enough for your dog to go in and out of safely and easily.

 Accept the idea that it's OK to make mistakes. We are humans, mistakes are part of life and are a great opportunity for learning.;
, It is to be noted that when you are sad or unhappy you can't be fully available to others. On the other hand when you are full of joy and rejoice, you can help other people in a true manner. Itâ€™s not the other way around. It is your life, you have to make it great. Nobody else will do it for you.
 What are your dreams? What would your perfect life look like? To be happy you need to make it happen. Start today by focusing on one goal and take the first step.
 Life is all about choices. Start making yours today. You will feel powerful. Think of what you are tolerating in your life and eliminate them. What is missing from your life: more fun? a great job? more money? Do something about it. Don't leave it to fate.
 Starting to live a proactive life is about making changes, it's about getting rid of bad habits and get good ones instead. Each action will build up your confidence and will bring you closer to your goals. Keep moving forward and you'll get there!

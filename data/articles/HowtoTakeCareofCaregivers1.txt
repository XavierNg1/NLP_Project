 It's better if many people are helping look after the person in need: people to take on full caregiving duties, people to visit for housework or socializing, people to take the person out, et cetera. This way, one person isn't doing most of the work.
 Seeing their friends and family can help cheer them up, and it'll also give the current caregiver some time where they don't need to worry about the person., Especially if the person needs a lot of care, it may be hard for the caregiver to find time for chores. It can be very helpful if someone comes over to do the dishes, mop, vacuum, clean the bathrooms, and handle other household tasks., This can help organize what is happening and what needs to be done.

You could set up an online calendar (e.g. through Google Calendar) with the schedule on it so people can easily see what is going on.

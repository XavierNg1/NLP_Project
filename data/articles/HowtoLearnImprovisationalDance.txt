 Warm up and stretch. Wear movable clothing (this can mean elastic shorts if you don't have a leotard). Wear dancing shoes of your choice.;
, Move furniture and other obstacles aside. Make sure the area is not slippery.
 Especially when you first start. It helps you build your confidence rather than when you are being watched.
 If no mirror is available, a glass door or large window can provide some feedback, too. It helps to stand on the more brightly lit side.
 Something upbeat with plenty of drama and variety is a good place to start. Try many different songs and styles to find what works for you.
 As you warm up, vary your steps and start to move your upper body any way that seems to go with the music.
 Arms, hands, legs, and feet are the obvious ones, but don't forget shoulders, knees, head, chest, hips and everything else. Notice what looks good and what feels good. Notice what works with your music.
 If you're extending a hand, for instance, follow with your chest and head and use your legs. Unless you intend to keep something motionless, you'll just end up looking stiff.
 Think about the shape and posture of your whole body.
 Pantomime the words. Get bigger when the music gets louder; get faster when the music gets faster.
 Shake, turn, move with the music. Intensity doesn't necessarily mean speed, though. A slow motion can be every bit as intense and deliberate as a quick one.
 Dance is an amplification of body language you already know. Does your music call for you to puff up your chest and strut, or shrink sadly away?

, Also watch anybody else moving. Martial artists, figure skaters, actors on a stage, soccer players, and children can all suggest ways to move.
 This is your own creation, so there's no reason that elements of belly dancing and ballet can't blend.
 Step on a beat when the music is still, subdivide the beat, change direction mid-measure or mid-phrase, and occasionally do something a bit contrary to the mood of the music.

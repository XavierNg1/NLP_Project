 Even oxygen in the air can lead to rust on your razor blade. Coating it in oil will provide a barrier between the metal blade and the surrounding air. Choose from a variety of household oils, including olive oil, baby oil, vegetable oil or mineral oil., Ensure the blade is completely coated. Don't rub the film off or it will defeat the exercise.
 If you prefer, you can also pour some of your chosen oil into a small saucer. After you're sure the blade is completely coated, just remove the razor and set it down to dry on a paper towel.
 Some people even choose to store their razor in oil between uses. Partially fill a cup with oil. Each time after you use your razor, dry it and set it blade-first into the cup of oil. Keep the blade submerged there until you're ready to use the razor again.

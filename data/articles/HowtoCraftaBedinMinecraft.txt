 Head back to a Workbench and craft Wooden Planks. Get your Wood out and simply put the Wood in any slot. Take out the Wooden Planks.


Wood can be found by destroying trees. You can destroy trees with an axe but it is also possible to punch them to obtain wood, although this takes significantly longer.;
, Put 3 Wool in the middle of the three by three grid.


Wool can be found by shearing or killing sheep. Shearing (which will not kill the sheep) requires sheers, which are made by crafting together 2 iron ingots. Shearing also potentially produces more wool than killing.
 After that, put the 3 Wooden Planks on all of the bottom slots.
 The result of this process will be a bed. Click on the bed and put the bed in your inventory or your hot bar.


Understand that there is no way to change the color of the bed. Wool color will not matter. The only way to change the color of the bed is to mod your game (using a mod such as this one)

, Place your bed in your house (or any place which keeps you safe) and sleep peacefully on your bed. This has the added bonus of creating a new spawn point, after which you will always spawn next to your bed after death.

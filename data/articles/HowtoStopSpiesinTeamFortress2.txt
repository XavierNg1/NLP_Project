 Pyros and Scouts are excellent at detecting and destroying Spies, but any class will be suitable if you are alert and observant.;
, Spies like to hide and wait for a passing victim to stab. Gain the upper hand by surprising them first!

, You have the power of teamwork in Team Fortress 2. Use it to detect and eliminate Spies!

, The Flamethrower can be used to easily distinguish cloaked or disguised Spies. Use it everywhere, but be sure and keep ammo on hand.
 Spies are always waiting for your back to be turned for an instant kill.
 Cloaked Spies can sometimes be seen as a faint glow or shadow. Look for teammates who are acting strange, or ones you bump into and don't pass through.
 Spies have an extremely accurate Revolver by default that can kill in two to three shots if you don't finish them off quickly.
 When a building is sapped, look for the Spy who placed the sapper. They may be disguised as a teammate! Beware of the backstab while building or repairing buildings as an Engineer.

 You should be close enough to the steering column that you can steer with your elbows slightly bent and access the pedals with slightly bent knees. Grabbing the wheel with fully extended elbows can cause back and arm pain.The steering wheel should be 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) away from the driver’s chest.
If your seat has adjustable lumbar support set it to a comfortable position. Your lower back should be slightly curved toward the steering column while making complete contact with the seat.
 The seat should be set as high as possible so that your legs are relaxed and slightly bent. You should be able to see out of the car with ease and without obstruction.Make sure you still have enough headroom that you won’t bump your head.
 The top of the headrest should be level with the top of your head. While sitting the car, your head should lie comfortably against the headrest or be held within two to three inches of it.A headrest must be positioned high enough to protect from whiplash injuries in the event of an accident.
 The best time to adjust mirrors and other instruments is when you’ve put yourself in a comfortable, ergonomic driving position. Set your mirrors so that they’re positioned for a non-slumping vantage point.If, while driving, your mirrors seem like they need to be readjusted, you’ll know that you’re starting to slouch and need to sit up straight.

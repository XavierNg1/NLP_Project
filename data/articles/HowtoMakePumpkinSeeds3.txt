 Cut the top off the pumpkin or cut an angled hole around the stem. Scrape out the seeds with a spoon, and transfer them to a strainer. Rinse the seeds under running water, picking out strings and bits of orange flesh.When the seeds are clean, shake the strainer to remove excess water.
 Transfer the seeds to a jar or bowl. Cover them with the water and sprinkle in the salt. Cover the bowl with a clean towel or sheet of a paper towel and set it aside on the counter.


Allow the seeds to soak for at least seven hours, or overnight if possible.Soaking seeds is similar to sprouting, in that it makes the nutrients easier to digest. Pumpkin seeds, however, won’t sprout, so you have to soak them instead.
 Drain the seeds through a strainer to remove the water. Spread the seeds out in a single layer on a baking sheet. Transfer them to a warm oven that’s been preheated to 150ºF (66ºC). Let them dehydrate in the oven for between 12 and 24 hours.Start checking the seeds after 12 hours. The seeds are done when they are completely dry and there's no water left in them.
If your oven doesn’t go that low, either set your oven to its lowest temperature, or use a dehydrator.

 Get a coat hanger and bend it so that it's as straight as possible. The longer the coat hanger is, the easier it will be to open your lock.
 The "V" side of the hanger will go into your car and wrap around your lock. Make the bent side of the hanger large enough so that it can wrap around your lock., Slide the "V" end of the coat hanger in between the window and the rubber surrounding it. You may have to work the coat hanger back and forth to slide it into your car. Continue to do this until the coat hanger slides between the window.Do this carefully so that you don't damage the rubber lining around your window.
 Wiggle the coat hanger back and forth until it snags on the pin on the lock. The mechanism should be above your door's handle. It may take multiple tries to actually find the pin, so be patient while you find it.
 Pulling up on the coat hanger while it's wrapped around the pin in the door's frame will unlock your car. Make sure that you've snagged it before pulling up on the coat hanger.

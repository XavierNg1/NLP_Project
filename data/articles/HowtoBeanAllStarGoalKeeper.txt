 This way you'll always be prepared for the shot. Never turn your back to the field.;
, Place both hands next to each other so that the thumbs are touching to create W shape. Use this when catching higher balls and it will be much more effective. Always keep your hands over top of the ball when you catch it so that it falls down to your feet if you can't hold on to it. It's much better to have the ball loose at your feet than to have it loose going through your hands into the net.
 In order for your teammates to know whether to rely on you or to help, you have to communicate. This also helps when a teammate is not doing their job.
 If you're always tense, getting hit with the ball will hurt more, than if you are relaxed.
 This helps shorten the open areas for the other team to shoot into.
 When a shot is taken, while you're in the goal, always move so you are in front of the ball.
 Be ready to rush out at the ball if necessary. When you rush out make sure to be on your toes. When approaching an attacker, dive horizontally at his/her feet. Make sure to cover all the angles. Do not shy away from the ball.
 The way their feet are positioned before kicking a ball can show you ahead of time where they are kicking.

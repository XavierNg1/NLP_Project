 Pile #1 is what you want to keep, and pile #2 is things that need to be thrown away.;
, If you need extra storage, but have no room, use underneath beds, install shelves, the attic, or just put things not in use into labeled and organized boxes and put in the garage!

, For example, put CDs into one pile, books in another, documents in another, etc. Make sure to find appropriate storage for each category.
 Put in correct shelves and cupboards and put food substances in their correct place (i.e. cabinets, refrigerator, etc.).
 When everything is put away, you can begin to start cleaning surfaces. (Carpet, walls, etc.) Dust shelves, wash out the bathtub, toilet and sinks, vacuum under beds and couches (if you can reach) and all the rugs and carpets. Dust and vacuum the curtains; and if they are machine washable, WASH THEM! Clean the windows and walls and if desired, you can cover over any rotting or out of place wall with paint.
 If someone left something (such as a puzzle, newspaper, toys, etc.) out, just put it back. Be sure to wash dishes and do laundry daily.

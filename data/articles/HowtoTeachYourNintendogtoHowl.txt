 This siren will go off at a random time in your house. There is nothing you can do about the timing of the siren.;
, Or, some will yelp and startle. A tired dog may not react at all.
 Your dog will turn to you. Speak the command "howl" clearly into the microphone. If your dog doesn't understand, don't worry, the siren will sound again.

 Sit on the bench directly in front of the bar, facing away from it. Reach your arms backwards and place them on the bar with an underhand grip. Position your hands shoulder width apart., To be safe, have someone spot you before you start lifting. Carefully remove the bar from the rack. Be sure to hold the bar steady so it does not fall backwards., Gently lower the weight behind your head. Stop when your elbows are perpendicular. Lowering the bar any further will put you at a significant risk for shoulder injury., Exhale as you push the bar back upwards using a careful, fluid motion. Concentrate on keeping the bar steady. Extend your arms fully above you, but don't "lock" your elbows., When you are done with the exercise, bring the bar upwards toward the rack. Hold the bar steady for your spotter to grasp and re-rack. Keep your hands on the bar until it is securely back on the rack, then let go., For the best results, do four sets of behind the neck presses as part of a larger weight training routine. Each set should include eight reps. Rest for one minute between each set.

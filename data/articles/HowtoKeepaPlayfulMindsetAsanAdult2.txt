 Kids, especially younger ones, are unabashed about their interests and desires. If they want to play, they play. If they have a question, they ask. Make a commitment to spend time with children, and maybe their carefree attitudes will rub off.

Get on the floor and play with your own children or those of a friend or family member. Volunteer at a recreational center. Or, simply go to the park and observe children at play., Animals, particularly young dogs, can help you connect with your inner child, too. Adopt a pet from a local animal shelter. Visit a relative or neighbor who has a youthful dog. Or, start a volunteer commitment with an animal shelter in your area.If you are not sure if you feel ready to commit to caring for a pet or volunteering on a regular basis, then try volunteering one time as a dog walker and see if it is something you would like to do again.
 An enviable trait many kids have is the ability to just be who they are. At least while they are young, they don’t edit themselves. It can help you become more playful to hang out with people who don’t make you edit yourself.Think about the people in your life who you can be your silly, quirky self around. Choose to spend more time with these people.
If you don’t have people like this in your life, you may try to make new friends or be bolder in your current relationships.
Try having a game night when you have friends over for something new and interesting to do together.

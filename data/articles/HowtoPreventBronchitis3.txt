 You will generally have a fever (100.2–102.4°F or 37.9–39.1°C) and feel like all of your muscles are aching.


In the first two or three days of being sick, you might have a dry cough (one where you don’t cough up phlegm) accompanied by a slight burning sensation in your chest that feels like heartburn.
Five or six days after that, you will have a productive cough (which means you will be coughing up phlegm) and then your symptoms will generally clear up., Acute bronchitis is more common and it is less worrisome. It is normally brought on by a viral or bacterial infection that runs its course and then goes away. You can get rid of it by managing the cough that develops or, in more intense instances, with an antimicrobial treatment.


Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, is persistent and harder to get rid of. Chronic bronchitis is generally recognized as a wet cough that lasts longer than three months that is paired with a lot of mucus production that you will cough up and have to spit out. This sort of bronchitis can lead to other, worse respiratory diseases so it is important to manage it early on.
Speak to your doctor if you have a persistent cough or a worry of chronic bronchitis.
Patients with cystic fibrosis are prone to recurrent bronchial infections leading to a condition called bronchiectasis.
 (Note that if you cannot get a same-day appointment with your family doctor, go to the emergency room; the more quickly you can be diagnosed and treated, the better.)

 Your safe house also has built-in closets that you can use to change outfits. These closets or wardrobes also store all the apparels you buy from different clothing shops all over San Andreas.


If you don’t know where your safe house is, open the Map from the main menu screen and find a place marked with a house icon. This is where your safe house is.
 Head inside the safe house and find the wardrobe. You’ll see a red circle floating in front of a closet, notifying you that you can use it to change clothes.


Approach the wardrobe to enter it.
 Once you enter the wardrobe, a pop-up menu will appear on the game screen. Select the outfit type you want to change from the pop-up menu. You can choose from hats, shades, shirts, jackets, pants, shorts, and shoes.


Once you’ve selected the outfit type you want to change, a list of available apparel to wear will be shown on the pop-up menu. Choose from the list of items and press the “Try On” button to see how it would look like on your character before wearing it.
If you want to pick other clothes to wear, simply press the “Back” button to go back to the list of clothing choices.
 If you like how the outfit looks on your character, press the “Wear” button to use the selected piece of clothing.

 Another thing to consider is keeping only the fish or the cat, especially if nothing you try keeps your cat from attacking the fish bowl. Cats usually can't resist the fascination of a constantly moving, shimmering body, often exploring a fish bowl and eventually popping the fish in its mouth.Since this is is the case, getting rid of one or other might be best for both parties.


Decide which pet you have a greater attachment to, then give away the other one.
 Many people have outdoor cats. If your indoor cat will not stay away from the fish tank no matter what you do, you might try training your cat to live outside, at least part time.


Start slowly at first, dismissing your cat to the backyard for only 10 minutes the first day, then gradually increasing their outdoor time.
Feed your cat indoors and let them out and in at the same time everyday. Feeding your cat outside will attract wildlife.Give your cat a treat as soon as it comes inside each day to keep it wanting to come indoors.Having your cat inside only at certain times of day will allow you to properly protect the fish, perhaps locking up the fish when the cat is inside.
 When you leave the house, put your fish in a locked room so that the cat canâ€™t get to it. Even if you believe your cat is trained to leave the fish alone, eliminating the possibility of mischief keeps your cat from being tempted.

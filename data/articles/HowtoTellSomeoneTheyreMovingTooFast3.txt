 Sometimes a partner can have a difficult time accepting that a relationship is slowing down. As a result, his or her dissatisfaction with your decision causes them to exhibit less than acceptable behavior, such as pressuring you to move things forward more quickly. When this behavior becomes more than you are comfortable dealing with, it might be best to end the relationship.


If this happens, tell your partner, “I know my decision to slow things down has been hard for you. I was hoping that you would give me the time that I needed, but unfortunately you can’t. I think it’s best that we end things.”

, If your decision to slow things down in your relationship has left you feeling like the two of you can’t possibly move forward, then it’s time to end it. If the excitement and energy in your relationship is gone now, there’s a good chance that it won’t return. The sooner you can end a relationship that is head in the wrong direction, the quicker the two of you can move on., You have to remain true to yourself. Accept that it’s okay to slow things down. Don’t allow the other person to prematurely convince you to speed things up before you’re ready. It is unhealthy to second-guess yourself when it goes against your sound reasoning and judgement.

 Manually adjust the meter to read zero by turning the screw in the middle of the meter. Next, connect the probe and turn the meter on for fifteen minutes for optimum performance. Adjust the redline with the control knob to align with the 31 degrees celsius line and set the central line to zero.All meters are calibrated differently. See the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for variations that are specific to your meter.
Meters are calibrated in Celsius not Fahrenheit.
 Place the probe into a sample of water that you wish to measure. Allow the meter to stabilize. Write down your reading., Understand that running water will have a higher dissolved oxygen content than still water. Higher altitudes mean less dissolved oxygen. Consider these things when you look at your measurement to be sure that the measurement makes sense given the sample you are taking.

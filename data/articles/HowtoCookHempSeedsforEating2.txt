 Throw your hemp seeds into a clean coffee grinder. Pulse until the hemp seeds are ground into a powder. Since hemp seeds are so small, you don't have to grind them into a powder for your baked goods. Using them whole will create a nutty and crunchy texture. It's up to you!

, The next time you're preparing muffins, bread, a cake, cookies or cinnamon rolls, try tossing in a handful of hemp powder (or the whole seeds) into the batter. The hemp seeds add a rich and nutty flavor to these recipes., It is best to avoid heating hemp seeds in the oven, because they will be less nutritious. If you're baking something with a glaze, whether it's meat or a baked item, sprinkle the hemp powder or seeds on top of the glaze right before serving the dish.
 It can also be added to porridge or oatmeal to increase the fiber and fatty acids. You wonâ€™t get them stuck in your teeth like you might with whole seeds.

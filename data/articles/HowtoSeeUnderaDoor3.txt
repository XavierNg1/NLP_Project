 The most expensive option for viewing under a door, telescoping or “snake” cameras can be purchased. They come in a few varieties, with some being reserved for more professional uses.


The cheapest among the telescoping cameras are the camera kits that plug directly into your cell phone. These can be purchased online and at some retail stores such as Walmart.
 The exact nature of these applications will vary from product to product. Make sure you read the specifications of the camera and its application to make sure your cell phone is compatible. Some are specially made to work with certain operating systems, while others will only work with certain models of cameras., Most snake cameras are made from a material that allows the camera to be angled in various directions. Maneuver the camera as desired and begin shooting.


If the camera wire is too flimsy to navigate effectively, try connecting it to a coat hanger or other pliable wire, and snake it under the door.Such cameras shoot in a small area, or use a macro lens. You’ll be able to see much of the room, but the image will be distorted or somewhat blurry compared to a normal camera.

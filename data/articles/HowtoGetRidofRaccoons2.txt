 Sweep up berries that fell from trees. Make sure that any picnic tables and chairs (or anything else outside) are completely free of food scraps and crumbs. Clean the area completely. Double check the area after you finish., Raccoons are omnivores, so they won't pass up any dog- or cat food scraps left outdoors. You can avoid this problem entirely by feeding your companion animals indoors. If you must feed Fido or Tiger outside, clean up every last scrap of wet or dry food when meal time is over. If you have a doggie door or cat flap, keep food bowls far away from these access points., Even a bird feeder with sunflower seeds might be tempting to a raccoon. Hang your bird feeder on a pole about 0.5 inches (1.3Â cm) in diameter. Raccoons can't climb such skinny poles. Secure the pole firmly so that it can't be knocked over. Store any bird seed in metal trash cans or an indoor locations that raccoons can't access.If this isn't an option, lock up your bird feeder in the garage or tool shed just before sundown.
 As omnivores, raccoons love to fish. Place cinder blocks, ceramic pipes, and wire baskets in the pond. These will provide hiding places for your fish.You can also install metal leaf netting over your fish pond. Buy the strongest material available to support the raccoon's weight.

 Sometimes, a slow shutter speed allows in too much light, which may create photos that are literally whited out.


The shutter speed is how long the shutter, or doors, to your film or electronic sensor are opened. The longer the shutter is open, the more light the film or electronic sensor is exposed to.
ND filters act like sunglasses that diminish the amount of light that gets to your eyes, so that your film or electronic sensor does not become over exposed.
 Graduated ND lens filters are expensive, and if you are on a budget, you may decide to stick with a regular ND filter.
 These filters are actually like putting an additional lens on your camera. A macro filter may distort the image, causing a reduction in image quality.

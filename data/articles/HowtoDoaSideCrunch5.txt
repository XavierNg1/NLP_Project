 Stand straight up with your feet about hip width apart and your knees somewhat bent. Place one of your hands behind or at the side of your head.Whichever hand you bring to your head is the side on which you are going to start your standing crunch.
 Whichever side your hand is at your head, lift that same side leg up with your knee bent at a 90° right angle. Turn your knee out, so the side of your thigh is facing out as you crunch. As you bring your knee up, contract your side abdominal muscles to bring your upper body down.


As you crunch, your elbow should be touching you knee.
Try not to bend forward as you crunch. Keep your spine straight as your curve it down to the side.
This crunch style is a great alternative for people who have poor mobility and can’t get down on the ground., Once you have done one set of side crunches (approximately 10–15 reps), switch arms and legs to crunch on the other side of your body.


Try to do 1–3 sets of 10–15 reps on each side of your body.

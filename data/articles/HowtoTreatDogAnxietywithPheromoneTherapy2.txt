 Once you have decided to use pheromones, you will need to find the right product to use. Look at the label to see if it is appropriate for your dog. Some products, such as collars, come in a variety of sizes, so pick the right one for your specific dog.


There are a wide variety of pheromone products available at pet stores and online retailers.
You will need to decide between a spray, a diffuser, wipes, drops, or a collar.
 If you are using pheromones to help your dog with anxiety, you will need to assess when the pheromone is needed. It's important to know when to apply the pheromone so that it helps your dog stay calm before the anxiety arises.


For example, if you know that your dog will have anxiety during a holiday when people shoot off fireworks, then give your dog pheromone therapy medication before the fireworks begin.
If you are using a pheromone collar, you may just keep it on your dog if it has general anxiety., Follow the instructions that came on the product's label. This will tell you how much to use and when to apply it if you bought a spray-on pheromone product. The diffuser products are usually just plugged in to an electrical plug near your dog's favorite spot.


If you have multiple pets in your house, it is still safe to use pheromones. There have been no reported negative side effects from pheromone therapy and the pheromones might even help your other pet's mental well-being also.

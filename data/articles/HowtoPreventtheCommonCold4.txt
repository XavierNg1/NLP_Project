We make vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight. Just 15 minutes of sun, or half the time it takes for your arms and face to become pink from the sun, is enough to boost the immune system.


If you spend more than 15 minutes in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Some experts believe that you can still get the vitamin D benefits from the sunlight even when you protect your skin.
In winter when there is usually less sunlight, researchers are discovering that people may have a higher risk for respiratory infections such as colds. This is due in part to low vitamin D levels. Supplement low vitamin D levels with tablets or cod liver oil during the winter months.
Ask your doctor to check your vitamin D levels with a simple blood test.

 These towels are almost always rectangular and usually measure around 6 inches by 9 inches (15 cm by 23 cm). An embroidered cross or shell usually decorates the center bottom.


The priest uses the lavabo towel to dry his hands when he has washed them before the Consecration of the Eucharist.
A baptismal towel is used to dry an infant or other individual after being baptized with Holy water.
 Spread out the towel so that the cross or shell faces down.


Use your hands to smooth out any wrinkles or bunches.
The long side of the towel should run vertically and the shorter side should run horizontally.
 Take the right-most third of the towel and fold it in toward the left.


The right third should completely cover a third of the towel at the center. There should be another even third open at the left.
 Fold the left-most third of the towel in toward the right.


This panel should completely cover the right and center thirds that were folded together previously.
 Fold the top of the towel down over the bottom.


When finished, the towel should be folded into six evenly sized rectangles.
 Use your fingers to crease each fold you made. Turn the towel over so that the decorative cross or shell is now on top.


This step should complete the process.

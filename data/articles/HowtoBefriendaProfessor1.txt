 Make a point of approaching the professor after the class to say a quick “hello” and introduce yourself. Let the professor know you are excited about their class and look forward to learning from them. Mention your name and try to chat with the professor about your educational interests or background.For example, you may say, “Hi, my name is Selena Gomez. I’m a second year med student. I’m looking forward to taking your class.”;
, Most professors will hold office hours outside of class time and like it when students make the effort to attend them. Go to the professor’s office hours to introduce yourself one on one.Come prepared with a question or thought about that week’s class. Bring along notes from class so you can discuss them with the professor. Having notes will give you something to chat about during the office hours.
Most professors have open office hours, or office hours by appointment. Show up on time for your appointment with the professor so they are not kept waiting.
 Be friendly to the professor when you spot them walking around campus or in the hallway between classes. Say “hello” to them at social events on campus. Doing this will let them know you are open and friendly.You may try some small talk with the professor when you see them and they do not seem in a hurry. You may say, “How’s your day going?” or “Great to see you.”

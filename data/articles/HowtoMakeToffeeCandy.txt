 Place the chopped butter, sugar, water, and corn syrup in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat.;
, Insert a candy thermometer and bring the candy to a boil. Periodically brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals from forming on the sides and turning your candy unpleasantly gritty.
 If the candy appears to separate (with a layer of melted butter on top) carefully stir it vigorously to make it come back together again. Watch the candy as it approaches 300 °F (149 °C), since it cooks quickly and can easily scorch at high temperatures. As it reaches the proper temperature it will turn a dark, golden amber color.
 Carefully remove the pan from heat and pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet.
, Allow the toffee to cool completely.
 At this point, the toffee is finished and can be served plain. If you wish to dip it in chocolate, proceed to the next step.
 Place it in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it in one-minute increments, stirring after every minute to prevent overheating.
 You can dip it halfway in, or if you prefer, you can use a fork or dipping tools to submerge the toffee pieces entirely in chocolate. Remove the toffee from the chocolate and drag the bottom of the fork across the lip of the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place dipped toffee pieces on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. You can serve the chocolate-dipped toffee as-is, or if you would like to cover it with chopped nuts, proceed to the next step.
 Repeat with the remaining chocolate, toffee and nuts.
 Once the chocolate is set, the toffee can be served immediately or stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

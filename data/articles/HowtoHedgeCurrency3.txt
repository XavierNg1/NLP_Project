 Foreign currency options give the purchaser the option to sell or buy a foreign currency contract at a specific price on a specific date. This hedging technique is similar to forward contracts, except that the owner of the option is not required to exercise the option.


When the specific date (known as the expiration date) of the contract arrives, the buyer of the contract can exercise the option at the agreed price (known as the strike price), if currency fluctuations have made it profitable for him/her. If fluctuations have made the option worthless, it expires without the company or individual exercising it.
 You can use gold and other precious metals to hedge currency positions. Investors have used gold as a hedge since ancient times, and many investors still keep gold in their portfolios to guard against economic pitfalls or disasters.
 One of the simplest ways to hedge your currency holdings is to buy some foreign currencies. If you live in a country that uses the Euro, for example, you can buy U.S. dollars, Swiss francs or Japanese yen (among others). If the value of the Euro drops relative to the other currencies, youâ€™ve sheltered yourself to the extent that you own the other currencies.
 A spot contract is an agreement to sell or buy foreign currency at the current rate and requires execution within two days. Spot contracts are essentially the opposite of futures contracts, where the deal is agreed upon well before the assets or goods are delivered, if at all.

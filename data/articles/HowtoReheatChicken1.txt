 Chicken — especially the breast meat — tends to dry out when it's heated for too long. Cutting the chicken into smaller pieces will make the reheating time shorter and prevent the pieces from drying out.;
, Don’t microwave anything in a plastic container. Many of the myths surrounding microwaved plastic and cancer have proven scientifically unfounded.The risk you run, though, is melting the plastic onto your food.
 Again, don’t use regular old plastic wrap, as it might melt onto your food. Don’t use tinfoil either, as it can spark and either start a fire or break your microwave.


You can purchase microwave covers that are made of microwave-safe plasticSimply cover it with a paper towel if you can’t find anything else

, How much chicken do you have? If it's a very small amount (a serving for a single meal), begin with one and a half minutes of reheating using the normal setting on your microwave — usually 1,000 watts. If you have a large amount of chicken, begin with 2 1/2 or 3 minutes of microwaving. In either case, check the temperature either by touching the chicken with your finger or by tasting a small bite to see if it's been warmed through properly. Continue to reheat thirty seconds at a time until it reaches an appropriate temperature.
 Keep in mind that the container will likely be very hot, so use oven mitts or potholders to safely remove the chicken from the microwave. Leave the cover over the chicken, and let it rest for two minutes before cutting into it or serving.
 Be careful when you do this, as it may release a large amount of hot steam. Keep your face and fingers out of the way to prevent burns.

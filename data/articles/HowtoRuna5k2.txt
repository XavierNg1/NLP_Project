 If you are physically fit, you may only need to get into the habit of running.
 Many organizations, including Couch to 5K, the Running Planet and the Mayo Clinic offer programs that allow people with no running or fitness backgrounds to train for a 5K.


Start slowly, with walking and running intervals. Most programs will have you walk for 90 seconds, then run for 60 seconds until you reach the point where you can run for 5 km (3.1 mi).
 Even if you do not run every day, getting enough physical activity on a daily basis to prepare you for a 5K is essential.


Choose another type of exercise for the days you do not run. This might be swimming, a sport like tennis or basketball or an aerobics class at the gym.
 Many people find getting support from another runner is helpful while training for a 5K. Recruit a friend, neighbor or family member.
 Your body will do a better job of training to run a 5K when it is fueled with lean proteins, fiber and the vitamins and minerals that come from fresh fruits and vegetables.


Drink plenty of water. While you are training, your body will require and use additional fluids. Drink water all day long.
 You might worry that you are too fat, too slow or just unable to run for the entire distance. Work through those so you are as mentally strong as you are physically strong.

 In order to suggest alternative dresses everyone should agree on some shopping guidelines. For example, have a list of "must have's" so that the bride, bridesmaids, and mother-of-the-bride are all on the same page while shopping for alternative dresses. Come to an agreement on the colour, length, style, and material. That way it will be easier to find an alternative dress.


For example, you might agree that the dress must be cocktail length, with a sweetheart neckline, strapless, and in a light pink colour.
 In some instances the bride or another member of the wedding party, may select a dress that you do not like. Perhaps you don’t like the style or the way the dress looks on your body type. Rather than saying “There is no way I would be seen in public wearing that hideous dress!” you could say “I like the colour of that dress, but let’s try on some other styles."This way you are not outwardly objecting to the dress or hurting someone's feelings, but you are providing alternative options.
Actively search for another dress that you like that meets the bride’s requirements (i.e. colour, length, material, etc.)
This also works if you are the bride and one of your bridesmaids or your mother has chosen a dress that you do not like.
 A growing trend for many bridal parties is for the bridesmaids to have different dresses. For instance, the bride can select a colour or shade and then the bridesmaids can each choose their own dress as long as it is the right colour. This way each individual bridesmaid can take their own body shape and budget into consideration when selecting a dress.If the bride has a particular look in mind, ask that all of the bridesmaids get the bride's approval before they purchase a dress. This allows the bridesmaids to have more freedom with their dress selection, but still gives the bride the final say.
In some instances the bride will want the mother-of-the-bride dress to be the same colour as the wedding party.

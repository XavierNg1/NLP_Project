 Adopting a Lab from a shelter or rescue group is a great thing to do, as these dogs are often loving, loyal animals who through no fault of their own have ended up in a rescue. Just keep in mind that adopting a Lab can mean compromising on little things such as the dogâ€™s color, age, or gender., Most dog breeds have fans who work to ensure that special dog breeds, such as Labradors, have good homes. Check to see if there are any Labrador rescue groups in your area with dogs available for adoption.


You may be able to get contact information for local rescue organizations from your local humane society, veterinarian's office, or pet shop.
Keep in mind that dogs who end up in rescue programs are not there because they are bad. Owners may give up their dogs because of life circumstances such as a divorce, job loss, or physical condition. Other times a dog may end up in a rescue program because the owner did not fully consider the financial and/or time commitment that a dog requires., If you are nervous about adopting a dog, keep in mind that many adoption agencies offer or even require a trial period for qualified adopters. During the trial period, you will be able to take the dog home for a week to see if you are a good match for each other.Even if you do not have to or want to do a trial period, it is important to meet your potential new pet. Spend some time with him or her before you decide if this is the dog for you. Shelters often have special areas for prospective pet owners and their family members (people and pets) to get to know a potential new member.

 If neither you nor your co-borrower are interested in living in or otherwise utilizing the property, you may consider selling the property. Selling the property would solve the problem altogether. If you wish to remain living on the property, however, then selling it is clearly not an option.
 Your realtor can research the values of properties that are comparable to your property. These property values, as well as current market conditions, can give you a fairly good idea as to the value of the property. You also can pay to have an appraisal done on the property. However, appraisals can be expensive and are likely to give you roughly the same information as the realtorâ€™s analysis.
 If the estimated value of your property is equal to or more than the balance on your mortgage loan, you could sell it and pay off the mortgage loan. However, if you owe more than the property is worth, then you will not be able to pay off the mortgage loan. The only exception is if the mortgage lender agrees to a short sale, or a sale of the property for an amount that is less than what is owed on the mortgage loan.
 If you receive an offer on the property that is fair and will pay the mortgage loan in full, your problem is solved. Both you and your co-borrower will execute a deed within the course of the sale that transfers all ownership of the property to the buyer. The mortgage loan will be paid off. If you receive an offer that is less than the amount of the mortgage loan, however, you will need to contact your lender to see if they will agree to a short sale.

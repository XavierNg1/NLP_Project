 Although fenugreek seems to be an effective way to reduce blood sugar levels after a meal, only a handful of studies have found this to be true so far. Therefore, it is still important to work with your physician to treat your diabetes.Fenugreek alone will not treat diabetes. Diabetics must follow a careful diet, monitor blood sugar levels closely, and do other things such as get regular exercise. Taking fenugreek does not mean you can stop doing any of these things.
Make sure that you still take your regular diabetes medications as prescribed by your doctor.
 Fenugreek is considered as “likely safe” for adults when you use it in amounts that are common for food. But it is considered "possibly safe" when taken as a supplement. During this time, you may experience some gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, gas, and upset stomach. You may also experience some respiratory side effects such as congestion, wheezing, and coughing.Do not take fenugreek for more than six months.
 Fenugreek is not considered to be safe for pregnant women and children. Do not take fenugreek if you are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant. Do not give fenugreek to children either, as some children have passed out from taking fenugreek.

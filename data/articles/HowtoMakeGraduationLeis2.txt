 You can use any color you want, even clear. You could also use one of the school's colors to get into the school spirit., Set the cellophane down on a flat surface. Place a small candy bar on top of it, about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from one of the narrow ends.Make sure that both are oriented horizontally.

It's best if you use wrapped candies so that they don't melt.
If the candies are very small, you could fit 3 to 4., Starting from the long, top edge, roll the cellophane around the candy, forming a tube. If you need to, secure the cellophane with a piece of tape first., Cut two 6 to 8-inch (15.24 to 20.32-centimeter) long pieces of curling ribbon in one of the school's colors. Tie each ribbon to either side of the candy bar.You can tie the ribbon into a bow or a simple double-knot. If you use a double-knot, consider curing the ribbon with scissors.Use one of the school's colors for the ribbon, if possible.
 You will need to tuck, wrap, and adjust the cellophane around the candy bar. Tie another piece of ribbon right above the candy bar., Tie a piece of curling ribbon around the cellophane around each candy that you add.

Consider alternating the ribbon colors for a more interesting lei. Be sure to match them to the school's colors!

, The standard 3-foot (0.91-yard) long piece of cellophane may not be long enough to make a lei. If yours is too short, cut another strip of cellophane, and tape it to the end of your lei. Continue adding candies and ribbons until the cellophane is filled.Something around 4 feet (1.2 meters) would be ideal, so trim off any excess., When you are close to the end of the lei, tie a piece of ribbon around the cellophane, just above the last candy bar. Bring both ends of the lei together, and tie them into a secure, double-knot.For an added touch, tie a piece of ribbon around the knot in a bow.

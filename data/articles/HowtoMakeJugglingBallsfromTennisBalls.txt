, The slit should be slightly wider than the penny

, (Any small, low value, coin will do.) Once they are in, they will not fall out. These balls will jingle as you juggle, and when they hit the ground, they will not bounce and will not roll away.
You can use fewer or more coins, but remember to use the same number of coins for each ball! If you use sand, weigh it, and use the same amount for each ball.






Start with fewer coins and add more as necessary; they are easier to put in than to take out.






The balls may be filled with sand, rice, or any inert granular material as an alternative to pennies. If you use sand, you may want to seal the slit in the ball with electrical tape or hot-glue.

There you go, colorful and cheap!
And they make music (jingle).
And they have a good grip to them.
And they stay put when you drop them.
You can also cut duct tape in half lengthwise about as long as your tennis ball, then wrap around, you can also put electrical tape over the duck tape

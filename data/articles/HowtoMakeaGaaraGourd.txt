 One should be around the size of a basketball, the other distinctly larger. They can be found in many arts and crafts stores, or bought online.;
, This is where they will be joined together, so make the cut as clean as possible.
 This has to be done quickly, as hot glue erodes foam, so only put glue on the inside 2/3 of the area, and press the balls together as quickly as possible.
 One should be the size and shape of five or so stacked bangles (in fact, you may want to model it after them), and the other should look like half of a small bouncy-ball.
 The smaller one should be glued on flat-side down, and as quickly as possible.
 This should be big enough to accommodate the top part you recently put together.
 Make sure to press it on firmly so it doesn't pop off.
 Gaara's gourd is a beige-like color, but painting the gourd gold or bronze would give it a somewhat more realistic look.
 Does it need another coat of paint? If not, great. If so, repaint it.
 Using a darker color than your base, paint a few cracks and splits going down the sides of the gourd.
 If you don't know what they look like, there are tons of websites you can turn to for help, like Google or Live Search. Just type in "Gaara's Gourd".
 Gaara has a red sash tied around the middle of his gourd - you could use and old scarf or just a piece of red fabric for this. Congratulations, you're done!

 You can buy inexpensive plastic storage containers in variety stores, located in the home aisle. They are clear, and they come with a frosted, plastic lid. You might want to buy one that will fit a cake pan in it.;
, To be specific, you can get all or what you want from the following: Yellow, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, devil's food, angel's food, butter, lemon, white,Velvet, carrot, rainbow (multi-colored dots), French vanilla, German chocolate, strawberry, golden butter, spice, fudge marble, and coffee.
 Choose which ones you like, and also add decorations for the cake, such as sugar crystals and other decors.
 It would also be a great idea to buy food coloring in assorted colors. (just in case you want to mix and make colors for your top coat of the cake.) Or, you can just buy regular colored frosting in: Pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, white, black.
 You can reuse these but it is important to have more than two on hand (just in case more than one cake is needed to bake.)

, This would include not only what suits your fancy but the following: Pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, white, black in sugar crystals, sprinkles, and candles.

 Most hospitals or birthing centers staff lactation consultants, peer counselors, or nurses with expertise in breastfeeding.


Lactation consultants can offer useful tips, demonstrate appropriate technique, and let you know what is normal in terms of feeding frequency, milk consistency, pain or discomfort, infant appetite, and milk production.
Most institutions will set-up an in-room visit while you are at the hospital or schedule a home visit to enable you to see a breastfeeding counselor.
 Let the consultant know about your troubles or questions as soon as possible so that she can direct you toward the appropriate resource for help or correct problems early in the process.


Most counselors will have you attempt to breastfeed while they are present so that you can walk through the steps and get reassurance, feedback, or answers to any questions as they occur to you.
 Breastfeeding can be intimidating, especially if you are a first-time mother. If you suspect you do not have enough milk or if breastfeeding is causing pain in your nipple or breast, discuss this with the lactation consultant. She may be able to direct changes in position, the use of creams, or additional tips to encourage the let-down of milk and to make the feeding process comfortable and successful.

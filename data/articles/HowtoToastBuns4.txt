 Switch the setting dial to "Broil" and turn the thermostat dial to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius).


Even though toaster ovens also have a “Toast” setting, the “Broil” setting is ideal for toasting buns. The “Toast” setting uses both the upper and lower heating elements, so both sides of each bun half will brown, resulting in drier, crumblier bread. The “Broil” setting, on the other hand, only uses the upper heating element, so one side of each bun half will brown and crisp while the other side remains soft.
You should be able to use this method for hamburger-style sandwich buns, sub-style sandwich buns, and hotdog buns.
 Open the bun and thoroughly brush both cut sides with the melted butter.You do not need to coat the crust side in butter.
Make sure that the entire cut side is coated with butter, however, including the edges. The edges will be the first part to burn if left dry.
 Place the split buns directly onto the toaster oven grate, keeping the cut sides face-up. Set the timer dial for 2 minutes, but watch the buns closely as they toast and remove them once the cut sides turn a light golden color.


Do not cover the grate with foil or place the bun halves on top of a baking sheet. The bun should go directly on top of the grate itself.
Watch the bun halves closely throughout the toasting process. They may finish sooner than 2 minutes, or they may require a little more time. Work in relatively short intervals, though, to minimize the risk of accidentally burning the bun.
 Use the buns immediately for the best texture and overall experience.

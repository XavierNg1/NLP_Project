 This is where your paper starts -- the first impression needs to be assertive, interesting, and encourage the reader to continue on. A few ideas to start with:


A relevant quotation or anecdote. This could be lines or dialogue, depending on the text you're analyzing
An interesting fact or question.
An acknowledgment of the counterargument.
Irony, paradox, or analogy

, It should seem to usher in the rest of the paper.

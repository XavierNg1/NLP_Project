Check the roots. Saplings with a root ball should have lots of root growth, but the ball should not be broken. Potted trees should have adequate root growth, but not so much that the roots encompass the outside of the container. The roots and soil should be joined together, and the soil should be moist.
Examine the trunk and branches, especially in mature trees. Look for healthy bark that is bright in color. Avoid leggy and spindly top branches, and look for well-developed leader branches (those coming from the top of the trunk).

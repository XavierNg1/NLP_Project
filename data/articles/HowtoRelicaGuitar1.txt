 Before getting into modifying the appearance, you’ll need to remove the strings. Unwind the strings if they’re relatively new. If they’re old and the string slack has already been removed, then snap them off with wire cutters.Aged strings won’t add any benefits when you relic your guitar.;
, You should be able to remove all the metal parts using a screwdriver. Aging the metal pieces of the guitar isn’t necessary, but it’ll add to the overall look in the end. Be careful when removing the pickguard from your guitar if you have one. Most guitars are wired so that the pickguard is attached to the input jack.If it is attached, you'll need to clip the connection using wire cutters. Only do this if you are prepared to solder or pay someone to solder the connection back.
 Be methodical when removing gear from your guitar. Do not just put everything in a large pile to be dug through later. It might help to take photos as you remove components as a reminder of where everything goes. Organize your parts into piles like:


Metals from the neck in one spot.
The pickguard and other metals in one pile.
Then the parts of the bridge in another.
Keep track of which screws go with what component.

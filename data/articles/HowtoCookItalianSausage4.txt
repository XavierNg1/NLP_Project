 Make sure that about six to seven inches of casing are hanging from the end of the stuffing tube. Keep in mind that each sausage link requires roughly six inches of casing.


Don't tie the end of the casing until all of the meat is in it.
 Hold the hog casing loosely with the other as the meat feeds into the casing.


You might consider enlisting the help of a a friend. That way, your partner can push the meat into the grinder while you shape the sausage in the casing.
 As the meat makes its way into the casing, you might notice some air bubbles pop up. Simply push them back and out to get rid of them.


The meat grinder will take care of pushing the casing off the stuffing tube, so you don't need to worry about that.
 It's very helpful to twist the sausage in opposite directions to keep them intact as you go on to twist the next link.


You might consider making the first twist right in the middle of the giant sausage. Then twist again in the middle of the smaller sections.
 Once you've divided your giant sausage link into smaller links, tie a knot at both ends of the sausage link. Twist and tie the end of the casing.
 Let them dry overnight, uncovered. The next day, cut them into individual links where the twists intersect.

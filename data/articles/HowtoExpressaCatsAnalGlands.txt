 You’ll need a pair of clean surgical or examination gloves, gauze pads, clean water, and, if your cat is hairy, a clipper. You’ll also want someone to help hold the cat still while you work.;
, Have a partner or assistant hold the cat still, facing away from you.
 If your cat is hairy, you may need to trim the hair around the anus before you can proceed.
 Pull the cat’s tail gently upward to observe the anus. Look for the gland openings, which should be located just beneath and to the sides of the anus.
 If the anus and gland openings are crusted with dried secretions, rinse with water and then gently wipe away the softened crusts.


In some cases, you may not be able to wipe away the softened crusts very easily. If this happens, try putting a warm compress in the anus for five or ten minutes to soften clogged openings.
 Using your gloved hand, pinch the two anal glands under the anus, using your forefinger and thumb. Gently push upwards, increasing your pressure until the glands pop and release excess secretions.


You will likely notice a distinct odor once the glands release their secretions. This is a sign that you have succeeded in your task.
If there is blood or pus in the discharge, your cat’s anal glands are probably infected. You’ll need to contact a veterinarian as soon as possible.
 Using a damp piece of gauze, wipe the anus and the surrounding area clean.

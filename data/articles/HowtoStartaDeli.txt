Depending on where you operate the deli, your employees may need special food-prep certifications. Certain areas may require all employees to hold this certification, while others may state that only one team member has it. The certification ensures that employees know about various food-safety issues, such as the proper technique to store raw meat.
 Build a menu of sandwiches, salads, soups, and other items you believe should be sold in your deli. Be creative and think of ways you can use the menu to draw in a strong customer base. When you create the menu, consider the costs of food, the refrigeration space you will need, and how you will store the food and waste. Construct the menu to maximize profit and reduce waste. If you don't have a lot of food storage, consider this during your planning phase.
 Most often, leasing is the best way to go. If you choose to purchase the building, this may be a big risk since you may not know how well your business may perform. Choose a convenient location based upon your budget and where your customers are. If the location was previously used as a deli or eatery, you will likely have less equipment to buy.
 You'll need utensils, condiments, tableware, napkins, chairs, and other d√©cor elements.
 These companies will supply the food for your menu. Consider paying more for higher-quality ingredients, as this will make a difference in your menu.
 Take applications, conduct interviews, and train the people you hire. For your own protection, you may want to consider running background checks on your potential employees. You may also want to make the hiring contingent on a clean drug test.

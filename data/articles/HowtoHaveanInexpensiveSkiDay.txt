 It will cost $20 on a ski-area burger, fries and drink, let alone any snacks during the day. Buy groceries to make lunches for the next day or next few days and ideally for a few people so as to share the cost. Shop below the mountain or resort as that will be much cheaper. Buy bulk bags or boxes of snack bars and chocolate bars as snacks. It's surprising how hungry you'll get on the mountain.;
, You'll save heaps of money preparing your meals rather than buying meals three times a day. Cooking your own meals is cheaper than take out from Maccas, not to mention, healthier.
 Hot oats with dried fruit and honey is an ideal quick breakfast. Breakfast burritos are highly recommended as breakfast food, they are inexpensive and heavy in protein. If you want to save money on-slope, eat lots at breakfast.
  Try to find a group where several people have cars and rotate driving responsibilities.  This makes paying for gas less of a hassle.
  Other cheap rental options often lie in towns near resorts or on the road up to resorts.
 The earlier you arrive the more value you get out of an all-day ticket.  Many mountains have highways and interstates leading up to them that tend to get very slow with high-volume ski traffic.
  This is very inexpensive compared to resort food and will fuel you well through the morning. This also provides a nice stop for the driver and passengers and allows everyone to stretch their legs and wake-up for the day.
  By going with people who are similar in ability to you, you will progress on runs at the same speed and not end up waiting for slow group members very often.
 Trail fees are much cheaper than downhill lift passes and the hire cost of cross country skis and poles is a fraction of the cost.

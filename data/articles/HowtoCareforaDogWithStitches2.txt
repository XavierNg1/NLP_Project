 Unless the surgery is emergency, try to schedule the surgery at a time where you can be at home with your dog. You want to watch for any odd symptoms, make sure your dogs rests and doesn’t over do it, and just be there for your dog.


During this time you shouldn’t have a lot of house guests. Keep your home quiet and calm for your dog so she can rest.
 When your dog has stitches, you should limit his physical activity. Stretching or over-exertion can cause swelling of the operation site. Don’t let your dog run up and down stairs, jump up to greet people, or engage in other hyper activities. It may stretch the operation site, causing inflammation which leads to swelling, pain, and discomfort.Keep the dog on a leash for seven to 14 days after the injury or surgery. This helps avoid too much activity and helps keep the dog from getting into something that might infect the wound.This may be hard at home. If you can't keep your dog calm, you may need to put him in a kennel to keep his activity level down.
Use barriers to keep the dog from going up the stairs. Whenever you leave the dog alone, put up barriers to keep him from running around or jumping on things.
 Other dogs also pose a risk to your dog when she has stitches. Other dogs might want to lick your dog’s wounds, so keep her away from other dogs during the healing period. This includes dogs in your own home.You may also need to keep her in a kennel to keep her away from other animals.
 Your pet’s health is the first concern. If you notice any excess bleeding, unusual swelling, or discharge from the wound, contact your vet. If your dog start running a fever, gets sick, throws up, or shows any other signs of poor health, also contact your vet.


If you are unsure about anything, call your vet or e-mail her a photo. She can help you determine if your dog is healing normally.

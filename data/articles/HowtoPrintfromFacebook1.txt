 If you have a long comment thread you want to print or you're looking to showcase several pages from your News Feed, printing a Facebook page formatting and all is your best bet.


When printing a Facebook page, you'll notice some of Facebook's formatting is simplified. If this doesn't suit your purposes, consider proceeding to the "Printing a Screenshot" method.;
, Picking a random point in your News Feed will cause several pages to be included in your print job.
 If you're using a Mac, click using two fingers.


Do this on a blank piece of the page (e.g., not on a link or a photo).
 You can also hold down Ctrl and tap P (for PC users), or you can hold down Command and tap P (for Mac users).


On a Mac, this option says Print Page instead.
 When printing a single Facebook page from your News Feed, you'll likely see a few extra pages included. You can remove these if you wish.


You should also decide whether or not you need color for your print job.
Note that your computer needs to be connected to a printer in order for the printer to respond to your request.
 If your computer is hooked up to the printer and the printer is properly set up, your image should begin printing.

 You will need a bucket of hot water mixed with dish soap, a clean cloth or sponge, a new safety razor blade and some glass cleaner.






As an alternative to the razor blade, you could use a mini paint scraper (for small jobs), a professional grade window scraper (for bigger jobs) or even a little fine-grade steel wool (for drips and splatters).;
, Use the sponge to wet the window with warm soapy water. The soap lubricates the window, preventing the glass from getting scratched.






If you need to protect a freshly painted windowsill, lay down a plastic tarp before applying the water and soap.
Make sure to reapply the soapy water whenever the window starts to dry out.
 Hold the razor blade at a 45 degree angle from the window pane (so it is closer to flat than vertical) and position it at the edge of the paint.






Holding the blade at this angle will help to prevent it from scratching the glass or from breaking., Using slow, smooth motions, start scraping the paint from the window. If the paint is wet enough, it should come away in a single sheet, rather than patchy flakes. After each stroke, clean the paint off the razor blade before starting again.






Always scrape in one direction only, lifting the blade from the glass at the end of the stroke. Scraping the blade backwards and forwards across the glass is more likely to cause scratching.
Pay attention to the sound the blade makes as it moves across the glass. If it makes a coarse or gritty sound, the blade may be dull or broken. Switch to using a newer, sharper razor blade instead.
You should test the blade out on an inconspicuous area of the glass first, to make sure it is working properly., Once all of the paint has been scraped away, spritz the window with some glass cleaner and use a clean, dry cloth to buff the windows clean.


Inspect the windows for any remaining paint. If you see any, repeat the process.

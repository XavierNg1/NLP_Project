 Along the folded edge, draw the trunk and branches of half of a tree on the cardstock. You will need to create four cutouts of the same tree.You can make the trunk any size you would like.
Be creative to create your tree's shape with branches in different directions.;
, Cut the cardstock while it is folded to end up with a tree that is a mirror image of itself along the folded edge.
 Copy the tree shape onto three additional sheets of cardstock to create four identical trees.
 Make sure you cut exactly on the lines to end up with identical tree trunks.
 Use a ruler to draw a straight line up the middle of each tree trunk. Then, fold the trunks on the line to fold them in half.


Fold all four trees in the same spot using the original tree that was folded as a guide.
 Use a hot glue gun to glue two halves of the folded trunks together. Repeat this with the other two trunks. Then, glue the two sets together.Do not glue the branches, only the trunks, to allow the branches to look more natural in different directions.
The trees will form a "+" shape with the folded edges coming together in the middle.
The shape should provide stability to allow the tree to stand.
 Use lightweight paper to cut small leaves for the tree. Using multiple different shades of greens, reds, or yellows will give the tree depth.


Fold a piece of paper into a small square.
Draw a leaf shape onto the square.
Use sharp scissors to cut out the leaf shape from all layers of the folded square to cut multiple leaves at one time.
Make enough leaves to cover your tree.
You can also use a leaf template to print pages of multiple leaves, and then cut them out individually., Use craft glue or a hot glue gun to attach the leaves onto the branches of your tree. Continue covering the tree with leaves until you reach your desired look.

 When you are looking at a potential female beagle (or dam) to breed, you must first ensure that she has not been spayed. Your first step should be to look for a scar on her lower abdomen. The presence of such a scar indicates that she probably has been spayed. For a more thorough diagnostic test, you should bring your potential dog to see a vet., You’ll want to have your potential dog tested for genetic issues that could be passed down to her puppies. You’ll also want to test for any hereditary diseases. Additionally, testing should include hips, CERF, elbows, CCD, and thyroid. Take your dog to see a vet and rule out any problems., In addition to a clean bill of health, you will want a dog with a good, stable temperament. A local dog trainer or local chapter of the American Temperament Test Society can do a quick test on your dog to see if she is prone to anger or panic.These mood swings can be passed down to your puppies, or may even make breeding difficult.
 According to the American Kennel Club, the female dog (or dam) must be at least 8 months old we she is bred. However, many breeders recommend waiting until she is at least 2 years old. This allows her body to grow and mature before enduring the stress of pregnancy. Females are normally retired from breeding by the age of 7 years old. Once again, if you are not sure about your dog’s age, a vet can give you a ballpark figure., A female, of course, will only breed when in heat. A female dog will go into heat about twice a year. If you can find out from a breeder or previous owner approximately the last time she went into heat, you can determine if she will be ready to breed soon enough for your timeline to allow.

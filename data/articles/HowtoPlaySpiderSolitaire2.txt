 You're using the same amount of cards in the same format. That's piles of 5 on the right and piles of 6 on the left (turned-up card included). The stock is the same, too.


If you're unsure as to what that fashion is, read up on the one-suit version. It's much easier and every new player should start with it.
 Instead of completely ignoring the suits, this time you're just going to lump them by color. That is, hearts and diamonds are "one suit" and clubs and spades are another.
 For the one suit version, you just needed to make numerical sequences (7-8-9, for example). Now you can still make those sequences, but you can only move them in chunks if they're the same color. That is, you can put a 7 of hearts on an 8 of spades, but you can't move them together.


You could, however, move a 7 of hearts and an 8 of hearts (or diamonds). This adds a considerable level of difficulty to the game.
 The rest of the game is the same, regardless of whether you're playing one suit, two suit, or the four suit version. You still use the stock when you have no moves to make, you still have to turn over face down cards when they're open, and you still have to have cards in every pile before you can use the stock.


And the format is the same, too. Same amount of cards, same amount of piles. If you skipped method one, you may wish to refer to it. What's more, if you're new to Spider Solitaire, definitely start with one suit -- it's much, much easier!
Again, the only difference is how you move the clusters, not how you make them. So be very careful when you move that red card onto that black card -- you may not be able to get to that black card for a while!

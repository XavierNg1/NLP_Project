 This isn't your purse. It should be small, maybe a travel makeup bag or simply a plastic snack bag, but big enough to carry everything you need. No one will see this.;
, If you're in the movie theater and you start your period, the pads you packed are no good sitting out in your car.
 Women have their periods and it's unavoidable. Teens: even if you haven't started, you could. Pack whatever supplies you prefer, plus a moist toilet, and some change, if you need to buy a tampon.
 Pack some mints or your favorite minty gum. Maybe even some breath spray.
 Pack a mini stick of deodorant, some perfume, and tissues.
 Makeup need touched up? Pack powder, concealer, lip gloss or balm, and eyeliner. You really don't need anything to simply touch-up your makeup. If you don't wear eyeliner/concealer/powder, don't pack it. Also, a few blotting sheets for an oily face are great!

, You never know when you need a ride out of there, fast, or when plans have changed and you need to call someone.
 A little gel could work too, or some smoothing cream. Pack some bobby-pins too, they fix almost anything.
 Clear nail polish works wonders. It can repair a torn dress for the evening, keep the shine on your nails, fix up chipped polish, and help with minor dents. Pack a tube with you, it'll come in handy.
 Pack at least $20 more than you'll need, just in case.
 You may think, Hey, I'm not on my period, I don't need a bunch of tampons. What happens if you start? Then you're in trouble.
 Always have fun on your date knowing your prepared for disaster.

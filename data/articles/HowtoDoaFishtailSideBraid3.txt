 Pull the hair into a ponytail in the back. Secure the ponytail at the nape of the neck with a hair band. Make sure to use a hair band you don't mind cutting.
 Divide the hair into two even sections. Take a small section of hair from the right strand, pull it over the strand to combine it with the left strand. Now, grab a small section of hair from the left section, cross over to combine with the right strand. Once you have finished a level of the braid, pull tight by separating the two strands wide. Repeat this method as you braid along the ponytail.Make sure the smaller strands are incorporated into the two main sections. You should not have many smaller sections as you braid.
An alternate way to begin this braid is to start at the top of the head. By starting at the top of the head, you do not need an elastic. You will start with two sections of hair. As you braid towards the nape of your neck, add sections of hair. You may need someone to help you braid if you are trying to complete this look by yourself., Secure the bottom of the braid with a hair band. With a pair of scissors, carefully cut the elastic from your hair. Loosen the braid by tugging on the plait to gently pull it apart.To complete the side braid look, drape the braid over one shoulder.

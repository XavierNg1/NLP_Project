 There are two ways to do this. For the easier way, you could buy some pine cones from a craft store (or something). You could also go to a park or wherever you might find pine cones and collect them.;
, Here, you decide what paint you're going to use. If these are Christmas decorations, you could try gold, silver, green, or red. You can do any color to your liking.
 Lay some newspaper down, get on an old shirt, and paint those pine cones!

, Once the pine cones are dry, find a decorative bowl, place the pine cones inside, put the bowl somewhere to your liking, and enjoy!

, If you want, glue sequins or rhinestones on the pine cones.


You can use some tweezers or some tool to glue the sequins or rhinestones easily.

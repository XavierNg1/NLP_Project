 Enzymes are molecules that help speed up the process of a reaction (in this case, the breaking down of meat). Various fruits contain enzymes that will help this tenderizing process along.Acidic fruits and substances like lemon or buttermilk will also increase the tenderness of your meat.
 The most commonly used fruits for this process are pineapples, kiwis, and papayas. Of all of these, the kiwifruit has the most neutral flavor (which means it will affect the flavor of your marinade the least). Be wary of pineapple--it contains the enzyme Bromelain, which will actually turn your meat to mush if you leave it sitting in the pineapple marinade for too long., Pureeing your fruit will help it mix into the marinade better. You could also make a simple marinade of oil and lemon if you would prefer that to a marinade with kiwi. All of these ingredients will help to break down the muscle fiber in your meat.
 Add your marinade of choice to the meat and cover or seal whatever you are keeping your meat in. Let the meat rest in your marinade for at least a day (though the longer the better).

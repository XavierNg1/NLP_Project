 Drew Barrymore and Taylor Swift both famously did this (Swift also went as a "prom date" for a football player who won a contest). Sure, it might a little self-absorbed, and will probably be expensive, but if it will give you closure, and it's within your means to do so, then go right ahead. Most people who do this tend to either hold it at a community center or make arrangements to rent out the local high school gymnasium during the summer. If you really have money to burn, you can rent a hotel ballroom (like a lot of high schools do now anyway), hire an event planning service to do all the work for you, and make it extremely realistic. You can even have yourself crowned "prom king" or "prom queen" if you are really feeling self-indulgent (hey, it's okay if you're paying for the party, right?);
, Before you get creeped out by the terminology, NO, an "adult prom" is NOT an X-rated version of a prom. It's a party that exactly resembles a prom, but marketed toward adults who are either looking to re-live their prom night, or make up for a missed prom. They often go out of their way to be realistic, even crowning a "king and queen", You can also do an Internet search on "adult prom" to see what the options are in your area.
 Before you cross this off as a completely ludicrous idea, consider the following. Movies with prom scenes are typically shot at least 20 times a year in cities with film industries. This works best if you can reasonably pass for prom age, and/or if you'd be willing to play a "faculty" extra rather than a "student" extra. It's also only really an option if you live in or near a city where films are regularly produced (i.e. New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver) Keep in mind that auditions probably won't be held during prom season - prom's a popular topic, and a movie that is released in the spring, in time for "prom season" is usually shot 6 to 18 months ahead of release.

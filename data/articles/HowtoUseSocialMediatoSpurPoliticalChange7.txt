 People like to connect and help things that are growing, and show results where they can point to. For example, if you are following a petition for "more nature oriented" or "greenery", try doing groundwork in your neighborhood as a role model and upload updates (photos, meetings, work done, and members) in the online format. This will not only engage you in your passion but also help the web community you are interested to attract; as your base grows you will have opportunity to use the web portal of social networking as a mouthpiece for collaboration and a meeting place for common ideas.

Some items may need steaming, such as rice or carrots.
Some items may need to be dried or toasted, such as quinoa or oats.
Sugar and butter may need to be melted.
 The ingredients should be mixed evenly.


When making a soft, chewy bar you will be adding items to a thick batter. As such, you will need to make sure the particles are suspended evenly so that they do not fall to the bottom of your bars.
If the inclusions you have chosen are too heavy, try smaller pieces. Alternatively, try drying them out. For example, walnuts may need to be chopped into small pieces as well as slightly dried to ensure they stay suspended in your mixture.
 Most bars need to be baked to keep everything together and to ensure that all the raw starches are properly cooked.


The mixture should be spread into a baking pan at the desired thickness.
Setting your oven to a temperature of 350 °F (177 °C) should be sufficient.
Bake times will vary depending on the type of bar you are preparing.
For thick batters, use a toothpick to check the bars are cooked adequately. Stick the toothpick in the middle; when the toothpick is removed and contains no raw batter, the bars are done. For other bars, bake until desired level of crunchy or chewy.
Some bars can be made quickly and don’t require baking, but do need refrigeration; these are the bars that have no raw flour in them. An example would be a peanut butter and granola bar.

 Make sure your camera has healthy batteries. Set your camera to camera mode.;
, Try to look for something interesting--it can be a person, a location, or an inanimate object.
 For example: the eye on a dog, the cherry on a sundae, the head of a horse, or the ladybug on a flower.
 If you are indoors, it might be best to use your flash (bounce off a wall or a roof if possible). If you are outside, your back should be to the sun and the flash should be off (make sure you don't get your own shadow in the picture).
 Your photo should have some dark areas and some light highlights. The best way to do this is to imagine your photo in black and white. You should have a white spot, a black spot, and a gray spot in your photo.
 Your emphasis shouldn't be in the centre of your photograph. Imagine a Tic-Tac-Toe across your photo. The emphasis should be at one of the four points where the lines cross.
 Make the subject take up the whole photo. Unnecessary empty space can take the emphasis away from your subject.
 Looking at something from eye level is often boring. Try taking the photo from above or below eye level--unique angles are always interesting!

, Shaky cameras make blurry photos. Hold the camera close to your body for stability. You may also purchase a tripod to rest your camera and keep it still.
 Utilise stability, setting, photography and snap your desired photo.
 You may have to snap a few more photos to ensure quality and satisfaction, so do not get frustrated if your photos do not turn out well the first few clicks.

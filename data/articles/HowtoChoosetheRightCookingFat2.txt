 Fats high in saturated fats are great for cooking and frying at higher temperatures. Because of their molecular structure, cooking fats high in saturated fats are stable and will not break down or oxidize due to high temperatures.Fats derived from animals are usually high in saturated fats.
 Cooking fats that contain a higher percentage of monounsaturated fats are great for cooking at medium to high temperatures. These cooking fats are suitable for saut√©ing, stir-frying, pan frying, and medium to high-heat cooking.Like saturated fats, monounsaturated fats do not oxidize under high temperatures.
 Because of their molecular structure, polyunsaturated fats will oxidize under high to medium-heat temperatures. When they oxidize, they release chemicals called aldehydes and lipid peroxides. Inhaling or consuming these chemicals has been linked to negative health effects.Seed and vegetable oils, like soybean, corn, cottonseed, canola, sunflower, sesame, and grapeseed oil, contain high percentages of polyunsaturated fat.
It is best to eat these oils fresh or raw instead.

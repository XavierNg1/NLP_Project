 Angels are known for their amazing bodies – after all, their work clothes are lingerie- and their diets reflect this. There is no clear diet for an Angel body, but all models stress healthy eating.For breakfast, eat something high in protein, like Eggs Benedict or oatmeal.
For lunch, eat a protein like chicken or fish, with some vegetables and fruit.
For dinner, eat sushi and rice.
Occasionally treat yourself to carbohydrates and desserts, but eat them in moderation.
 Eating right is not enough; to have the lean, toned body of an Angel, you’ll also have to make working out a priority. Angels differ in their preferred exercise regimens, but they all have found methods of working out that they really enjoy.For long, lean muscles, try yoga, pilates and ballet.
To burn fan, try biking, running or boxing.
 Some Angels will cut out alcohol in the month preceding a big show. Reducing alcohol intake is a great way to cut empty calories, and will also go a long way towards improving the quality of your skin.In addition to cutting out alcohol, make sure to drink water every day.
Drinking a half-gallon of water will aid in digestion and help cut tummy bloat.

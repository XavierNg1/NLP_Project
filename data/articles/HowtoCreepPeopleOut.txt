 Maintain eye contact for uncomfortably long periods without moving your eyes away from theirs. Do it in weird positions, like from the side, or peeking under your elbow to stare at the person behind you.;
, Angle your body so that your feet and shoulders are pointed directly towards the person you are focusing on creeping out.
 Like, "Oh, yeah. My feet are freaking stinky when I get home. Yeah, want to smell?", or "Wanna smell my breath?" while opening your mouth widely and looking at them.
 If they still haven't backed off, suddenly become moody, upset, or even angry at their lack of investment in the conversation. Like, "I hate myself and you probably hate me, too. I bet you're just trying to be "nice" to me." using annoying air quotes, "Everyone lies to me. What are you lying to me about?" or other questions that are impossible to answer.
 Ape everything that they do until it becomes frustrating. Exaggerate their facial and body movements. Mimic their voice for emphasis. "-snort- I just got the new World of Warcraft game. I only played for like 18 hours straight, so I'm only level 79 so far. -snort-" or "-pushes glasses up- Yeah, I have 9 skillcapes. I only spent like 80 mil on Construction, and 20 mil on Magic. I'm so pro, -nerd laugh-" Let them know how ridiculous they seem to you.
 If you've just met the person, you can say something like, "That Facebook post about (something weird like their mom's pregnancy) was so cool!" Make sure that the post was from a long time ago. This is guaranteed to scare them off.

 This app is white with a yellow Sprint icon on it.

If you haven't yet downloaded My Sprint for your iPhone or Android, do so before continuing.
 It's a tab that's either at the bottom of the screen (iPhone) or at the top of the screen (Android). Doing so will open your usage page.

If you aren't already logged in, first enter your username and password, then tap Sign In.
 This will expand it to show your current minutes and the total number of minutes available., The number on the left side of the "/" icon is the number of minutes you've used during the current billing cycle, while the number on the right side correlates with your total available minutes.

If you have unlimited minutes, you'll see something like "123 / Unlimited" here.

 This method is great for cleaning your entire shoe, inside and out. Your shoes will get cleaner if you remove the laces and inserts so they can be cleaned separately.
 If your shoes have deep grass, food or oil stains, they'll come out cleaner if you pretreat them with stain remover. Use the same stain remover you'd use on clothing. Apply it to the stain and let it sit for the recommended amount of time before washing your shoes.









If your shoes are a deep, saturated color, you might want to test the stain remover on a discreet part of the shoes (like inside the tongue) before applying it to the outside. If it seems to lighten the color, don't use it.
You should also brush off excess dirt and other debris before washing the shoes. This can clog up your washing machine.
 You can use a delicates bag or a pillowcase tied at the top. This will protect your shoes and keep your washing machine from getting pummeled during the wash cycle.
 Use warm water to help loosen the dirt and stains from your shoes. Cool water is also fine if you're worried about keeping your shoes bright in color. Don't be tempted to use hot water, no matter how badly your shoes are stained; the heat will loosen the glue that holds your shoes together, causing them to fall apart much faster than they otherwise would.









Use the same amount of detergent that you would use for a small load of laundry.
Don't wash your shoes with other articles of clothing; your shoes could damage the fabric, especially if it is delicate.
 Never dry your shoes in the dryer, even using low heat. Any amount of heat will cause them to fall apart by damaging the glue in your shoes. Instead, stuff them with newspaper or another stiff material and let them dry in a warm spot with good air circulation. Replace the inserts and laces when they're fully dry.

 Look for the Bubble Witch Saga app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with a witch and some colored bubbles. Tap on it to launch it.
 On the lower-left corner of the screen are some circled buttons. The first one from the left has a gear icon. Tap this to go to Settings.
 Under the Settings screen, there are some options. There’s an item for Sound effects which is ticked by default. Tap on this item to remove the tick.


The game is now muted and you won’t hear any sounds from your game play.
 If you don’t want to hear the Bubble Witch Saga theme running in the background, tap on the item for Music, which is also ticked by default. Tap on this item to remove the tick.


The music theme will be turned off and you won’t hear it anymore.
 Tap the big green button with a check mark on the bottom to save your settings and exit back to the game.

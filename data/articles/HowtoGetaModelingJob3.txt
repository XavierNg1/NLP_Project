 An agency will manage and promote your modeling career, marketing you to clients, fashion shows, and online, and helping to arrange jobs based on your availability and assets.Most agencies take a standard 20% commission from your earnings.Being a part of an agency does not mean that you’re guaranteed work, though you should feel that they’re marketing you appropriately.
Some non-exclusive agencies will allow you to sign with other agencies, so that you have even more opportunities for modeling jobs., Some agencies will offer open casting calls for new talent, so add those dates to your calendar and be prepared for a go-see or a cattle-call.


Be sure that the open casting is for a legitimate agency and is not a scam or a dangerous situation. If you have any concerns, take a friend with you to the call or photo shoot.Know the signs of a modeling scam, such as unsolicited contact from a photographer or agency, or the requirement for a down payment or fees in advance of your acceptance to the agency., Most contracts are biased towards the agency, but always contact a lawyer before signing any documents. The terms of an agency contract are always negotiable, so review the document with a lawyer and propose any changes to the agency before deciding whether or not to sign., Modeling for an agency, especially at the beginning, can be expensive, as you will need start-up costs for marketing, such as for your composite cards and messenger services between the agency and the client. Agencies often bill these expenses were billed to your future earnings, so that it may take some time to see any pay at all.Foreign models may need to pay the agency for travel expenses, and so may be deep in debt before they’ve begun working., Make sure they’re promoting you on a regular basis, and ask if you need to do anything else to be more marketable. If your agency is not doing a good job of finding work for you or you do not like the way that they are marketing you, then you may want to consider looking for a new agent or going freelance.

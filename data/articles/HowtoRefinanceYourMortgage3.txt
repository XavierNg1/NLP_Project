 ARMs' monthly payments are tied to interest rates. Some months, you might get a very decent monthly payment because interest rates have gone down. Other months, you might get a bigger-than expected monthly payment because interest rates have gone up.
 Many ARMs will feature a special "teaser rate" that advertises a lower-than-average initial interest payment on the loan. Often, this rate lasts for just a year or even several months, after which the interest payments skyrocket.These loans often seem too good to pass up. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always read the fine print associated with a loan, but especially those loans which appear to give you the deal of the century.
 If you are refinancing, look for another ARM with a lower initial rate, so your interest payments start off less. Also look for deals when it comes to payment caps. Payment caps are the total increased amount you can pay from month to month. If your ARM has a payment cap of 6%, then the total increase you can pay from one month to the next is 6%, even if interest rates increase more than that.

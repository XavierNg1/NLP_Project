If you aren't already logged in: tap Log In, enter your phone number and password, and tap Log In.;
, This is a speech bubble icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
 It's in the top-right corner of the screen.
 This option is at the top of the drop-down menu.
 You'll do so in the Contacts area near the bottom of the screen (and down).

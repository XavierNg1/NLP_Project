 Your target should still be 25 yards (22.9 m) out. Place the crosshairs directly on the center of the bull’s-eye. It shouldn’t require much adjustment from the bore-sighting section.
 Once you have the rifle aimed at the target, double-check your gun rest to make sure that it is secure and that the gun will not move when fired. Place extra sandbags around the butt if necessary.
 Different bullets have different weights, so it may shoot inaccurately if you change ammunition after sighting-in the rifle. When you are sighting in a rifle, you are essentially sighting it for one specific type of ammunition.


Put the cartridge in gently, so that you don’t disrupt the positioning of the rifle.
 Fire a group of 3 shots at the bull’s-eye, taking care to stay in the same position for each shot.Try to fire when there is little to no wind, so that your shot will not be affected.


Always follow strict safety guidelines when handling a live firearm. Never shoot when someone is downrange, and never point a loaded gun at another person.
 Measure how far away the center spot is from the bull’s-eye. Adjust the crosshairs vertically and horizontally, using the scope adjustment knobs. For example, if you need to move up 3 inches (7.6 cm), you would turn the scope adjustment knob in the up direction.
 Continue the 3-shot process, adjusting the scope as necessary, until you have centered the shots on the target.


Allow your gun to cool between shooting groups of shots. You should be able to hold the barrel for 10 seconds without burning yourself before firing again. If the barrel gets too hot, it can warp and lead to misfires and bad accuracy., Repeat the 3-shot process until you have centered the shots on the target again. Once you’ve centered your shots, you have successfully sighted-in the rifle.

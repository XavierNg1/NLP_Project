 Cool and confident people like to draw positive attention to themselves, so they tend to dress in style and a bit noticeable. Shy people tend to go for plain looks in order to avoid attention.


Know what's in style and put together a nice look for you. Something simple but cool.
Add a cool accessory. A pair of flashy earrings or just a really cool watch on your wrist can give your whole look more style.
Get a haircut. Just like dressing style, cool and confident people like to wear haircuts that make themselves look more attractive in order to attract more attention. Learn what type of haircuts suits you better, and if you are a girl, style it pretty - YouTube has lots of video tutorials about it.
For girls: wear makeup. Just a little bit.;
, Do not let a new cool look be ruined by shy body language. Your attitude must match how cool you look.


Stand up straight, head high and stride with a little cool bounce. If you're a guy, bounce a little on your shoulders; if you're a girl, then a little bounce on hips. But the important thing is that it's not overly exaggerated, but has enough attitude to show people you're confident and not afraid of attention.
Make eye contact. Face people, don't look down. It shows you are not afraid.
 You don't have to talk to much... but when you do, you must know how. Most shy people tend to get nervous when speaking to people, especially strangers. As a result, they mumble or stutter, making themselves look nervous.


Speak in slow pace. Practice this. Get any text and read it in a slower pace, making some pauses. Notice how easier your speech goes? Then, you know how to speak with anyone - in a calm, moderate pace with a soft pause after each sentence.
Speak to strangers. Ask what time is it to someone you haven't ever seen your life, or ask an information for someone you almost never talk to. This is a great start to become at ease speaking to new people. But remember, speak with calm pace and make eye contact!

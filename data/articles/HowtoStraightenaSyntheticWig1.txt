, You can buy a wig stand online or from a wig shop. You can also make own by sticking a wooden dowel into a wooden base with a hole drilled into the middle of it. Here are some other options for wig stands:


A toilet plunger will work well for short and medium-length wigs.
A soda bottle filled with water, sand, or rocks will work for short wigs.
A camera tripod will allow you to rotate the wig head to any angle.
 Push a pin right through the top of the head, at the temples, along the sides, and at the nape. You can use either sewing pins or T-pins.
 Gently run the comb or brush through the fibers. Work in small sections, and start from the ends first. Work your way up to the top. Never brush a wig straight down from the roots to the ends.Never use your personal hairbrush. The oils from your hair will damage the fibers.
Do not use a regular hairbrush. This includes boar bristle and paddle brushes. This can also damage the fibers and mar the finish.

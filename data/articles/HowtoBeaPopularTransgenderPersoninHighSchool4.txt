 Your emotional health matters, so spend lots of time hanging out with people who make you happy and/or engaging in hobbies that help you feel at peace.
 It isn't fair to expect you to be an ambassador of transgender people, especially not when you are so young. No one is entitled to anything from you. Any educational or anti-discrimination efforts on your part are your choice, and you are not obligated.


Check yourself to make sure you aren't holding yourself to impossible standards. You should not expect yourself to constantly be a smiling, talking Trans 101 encyclopedia. Not every interaction needs to be a perfect educational moment.
If educating others is exhausting you, then by all means, give yourself a break. Say the magic words "Go look it up" and do something fun for a change.
 Read webcomics such as The Princess and Rain, watch Orange is the New Black (if you are okay with R ratings), look at the work of transgender artists, and immerse yourself in transgender stories as told by transgender people. Representation matters, and it can really help to see fictional people who are just like you.


Don't just look for professional artists; a lot of amateurs also post worthwhile work.
 Look for transgender friends, but also other LGB+ people. There may be a club at school, a local support group, or a website (e.g. Tumblr) where you can meet others like you. They can understand you in a way that cisgender heterosexuals can't. Support each other, and know that you're not alone.

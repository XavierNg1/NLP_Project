 This recipe will make a large pitcher of Cosmo-style pomegranate martinis, but you'll still want to serve them in martini glasses. The recipe will make 6 servings, so you may need up to six martini glasses. Place your martini glasses in the freezer to chill while you make the drinks.Chilling the glasses is optional, but it will help the cocktails stay cooler longer.
 Carefully, cut 3 limes in half. Use a citrus reamer or juicer machine to juice about 3 limes. You need to end up with 1/2 cup (4 ounces) of lime juice.You can use bottled lime juice, but the flavor won't be as intense.
 Put your lime juice along with the other cocktail ingredients into a large pitcher. Stir them and refrigerate the cocktail mixture until you're ready to mix up the drinks to serve. Place these ingredients in your pitcher with the lime juice:2 cups (16 ounces) of vodka
1 cup (8 ounces) of orange liqueur
1 cup (8 ounces) of pomegranate juice

, Fill a cocktail shaker with ice and fill the cocktail shaker halfway with your Cosmo-pomegranate mixture. Cover the cocktail shaker and shake it vigorously. The outside of the cocktail shaker should become cold and frosty once the cocktail is shaken well enough.Depending on the size of your cocktail shaker, you may be able to shake a couple of servings at once.
 Remove the chilled martini glasses from the freezer and divide the shaken Cosmo-pomegranate martinis into them. Depending on the kind of shaker you have, you may need to strain the ice out as you pour the cocktails. Garnish the drinks with one of the following:


A strip of lime peel
A twist of lemon peel
A strip of orange peel

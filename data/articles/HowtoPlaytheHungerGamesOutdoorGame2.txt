 Have the announcer set two timers: one for one minute and one for two minutes. When the first timer goes off, everyone can race forward to grab a supply backpack. However, they cannot kill other players until the second timer goes off.
 Play this as a free-for-all game, but don't be afraid to make alliances. Learn to be stealthy by walking silently and using grass as camouflage. Sometimes just laying down in some medium- to long-grass terrain can keep you out of the enemy's sight. If possible, grab both a ranged weapon and a melee weapon. This will also come in handy if you lose one weapon or run out of ammunition.
 Remember the following when you fight:


If you get hit on the torso, you're dead, but if you get hit on a limb you're okay.
If you are hit on a hand, that limb is lost and you are not able to hold weapons in that hand.
If you are hit on a leg or ankle, you are not able to stand on that foot.
Ration your food and water: if you eat or drink too much to begin, you might starve to death or die of thirst later!

, Though the announcer should be keeping a close eye on game play, they cannot always keep track of everything. If you're texting, both the killer and the victim should text the announcer. If using walkie-talkies, just one person can notify the announcer.
 Once you are killed, you can sponsor other players by giving them your unused helpful items or bringing them new weapons that you make.
 The last person standing is the winner!

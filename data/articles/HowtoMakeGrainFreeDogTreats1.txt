 You make grain free treats by using a flour made from something other than wheat flour. Wheat flour contains gluten, which is stretchy and accounts for many of the properties of grain that make it so popular. Because you are not using wheat flour, don't expect your grain-free treats to rise or expand, the finished treat are likely to be denser than treats containing grain, and they will be more crunchy. For this super easy grain-free treat you will need:3 tablespoons of smooth peanut butter
1 large egg
1 ripe banana, mashed
1¾ cup of garbanzo bean flour;
, Preheat the oven to 300 F. Get out two bowls, a fork, and a cookie sheet. Line the cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
 In a bowl mash the banana with a fork and then mix it with the peanut butter and egg. Combine until they are completely mixed together.


Put the garbanzo flour in another bowl. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour and combine until it forms a dough.
 Either use a silicone sheet or use more garbanzo flour and roll out the dough until it is ¼ inch thick. Use a knife or use a cookie cutter of your choice to cut out the individual treats.
 Place the treats on baking parchment on a baking tray. You can put them close together, as the treats do not spread while cooking.


Place the tray on the middle shelf of the pre-warmed oven. Cook for 30 - 40 minutes until golden.
Allow to fully cool before giving to your dog.
Keeps for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container.

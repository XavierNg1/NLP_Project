 This antenna, which looks somewhat like a satellite dish, is known to offer better results than the can-tenna.


To build a parabolic antenna, you need a dome-shaped piece of metallic cookware. You can use a metal bowl, strainer or anything that falls under the category of Asian parabolic cookware (such as a small wok).
 Drill a hole in your utensil or strainer. Make sure that your antenna is as close its center as possible. Then fix it to the receiver with tape or superglue.
 Once you have made sure that your bowl/strainer has stuck to the receiver, face it toward the area that you will be accessing the internet from.


Keep changing your antennaâ€™s angle and note the signal strength on your receiver in each position. Use the position which indicates the highest signal strength.
Note that the larger the circumference of your bowl or strainer; and the closer it is placed to the center; the better are its chances of enhancing Wi-Fi signal strength.

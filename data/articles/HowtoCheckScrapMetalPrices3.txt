 Make sure you separate the rare metals from mixed iron. The quality affects the price considerably.
 Go online and research larger scrap metal yards that are slightly further away. These yards are likely to list their daily prices.


Do a search engine query with your state's name and "scrap yard" or "metal recycling" before choosing to trade on the day's current rate. Larger scrap yards may offer better prices that are worth the transportation cost of going further down the road.
 Playing the market comes with its risks, but learning to recognize a jump in scrap metal rates is likely to pay off.

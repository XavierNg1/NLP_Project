Grooming your dog is a great chance to become familiar with what's normal for its body.Don't panic if you find a lump. The lump could be a wide variety of things, from a harmless spot or mole to a more serious, aggressive cancer.;
, Check the size and shape of the lump. Measure the size of the lump and write it down with the date for future comparison.


How deep is the lump? Feel the lump and see if it seems to be in the skin, beneath the skin, or attaching the skin to the tissue beneath.
What shape is the lump? Is the lump round or does it have an irregular shape. Irregular lumps should always be checked urgently by a veterinarian.
How quickly is it growing? It is best to get any new lumps checked but if you are unable to get to a vet straight away, monitor the lump. Measure it weekly to see if it is enlarging. A rapidly growing lump needs urgent attention.

Higher risk lumps often have one or more of the following characteristics: irregular shape, rapid growing, deeply attaching the skin of the tissues beneath, inflamed itchy or painful.

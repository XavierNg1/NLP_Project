 Give your child time to meet the dentist you’re thinking about briefly and familiarize themselves with the pediatric dentist’s office. Allow them to play with some of the toys or games strewn about the office. If your child has a positive first impression of the dentist’s office, you should use that feedback to rank that dentist’s office in a positive way against other dentists.When a dentist’s office makes a good first impression on your child, the child will experience less anxiety than they otherwise might when it’s finally time to receive a checkup or other appointment.
 When you bring your child to the pediatric dentist or dentists you’re most interested in, check out their waiting room. One sign of a dentist who is committed to looking after children’s needs is the presence of child-sized furniture, books, games, and other paraphernalia of childhood. The pediatric dentist’s office should also feature kid-friendly décor – bright colors, cartoon characters, and so on., If your child is going to a pediatric dentist for the first time, they should ask about your child’s medical history and receive a copy of all relevant medical records before their first appointment. If your child is switching from one dentist to another, the new dentist should receive not only a copy of your child’s medical records, but also a copy of the dental records from their previous pediatric dentist.With these records in hand, the pediatric dentist will be able to make the best decisions about your child’s dental health.

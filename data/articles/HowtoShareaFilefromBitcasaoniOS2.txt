 Locate the Bitcasa app on your iOS device. It’s the app with a green background with a house on a cloud drawing. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step. Otherwise, you will be asked to enter your Bitcasa email address and password in order to proceed. Do so on the fields provided and tap the login button.
 Bitcasa’s main screen gives you easy access to major categories of your files. Aside from the main file directory under My Drive, you can also quickly access Photos, Videos, Music, Documents, and your Favorites.
 My Drive contains your main file directory. Tap on it to get inside to view your files and folders.
 Find the folder where the files you want to share are located. Tap on the folders to open them.
 You can share one or several files at once using a share link from Bitcasa. Tap the share icon from the bottom toolbar. It’s the icon with a box and an arrow pointing outward.


The files inside the folder will all have circles in front of them. Tap on the circles of the files you’d like to share to select them.
 After your selection, tap the Share link found on the bottom toolbar. A submenu of sharing options will be shown. Tap on the Facebook icon for Facebook.


The Bitcasa app will call the Facebook app and bring you to a post message box that already contains the share link for the files selected.
 In the message box, type in your message to go with the share link. Set who can see your post by tapping on the To field. A “Share With” list will appear where you can select the audience level or individual friends who can see your post.
 Once you’re done, tap the “Post” button found at the upper-right corner of the Facebook post box. The post containing the share link will be posted on your Facebook wall.


The Facebook app must be properly configured on your mobile device for this to work.

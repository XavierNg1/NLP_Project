 Use a sharp knife to cut an avocado in half, and remove the pit. Scoop out the avocado flesh from one half of the fruit, and place it in a bowl. Mash the avocado with a fork until it’s fairly smooth.If the avocado is small, you may want to scoop out the flesh from both halves to use for your mask. You should have enough for a mask that you can spread all over your face.;
, Once you’ve mashed the avocado, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of plain yogurt, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of olive oil, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of organic honey to the bowl. Use a spoon to fully combine all of the ingredients in a smooth paste.If the mask seems runny and you’ve only added half of the avocado, mix in some more of the flesh to thicken it up.
The omega fatty acids in the avocado and olive oil help heal cracks between the skin cells that can occur when your skin is dehydrated.
Honey and yogurt are soothing ingredients that help moisturize and soften the skin.
 When the mask is fully mixed, use your fingers to carefully spread it all over your face. Allow the mask to sit on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes so the omega fatty acids in the avocado and olive oil have time to penetrate.Be careful when you’re applying the mask around your hairline. The honey can be very sticky if it gets in your hair.
 When you’ve let the mask sit on your skin for at least 15 minutes, rinse it off with warm water from the sink. Because the mask can be fairly sticky, you may want to use a washcloth to help remove it.Be sure to rinse especially well along your hairline.

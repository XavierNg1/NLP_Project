 Fabric protectant, like Scotchguard or Stainshield, will make your hemp shoes more resistant to discoloration and dirtiness. Fabric protectant is suitable for most hemp products.


Check the label on your shoes or look up their care information online to verify that protectant can be applied. Some fabric blends may react negatively to protectant.Clean your shoes completely before applying a fabric protectant. Stains may be difficult or impossible to remove after applying protectant over them.
 The insoles of your shoes are often a hotbed for bacteria that produces an unpleasant smell. Kill this bacteria by soaking insoles in 2 parts white vinegar and 1 part hot water for several hours. Allow the soles to air dry completely, then replace them in the shoes.


Bacteria living in the insoles of your shoe are sensitive to cold temperatures. Put dry insoles or shoes in a freezer bag and store them in your freezer for 1 to 2 days. When you remove the shoes, the odor should be gone.
In the event your shoes still have an unpleasant smell after using one of these techniques, allow them to dry or thaw completely and then repeat the treatment as necessary.
In some cases, you may not be able to remove an odor even after multiple treatments. Buy a fresh pair of insoles at your local shoe store and replace the stinky ones., Gentle soaps and detergent will keep your shoes from wearing out too soon. Cleaners with chlorine, like many kinds of bleach, can cause damage and discoloration. Active cleaning components, like chlorine, should be clearly indicated on the label of cleaning products.


In the event that you need a cleaner for your hemp that has bleaching power but no chlorine, use oxygen bleaches, like hydrogen peroxide.

 Ideally, you have a close friend or neighbor who would be happy to watch your dog while you are away. They may already have dogs that are friendly with your dog, or they enjoy your dog’s company.They may not be able to watch your dog during those dates, so it is a good idea to have a few additional friends you could ask as a backup.
 Unlike a boarding kennel, your friend probably does not have all the items your dog will need. Your friend will appreciate that you’ve taken the time to collect these items so they don’t have to worry about providing them.Leash.
Food.
Bowls for food and water.
Toys.
Dog bed.
Any medications, if needed.
 Just like you would with a pet sitter, you’ll need to write down care instructions for your friend to reference. Even if your friend already spends a lot of time with your dog, it is best to give them this information as a precaution.Be sure to include the contact information where you can be reached at during your vacation your veterinarian’s phone number in case of an emergency. Include information about your dog’s daily routine, when they are walked and fed, any medications they take, and their bathroom habits. Give them a key to your house just in case they need to go and retrieve something for your dog there.
Let the person know if your dog is microchipped. If your dog is not microchipped, then you might want to have your dog microchipped before you go to increase the chances that your dog will be returned to you if they get lost.
 Always offer to pay them to watch your pet. While they may refuse payment, you should bring them a small gift back from your trip or take them to their favorite restaurant to say thank you.


You should also offer to return the favor and watch their pets the next time they are away on vacation. You could also offer to house sit if they do not have pets.

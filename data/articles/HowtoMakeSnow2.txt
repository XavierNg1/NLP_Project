 For this method to work, the weather needs to be extremely cold, like −30 °F (−34 °C).
 The water must be at 212 °F (100 °C) for this to work. If it is much colder, the water may not freeze.
 Make sure to do this away from you. You do not want the water coming back to hit you. If the experiment fails, you could get burned. If the temperature is cold enough and the water is boiling, you should have snow.


Boiling water is close to the gaseous stage. When it's tossed into the air, droplets vaporize. But extremely cold air can't hold water vapor like warm air, so the droplets condense and freeze.

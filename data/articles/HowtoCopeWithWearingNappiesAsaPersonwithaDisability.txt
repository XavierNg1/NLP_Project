 If you don't get a clear answer or you don't understand the answer, ask them to explain more clearly.;
,, Once you find out the reason, accept it because it is likely that it will never change. However, don't be a passive acceptor. Be proactive in this acceptance and do the following:


Talk to other people who wear them and ask how they feel about them and what they do to make wearing such aids more comfortable
Go online and do some research on the different incontinence aids available. You don't need to settle for somebody else's choice, especially if they don't wear anything like this.
Go shopping with the people purchasing these items for you. You can ask questions at the store and find things out for yourself.
 Take part in everyday activities as always. Seek advice from organizations responsible for assisting disabled people about ways to make things easier with your disability.
 It is really important to be with people who understand one another and can share information, ideas and stories together. This does need to be the only thing you join - indeed, you should also actively seek to join general clubs, groups etc., but this one will provide you with an environment in which everyone else "gets" you.
 This may include sports - many sporting clubs are now developing programs that are inclusive of disabilities and will be happy to help out. If not, ask why not and ask if they can develop something - suggest they seek funding from a local authority to help out. Other activities can include craft classes, adult education classes, language classes, computing classes and dating functions.

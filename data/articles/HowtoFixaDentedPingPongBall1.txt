 Boil a small pot of water. Pour the water into a ceramic cup.


You can put the ball directly in the pot of water, but don't leave it in for more than a couple minutes.Ping pong balls can melt or burn when overheated.;
, The water will heat up the air inside the ping pong ball. This causes the air to expand, popping the ball back into shape., To increase the heat and pressure, use a spoon to push the ball underneath the water. Hold it there for about 20 seconds, or until the ball is fixed.
 Use the spoon or a pair of kitchen tongs to take out the ball. The water will be too hot to touch with your bare hands.
 Wrap a tissue or handkerchief around the ball, taping all the edges together to form a little sack. Hang the sack from a nail or clothes hanger until the ball cools, about 5â€“10 minutes. The ball won't be quite as good as new, but it will be round and usable again.


Leaving the ball to cool on a flat surface can cause it to slump and form a flat surface.

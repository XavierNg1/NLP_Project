 Your course syllabus is the sheet of paper that lists each session’s topic and required reading. Look over the titles, units, and other information listed in the syllabus to find clues about how the course’s larger themes fit together.Ask yourself, “How does the syllabus organize these facts and figures? Does it mention or hint at any key critical questions? What connections does it make between individual class sessions?”

, You can make a study guide or outline once you’ve looked over your syllabus and gotten a feel for how the class organizes information. Use the syllabus as a guide to structure and consolidate your study guide.Your study guide won’t do you much good if it simply copies your class notes. Look for key themes in your class notes, pull out the essential information, and put it in your outline.
For example, if you’re outlining class sessions on the Wars of the Roses, you could list key members (along with their dates and titles) of the houses of Lancaster and York in one section of your study guide. Then, you could outline underlying causes of the rivalry between the houses. Finally, you could list key battles and their dates, temporary truces and how they broke down, and the conflict’s resolution.  

, When studying history, charts, drawings, and maps are sometimes the best way to visualize how the information fits together. In addition to being great study tools, making visual aids like timelines, family trees, and flow charts will help give you a bird’s eye view of the material.For example, making family trees and a timeline would come in handy if you’re trying to prepare for an exam on the Wars of the Roses.  

, Your teacher is there to help you! If you’re not sure what they are looking for, ask them.For example, ask them what the exam's format will be, what the unit's main theses (or key ideas) are, and what information is most important.

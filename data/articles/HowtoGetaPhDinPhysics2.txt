 For the most part, the other courses you choose don't matter, though a minor or a double-major in math can't hurt. You can take courses in other areas that you find interesting, since it's mostly the GPA that matters when applying to graduate school. However, you should ensure that your coursework includes the highest-level quantum mechanics and electromagnetism courses. Also, statistical mechanics can be really useful.
 Different schools place different levels of priority on these items. For the most part, you can assume that each factor matters equally.
 This means an activity that usually doesn't give college credit. It plays three roles: 1) you get experience in a lab, so you get an idea of what you're getting into, 2) you establish a close relationship with a faculty member who can write you a strong recommendation, and 3) you have evidence that you can function in the field of physics. Fortunately, most of these jobs pay - you can work hard over the summer and work part-time over the year. It is never too early to get started.
 Always interview upper class students to help you avoid bad programs. A web search will also help you identify summer programs outside your college. The advantage of these external programs is that they typically are run by extremely reputable institutions, and one of your recommendations will come from outside your college faculty.

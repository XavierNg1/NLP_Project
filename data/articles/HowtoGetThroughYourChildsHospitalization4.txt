 Being in the know about your child’s medical care can help keep your imagination in check. If you don’t have answers about their condition or different procedures, it’s easy to let your mind wander. Put your mind at ease by staying updated with their medical care team. Ask questions about any procedures you don’t understand.Staying in the loop about their care can help you feel more in control and keep stress at bay.
No one knows your child better than you. So, don’t hesitate to offer your insights about your child’s status to their doctors and nurses, too.
 Parents are trained to fear and prepare for the worst. But such a perspective won’t help you get through your child’s hospitalization. Try to maintain a positive outlook, especially when in the presence of your child.You can keep your attitude positive by not giving in to fear or negative thinking. If you catch yourself worrying or catastrophizing, immediately find a task to distract yourself, either by reading a book to your child or engaging in a spiritual ritual.
 Regular sleep is essential during stressful times like a child’s hospitalization. Aim to sleep as much as you can. Doing so can help relieve stress and tension, and equip you to make tough medical decisions. Many hospitals offer special suites for families staying overnight. If you use a suite, bring comforts from home that can help you sleep better.You might also alternate overnight shifts with your spouse, co-parent, or a relative. That way, you can sleep a few nights at home in your own bed without your leaving your child alone.

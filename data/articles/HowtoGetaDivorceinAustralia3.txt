 This is available at: http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Forms/Divorce+forms+and+kits/Application+for+Divorce+Kit. You can either view the kit online or download it as a PDF. The kit details the steps you need to take for filing for and obtaining a divorce. The kit also contains the "application for divorce" form.
 File your divorce application, pay the application fee (currently $800) and await the processing.


It is possible to file applications electronically or in person. For electronic lodging, see the Commonwealth Courts Portal at www.comcourts.gov.au.
 You do not need to attend a hearing for a sole application without a child under 18 or for a joint application with a child under 18. If it is a sole application and there is a child under 18, a hearing is required.


Undecided or contested division of property may require you to attend a hearing.
Failure to attend a hearing when required to do so can result in dismissal or adjournment of the divorce application.
 If there is any possibility of a resumption of the marriage, the Court will not be able to grant the divorce.
 If the Court is not satisfied that the children's well-being and needs have not been properly taken care of, the Court may decline to grant a divorce. There are exceptions to this, however. In challenging situations, it is a good idea to speak to a lawyer.
 Such a person will be able to help you with all of the process, including sorting out property, ensuring appropriate access rights to children and making certain that the end result is fair for both parties.

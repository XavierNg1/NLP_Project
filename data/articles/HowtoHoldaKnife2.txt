 Grab the blade in between your thumb and index finger. Keep these fingers positioned at the point where the blade connects to the handle.








If desired, you can pinch the base of the blade with your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Some cooks find this position easier to work with than one utilizing only the thumb and index finger.
When using a knife with a notably thin blade, like a utility knife or a boning knife, it might be easier to pinch the base of the blade with your thumb and middle finger while resting the index finger over the blunt top of the blade.
Overall, the professional grip offers greater accuracy and control while cutting.
 Bend the middle finger just behind the bolster of the knife. It should curl all the way around the top of the knife handle.









The bolster is the blunt metal strip connecting the blade to the handle.
When pinching the blade with both the index and middle finger, you will need to position the ring finger behind the bolster.
 Lightly wrap the remaining fingers around the handle of the knife, bending them all the way around the knife without gripping the handle tightly.









These fingers are positioned around the handle for the purpose of support. All of the actual strength used should be channeled into the fingers pinching the blade.
 Your grip should remain just firm enough to hold the knife. Use as little force as possible to accomplish that task while cutting.









Gripping the knife with too much force can cause tension to build in your hand. When that happens, your hand is more likely to tire out, and the accuracy, safety, and speed of your cuts will diminish as a result.

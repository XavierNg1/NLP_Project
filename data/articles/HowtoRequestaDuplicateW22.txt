 Your first action should be to call your employer if you have not received your W-2 by the end of January. If your attempts to get your W-2 from your employer have failed, then you should call the IRS., To make it easier and quicker to talk to the IRS about your missing pay stub, you should spend a few minutes preparing before you call. You can find your employer’s information on your final pay stub or earnings statement. You will be asked to provide the following information:your name
address
phone number
Social Security number
employer contact information
employment dates
an estimate of the wages you earned for the tax year and the federal income tax withheld

, If your employer still has not sent you your W-2 by February 14th, you will need to contact the IRS. Remember to be prepared to provide the IRS with the following information about your employer:your employer’s name
address including city, state, zip code
phone number

, You will still have to file a tax return even if your W-2 is missing or late. To do so, you must include Form 4852 with your return, known as a “Substitute for Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.”Form 4852 will require you to estimate your income and withholdings taxes.
 If you receive your missing W-2 forms after you file your tax return using the Form 4852 and the information differs from what you reported on your return you must amend your return. To amend your return, you will need to fill out a US 1040X Tax Return form, “Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.”

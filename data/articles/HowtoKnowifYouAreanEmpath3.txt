 Hostility is a large and unmistakable emotional mass for an Empath.


Once one has sensed this specific set of vibrations and learned that it means hostility or danger, it can be avoided or sidestepped rather easily.
Even if others to not know you are an Empath, in most groups it is easy to suggest taking one hallway, road or path versus another, thereby bypassing the threat.
 This knowledge eliminates confusion and frustration in many aspects of life.
 Most Empaths are very strongly connected to the earth and all living things.
 For clients, this ability paves the road for trust, feeling safe and supported and having someone value you for exactly who you are.


Getting angry at an empath is a big mistake and feels like having a bucket of water thrown in their face. An inexperienced empath is likely to wonder what's going on and feel very upset. An experienced empath might respond rather more abruptly. Either way you won't understand just how offended the other person feels.
Remember that although you will always feel driven to some extent to help others and be a good custodian of our world, it is not up to you alone. Do not allow yourself to be depleted or taken hostage emotionally.

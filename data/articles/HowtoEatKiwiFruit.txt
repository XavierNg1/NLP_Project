 Kiwi fruit has olive green or brown skin covered in a thin layer of fuzz. Inspect the kiwi all over to ensure it is has an even color on all sides. If you see spots that are darker in color or black, the kiwi may be rotten., A ripe kiwi is mostly firm, but it will give slightly when you press it with your thumb. This indicates that the kiwi has reached its peak of sweetness.


If the kiwi is rock hard, it isn't quite ripe. You should be able to press it in slightly.
If the kiwi gives too much, it is overripe. The kiwi should not feel mushy.
 A ripe kiwi will smell fruity and fragrant. The smell should be sweet, but not overpowering. If it verges on being sickeningly sweet, the kiwi is probably overripe. If it has no scent at all, it may not be ripe yet.
 If the only kiwi fruit available is hard and underripe, you can ripen it on your kitchen counter at home. Simply place the kiwi fruit in a paper bag and leave it out at room temperature. In a day or two, it should be ready to eat.


Kiwi fruit releases an enzyme that causes it to ripen. Storing it at room temperature in a paper bag speeds up the process. You can add a ripe apple or banana to make it go even faster.

 If the kiwi is ripe, the flesh will come right out. Use the spoon to scoop close to the skin to separate it from the flesh. Do the same with both halves of the kiwi fruit.


If the flesh won't come out easily, you may need to peel the kiwi with a paring knife. You can also use a vegetable peeler.
You should also peel the kiwi if you prefer to keep it whole so that you can slice it into discs.

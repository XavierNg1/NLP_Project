 Mason jars – the old standby of the home canning hobbyist – look great on a bathroom counter or shelf. Fill them with bars of soap, cotton swabs, or other bathroom essentials.You don’t have to use Mason jars. Any sort of large glass jar will do. But Mason jars are closely associated with the sort of simple rustic charm you should be aiming for when creating a farmhouse style bathroom.
 Wire baskets and bins are a standard component in farmhouse style bathrooms. You can use them to store bottles of shampoo, soap, toilet paper, or towels. Store the wire baskets and bins beneath the sink, on the back of the toilet, or on shelves located throughout the bathroom., Wicker can bring a bit of rustic charm to your farmhouse style bathroom. For instance, wicker baskets can be used to store towels, toilet paper, and other bathroom essentials. Use wicker tables and chairs as makeshift shelves. And wicker baskets are perfect for storing fresh or soiled towels., Wooden toolboxes or small wooden containers add a homespun charm to your farmhouse style bathroom. Place a longer wooden toolbox on a shelf or at the end of your bathroom counter. Stuff smaller wooden boxes with bathroom essentials and hand towels.

 Dye your hair blood red, or brownish-red but not completely diva red. Make sure your hair is straight, never curly or frizzy.;
, Don't wear glasses. You have to have dark brown eyes with long eyelashes.
 Don't always wear pink. Wear blue jackets and jeans, follow children's trends. Wear belts that match your outfit, but not totally bling-bling.
 Hallie is a mix between really kind and sweet and nasty and mean. For example, she tricked Annie into many things like pushing her into that water-tub. That was a mean, and when she criticized Annie's appearance as well. Try not to be like that so much, but develop a bit of a mean attitude. Do not look forward to this step too much.
 Hallie sleeps with a stuffed lamb named Cuppy. Try to choose one that you've had since you were a baby.
 Say 'thank-you' and 'please' but develop a more fun attitude inside you.
 Have a fun attitude, come up with crazy ideas for you and your friends to play and just be the loudest and most fun girl anyone has ever seen! Hallie is very creative and comes up with many cool ideas, which usually work.
, Imitate others but don't be too mean about it. Make other people laugh but make the situation nice and sweet with a sprinkle of funniness inside. Remember: Hallie is just a fictional character. You are just developing a style like her, not completely being her.
 A picture of your father is probably best because Hallie is more close to her father than her mother. Be creative, like putting a tiny strand of hair into the locket. Keep it as memorable as possible. Wear the locket all the time and never take it off, except when you sleep.
 Play pranks and believe in payback and revenge. Cover up for you and your friends, but not for anyone who is rude to you or who annoys you (your enemies).

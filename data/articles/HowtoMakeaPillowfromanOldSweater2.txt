 If you don't like the buttons on your sweater, cut them off, and replace them with more interesting ones. Wooden buttons will lend the sweater pillow a nice, rustic charm.

Keep the sweater buttoned shut.
Choose a sweater with an interesting texture, such as a cable knit.
 Center the pillow form as best you can. If the sweater has a ribbed hem, position the pillow form just above it. If the sweater doesn't have a ribbed hem, place it at least ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the bottom edge; you will need this for the seam allowance.

The size of your pillow form depends on the size of your sweater. Use a pillow that is a few inches/centimeters smaller than your sweater so that it can fit inside.
 Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to draw around all four sides of the pillow form. Cut the sweater, leaving behind a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.

If the sweater is very thick, cut the front out first, then use the square/rectangle as a template to cut out the back.
Make sure that the sweater is big enough to wrap around the pillow. This is important, especially if the sweater is tightly-knit or if the pillow is bulky.
 Pin the sweater along the edges, then sew it using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. When you are done, cut the bottom hem down to ½-inch (1.27-centimeter)., Slip your fingers into the openings between the buttons, and unbutton the sweater. You do not have to unbutton it all the way. Once you have a big enough opening, turn the pillowcase inside out.If your sweater is very bulky, you may have to clip the corners at the seams.
 On the other hand, if you leave it as is, you can take the pillow form out and wash the cover whenever necessary.

 When you first arrive in your new Animal Crossing town, you'll need to purchase a house, on loan from Tom Nook for around 20,000 bells. Through the game's tutorial, you'll learn how to pay off your home loan, which includes earning and finding bells. Throughout the game, you'll have the opportunity to remodel and expand your house with the bells you earn.;
, The best way to earn bells is by using tools. However, you need bells to buy tools, so you'll need to find a few bells first. The easiest way to find bells is to shake trees for their fruit. Your town's native fruit could be anything from apples to pears, which Tom Nook will buy for 100 bells each. But, if you have a non-native fruit in your town, such as a coconut, those sell for 500 bells. The second option is to find shells, which are located down at the beach.
 As soon as you've earned enough bells, you can buy tools, which will help you earn bells at a much faster rate. You can buy a net to catch bugs and a pole to catch fish, either in the river or at the beach. There are a lot of rare bugs and fish in AC:WW, so search high and low for high bell earners like coelacanths, sharks and Hercules bugs. Note: Most bugs don't come out during the winter, when there's snow on the ground.
 Look for stars in the ground around your town. These star-shaped patterns on the ground contain fossils, gyroids (self-playing musical instruments native to Animal Crossing) or pitfall seeds. Fossils are great to sell if you're not planning on donating them to your town's museum. Gyroids don't earn as much as fossils, but the rare ones earn more.
 Sometimes, when running errands for your little animal neighbors, they can give your about 500 bells or pieces of furniture you can sell to Tom Nook.

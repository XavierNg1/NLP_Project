 You can find vintage mason jars at antique stores or find canning jars online or in kitchen supply stores. In some locations, they sell canning jars by the dozen at supermarkets. Canning jars come in varying sizes, including 8 oz., 1 pint and 1 quart. The bigger the jar, the bigger your bulb can be and the brighter the light.


For the average bulb (60 watts), a normal 12-ounce jar should be perfect.;
, These kits are commonly sold in order to light paper or other lanterns. Ikea, in particular, sells a kit designed for simple DIY projects like this, but other retailers should have kits as well. They can be hung from a hook, strung along ceilings or walls and plugged into an electrical outlet.
 Look at the wattage requirements for the light kit. Each socket should specify what watts are required. Then, as long as the bulb fits, you can use any design or light type to fit into your kit., Clean them out the best you can, then dry them by hand to prevent water spots from forming. Make sure you get any dust and dirt off the inside of the jar.
 You can color clear canning jars with food coloring and Elmer's glue. Pour 1 cup of glue into a disposable bowl. Stir in the food coloring that you want to use until it is mixed well. Apply it to the inside of the mason jar with a foam brush. Allow it to dry overnight.You can also use decoupage glue; just be certain that whatever glue you use is easy to apply and dries clear.
You can also spray paint your lid and light fixtures to match if you want a more elegant light. Try a copper, silver, or gold spray paint.

 To advance your cowboy look, find a long-sleeved, button-down shirt, preferably with a plaid pattern. Thicker shirts, of course, can be worn in winter, and thinner shirts when it’s warm. Some cowboys do opt for a simple T-shirts, but rarely while working in the sun. Either way, the look should be rugged. Designer cowboy shirts might include some light embroidery, or a chest flap that snaps closed on one side.
 Many cowboys prefer wide leather belts with large metal buckles, which are often made of silver or brass. These may have "western" themes, or the cowboy’s initials, or they may just advertise for a favorite tobacco or beer company.
 Cowboys are like any other group of people - some wear facial hair, some don't. But working cowboys, who are often on the job from sun-up to sundown, don’t have much time for shaving.

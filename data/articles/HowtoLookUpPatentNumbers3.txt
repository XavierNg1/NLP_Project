 Each country has its own database, and has different methods of formatting patent numbers.


For example, a Japanese patent begins with the letters “JP.” For Japanese patents issued before May of 1996, the letters “JP” are followed by the last two years of the Japanese Emperor year number.Some countries start patent numbers over every year, while others continue numbering in sequence from the previous year., WIPO’s database includes 2.7 million published international patent applications and provides a simple search that allows you to limit your search to certain fields.Other global databases include The Lens and Freepatentsonline.com.
 If you don’t have a patent number, you can search most international databases with the CPC or IPC.You can search on the USPTO’s website to find the relevant CPC. For example, if you wanted to know the CPC classifications for headphones, you could search for “CPC Scheme headphones.”You also can browse through the CPC Schemes at the WIPO IPC Publication database.
The IPC system is older, and the CPC is based on it. You can also find appropriate classification words by searching the International Patent Classification Catchword Index., Most countries have their own English-language patent databases that you can use either to find patent numbers or to find information about a patent based on a number you already have.

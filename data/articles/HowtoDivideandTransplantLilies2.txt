 Generally, the transplanted lilies will grow better in a new location.


Pick a site with good soil drainage and good air circulation. Both are necessary for healthy lilies.
Select a spot with appropriate sunlight and shade. Lily plants require direct sun while the bulbs require shade provided by mulch and low-growing plants.
If you must transplant your lilies in the same bed, add new soil or bolster the existing soil with fertilizer or compost.
 Give each bulb a minimum radius of 6 inches (15 cm).



Replant big bulbs at a depth of 4 inches (10 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm).
Replant small bulblets at a depth of 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5 cm).

 Seeing your friend’s name on your phone as you scroll through your numbers will only serve to remind you about her and about your falling-out. Delete her phone number from your contacts.


Clear your recent call and text history so that her number isn’t listed there either.
 Delete your friend’s email address so that you’re not tempted to send a mean email or reminded about the hurt you feel.


If your email program keeps auto-loading her email address, try clearing the cookies on your web browser.
 Unfriend this person on Facebook, stop following her on Twitter, and undo your connection to her on other social media sites. You might still see her if she’s friends with your friends, but at least you won’t be constantly reminded about her every time you log in.
 If you have anything that belongs to your friend, return it to her. Otherwise, get rid of it. Remove this extra clutter from your life so that you don’t have these constant reminders about your former friend.

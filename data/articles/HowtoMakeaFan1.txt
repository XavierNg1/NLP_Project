 You can use larger paper, but this size is easy to find and work with. Set the paper in portrait orientation, meaning it's taller than it is wider.Practice with plain or scrap paper when you start learning. You can then switch to more decorative papers once you're comfortable with the technique.;
, Using a pencil and ruler, draw vertical lines 3/4 inch to 1 inch (1.9 cm to 2.54 cm) apart. These should go straight from the bottom to top of the paper.


For larger wall fans, move the lines apart in proportion to the paper size. Smaller fans could have smaller folds, which will make the fan seem more detailed.
 Fold on the first line, bringing the right side of the paper toward you. Use a bone folder to press the crease firmly. You should now see a peak.
 You should it in the opposite direction of the first fold, creasing the fold with the bone folder. You should now see a dip in the paper, or a valley.
 You'll start seeing these dips and peaks. They should alternate between these mountains and valleys.
 You should be grasping the gathered portion between your fingers, while the vertical pleats of the paper extend up and out. The paper fans out.
 Alternately, you could glue each fold to the next. Place the glue along the bottom of the fan where you've gathered it.


If you are using glue, let it dry completely before opening the fan.
 You can now use the fan or embellish it.

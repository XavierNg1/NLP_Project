 It is easy to fall into the trap of being mean to a girl you like, but in the end girls appreciate a nice, compassionate guy. Rather than tease or bother a girl you are trying to impress, flatter her with kindness. When you pass her in the hall, smile and say “Hey, Jess.” Take any opportunity to help out, like holding open a door, picking up her books, or offering her notes when she was sick.Do not be overly nice or it will come across as phony.
Also, be nice to her friends because friends often influence how someone feels about another person.
 Not only should you be considerate towards the girl you are trying to impress, but also to others around you. Once she sees how you treat others, it will shed light on your overall character. Practicing consideration for others will benefit you in all your future impressions on women.


Don't be a bully.
 Girls notice and appreciate a boy who is well mannered. For example, if she is walking behind you through a doorway make sure to hold the door open for her. Also saying please and thank you is appreciated by everyone.Make her feel special in anyway that's available to you. For example, if there is only one candy bar left and you both reach for it, offer it to her.
 Be careful and conscientious about what you say around her. Don’t say something around her that may make her feel uncomfortable. Avoid putting others down even as a joke; she may see you as judgmental and feel self-conscious around you.


You can be compassionate by showing encouragement to her and others. Positive reinforcement goes a long way in middle school and is often overlooked.Try out some positive messages in your day at school like "Don't even worry about that math test, Shonda. I know you'll ace it!" or "Good luck with your soccer tryout, Bill!"

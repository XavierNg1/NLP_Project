 A typical scene can include dozens of shots, from close-ups on a character's face to extreme long shots showing the entire scene from a great distance. There are also shots during which the camera moves, tracking the movements of a character or zooming in on an object. Each is meant to serve a purpose in telling the story.


Note whether the camera is acting as the eyes of a character or is simply watching the scene being shot.
Try to determine why the director choose each shot, and what the effect of each shot is.
Pay particular attention to unusual camera shots, such as slow motion, tilted shots or shots where the camera is allowed to shake. For example, a tilted camera shot is often used to suggest that the character represented by the camera is drugged.
Think about how the camera shots affect the pace of the scene.

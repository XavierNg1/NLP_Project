 Make a large workspace area available for your wedding invitation crafting.;

Create a template rectangle (or square if you are looking for a square shape). This should be made on very thick cardboard so that it can be drawn around again and again. Cutting up a cardboard box is ideal.
Create a slightly smaller template for the feature piece of paper which will sit over the top of the heavy card. This template should stop several inches each side of the card it will be sitting on. See photo for example.
 Do as many invitations as you require, plus some spares. Using scissors or a precision cutting machine, cut the cards neatly. Do the same for the feature piece.
, Smooth out any bubbles or wrinkles. Before you get the hang of this, you may need to pencil in the exact placement of the feature piece in order to ensure that it remains even on each card. The more cards that you make, however, the more intuitive this will become.
, See photo above for example. Make as many of these bows as you have cards.
 This will be the front of your card. Allow to dry.
 If you have a calligraphy pen, this will make it appear very elegant. Another alternative is to prepare a printed insert and attach it to the inner side of each card. This is faster and you do not have to worry about making mistakes or keeping straight.

 To do this, try several different CD's in the player. If possible, use new ones that you know aren't scratched.;
, If you find some, go on to the next step. If you do not hear any skips, then your CD is not damaged and you may stop here.
 Move radially from the center to the edge of the CD - never in circles! The reason for not moving in circles is that CD's store data redundantly in circles. If you scratch it from center-out, chances are there's no data loss. But if you scratch it in circles, chances are you'll ruin it.
 If there's still a problem, keep reading.
, If you find light scratches, buy a CD Repair Kit and use it. If you find big scratches, go to the next step.
 If you get to this step, either you just throw your CD in the trash or ask at an electronics store for the best CD Repair Kit they have. It may be expensive.

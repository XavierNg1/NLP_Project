 Wipe them down with a damp cloth, and try to remove all dust. (If you've been using the soap method, use a putty knife to remove the built-up soap.)

, Like the soap, this is not permanent. The lubricant will, however, last longer, and it won't build up as much as the soap will.
 This is extremely important if you use the silicone-based lubricant. If you accidentally sprayed anything other than the drawers with the lubricant, clean it up as soon as possible! It will make the floors very slippery, and if you do not clean it up quickly, it will be nearly impossible to get out. (If you don't trust yourself with the spray, put newspaper down before you spray anything at all.)

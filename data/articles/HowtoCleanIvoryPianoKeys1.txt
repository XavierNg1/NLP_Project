 To remove surface layer dirt and marks, use a clean soft cloth. Slightly dampen the cloth with warm water. Squeeze out any excess water before you use the cloth so it is not too wet.








Ivory piano keys should not be drenched in water as this can damage the ivory and cause the keys to swell, making them harder to play properly.
Do not use a brush or scouring pad on the keys. A soft clean cloth will work just fine.;
, Once the cloth is damp, apply a few dots of mild soap. Use soap that has no fragrance or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the keys.








Only use a very small amount of soap. You do not want the cloth to be drenched in soap or be lathered with soap.
If you do not want to use soap, you can skip this step. Often marks and fingerprints will come off the ivory easily with just a damp cloth.
 Wipe each key individually. This may take 20-30 minutes. Make sure you give each key a good wipe from top to bottom. Do not wipe them side to side, as this can end up damaging the keys. If you notice any stubborn marks, gentle wipe the area several times until the mark comes out.








If there are stains on the keys, you may need to use a stronger cleaning solution like rubbing alcohol, milk, or toothpaste to remove them.
 Once you have finished wiping each key, use a new clean cloth to dry the keys. Dry each key one at a time from top to bottom. Make sure there is no excess water sitting on the keys, as this can damage the ivory.

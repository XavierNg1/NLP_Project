 Instead of using plain soap to wash your body, use a scented body wash. Choose a body wash with scents that are similar or complementary to the ones in your favorite fragrance.For example, if your fragrance contains jasmine, bergamot, and vanilla, then choose a body wash that contains bergamot.
Many perfumes have matching body washes and lotions. If your favorite perfume does, then use these to layer instead.
 After your shower, apply a scented lotion that matches your body wash and perfume. Since the lotion is the “connector” between your body wash and fragrance, choose a simple lotion that contains only one or two scents.For example, choose a vanilla or jasmine scented lotion.
 Once the lotion has settled in, spritz your pulse points one or two times with your favorite fragrance. Try not to apply too much fragrance. Remember you can re-apply the fragrance throughout the day as it fades.

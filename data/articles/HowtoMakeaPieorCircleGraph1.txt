 One of the easiest ways to create a pie chart is to use a program like Excel, which has a pie chart builder option. You should open a new worksheet in Excel and then enter in the data you would like to put into the pie chart., Start by typing in the categories that you want to compare in the pie chart in the first row of the worksheet.For example, you may be comparing the number of men, women, and children who lived in your town during 2012. So you would type in the following three categories in the first row of the worksheet: Men, Women, Children. Enter the year that applies to the data in the first box, cell A1. In this example, you would enter the year 2012.
Enter in the applicable data for each category. For example, under Men, you may type in 2,200. Under women, you may type, 2,100. Continue to do this under you have put all of your data into the worksheet.
 Use your mouse to select all the data in the worksheet. The filled in rows should be highlighted blue.
 There should be a pie icon that appears on the right of the toolbar, with a graphic in the shape of a pie chart. Click on the drop down arrow and choose the type of pie chart you would like to build.There will be a 2D option and a 3D option. You can decide if youâ€™d like your pie chart to appear two dimensional or three dimensional.
 You can also choose the design of the pie chart by going to the Design tab and selecting the chart layout you would like to use. You can decide which colors appear on your pie chart, as well as the overall the appearance of the pie chart., Once the pie chart has been created in Excel, you should look over the pie chart to confirm all the data has been entered into the pie chart correctly.


You can also highlight a certain section of the pie by clicking on it with your mouse. The slice should move slightly up and away from the rest of the pie chart.

 (iTunes sends an email to whatever email address you sign up with whenever you download something, so if you sign up using your parent's, they will know if you buy/rent a movie they don't want you watching.) If your parents don't let you buy stuff using their credit card(s), you can use your own money to buy an iTunes gift card and sign up with that.
 Buying a movie costs $9.99, renting a movie costs $2.99. Renting is probably a safer option if your parents check your computer because it costs less and automatically deletes itself 24 hours after you watch it.

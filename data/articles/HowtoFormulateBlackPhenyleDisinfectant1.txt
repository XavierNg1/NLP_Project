 Caster oil will be the base solvent for your soap solution. Roughly ninety percent of the soap solution will be comprised of caster oil. Pour the oil into a container that is safe to heat on the stove top or over a bunsen burner.For example, use 890 mL of caster oil to make 1 L of soap solution.;
, Rosin is a dry form of pine resin. It is solid and brittle at room temperature, but can be melted on the stovetop. Heat the rosin until it is in a liquid form. Roughly ten percent of your soap solution will be rosin. Pour the rosin into the caster oil. This will give the solution a pine scent.For example, 90 mL of rosin will be added to 890 milliliters (30.1  fl oz) of caster oil to make 1 L soap solution.
 A caustic soda is the common name for a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Make the solution by adding 0.5% NaOH to a given volume of water. You only need to make a small volume of caustic soda solution, as it will only be one to two percent of the total soap solution.In the example of a 1 L solution, you would add 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of caustic soda solution to 890 milliliters (30.1  fl oz) of caster oil and 90 milliliters (3  fl oz) of rosin.To make 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of caustic soda solution you would add 0.1 mg of NaOH to 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of water and warm the water slowly while stirring. When the NaOH has completely dissolved, you will have a clear caustic soda solution that is ready to use.Do not let the caustic soda solution cool before adding it to the soap solution., Heat the mixture on the stove or over a bunsen burner until it develops into a soap. To test the consistency of the solution, you can dip a piece of paper into it. If it leaves an oily stain on the paper, the solution will need to be heated longer.

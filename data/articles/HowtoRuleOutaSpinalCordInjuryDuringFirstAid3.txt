 If the injured person is wearing a helmet, leave it on. Removing it could upset the injury, especially if it involved neck trauma. Wait for emergency personnel to determine whether and how to remove it.
 If the trauma victim is vomiting or choking on blood, it might be necessary to roll them over onto their side. If at all possible, seek assistance from at least one other person to proceed. With one person at the head and others along the side of the injured person, carefully coordinate your movements to roll them over and prevent choking.
 Since the rule of thumb is assume spinal injury until proven otherwise, do not allow someone who has suffered a serious head, neck, or back trauma to walk around or move in any way. It’s common for a victim to be mobile after an injury, but suffer paralysis due to later hemorrhaging and swelling. It’s important to have a medical professional examine the injury, and to obtain imaging scans for the most accurate diagnosis.

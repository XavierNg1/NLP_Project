 Many girls who wear Boston braces decide that they want to wear their brace over their clothes, rather than hide it all the time. Stores like Nordstroms and Macy’s sell cute, trendy covers for Boston braces.
 If a cloth cover for your brace isn’t your style, you can still decorate your brace. Stickers and permanent markers for writing or drawing on it are great options. Be careful not to do any decorating that might accidentally damage your brace.
 The Boston braces themselves are far less bulky than they used to be. Many girls choose to wear regular clothes and put their brace over their clothes. The choice is yours, and you should do whatever makes you most comfortable.
 Your brace is nothing to be embarrassed about. Between six and nine million people have scoliosis. You aren’t alone or weird for having this condition., Many teens have braces on their teeth temporarily, and your brace is temporary, too. Regardless of whether you show off your brace or cover it, know that it isn’t permanent, and you only have to deal with its inconvenience for a little while.

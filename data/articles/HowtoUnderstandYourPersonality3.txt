 Though this may not stand true for every test ever developed, most personality tests evaluate personality based on five traits (often called the Big Five). Each of these traits show up in some degree in all people, and your personality depends upon which ones are dominant.These five characteristics are abbreviated with the acronym OCEAN. The traits are as follows:O is for openness.
C is for conscientiousness.
E is for extroversion.
A is for agreeableness.
N is for neuroticism.
 For example, no person is totally introverted or totally extroverted. That would mean that someone never wanted to be around any person, or that they never wanted to be alone even for a moment. That said, most people lean to one side or the other. This is true with each personality trait. You cannot be defined as totally one trait, but will find where you fall on the gradient from introversion to extroversion.The same holds true for the traits of openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism.
 As we move through life, we experience new things. These new experiences force us to grow and change as people. You should be aware of how this growth affects your personality. Allow yourself to acknowledge when your personality has shifted, no matter how slightly. This will help you to stay true to yourself as you grow., If you are not happy with your current personality, you can make changes. Just setting goals and focusing on the traits you want to display can effect short term changes in your personality. If you keep this going long enough, you can start to see yourself differently and alter your social and emotional self to the point that changes become long term.If you are serious about changing major aspects of your personality, you may want to consult a mental health professional. They can offer guidance and supervision to help you attain your goals in a safe and responsible way.

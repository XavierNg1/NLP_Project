 Buy a shower curtain at a dollar store that you can throw away after the holiday. Use red paint to make a few handprints on it. Let some of the paint drip down the curtain and make some other smudges.It is probably best to do this outside on the grass or in the garage.
You don’t want to smear the paint around too much or it will start to look like just a blob of red.
Let the curtain dry completely before you hang it up in your shower. Hang it so the painted side is facing inward.
 Using some washable red paint, or lipstick, scrawl a warning across your mirror. Writing “you’re next” or “redrum” are classic horror phrases. You can splatter some other paint onto the mirror or makes streaks around the words.


An added scare tactic that uses the mirror is to hang a creepy picture on the wall that faces the mirror. Position it in such a way that when people look in the mirror they can see the picture right behind them.
 You can throw a cheap rug down and make “bloody” footprints that lead out the door. If you don’t mind getting the floor messy, you can make footprints on the floor as well. Be sure that whatever you use to make the footprints is washable.Another option is to make handprints that look as if someone crawled away. You can smear some paint along with the handprints as if the person was dragging their body away.

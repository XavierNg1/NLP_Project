 Batman's costume is close-fitting, although in more recent years, it has incorporated form-fitting soft body armor to protect the Dark Knight from bullets and knives. Thus, it isn't necessary to show every detail of every muscle, although the most significant ripples should be shown., Although the contrasting color trunks have been dropped in recent years, Batman is still drawn with them in many pictures. If you're including them, the lower parts should ride where his legs meet his groin, and the upper part, which reaches his waist, should be concealed by his utility belt., The sides of Batman's boots should come up to the thickest part of his calves, with the point at the front coming to just below his knees. His gloves should reach the thickest part of his forearms, with 3 serrated projections curving backward from the outer sides of his forearms to suggest bat wings.

The glove serrations are primarily decorative, but they served as bladed weapons in "Batman Begins."

, Batman's cape is both longer and wider than Superman's. It should extend as far down as the backs of his upper ankles, ending in scalloped points to suggest bat wings and be wide enough that he can wrap it around his body the way Sherlock Holmes can his Inverness cape. In action poses, the cape should billow out behind Batman, large enough for him to use it as a parachute or parasail in an emergency.

Bob Kane's original vision for Batman's cape was as sort of a wearable hang glider, but this created a cape that was too stiff to draw.
 Draw a line just below the waist and another line about the width of Batman's hand above it to represent the edges of the utility belt. Create a rectangle in the center for the buckle, then either draw in a set of spaced cylinders or rectangular pouches depending on which version of the belt you're rendering.

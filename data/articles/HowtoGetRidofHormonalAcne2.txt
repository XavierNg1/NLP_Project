 To get rid of hormonal acne, you will need to wash your face twice per day, such as in the morning and the evening. You should also wash your face after any periods of heavy sweating.For example, if you go for a run or if you have been doing yard work, then you will want to wash your face again.
 To make sure that you are getting a non-comedogenic cleanser, you will need to read the label., Gentle cleansing is the best way to clear up acne, so your fingertips are the best tool to wash your face. Don’t use a washcloth or a sponge as this can irritate the skin and cause even more problems. Work the cleanser into your skin using gentle circular motions. Then, use lukewarm water to rinse away the cleanser when you are done.Do not scrub your face! Scrubbing may cause irritation and, in some rare cases, scarring.
 Use a clean cotton towel to dry your skin, but do not rub your face with the towel. Just gently pat your face with the towel until it is dry. Rubbing your face with a towel may cause irritation and redness., Moisturizing helps prevent damage to your skin and helps keep it soft and flexible. You can check the labels of store-brand moisturizers to make sure that they are non-comedogenic. The term “non-comedogenic” indicates that it will not clog your pores. You can use some natural oils as moisturizers as well if your skin is dry and not oily. Some good choices include:Hemp seed oil
Shea butter
Sunflower oil
Castor oil
Calendula oil
Argan oil

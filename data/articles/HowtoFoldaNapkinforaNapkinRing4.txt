 This amazing fold looks breathtaking when pulled off correctly but doesn't require much more work than any of the standard folds above, surprisingly.To begin, lay your napkin flat on your table or work surface and fold one of the top corners to the opposite bottom corner. Your napkin should look like a triangle when you're done.


As above, a stiff, square cloth napkin works best here. You may find that this fold needs more stiffness than any of the other ones in this article — more so than the others, this fold uses the natural strength of the cloth to support the weight of the napkin.
 Grab the long, wide end of the napkin and start rolling it toward the point of the triangle. Roll as tightly as you can. The more tightly you roll your napkin, the more easily it will be able to hold its final shape, so the tighter, the better.


When you're done, your napkin should look like a narrow, skinny, roll. The edges of the napkin should make repeating diagonal lines on the surface of the roll.
 Taking care not to let your roll unravel, fold the napkin roughly at its middle point. The "points" at the ends of the roll should align with each other. Keep a grip on the folded base of the napkin to keep it from unrolling.
 Next, take the folded end of your napkin and push it into the ring (it should fit rather snugly — if your ring is too big or too small, this can be tricky). The two rolled-up edges of the napkin should stand upright, resembling a pair of skinny candles. Congratulations! You're done.


One great trick for arranging your napkins with this fold is to bring the folded edge of the napkin flush with the bottom of the ring and stand it upright. The ring should resemble the rim of a candlestick, enhancing the candle-like appearance of your napkins. Note, however, that this arrangement is very easy to tip over.

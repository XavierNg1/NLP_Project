 Equip a lava bucket by dragging it from its current location in your inventory to the first of 9 blocks in the bottom row of the inventory, and then press 1 to activate the lava bucket.


Walk around the map until you find water, and once you do, right-click the water to place lava directly on it. This reaction will create an obsidian block.
Use a diamond pickaxe to harvest the obsidian by left-clicking on the obsidian block.
Repeat the process 13 more times so that you end up with a total of 14 obsidian blocks.;
, In the location you wish to build the portal, place four obsidian blocks side by side in a line on the ground by right-clicking with the blocks equipped. This will serve as the bottom of the portal.
 To do this, right-click on top of each of the two-end blocks and stack 4 more obsidian blocks vertically so that the portal frame appears in a U shape.
 Right-click between the two upper areas of the U to fill it with obsidian.
 First, put iron ore into a furnace to make an iron ingot, and do the following steps in the sequence specified:


Destroy gravel by left-clicking with a shovel until a flint is dropped.
Right-click on a crafting table to open the crafting menu, and in the 3x3 grid of boxes at the top-left corner, place the iron ingot in the left column in the middle row by dragging it from the inventory into the appropriate box.
Drag a flint from your inventory to the bottom row, middle column, and click to place it.
Click the picture of flint and steel that appears on the right to craft it.
 Drag it into the first slot at the bottom-left corner of the inventory then press 1.
 To do this, right-click within the frame.
 Jump into the portal, and stand there until you are teleported to the Nether. This will take a few seconds.


If you leave the portal before you see the loading screen, you will not be teleported to the Nether.

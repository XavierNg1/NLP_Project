 When doing the box, literally sweep tip of the baton in your underarm, very lightly. It might sound a little nasty, but this makes it easier to toss the baton and it looks better than a sloppy preparation and/ or toss.;
, Toss the baton straight up. Always follow the baton with your eyes.
 When spinning, spot your spin by looking up at the baton, that way you're more likely to catch the baton and you won't get dizzy.
 If you have your arms out, it increases wind resistance, which slows down your turn.
 Do so whether you dropped the baton or not. Judges would rather see you smiling with confidence and drop the baton than to see you nail it but look unenthusiastic.

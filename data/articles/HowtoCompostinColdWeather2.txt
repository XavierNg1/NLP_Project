 Compost needs nitrogen and carbon, as well as air and water, in order to function properly so try to make sure that there is an available balance of all four components in order to keep the pile working properly., Typical carbon-based ingredients for compost include straw, leaves, cardboard, and shredded newspapers.


However, gardeners should only add black and white or grey newsprint because colored sheets may contain potentially toxic chemicals.
 Add some nitrogen-based fertilizer, such as blood meal or alfalfa pellets, to the compost pile from time to time to keep it working. This is especially helpful during cold periods. Nitrogen not only generates heat, it is part of a balanced diet for all microbes.


Gardeners can also add kitchen scraps, such as vegetable peels and coffee grounds, for a higher nitrogen content if the pile stops decomposing like it should.
 Where possible, compost piles should be located in sunny places, as this will increase heat and speed up the decomposition process.
 Start the composting process in the garage, basement or nearby shed and eliminate some trips to the compost bin. Cooler temperatures will reduce the usual unpleasant odors. Simply place the compost materials in a large bucket or small garbage can and take them out to the compost pile once a week or whenever the container gets full.


Layer kitchen scraps between layers of “browns” or paper products to help reduce odors.
 Diseased plant parts, dog manure, cat manure, coal ashes, and black walnut leaves should all be kept out of the compost pile because each of these things are known to be harmful in their own fashion.


Meat and dairy products should also be kept out of the compost bin because they will certainly attract unwanted attention from neighborhood animals.

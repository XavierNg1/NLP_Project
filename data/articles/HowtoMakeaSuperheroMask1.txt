 If you’re looking to make the mask of a specific super hero, you’ll probably want to use a template to make sure you get all of the details right. You can find a lot of super hero mask templates online, particularly websites like Pinterest. A Google Image search will also turn up templates you can use.

When you’re choosing a template, keep in mind your own skills. You don’t want to select something too intricate if you’ve never made this type of mask before.;
, If you’ve already got a mask that you’ve used before but it’s a little beat up, you can use it to trace the same design onto new material. This is also a good option if you’re making a group costume and everyone needs the same mask., If you’re good at drawing, you can design your own mask. You can draw the mask of a super hero that everyone knows, or you can draw an original design. This gives you more freedom in how the mask will look., Whether you’re using a template or a freehand design, trace it on to the material you’ve chosen for your mask. You can use a pen or a marker to trace the design. A marker is probably best because it will be easier to see when you’re cutting out the design., Once you’ve traced your design on your fabric, you’ll need to cut it out. If you’re working with little kids, an adult should do this part. Use a larger pair of scissors, especially if you’re using a thicker material like craft foam.Don’t worry if you don’t cut exactly on the lines you’ve drawn. When you paint or decorate the mask, these lines will get covered up anyway.
Fold the mask in half to make sure that the eye holes you’ve cut out (and any other holes, depending on the design) are even. Folding it over and then cutting off excess material makes your mask nice and symmetrical.

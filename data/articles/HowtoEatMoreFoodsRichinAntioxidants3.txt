 Perhaps the most touted source of drinkable antioxidants is green tea, although black and white teas also contain antioxidants that help protect cells from damage and may promote heart health.
 The antioxidants in wine may help maintain urinary tract health as well as promote general heart and brain health when consumed in small servings.
 Cocoa may help protect the heart from damaging oxidation and may also promote a healthy brain, urinary tract, and cellular defense system.
 Antioxidants contained in coffee may be just as beneficial for preventing cell damage and brain deterioration as tea or cocoa, according to recent studies.



If you prefer not to eat fruit or if you do not have the time, blend darkly-colored berries, citrus fruits, pineapples, or apples and pears for a whole host of antioxidant benefits.
Alternately, make a powerful antioxidant vegetable smoothie with tomatoes, carrots, leafy greens, and cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli.
 A glass of 100% pomegranate, blueberry, cherry, or cranberry juice can provide a rich source of antioxidants in a pinch. Avoid juices with added sugars or flavors.

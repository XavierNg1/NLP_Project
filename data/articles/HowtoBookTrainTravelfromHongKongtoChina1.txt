 The site is in Chinese, but you can navigate very easily with almost no knowledge of Chinese at all.;
, Baidu maps is very similar to Google maps and you can get public transport info.


Alternatively, you could go directly to http://map.baidu.com.
 This means 'Public Transport'. There you should find two boxes. The first box is the departure field, and the second is the destination.
 In the destination field, enter your destination. Direct trains include trains to


Shanghai/上海
Beijing/北京
Guangzhou/广州
Shenzhen/深圳

,, There, go to the ticket counter and buy your ticket. They should speak English there, as it is Hong Kong.


Ask for either Hard or Soft sleeper if going farther than Guangzhou. They're more expensive, but it's a long ride, so you'll thank yourself.
You can only buy your ticket less than a week prior to your departure.

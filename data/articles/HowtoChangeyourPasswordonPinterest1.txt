 The first thing you will need to do is log back into your Pinterest account from your computer and get on your main screen.;
, Once you are logged in to Pinterest, you will need to click the profile bar at the top right of the screen. A menu will drop down; click on the “Settings” button.



The first one is your email address. Click on the red link right below that says “Change your Password”.
 A pop-up will appear and it will prompt you to enter your old password, and your new password twice. This will confirm you entered the password you want.


Your password has been changed and your account is secure!

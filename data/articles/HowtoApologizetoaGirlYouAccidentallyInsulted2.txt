 Is there something you can do to make her feel better? Is there someone else that you may need to apologize to, such as a friend or family member who was also nearby. Showing that you will do things to fix your mistake proves that you are truly sorry and want to prevent future insult.


Do not, however, feel like you "owe" her anything. Your actions should be done out of caring, and she should not take advantage of you with absurd or unreasonable demands.
 If you tell her during the apology that you are going to act differently in the future, put your money where your mouth is and actually do so.
 While you should do this all of the time, go out of your way to show that you still respect her, despite your slip up. Treating her with respect and humility will help heal the wounds that were accidentally opened.


You don't need to act like she is queen. Basic dignity and curtsey should suffice.
 You need to go a step further than apologizing if you want to make a real difference in your friendship. Ask her to explain why your words/actions hurt, and make sure you take the time to listen.
 You may feel entitled to an apology as well -- after all, you did not mean to be offensive -- but this is not the time or place. You need to understand where she is coming from if you hope to avoid further issues. Do no argue or try and convince her that "you weren't being insulting" or that she is "overreacting."


The offender does not get to choose what is offensive. If she felt insulted, then you insulted her.
 This may seem obvious, but oftentimes, after a sincere apology, you may think that you can repeat the insult "jokingly." This is not only rude, it is incredibly disrespectful. You need to honor her wishes and find new language to express yourself.

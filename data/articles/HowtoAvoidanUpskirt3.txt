 When you are travelling through public spaces it is a good idea to pay attention to what is going on around you. Many upskirt photographs are taken in highly populated areas, such as subways, malls, and busy sidewalks. If you see someone acting suspiciously, you can keep your distance from them to avoid an upskirt.
 Upskirt photos are a growing concern as more people have high definition cameras on their smart phones. Often these pictures are uploaded to websites. It is difficult to charge people who post these images because many websites are hosted internationally. Also, many states are just now creating laws to deal with these types of photographs. For example, in 2014 in Massachusetts a law was passed to ban the practice of upskirt photography. Those charged can receive up to 2 1/2 years in prison or a $5,000 fine., Although you can do your best to take extra precautions and cover up while wearing a skirt, the major problem is that people are taking upskirt photographs in the first place. Laws will likely begin to change as more instances are reported. As a result, it is important that you make a report anytime you are a victim of inappropriate voyeuristic photography or you witness it taking place.You can also report the incident to a store manager, security guard, or any other public or private authority in the area.
When you report an incident it is important to provide detailed identifying information. For example, description of appearance, an account of what happened and where it happened, license plate number, or any other details you think are important.
 Reporting an upskirt photograph to the local authorities is one way to help change laws. You can also publicize your experience by talking with the media or posting your experience on social media. Many celebrities have talked openly about having inappropriate photos taken of them and posted online. This type of publication may help to sway public opinion and lead to the implementation of more laws.

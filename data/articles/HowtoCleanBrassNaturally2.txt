 Another option for cleaning more soiled items is to make a paste. Use the paste to scrub the brass down, which helps remove tarnish and grime. One paste you can try is lemon juice mixed with baking soda or salt. Just add enough juice to the dry ingredient to make a thick paste.You can also mix cream of tartar and lemon juice to form a paste. This paste can sit on the polish for up to 30 minutes.
Another option is equal parts white vinegar, flour, and salt. You can let this polish sit on the brass up to an hour., Use a soft cloth to rub the paste on the brass. You can scrub it into the whole piece. However, don't rub too hard, as you can scratch the surface. Be somewhat gentle to protect your item.Let the paste sit for 30 minutes to an hour if the brass is especially dirty.
 Once you've applied any of these pastes, make sure to rinse the product off. You don't want to leave it on the brass. Also, dry the brass thoroughly to help prevent tarnishing.

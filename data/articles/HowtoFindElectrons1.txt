 This is a color-coded table that organizes all the known elements by atomic structure. Each element has a 1, 2, or 3-letter abbreviation and is listed along with its atomic weight and atomic number.Periodic tables can easily be found in chemistry books and online.;
, The elements are ordered by atomic number and separated into three main groups: metals, non-metals, and metalloids (semi-metals). They are further grouped into families including alkali metals, halogens, and noble gases.Every column of the table is called a group and every row is called a period.


If you know the details of your element, such as what group or period it is in, it will be easier to locate.
If you donâ€™t know anything about the element in question, just search the table for its symbol until you find it.
 The atomic number appears in the upper left-hand corner, above the element symbol in the square. The atomic number defines the number of protons present in that particular element.Protons are the particles in an element that provide a positive charge. Because electrons are negatively charged, when an element is in its neutral state, it will have the same number of protons as electrons.


For instance, boron (B) has an atomic number of 5, meaning that it has 5 protons and 5 electrons.

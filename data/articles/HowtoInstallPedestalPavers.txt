 One keeps the pavers supplied to the installation site. One runs the chop saw and does the entire PVC cutting. PVC is usually cut for each new row as needed. You count how many intersections will need pedestals, measure in a couple of locations to get the height right and call out to the cutter how many at what length are needed. Two paver installers are setting and leveling.;
,, A standard chop saw (with fine tooth blade (12”) compatible with plastic) can cut the PVC pipe to the desired height. An installer then cuts the PVC pipe to the required height, less 1/4” for top and bottom cap insets. Example, a 2” high pedestal needs to have a piece of PVC cut 1-3/4”.
 Both the wedge top shims and round bottom shims can be used for “fine tuning” proper height if required. All top shims and bottom shims lock into place, and all six pieces (if used) interlock, allowing no paver movement and a level surface. The caps can be easily removed during installation if desired.
 Each bottom shim snaps into the bottom cap, they can stack to provide additional height.
 You are only building up the low side with this application.
 You are getting the same elevation (1/8”) but do not have to fool with the tabs on the top cap. Two bottom caps work well if you need to support the center of a large paver. It gives you a flat top in this application.

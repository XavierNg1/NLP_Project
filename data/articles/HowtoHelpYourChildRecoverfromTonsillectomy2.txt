 In order for your child’s throat to heal, it is usually recommended that she refrain from speaking for a number of days. This can be quite difficult for a child. Sometimes this is easier if the entire household refrains from speaking for the same period of time, at least when in front of your recovering child.
 Because your child needs to rest her throat, you can consider giving your child another way to get your attention. This could be through the use of a:


Bell.
Bicycle horn.
Xylophone.
Whatever item you choose, make sure that it is not very disruptive, as it will no doubt be ringing throughout the house.
 If your child is old enough to be able to write, then consider giving her a pad of paper and a pencil. That way she can write down whatever she may need. If available, you could also give your child an electronic tablet to write down her needs.


If your child can’t write, you can purchase picture cards that she could use to indicate common needs like needing food, water, or a hug.
You could also come up with hand signals to indicate certain needs, like having your child rub her tummy if she is hungry.

 Find a place in your backyard where you would like to build the track. Pick a relatively flat place where you will not kill any grass. It should also be big enough to accommodate the track. However, because you are using bricks, you can also adjust the track as needed.Have your kids come help you lay out the track so that they get a fun route that they helped design.
 Lay out the blocks end to end to create the track. Experiment with different routes and designs. Ultimately, you will want a track that loops back on itself. However, you can go with whatever design suits you and your child.If you want to connect the blocks permanently, consider connecting the bricks with landscaping adhesive once you have your track laid out.
If you want to create bends in your track, consider using chalk to draw rounded lines at the corners.
 Take a piece of yellow chalk and mark a line down the center of each block. This can be a straight line or a series of dashes like on a highway. You can also place a large patio stone near the track and draw parking lines on it to create a parking lot for your track.

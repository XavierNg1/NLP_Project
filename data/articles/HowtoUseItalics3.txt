 A common use for italics is to draw attention to a particular part of a text in order to provide emphasis. If something is important or shocking, you might want to italicize that word or phrase so that your readers don’t miss it.For example:


He had managed to eat ten cookies.
I love the word flabbergasted.
 If you want to call attention to a word, letter, or number as a specific term, use italics. For example:When defining an unfamiliar term, you may want to italicize its first appearance: “The scientific term for sneezing is sternutation.”Use italics to emphasize a letter on its own: I got an A in history this term.
When he moved to the Denver Broncos, quarterback Peyton Manning retained his famous 18 on his jersey.
 It is also common to use italics to show contrast to your readers. If you want your readers to notice a contrast between two words or phrases, you might want to italicize that word or phrase so that your readers don’t miss it. You can italicize one or both words depending on your objective.He had managed to eat not nine, but ten cookies.
The words through and threw may sound the same but obviously have very different meanings.
 Using italics to provide emphasis or show contrast is usually accepted in informal writing. However, most style guidelines advise against these uses in formal, professional, or academic writing. In most cases, it’s preferable to use syntax to emphasize your point in these types of writing.


For example, APA style specifies that using italics to provide emphasis is inappropriate unless the reader might miss your intended meaning without the italics.
Chicago style also does not recommend the use of italics for emphasis.

 To keep the tortilla from sticking, use cooking spray on one side. If you're using a nonstick pan, this step may not be necessary. Place the cooking-spray side face down on a plate or cutting board so you can add ingredients. Repeat with the other tortillas., Sprinkle in a fourth of the chicken, feta, cucumber, onion, olives, tomatoes, parsley, and oregano. Keep it on one half of the tortilla. Sprinkle on a bit of the vinaigrette dressing. Fold the tortilla in half, covering the ingredients. Repeat with the other tortillas.You can add in roasted red pepper or a bit of fresh spinach.You can also substitute dried spices for the fresh spices.
Adding a bit of mozzarella will help the quesadillas stick together better.In place of the chicken, you can use cooked ground lamb or even gyro meat.
 Place a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Let it heat up for a minute or so. Place two quesadillas in the pan. Cook them for two to three minutes on each side, letting them brown. Take them out, and keep them warm on a baking sheet in a 300 degree Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) oven while you do the other two. Cut them into wedges and serve.

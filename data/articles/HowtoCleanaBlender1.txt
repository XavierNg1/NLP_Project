 Fill the blender carafe halfway with warm water. Then, add a few drops of liquid dish detergent. Blend on a low setting for about a minute until the carafe is thoroughly sudsy. Then, pour out the soapy mixture and rinse until clean.








Make sure that the lid is secure! If the lid comes off, then you'll get soapy water everywhere!;
, Fill the blender halfway with water and a few drops of dish soap. Then, add half a lemon, coarsely chopped. Blend the mixture for a minute or so. The treatment should wash out the stains and leave the blender carafe looking fresh.








Alternately, use a few drops of white vinegar instead of the lemon. This may not smell as pleasant as the lemon, but it should be about as effective., Use a rough sponge, steel wool, or a toothbrush, depending on the strength of the caked-on matter. Put a bit of water and dish soap into the blender, and then chip away at the stains with your rubbing tool until they disappear.
 Use a mixture of baking soda, vinegar, and dish soap. First, pour a cup of white vinegar into the carafe. Then. add a few drops of liquid dish detergent and about a half-cup of baking soda. Let the mix bubble to the top and subside. Blend the mixture together, and then let it soak into the carafe for at least a few hours.








After a few hours have passed, pour the mixture out into the sink. Rinse out the blender carafe until it is completely clean. If the blender still smells like baking soda and vinegar, consider doing a quick blend-and-soak with only dish soap and water.
 After you clean the inside of the carafe, leave the jug upside-down on a drying rack. At the very least, wait to put the lid back onto the blender jug until the inside is completely dry. A moist interior can lead to condensation and provide an environment for bacterial growth.

 To decontaminate surfaces that may have come in contact with suspected foods or liquids, use one part chlorine bleach to five parts water as a cleanser.Wear gloves during cleaning. Spray surfaces and let the cleanser sit for 30 minutes before wiping with paper towels. Dispose of paper towels immediately.
Repeat this process again.
Discard gloves at end of cleaning process.
If not cleaned, clostridium botulinum on household surfaces will take days to fully denature.
 Place jars and lids in a large pot, fully immersed in water. Put a lid on the pot and boil the contents for 30 minutes.Cool, then discard all items safely.
 Any clothing exposed to the botulism toxin should be washed immediately in a machine with hot water and soap.
 Heating food to an internal temperature of 85 °C or 185 °F for at least five minutes will destroy botulism.

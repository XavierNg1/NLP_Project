 You can't block email addresses directly from your iPhone, and you can't access the iCloud Mail website from your mobile browser. You'll need to log into icloud.com on a desktop or laptop computer.


Log in with the Apple ID that your iCloud email address is associated with.
 This will open your iCloud mail account web interface.
 This will open a small menu.
 A new window will open to the "Rules" tab.
 If this is your first time, the list will be empty.
 There are several ways you can choose to block incoming messages:


Select "is from" and then enter the name or email address that you want to block messages from.
Select "has subject containing" and then enter a phrase to look for. This is useful if you gets of spam with the same subject but from different addresses.
 This will set any messages that meet your rule directly to the Trash.
 Your new rule will start to take effect in a few minutes. Any messages that meet the rule will be sent to the Trash. You can create as many rules as you'd like if you have lots of email that you need to block.

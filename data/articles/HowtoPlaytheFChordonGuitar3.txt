 Place your index finger across all six strings on the first fret and press down. This version of F is the most traditional, and contains all of the notes without any shortcuts. This makes it the biggest, fullest version of the chord.



Roll your finger slightly back towards the headstock, so you are pressing with the hard, bony side of your finger rather than the soft, fleshy middle. Barring takes some practice to get comfortable.
You will need to apply quite a lot of pressure to hold down all six strings. Try squeezing your thumb against the back of the neck for extra support.
 Holding your first finger in the barre position, form your second, third and fourth fingers into the shape of an E chord, starting on the second fret. More specifically:



Place your second finger on the third (G) string on the second fret.
Place your third finger on the fifth (A) string on the third fret.
Place your fourth finger on the fourth (D) string on the third fret.
 The finger position used for the F major barre chord is an example of what is known as an E barre formation, as the fingers following the barre make the shape of a basic E chord.











For example: keeping your fingers in the same formation as the F barre chord, slide your hand down the neck of the guitar until your index finger is on the third fret. This is a G barre chord. If your index finger is on the fifth fret, you are playing an A chord. You can move this form anywhere.

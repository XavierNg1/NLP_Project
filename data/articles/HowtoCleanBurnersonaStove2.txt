 If any stubborn stains remain after wiping down the burner coils or grates, use a baking soda scrub to gently remove them. In a small bowl, add 1-2 tablespoons of baking soda. Slowly add drops of water and stir until the mixture reaches a thick paste consistency., Using a soft cloth, sponge, or old, soft-bristled toothbrush, gently apply the baking soda paste to the stains on your burners. For best results, only apply the baking soda paste to burner coils or grates when they are removed from the stove top. Let them sit for 15-20 minutes., Using a clean, wet cloth, wipe the baking soda paste off of the burners. Wipe as thoroughly as possible to make sure that none of the mixture is left behind on the burners. Let the coils or grates dry completely before reattaching them to the stove.

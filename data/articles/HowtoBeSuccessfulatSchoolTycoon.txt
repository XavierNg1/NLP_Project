 As soon as buildings are built, students will appear wandering around. There are also some buildings that require others to be built first and in order to "upgrade" to larger buildings, you'll need to construct smaller ones first.;
, Choose teachers that have a little strictness, but fun in their evaluation "card". This strictness will be noted by students and reported in your alert box at the bottom.
 Avoid clustering your educational buildings in a cluster and having a cafe outside. Students may leave campus for food if they can't find anything. Hire 1 cook per food building.
 It doesn't necessary mean placing portables all around campus, but places where a student can be happy and comfortable. The bigger the restroom, the better.
 Make the students happy and build entertainment. Whether it's an arcade, mini golf range, or roller coaster, the happiness of the students will rise.
 When you see bubbles above a person's head, they either may have a happy face (meaning that they're happy) or with a building thought. Building thoughts can come up if the student thinks you should need something of (like a music building) or the area he/she is at, lacks what they want. Newspapers will bring the latest news, coupons, ideas, etc.
 Spark up the campus grounds with fountains, fences, flowers, statues, and other stuff. These objects are also included in a student's happiness and comments.
 As long as you have those facilities somewhere on campus, you are allowed to hire those people.

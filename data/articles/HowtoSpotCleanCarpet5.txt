 Anytime you spill on carpet, speed is the most important factor. The longer a mess sits, the more it soaks in. Lay a towel over a fresh spill and let the towel soak up the liquid. For solid messes, scoop or vacuum up as much as you can before you use a cleaner.
 Most manufactured spot cleaners come in a convenient spritzer bottle or aerosol spray can. You may also have a powder cleaner which you’d sprinkle on the stain. Cover the stain completely but don’t saturate the carpet.


Follow the specific instructions on the container anytime you use these products.
Look for spot cleaning products at most big-box stores, home improvement stores, and many grocery or dollar stores.
 Some cleaners may only need to sit for 10 seconds, but others may need 10 minutes or more to do their work effectively. Don’t be too eager to wipe them up. Give them time to work.
 Using either a clean rag or paper towel, gently apply pressure to the stain so the rag or towel can soak it up. Press a dry portion of the rag into the spot at least twice to pull up as much as possible.
 Some bad stains may need to be treated more than once, and this is up to your judgment. If you are not satisfied with how the spot looks after you clean it, repeat the above process as needed.

 Fortunately, there are professionals out there who study relationships, and written a plethora of advice on the topic.Arriving at a realization via reading may simple feel better than receiving a lecture, even from a trusted confidant.
Reading some objective advice may help your friend feel empowered and confident by arriving at their own determinations about how to handle relationships woes.
Doing some reading of your own may help you give them advice, and find something that particularly pertains to their situation – even if they don’t recognize it yet.
 Academic studies have examined the information and advice on relationships and sexuality included in such magazines and have come to some startling findings.Magazine advice columns consistently regurgitate assumptions and stereotypes that do not reflect the diversity of the types of relationships people have.
In particular, avoid publications such as Cosmopolitan, that have repeatedly indicated that women are responsible for changing men, as well as themselves, in order to improve and maintain their relationship.
 Most magazines geared towards “men” also include relationship advice featurettes. Do not allow this potentially harmful information to dictate decisions about relationships.Again, messages geared towards one specific gender are often consistent with stereotypical, sometimes problematic assumptions about gender socialization.
In “men’s” magazines, advice often revolves around a predictable obsession with reinforcing male masculinity.
Be wary of relationship advice that makes sex a top priority. Often, this sort of advice is actually contrary to advice on how to form meaningful intimate relationships.

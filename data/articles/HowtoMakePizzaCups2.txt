 Use two tubes of refrigerated crescent roll dough. Open each tube and separate the dough into eight rolls for each tube. Then, halve the rolls. Press the halved rolls into a muffin pan.Make sure the muffin pan has been coated with cooking spray before putting the dough into each section.
 Put one teaspoon (4.9 mL) of pizza sauce into each dough cup. You can use slightly less or more depending on the size and depth of the dough cups., This recipe calls for two ounces of sliced turkey pepperoni, ¼ cups of finely chopped onions, and a 1/3 cup of finely chopped green pepper. You can, however, use whatever ingredients you’d like. Put the ingredients of your choice in the cups and top with one cup of mozzarella cheese distributed evenly over the cups., Once all of the ingredients are in the dough cups, put the muffin pan in the oven. Bake them for 15-18 minutes at 375°F (190°C). The crusts should be browned, and the cheese should be melted when they are done baking. Remove the pan from the oven and serve while warm.

 A highball is a drink that is made in a tall glass that typically combines alcohol with 4 to 5 oz. (118 ml to 147 ml) of soda; therefore you must have a tall, narrow glass in which to build your drink. The glass can be made of glass or plastic, but can only be slightly wider at the top as it is at the bottom to be a proper highball glass.;
,


Drop the ice carefully into the glass so that it doesn't break or chip the glass.
 Add 1 1/2 oz. (44 ml) scotch to the glass. You can use your favorite scotch; pour it down slowly into the glass so that it settles onto the bottom. Use a quality blended scotch for your scotch and soda rather than a single malt scotch. Some suggestions:


Johnnie Walker Red
Chivas Regal
Ballantine's

, Add 4 to 5 oz. (118 ml to 147 ml) of club soda to the glass. Tilt the glass on a 45 degree angle and slowly pour in the club soda, pausing once midway through the pour to allow the foam to subside.
 Using a stir stick, straw or spoon, gently stir the drink to ensure that the soda and scotch are well combined.

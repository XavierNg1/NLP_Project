 This is the amount you have currently borrowed on the account, not the limit of the line. You can find this on your most recent account statement, or by calling customer service for the bank that carries your credit line. This information will also be available on the bill for your monthly payment., This will almost always be expressed as a percentage of the balance of the credit line. However, it may also just be calculated from outstanding interest. This is rarely on your monthly statements, but you can find it by calling customer service or by consulting the original documentation for your line of credit., If some are scheduled, add them to the balance of the line of credit before you continue with the calculation. Fees may be charged for withdrawals, so make sure these fees are not pending on your account before calculating your payment., Multiply the balance of your line of credit by the basis for the minimum monthly payment. The result will be your minimum payment for that month.

For example, if you had a payment basis of 2 percent on a line with a balance of $20,000, your monthly payment would be ($20,000 times 2 percent equals) $400.

Your minimum payment will also be listed on your monthly bill.

You may also be required to pay off the balance of your credit line account in full once per year., You should avoid paying just the minimum amount on your lines of credit. You can save a surprising amount of money by paying more than the minimum each month on any loan or line of credit. The extra payment is applied directly to the principal, meaning the line of credit will accumulate less interest in subsequent months.

For large loans, such as a home equity line of credit, this can mean paying off the line years ahead of schedule.

 Press the Guide button, and then navigate to the Settings menu. Select System Settings.;
, You will see a list of attached storage devices. From here, select All Devices. A list of categories will appear.
 This category should be towards the top of the list. IN this section, you will see every profile that is currently associated with the system.
 Select the profile that you want to delete and press the A button. A new menu will open with a Delete option. When you press Delete, you will be given two choices. You can delete the profile only while continuing to store the save games and achievements, or you can delete the entire profile and all associated data.


If you just received the Xbox and are deleting the accounts of users who wonâ€™t be using the machine anymore, delete all the data to make more room for your own.

 Some of the possibilities include:

, Most homes, in the traditional fashion, are insulated on the interior with fiberglass or wool. If you apply this concept to container homes, the end result may be corrosion or too much condensation on the inside of the walls due to too much water or vapors.
 Polyurethane foam works best in combination with ceramic insulation paint. The paint is obvious for the exterior of the shipping container, while the foam is for the interior.


The paint contains a special gas that contains inside bubbles, which gives it a high thermal efficiency. The spray-on foam is available in both “open-cell” and “closed-cell”. The difference is in the price tag, density, strength, R-factor and in waterproofing.

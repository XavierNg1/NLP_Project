 Carefully plan out where and what type of picture you are going to take. This will make the geotag process easier.;
, If you have a camera or cell phone that can geotag, use it, but if you don't, consider getting a cheap GPS. Take a picture of the GPS (showing your location) where you take your pictures and save it. Be sure to remember which picture of the GPS belongs to which series of pictures that you made.


Another way to do this is to write down the address where you took your pictures and look it up with Google maps. Don't forget to write down the latitude and the longitude .
 For an easy and free way to post your pictures online you can use Flickr. Get yourself an account and start uploading the pictures. Once you're done uploading start tagging your pictures with the right latitude and longitude. Flickr made an application so you can tag all your pictures at once. If preferred you can add the latitude and longitude tags from your photo edit software.
, Find yourself a program which you can view your pictures with like sites like Flickr,Picasa,locr or everytrail.

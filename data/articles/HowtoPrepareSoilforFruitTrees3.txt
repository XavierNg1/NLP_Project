 Acidic soil can take a long time to really balance out. This can be done by mixing limestone (or garden preparations with limestone in them) in with your soil. Add limestone in fall every year for a few years and you should notice an improvement.

Unfortunately, most of the eastern half of the US has acidic soil. This doesn’t necessarily mean your soil won’t support fruit trees, but it may benefit from amending it with limestone., Sometimes referred to as “alkaline soil,” soil like this is found in much of the central and southwestern US. Add in a soil conditioner to your dirt, like one containing sulfur or gypsum.

Soil conditioners are available at most hardware stores and home centers. Try Sphagnum peat moss as an organic alternative.
If you have access to compost materials, apply these regularly to decrease alkalinity. Be sure to take readings as you balance to make sure you don’t make the soil too acidic., It’s very easy to overload the root system of fruit trees. Their roots are sensitive to direct exposure to fertilizer. Never add fertilizer or manure directly to the hole in which you’ll be planting a fruit tree.Fertilize from the top of the soil after the first pruning of the season and as close before budding as possible.
If you tree starts budding sooner than expected, you can still fertilize up through June. Late summer and fall will put trees at risk of frost damage., Nitrogen will make your trees grow in a way that will require more pruning but will actually decrease fruit bearing wood. Each tree will have its own unique needs, but most fruit trees require high phosphorus, potash, and iron.

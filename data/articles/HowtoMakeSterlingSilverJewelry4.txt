 Serrated tongs will mark the silver, so precious metal jewelers use flat pliers only. You may find several sizes and shapes handy if you're making a lot of jewelry, including round nose pliers and wire cutting pliers.
 Silver is quite malleable, and thick silver wire is often shaped into necklaces or arm bands. Simple lay the wire on a small anvil or other flat, hard metal surface and tap repeatedly and gently with a mallet or hammer into the desired shape.To attach a pendant, wrap the wire around an object, or solder it to a pendant with a sterling silver attachment point.
 For precise control, you can use several hammers, most commonly a flat mallet and a round ball peen hammer, or a couple examples of each in different sizes.Once the shape is complete, you can use a texturing hammer to alter the surface feel, or a planishing hammer to smooth out the dents on a bent or curved surface.For the most predictable and controlled effect, let the hammer fall from directly above the silver, striking the surface at a 90º angle.
 This is not a common approach for silver, since it can be manipulated while cold. However, if you have some experience under your belt and want to experiment with tight, intricate curves, hot forging could be the next step. You'll need a small gas forge — or possibly an electric oven with excellent temperature control — able to heat the silver to a cherry-red glow and keep it stable at that temperature while you manipulate it with pliers and hammering.The correct temperature is typically around 1100ºF (600ºC), but this varies depending on the exact alloy of your sterling silver.

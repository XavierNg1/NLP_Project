 Create your text list, leaving room for your custom bullet.



Make it larger than you need, and scale it down so that it fits exactly. If you need to scale up the original bullet, it may look muddy or indistinct.
Move the bullet into place, and reduce it to fit.
Copy and paste the original for multiple bullets.
This method works best for more artistic bullet points, or if you need spacing that's difficult with text editors.

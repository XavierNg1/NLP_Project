 Unless you’re planning to breed your cat or dog (which there are many reasons to avoid), you should have them spayed or neutered as soon as possible. Local animal shelters will do this for free (or at a low cost), saving you from paying for a potentially expensive surgery at your local veterinary office.If you’ve adopted a pet from an animal shelter, the shelter can also offer low-cost vaccinations and health checkups.
 Vaccinations are a primary form of animal healthcare, and will prevent your pet from needing potentially expensive surgeries or other medical procedures in the future.All dogs must go through a series of mandatory vaccinations as a puppy. If you’ve adopted an older dog, make sure that it has medical records indicating that it received these vaccines.


Talk to your veterinarian and compile a customized list of vaccines that your pet will need. No individual dog needs every vaccine, and the location you live in often determines which specialized vaccines a pet needs.
Ask your vet which illnesses animals in your region most commonly contract, and ask about vaccinating against those.
 A healthy diet is a crucial step in keeping your pet healthy. This directly effects the frequency and degree of veterinary care the pet will need. A healthy diet will keep the animal’s digestive tract working smoothly and give them strength to fight off illnesses. Talk to your vet to find a healthy, high-quality pet food which suits your pet’s age and lifestyle.Avoid feeding your pets human foods, although animals may appear to enjoy eating them. High-quality pet foods will contain all of the nutrients that animals need, and not fill the foods with unhealthy additives.
For example, cats are carnivores and should not eat carbohydrates. Giving a cat a piece of bread will harm its digestive system, as will feeding it low-quality pet foods, which are often supplemented with carbs.

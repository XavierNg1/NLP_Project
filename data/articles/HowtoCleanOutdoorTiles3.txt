, Fill a 5-gallon (18.9-litre) bucket with water and a few squirts of mild dish soap or stone soap. Dip a mop into the soapy water and wring it out. Mop the tiles in small, overlapping circles to remove the dirt and prevent streaking.Choose a soapstone with a pH level of 7 or try to find a soapless cleanser since it won't leave streaks. If you're using dish soap, choose one that's phosphate-free and biodegradable.
 To remove algae or moss, clean the tiles with a bleach solution. If your solid stone tiles are near a pool, patio, or hot tub, wash them off with clean water. Pour 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of water into a bucket and stir in 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of bleach. Use a sponge or mop to wash the area with the mild bleach solution., If you're cleaning a large space, take a garden hose and rinse the tiles with clean water to remove any soap residue. If you're cleaning a small area, you can dip the mop in clean water and wring it out. Mop over the tiles so they're rinsed with the clean water. Wipe the tiles with a soft cloth until they're dry and let them air dry completely.You'll need to change the water several times and keep rinsing until the soap residue is completely removed.

 Riften is one of the major cities in the world of Skyrim that the Dragonborn (main character) needs to travel to. It is located in the southeastern region of the map and can be reached either by foot or by horse.;
, Here, you’ll find an Argonian (reptile) woman named Wujeeta.
 She will tell you that she’s sick. Simply give her some potion and force out some information from her about who’s selling the Skooma, either by Persuasion, Intimidation, or Bribery.


For reference purposes, Skooma is referred to as an illegal drug in Skyrim. The Skooma quest is part of the game’s storyline, tracing back from the very start of the game.
 After getting some information from Wujeeta, head to the keep inside the city and talk to the Jarl (named Laila Law-Giver) about the Skooma incident.


The Jarl will then tell you to kill the Skooma dealers (another quest).
 The Jarl will give you a key to a warehouse located outside Riften at the port. Enter the warehouse and eliminate the Skooma dealers.


The dealers are rather weak and can be easily defeated.
 Talk to her to complete the quest, and she’ll then ask you to help a couple more of Riften citizens. Go back out into the city and look for people to help.


You need to help at least 3–5 citizens with random quests that are rather trivial and very easy to complete.
 She’ll make you a Thane (a local hero) for assisting the people of Riften, but before she can do that, she’ll tell you that a Thane should be a resident of Riften. She’ll then tell you of a property that you can purchase.
 You can purchase the house for 8,000 gold from him.
 She’ll now make you a Thane and give you a Housecarl, a non-playable character that’s in charge of safekeeping a house.

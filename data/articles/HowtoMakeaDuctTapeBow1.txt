 Duct tape is available in all sorts of colors and patterns, so choose some pretty, brightly colored ones to make your bow with. A good idea is to pick one color for the main part of your bow and another, contrasting color for the centerpiece.;
, Use a pair of sharp scissors to do this. The six inch pieces will make a pretty large bow, so if you'd prefer a smaller one, cut out two 3 inch (7.6Â cm) pieces instead.
 Do this slowly and carefully to make sure the two pieces are exactly aligned. However, if you make a mistake, you can use your scissors to trim any extra bits off the edges. Try to make sure that there aren't any wrinkles and the bow will look better at the end!


At this point, you can feel free to decorate your strip of duct tape with any additional details, using markers or glitter pens.
 Fold the strip of duct tape three ways, going in opposite directions each time, as if you were making a fan.
 Pinch the middle of the folded duct tape between your fingers and wrap a thin strip (about 0.25 inches in width) of the other colored duct tape around the center, to secure. Make sure to keep your fingers out of the way or making a duct tape bow could turn into a sticky situation!

, Once you have made the bow, you can stick it to whatever you like. One easy idea is to stick a bobby pin through the back of the wrapped piece of tape. Now you have a beautiful, customized bow to wear whenever you want! Alternatively, you could try attaching the bow to a headband or pinning it to a schoolbag or handbag.

 Wash 1 pound (480 g) of mushrooms, 2 large carrots, 2 large celery stalks, and peel 1 onion. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the mushrooms into 1/2-inch (12 mm) pieces. You can trim the carrots, celery, onion and then chop them into bite-sized pieces.Don't worry about keeping the chopped vegetables separate. You'll be sauteing them together.;
, Put 1/4 cup (28 g) of butter into a Dutch oven or soup pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Rinse 1/2 cup (100 g) of pearl barley and add it to the pot along with all of the chopped vegetables. Saute the vegetables for about 20 minutes, so they start to turn golden brown.Remember to stir the mixture frequently to prevent it sticking to the pot.
 Add 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and stir the vegetables well, so they absorb the flour. Slowly whisk in 8 cups (1.89 liters) of vegetable broth. Whisking will prevent lumps from forming.You could also use chicken broth or stock.
 Keep cooking and stirring the soup, so it comes to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium and let it bubble gently. Simmer the soup with the lid off of the pot for about 40 minutes. Remember to stir it every once in a while.The barley should become tender and the soup will thicken a bit.
 Chop 1/4 cup (5 g) of fresh parsley and 1 tablespoon of fresh dill. Add the herbs to the soup along with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the soup with your favorite crusty bread.If you don't have fresh dill, you can use 1 teaspoon of dried dill weed.

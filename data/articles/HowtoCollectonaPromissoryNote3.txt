 You can hire a certified member of the Commercial Collection Agency Association. These agencies have extensive experience and adhere to state and federal collection laws.Also check whether anyone has complained to the Better Business Bureau about the collection agency.
 Collection agencies should be licensed by the state where they are collecting the debt. Ask for the license number and double check by calling the state’s licensing agency.States usually require that debt collectors be bonded and have insurance, so ask for proof of that as well., Generally, collection agencies charge contingency fees. This means they only get a fee if they collect money, and they take a percent off the top. Typically, an agency will take 15-20% of the amount collected.Get the fee agreement in writing.

For example, an agency with a 20% contingency fee keeps $2,000 of every $10,000 collected.
Because agencies work on contingency, some debts might be too small for them to take on. Call and check.
 The debtor might have skipped town after stopping payment on your debt. If so, the collection agency should tell you how they will find them. For example, they might employ skip tracing, which involves using special databases to track down the debtor., Make sure to get the agreement in writing. Don’t rely on oral agreements, and insist all key terms are included in the contract. If you have a dispute with the collection agency, then the terms of your contract control.
 You’ll speed up the collection efforts if you share helpful information, such as the following:The debtor’s name and address, including any aliases.
The debtor’s telephone number and email address.
Whether the debtor has responded to your efforts to collect on the debt.
A copy of the promissory note.

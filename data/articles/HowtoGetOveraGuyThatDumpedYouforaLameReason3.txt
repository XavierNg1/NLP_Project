 For some people it may work but for many, it is a minefield and if you harbor any feelings that he didn't really mean to break up with you and that his excuses can be proven wrong, then you are dallying with unreality. Guys rarely exit a relationship with the intention of being proven wrong; they've made up their mind already that it isn't working and they're moving on.
 When you see one another again, it's up to you whether or not to acknowledge him. The reality is that it pays to stay polite but distant. A simple "hello, how are you doing?" is fine. On the other hand, a "hey, do you miss me and wish I were back by your side and giving you my kisses?" won't do either of you any favors.


A simple smile or wave is sufficient if you can't muster any words. He doesn't need to know you're cut up in inside; that's what your friends are for.
 By then, hopefully you will have started to sort yourself out. If so, try talking to him in a friendly way––about anything except your former close relationship. Don't put too much pressure on him; just have quick chats and don't follow him around or be clingy. Give it a couple more weeks and you two may just develop a better platonic friendship.

 If you have a tapeworm infection, you may see the worms in the bathroom after a bowel action or on the inner part of your underwear. If you find tapeworms in either of these areas, contact a doctor right away.Tapeworms look like:


Small pieces of thread.
Whitish color.
 If you are concerned that you have tapeworms, look at your eyes and skin in the mirror. Tapeworms can cause you to have an iron deficiency because they feed on your blood, which in turn lowers your blood levels. When your blood levels get reduced, you make notice that your skin and coloring of your eyes has become paler.


Because tapeworms can lower your blood levels, you can also become anemic. Signs of anemia include an unusually rapid heartbeat, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and challenges with concentration., Tapeworms can obstruct the openings and tubes in your intestines, and in the intestinal wall. When your intestines become blocked, you can begin to feel abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.


The abdominal pain is normally felt just above the stomach.
 Tapeworms can make invade and inflame the lining of your small intestine, which in turn stimulates the intestineâ€™s lining to secrete fluid. When excess fluid is secreted, your body has a harder time absorbing the extra fluid, which can lead to you having diarrhea.
 This condition is very rare and generally only occurs in people who have been infected by fish tapeworms. Fish tapeworms consume so much vitamin B12 from your body that they can induce a condition known as megaloblastic anemia.The resulting low red blood cell count can cause:


Dizziness.
Memory loss.
Dementia.

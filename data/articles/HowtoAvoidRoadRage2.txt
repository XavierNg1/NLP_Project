 Although it can be difficult not to react when someone is shouting at you, the best thing to do is ignore it. Keep your eyes on the road, and try not to make eye contact with the enraged driver., If an angry driver yells at you or shares a rude gesture out his or her window, don't shout back at them. Continue to drive as safely as possible ignore the angry driver. Fighting and driving angry is dangerous to both of you as well as the other drivers and will only cause the situation to escalate.Roughly half of US drivers reported responding to an enraged driver by yelling back or making a rude gesture.
As many as 37% of road rage incidents involve a firearm. This alone is an excellent reason to avoid road rage escalation.
 If another driver cuts you off or honks at you, it's because they're experiencing their own road rage, not because they are angry at you. Don't let it ruin your commute. Taking offense at his or her action will only cause your own road rage to escalate.
 If you do become a victim of another driver's road rage and you feel threatened, take steps to keep yourself safe. Note the license plate number, make, and model of the vehicle in case the situation escalates and there is vehicle damage. If you're being followed, drive to the nearest police station and request assistance.

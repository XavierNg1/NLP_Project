 Wrapping a present often involves a box of some sort. Sometimes the best choice is to use a store-bought box for the task. However, there are some other ways to use a box that reduces paper consumption.


Do you really need a box? Can you wrap your gift in just paper, put it in an envelope, tie a ribbon around it, or some other creative wrapping?

, Ask stores and other businesses for clean extra boxes that they no longer need. Cover it with recycled paper to encourage it being kept for another purpose.
 While more fragile than a cardboard box and best for tiny gifts, a paper origami box can be a delightful presentation that shows your extra effort and care for the recipient.

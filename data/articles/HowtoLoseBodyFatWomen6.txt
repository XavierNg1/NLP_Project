 Few people have the willpower to be perfect for the weeks or months it takes to lose the needed weight. Therefore it is advisable that you build into your diet a "cheat meal" once a week.


A cheat meal does not mean that you get to eat an entire pizza and a carton of ice cream in one sitting. But it is an opportunity to eat something that is not on your diet. So have two slices of pizza and a reasonable bowl of ice cream.
Have your cheat meal guilt free, after all it is a planned part of your diet, then immediately get back on your diet for the next meal. A regular and reasonable cheat meal may even help boost your metabolism .
 Not enough sleep can hamper your weight loss efforts. Try to get 8 hours of sleep per night.
 Low-fat, non-fat, the grapefruit diet, the cabbage diet, the cleansing diet. Fad diets may help you lose a few quick pounds, but for serious weight loss and sustained weight loss don't look for the next fad. This plan instead focuses on simple sustainable changes: eating less than you burn, eating high quality nutrient dense foods with plenty of protein and healthy fats in your diet.
 Log your food intake throughout your diet. If you eat as prescribed and maintain your current activity level or more, you should be able to successfully lose fat.


Keep in mind that as you lose weight you may want to recalculate your macronutrient and caloric needs.
Do not be afraid of incorporating new meals into your diet, as long as you still follow you calories and macronutrient guidelines for the day.
If you are not losing weight on a 15-30% deficit, look to your food logging. Be careful to measure, or better yet weigh, everything and record the correct portion sizes when calculating calories and macronutrients consumed.

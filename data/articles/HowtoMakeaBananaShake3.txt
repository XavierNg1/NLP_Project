 Place the slides into a resealable bag and pop in the freezer to freeze. Allow to freeze for a few hours or overnight.
 Add the vanilla extract and some of the frozen banana slices. Blend them together.
 Blend until all have been added in. If you need more coconut milk, add extra. (Use extra coconut milk to swish out any leftover pieces of banana at the end.)

, Sprinkle nutmeg or cinnamon on top for added flavor.

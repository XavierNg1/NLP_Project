 Did a witness see what happened? Did the victim complain to someone of dizziness, a headache, nausea or numbness before collapsing?


If you are talking to family, or someone who knows the victim, try to get as much medical history as possible. Find out if the person is pregnant, has a pacemaker, etc.;
, If you start feeling unwell, have multiple unconscious victims, or bystanders start to feel unwell, consider an environmental toxin such as carbon monoxide.
, The condition listed could be considered a possible cause.
 Pay attention to the climate of a place. Is it extremely hot or cold where the victim is? Heat stroke or hypothermia could have made the victim pass out.


Finding empty, or partially empty, alcohol bottles, pill bottles or a needle can indicate a possible overdose. Seeing a ladder close to the victim or electrical tools can mean the victim might have fallen or been electrocuted.
 Strange smells can indicate toxins or a medical condition such as in diabetes.
 Look for lumps on the head, evidence of broken bones -- especially in the neck or back -- bleeding or fever. This could be a primary cause of unconsciousness or a secondary injury.
 This can include swelling, redness or lines around a wound.
 If the person is older, a heart attack or stroke may be the cause of the victim's collapse.

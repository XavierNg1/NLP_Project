"Is fearr an tsláinte ná na táinte". Health is better than wealth.
"Is ait an mac an saol". Life is a strange thing. Such is life.
"Aithníonn ciaróg ciaróg eile". One beetle recognises another. Birds of a feather flock together.
"Cuir síoda ar ghabhar agus is gabhar i gcónaí é". Dress a goat in silk and he'll still be a goat.
"Ní thagann ciall roimh aois". Sense doesn't come before age.
"Níl saoi gan locht na daoi gan tréith". There's no wise man without a fault nor fool without a talent.
Emigration: "Bíonn súil le mir ach ní bhíonn súil le tír". There's hope from the sea but there's no hope from the land (grave).
"Tír gan teanga, tír gan anam". A country without a language (tongue), a country without a soul. See who can spot this phrase first in the tourist shops or on bumper stickers!
"Trí ní is deacair a thuiscint: intealacht na mbean, obair na mbeach agus imeacht na taoide". The three hardest things to understand; a woman's mind, the work of the bees and the ways of the tide.

 Go to File >> New. Pick a good size for the image you have planned. This image is 768 * 472.


Note that all of the options you can see can be switched very easily. For example, you can switch 768 * 472 to 472 * 768 with the flick (or press) of a button.;
, This is the direction that your circle/ball will go.
 Go to Animation >> Create… Then select the number of frames. Unless you want to get fancy, 15 or 20 frames should be enough.
 To do that, go to Window >> Swap mixing panel.
 If you look at the Tool panel, the box on the very right should have a gold triangle at the corner, shown here.
 Right click on the brush icon and select a medium sized brush from Simple >> Medium.


If you have a 3 button mouse, pressing the center mouse button on your image will bring up the same options.
 At this scale, the circle is about 1.5 inches in diameter. It doesn’t have to be a circle. It can be anything you want, like a smiley face, but a circle is a really good subject for beginners.
 This copies your work from the main image buffer and then and moves it over to the swap buffer. They should look the same at this point.
 This advances the frame and you are now in frame 1.
 Be sure that it is smaller than the first one, as well. If you know your physics, you can even make it the appropriate shape; e.g. elongating in some places, flattening in others.
 The circle will be the smallest at the peak of the arch and then it gets larger again.
, Here, it is 17 which makes 18 frames (0-17).
 If you want to change the speed, press the FPS (Frames per Second) key and make any adjustments that you would like.
 Just give it a helpful name and save. It will save the files with the added numbers, such as this:_0000. So a New File would be ‘New File_0000’, ‘New File_0001’, etc.

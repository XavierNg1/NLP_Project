 Don’t dread if you dropped your phone in water. Though the situation may look pretty bad, it’s actually simple to fix. Get your phone out of the water as soon as you drop it to prevent any further damage.


If the phone switched itself off when you dropped it, do NOT attempt to switch it on. Doing so will risk your phone getting shorted out.
 Get at least 2 kilos, and place your dripping phone inside the bag.
 The uncooked rice will absorb all the moisture that got inside your phone, drying it up.
 After 3–5 days, switch on your phone and let it run for a few hours to heat its parts up before plugging it into a charger.

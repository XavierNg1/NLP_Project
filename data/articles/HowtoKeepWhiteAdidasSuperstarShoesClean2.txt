Drop the laces into the water and wash away the remaining soap. Rap a dry rag firmly around one lace. Pull the rag along the length of the lace to dry it and repeat the process to dry the other lace.You can also throw your laces in the washer. Be sure to put them in a pillow case first and wash them in a normal cold wash cycle.
Your old laces will start to unravel after a few washes so you should still buy new laces periodically. New laces can instantly make your shoes appear brighter.
You can also use an iron to dry your laces and straighten them.

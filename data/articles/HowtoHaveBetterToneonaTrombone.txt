 This is essential. The pitch you buzz with your lips must match the pitch selected by the slide position. Buzzing either too high or too low will result in a weak tone. This is true of all brass instruments, but it is particularly true for the trombone.


Practice buzzing with just the mouthpiece to train your lips (and your ears) to buzz on pitch.;
, Low range requires large volumes of air delivered at relatively low pressure. High range requires a small volume of air delivered at high pressure. Be sure to use the diaphragm to support the air flow. This is particularly important in the high range.
 This means you can play very low notes and very high notes, as well as everything in between.You can expand your range by simply playing as high as you can, and holding the note for a few seconds, and then repeating that a few times every time you play.


Your embouchure is vital to good tone. Embouchure is your mouth and what its doing. Make sure your cheeks aren't puffed out at all.
 You can play around with different sounds and what the do to your tone, but unless you're playing jazz, "o" is the one to go with.


And also, when you have perfected your piece/s and you play them in front of a crowd don't stop playing if you mess up ( you didn't go there to practice the people want to hear you play! ). If you used the tips here and the basics of playing the trombone, you should be fine.

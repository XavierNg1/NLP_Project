 Read a lot about the plants that interest you and about collecting plants in general. Read up on the experiences of other plant collectors to get ideas of what they did and any tips or tricks that they might have about collecting plants.;
, There are many plants in the world and it's likely that you have finite space, whether it be your indoor windowsill, balcony space, or a garden. Sticking to one species of plant makes good sense as you won't be able to cope with a collection that is too varied.
 It is best to get to know the needs of your plants well and to learn the ins and outs of cultivating and caring for them before branching out to rarer versions of the plants.
 Know what temperatures, light, water, etc., the plant(s) you've chosen prefers and find out how you can ensure these needs in your home environment. Think about whether you need to put in additional structures such as a shadehouse, a greenhouse, lighting, hydroponics, etc.
 It's important to only have as many plants as you have time to tend to them. If you have other interests, you will want to balance everything. It is also important to investigate what you might need to do when you're away from home, such as setting up timer systems to water your plants, or paying for someone to come around and care for them while you're away.
 Look for a club or a group that specialises in the plants that you're collecting. This is an opportunity to talk about the plants, trade specimens, and to help each other find the rarer ones.


Be aware that other collectors may draw your attention to new types of plants to collect and you could end up collecting several different species because they're all so attractive!

, This will introduce you to new ideas for display, to competitions, and to lots more information. It's also another excellent opportunity to meet other plant enthusiasts.

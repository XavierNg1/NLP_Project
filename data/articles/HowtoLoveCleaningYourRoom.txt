 It's time for a good cleaning, isn't it? The problem is, the mess has built up and it looks like an insurmountable task. However, think about how glad you will be once you have finally stopped procrastinating on it. It's one less thing to worry about, and you'll have a nice clean space to boot.
 When a small mess happens, clean it up. It makes the final task of giving your room a ceiling-to-floor cleaning much easier., Completely clean one portion of the room or one aspect, such as the closet or under the bed. Trying to get it all finished in one day will only frustrate you and make you more apt to stop cleaning all together., Tackle one thing at a time. This makes it a lot easier (and in turn, it makes it more fun). Pick up all trash first, so you won't have to work around it. Make three piles for all of the other things in your room - one for keeps, one for things that don't belong in your room, and one for give away (or to possibly sell if you think you could bring in a decent amount of money with it)., See how much cleaning you can get finished in a certain amount of time. Challenge yourself, and reward yourself when you complete certain tasks within a certain amount of time. A stopwatch or timer will come in handy for this., Cleaning is a lot more enjoyable, and seems to go by faster, if you have a little entertainment. Try to keep the music upbeat so you will be more revved up., Any movement, especially fervent cleaning, burns calories. Counting cleaning toward your calorie deficit is even more of a reward - you've not only cleaned your room, but you've done something good for your body!, You've worked hard and gotten your room nice and sparkling clean! Have a cookie, or have a nap on your nice, made bed. (Just remember to remake it when you wake up!) You deserve it!

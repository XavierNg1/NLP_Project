 Bird feeders obviously bring birds to your yard. In turn, neighborhood cats will show up for the free entertainment and food.If you want to discourage the neighborhood cats from coming around, it's a good idea to remove the feeders completely.
 While you might be tempted to feed or pet neighborhood cats, that's only going to keep them coming back for more. Try to ignore the cats as much as possible. It's a good idea to not pet neighborhood cats, anyway, as you can pass diseases to your own cat., You can take steps to deter cats from coming near your yard. For instance, some cats enjoy walking along the tops of fences, but they find it more difficult with a pointed fence. Another option is a motion detector that will spray water if an animal comes near. Since cats don't like water, it will often keep them away., One way to deter cats is to sprinkle lemon or orange peels around your garden, as they don't like the smell. Coffee grounds, pipe tobacco, vinegar, eucalyptus, lemongrass, and lavender will likely have a similar effect. Rue is also a deterrent, which you can add to your garden or just sprinkle around the yard.These deterrents will need to be renewed regularly, particularly after it rains. Also, renew them if you notice cats coming around. You may need to do it as often as twice a month. You just need enough to make a steady border around your yard.
You can also buy a cat repellent spray at places like feed stores.
 Often, outdoor cats are owned by someone in the neighborhood. The owners may not realize that their cat is causing problems elsewhere, as they aren't around to see it. Simply bringing it up with them may help them realize there's a problem. In turn, they may decide to keep the cat indoors more.You could say, "I don't want to cause issues between us, but I was wondering if you knew that your cat enjoys taunting the indoor cats in the neighborhood. For instance, he loves spraying on our porch, which drives our indoor cat crazy."

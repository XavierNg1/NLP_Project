 A bicep curl is the standard bicep workout done with hand weights. Doing an alternating curl means you switch back and forth between your arms so that you get an even workout.








Stand with your feet apart and flat on the ground. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and let each hand hang down at your side with your palms facing forward. As you curl up, your palms should be facing your shoulder.
Raise your right dumbbell so that it reaches shoulder height by curling your forearm up towards your chest. The underside of your forearm should face up towards the sky.
While lowering the right dumbbell, begin to lift the left one up in the same manner. Avoid jerking your body backwards to help you lift the dumbbells. If you are doing this, your dumbbells are too heavy.
 A hammer grab is another way to work out your biceps. This gets its name from the way you hold the dumbbell like the handle of a hammer.









Grab a dumbbell in each of your hands so that your palms face in towards your body. Hold your arms down by your sides.
Curl your arms and lift the dumbbells so that the tops of the dumbbells comes toward your shoulders. The inner side of your forearm should be facing to the side.
 Seated arm exercises can be great to do while watching TV. This is called an isolated exercise because it only works one of your muscle groups.









Sit on the edge of a chair or bench. Hold one dumbbell in your right and let your arm hang down so that your right elbow rests against the inside of your right thigh.
Raise the dumbbell until it almost reaches shoulder height. It should not actually reach your shoulder or else the bicep will disengage. Hold it there for a pause of 5 to 10 seconds and then slowly lower it back to towards the ground.
Repeat these steps with the other your other arm.

 Some of the best advice you can get about a safari company is from someone who has been on an African safari with them in the past. There are dozens of websites on the web that list safari trip reports and journals written by previous travelers. Learn from them. It is also a good idea to see their website as usually people have commented on them in the attached blog.;
, Once you have shortlisted safari operators you need to check them out to make sure they are reputable. Here are the associations you can check: KATO - Kenya Association of Tour Operators, TATO - Tanzania Association of Tour Operators, SATSA - Southern Africa Tourism Services Association, TASA - Tours and Safari Association of Namibia, ATA - Africa Travel Association, ATTA - African Travel and Tourism Association, ASTA - American Society of Travel Agents, IATAN - International Airlines Travel Agent Network and APTA - Association for the Promotion of Tourism to Africa.
 Find out how many other people will be on your trip. Being crammed into a minibus with twelve other people is not the best way of going on safari. Make sure what it's included and what's not. Try to see the car before booking.
 Some operators have a trust that they place your money into before your trip which should protect it if they go into liquidation in the meantime.

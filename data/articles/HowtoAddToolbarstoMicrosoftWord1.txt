 A list of available toolbars appears, with check marks in front of the toolbars currently displayed.


The default toolbars displayed when you install Word 2003 are the "Standard" toolbar, which includes buttons for frequently used commands, such as "Open," "Save," "Copy," and "Paste," and the "Formatting" toolbar, which features text formatting commands such as "Bold," "Italic," "Underline," and the ability to add bullets and numbering.
Word 2007 and 2010s "Quick Access" toolbar takes the place of the "Standard" toolbar in Word 2003, while the buttons from the Word 2003 Formatting toolbar appear in the "Font" and "Paragraph" sections of the "Home" menu ribbon in Word 2007 and 2010.;

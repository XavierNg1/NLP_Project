 If you want a thicker phone case, use two pieces of felt instead. They can be the same color or contrasting colors., Place your phone on top of the first piece of felt. Trace around it using a ½-inch (1-centimeter) border. Cut the felt out, then use it as a template for the other piece(s)., Make sure that all of the edges and corners are aligned. If you are making a lined case, with two different colors of felt, choose one color to be on the inside, and the other color to be on the outside., You only need to pin the bottom and two side edges; leave the top edge open. Try to pin the felt as tightly around your phone as you can. The fit will be snug at first, but it will eventually loosen up., Use the pins as a guide as you sew. Your seam allowance will vary, depending on the thickness of your phone. You can do this on a sewing machine or by hand.If you are doing this by hand, consider using embroidery floss in a contrasting color.
If you are doing this on a sewing machine, backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.
 Try to cut as close as you can to the stitching, about ⅛-inch (0.3 centimeters).For a more unique look, use pinking shears instead.

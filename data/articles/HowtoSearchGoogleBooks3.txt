 If a publisher has made a book available for preview on Google Books, the entire book will be displayed in a preview pane. A row of buttons will be available above the preview pane, and a search box will reside to the left of the pane.
 For example, if you want to see whether toy poodles are featured in a book about dogs, type "toy poodle" into the search field to determine whether the book contains information about that particular dog breed.
 The zoom in and zoom out buttons contain icons of magnifying glasses with the plus and minus symbols.
 You can view pages side by side similar to a physical book, or view multiple pages at the same time in a tile format. The page view buttons are located to the right of the zoom buttons above the preview pane.
 If a book is in print and available for purchase or download, a "Get Book" button will be located in the upper-left corner of the web page. You will then have the ability to choose from a list of sellers, and purchase the book.


Click on the "Find in a library" link to the left of the book to locate or reserve a copy at a local library. You will be redirected to the WorldCat website to complete the library reservation process.

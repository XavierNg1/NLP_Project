 You want this hole just deep enough to fit a tennis ball. No need to damage your yard unnecessarily.
 Sprinkle the ball of paper with a bit of water; no more than a quarter of a cup. You can rub some dirt onto the paper before you do this; the mud will dirty and smudge the sheet.
 Make sure the paper is completely covered. The dirt will damage and wear out the paper over time, so youâ€™ll need to ensure a snug fit.
 The amount of time you wait depends on how old you want the paper to look.

You want your cream to be thickened, but still pourable., Add half of the chocolate syrup to the mildly thickened cream. Then, use a spoon to stir the cream and chocolate together until everything is combined., Once your whipped cream and chocolate syrup is mixed together, transfer the mixture to a mug. Add the coffee, whiskey, and the rest of the chocolate syrup. Use a spoon to slowly mix the ingredients together until everything is mixed evenly.For best results, use hot, freshly brewed coffee.

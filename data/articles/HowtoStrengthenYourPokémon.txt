 It can be annoying with those desperate trainers wanting to battle, but it IS a good idea to battle as much as you can. Also, don't always take the shortcut around the tall grass. If you do, you might miss out on finding a rare or even shiny Pokémon!;
, With most Pokémon, you evolve them by getting them up to a certain level. Some need a special stone to evolve (example: Clefairy + Moon Stone = Clefable). Don't do this as soon as you get the stone! Let them get really strong THEN evolve them. Some Pokémon evolve under specific conditions (example: Pichu+Happiness=Pikachu). Some Pokémon just DON'T evolve.
 Rare Candies are good. Don't use too many, though. Rare Candies are sort of like drugs for Pokémon. There are also jars of medicine you can buy that boost a particular stat. These jars can also raise the base HP or PP of a single Pokémon (or one of their moves).
 Remember to save the game after each battle. Also stock up on medicines! If you lose to one of the Elite 4, you lose some of your money and you have to go through the entire Elite 4 again!

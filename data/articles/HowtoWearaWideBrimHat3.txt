 Take a measuring tape and wrap it around your head to determine its circumference. Place the measuring tape 1/8 inches (3.17 millimeters) above your ear and across your forehead. Make sure to pull the tape firmly to your head but not too tight.


If you don't have a tape measure, you can download and print a tape measure online.
You can also ask a professional hat maker or seller to measure your hat size for you., Take a look at a hat size chart and correspond the measurement of the circumference of your head with the chart. While many hat brands will be similar sizes, they may differ fractions of an inch which can make it harder to find a hat that fits. Many hats are also broken down to their metric measurement, typically ranging from 54 to 65.For instance, a 22 1/4 inch head circumference is a 7 1/8 sized hat in the US and a size 57 if you use metric measurements.For Stetson hats, a size 7 1/8 is a medium.
 When you finally decide on a hat, make sure that you try it on to ensure that it fits. The sweatband inside of the hat should fit comfortably around your head. The top crown of the hat should not touch the top of your head.If the hat is too big and you can't find a suitable size in the style you want, you can apply felt pads to the inside of your hat.

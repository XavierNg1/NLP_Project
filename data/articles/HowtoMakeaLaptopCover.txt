, Measure the dimensions of your laptop. Place your closed laptop on a flat surface. Measure the width, length and height. Add half and inch to each measurement and write it down.
 Fold the fabric over once and use chalk to make marks where to cut using your measurements (with a half inch added)and a ruler. Do the same with the felt. Make sure you have 2 pieces of fabric, and 2 pieces of felt.
 Cut along the markings on the felt and the fabric making sure that they are the same shape and size.
 Place one piece of fabric on top of a piece of felt and pin the sides. Sew by using either a sewing machine or a needle and thread. Sew all 4 sides and then remove the pins. Repeat with the other piece of felt and fabric.
,, Place the 2 "fabrics" together with the felt sides facing out. Sew three sides.
 Turn the final product inside out making sure the stitches are strong and there aren't any holes anywhere. The felt should be on the inside, and the fabric on the out.
 Now put your laptop inside and you have a cover for it!

 Heat 3 tablespoons (43 g) of butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add 2 thinly sliced shallots. Cook the shallots until they are soft., Once the shallots are cooked, sprinkle 3 tablespoons (45 g) of flour to make a roux. Use a whisk to keep the roux from getting clumpy. Whisk the roux for about a minute., As your roux sets, add 1 cup (237 mL) of dark beer to the mixture and continue to whisk until it is reduced completely. This will help deglaze your pan and add some flavor to your gravy. Be sure not to add too much beer and overwhelm the flavor of your gravy., After the beer reduces, pour in 2 cups (474 mL) of chicken stock and turn up the heat. Whisk the chicken stock and roux to work out any lumps. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the flour flavor has cooked out of your gravy., Remove your gravy from the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of honey and 1 tablespoon (16 g) of mustard seeds. Let the gravy cool for a few minutes before serving. You may also want to sprinkle in some salt and black pepper to taste.

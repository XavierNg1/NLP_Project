 If you need to edit your photo somehow, click on the edit button in the upper right hand corner.
 You can change the border color and width. You can add a frame, and you can add a filter.


Change the border. You can change the look of the page by altering the width and the color of the border. You want to be sure that you find something that complements your work. You are not limited to the 40 colors that are displayed. To select another color, simply click on 'More Colors'.






Decide whether or not to use a frame as well as a border. There are a lot of frames and effects to choose from, so look around. Simply click the "frame" button and a new window will appear with a drop down button containing the list of frames.






Use a filter. You can change the coloring of your photos or add a vignette affect. Those are always nice.

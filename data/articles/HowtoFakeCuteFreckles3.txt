 This will be used to make the freckles on your cheek.


To choose a color, compare to any naturally occurring freckles you have. If you don't have any freckles, look for moles or sun spots on your skin and choose a color similar to those.
Do not use liquid eyeliner-- the results will not look like freckles!

, The freckles will be one of the last steps in your make-up routine, so its important to get the rest of your make-up just right before proceeding with the freckles.


If you normally wear foundation, powder, or concealer, apply those now as you normally would. If you wear blush, you can choose whether to apply it before or after the freckles depending on how prominent you'd like the freckles to appear.
 This should be done in a very light handed, dabbing motion, mixing pressure while dabbing so that some freckles are darker than others.


You can use a tiny brush to apply the eyeliner, or you can use the pencil itself, as long as you do not press too hard or make the circles too big.
Don't try to make perfect circles; just make small, unevenly sized polka dots. Remember, freckles aren't big.
You can just make them on your cheeks, across the bridge of your nose, or both. Its a good idea to just do a few very light ones on your first try until you get the hang of the technique.
 Put a very small amount of it on your fingertips, and gently pat it onto the freckles you just made.


Continue patting the freckles with your fingertips until they have reached the shade you prefer. The more you pat, the more subtle they will ultimately appear.

 Once you’ve realized that something sticky has gotten onto your shirt, sweater, or any other piece of clothing, put it on a flat surface where you can work at removing the stain.


Do not wash your garment after you notice a stain. Washing the fabric sets in the stain and makes it harder to remove. If you've already washed the fabric before you noticed the sticky substance, removing the stain will take more work.;
, Work carefully, using an object with a flat edge, like as a table knife or an old credit card. Try to remove as much of the substance as you can. This will make the removal process much easier.


If you’ve already washed the fabric, you might not be able to scrape much off.
 To remove the stain, you’ll need to choose a removal product. You will also need a soft brush to massage the product into the stain. An old toothbrush works well, or even an old cotton washcloth. Once you’ve massaged the stain out you’ll need to wash the garment, so you’ll need laundry detergent.You can also use cotton balls to blot the stain if you do not have a soft brush.
 Before you start, you’ll want to test the removal product that you’ve chosen on a small area of the fabric. Choose an area that is inconspicuous and isn’t noticeable. This way, you’ll know if the product will stain your fabric. Some delicate fabrics, like satin or silk, are more likely to become stained than more durable fabrics, like cotton or polyester.If the removal product does happen to stain your garment, choose another removal product. Test this new product in another inconspicuous area to make sure it doesn’t stain.

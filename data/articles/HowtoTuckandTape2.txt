 There are different types of panties that work well for tucking, so you may have to experiment a bit to find the kind you prefer. Pick panties that are made of tightly woven Spandex or some kind of microfiber blend. Shaper briefs and boy shorts can be good choices, but if the fabric is firm, you can pull off a bikini bottom. Panties that tie at the side let you adjust tightness accordingly.


Stay away from cotton or silk; natural fibers are "slippery" and can cause things to move once you have them in place. Cotton also has a tendency to stretch over time.






Try a gaff. You can purchase panties made especially for tucking; they're available online and specialty stores. They may be a good choice if you're new to this process, but there others who will tell you they're a waste of money. To save on funds, make your own by cutting the legs off a pair of control top pantyhose.






For extra "hold," add a girdle or a pair of control-top panty hose over your panties.
 Take your penis and pull it back between your legs. Push your testicles back as well. Use the penis to lift and separate the testicles so that you have one on either side, and they're nestled between your thighs.


Do whatever you need to do to fight arousal. If your penis becomes erect, it will be impossible to tuck.
 Pull the panties up between your cheeks in the back until the tuck feels secure. Once in place, the panties will keep everything from moving.


There are differing opinions about how painful this process is. Some say there's no real pain as long as the tuck isn't too tight; others describe it as excruciating but say it gets less painful over time as the body adjust to the new arrangement.

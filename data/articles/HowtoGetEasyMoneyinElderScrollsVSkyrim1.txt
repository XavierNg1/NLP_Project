 It is by far the best way to make money in Skyrim. From level 1, start collecting Blue Mountain Flowers and Blue Butterfly Wings. Mixing these two ingredients makes a potion that sells for 80-250 gold depending on your alchemy and speech levels.

You can make well over 5,000 gold before even killing the first dragon.;

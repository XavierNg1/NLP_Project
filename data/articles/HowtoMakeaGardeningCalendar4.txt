 Write down the progress of plants. If you are using a gardening notebook, take photographs of your plants in different growth phases and add the photographs to your notebook.
 Recording the weather patterns will give you pertinent information to evaluate the success of your garden. For example, if you had a particularly hot or dry summer, you can re-evaluate your plantings for the following year and include drought-resistant plants that are more likely to thrive.
 Some gardeners use a separate gardening journal to record an analysis of their gardens. However, you also may use a gardening calendar to jot down thoughts. Record ideas for future gardens, what you enjoy about your current gardens, things you would do differently, and any challenges encountered during your gardening. By tracking the progress of your current garden, you will be able to better plan for future years.

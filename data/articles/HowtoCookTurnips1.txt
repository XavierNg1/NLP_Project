 Fresh turnips will feature a heavy skin, be firm to the touch, and have lush green tops. Avoid any turnips with brown spots or have unhealthy looking green tops, as these are sure indicators of older age. The older your turnip, the more bitter it will taste.;
,, This will remove any bacteria or dirt.
 Use a sharp knife to peel the tough skin away from the turnips. If the turnip is already peeling or the skin is cracked, then you will need to peel the older layers away to expose the newer, fresher surface underneath. This is similar to the method for peeling an onion.

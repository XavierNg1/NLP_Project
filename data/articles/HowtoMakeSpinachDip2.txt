 Mix together 1 cup of mayonnaise, 1 container of sour cream, 1 package of dry leek soup mix, 1 can of drained and chopped water chestnuts, and 1/2 (10 oz.) package of thawed and drained frozen chopped spinach., Stir the ingredients together until they're incorporated.
 Chill these ingredients together for 6 hours, or even overnight. This will thicken the mixture and combine the ingredients a bit more.
 Serve this rich spinach dip with a sliced loaf of round sourdough bread. You can dip the bread into the dip, or just spread the dip onto the bread.

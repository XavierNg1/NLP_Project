 Ghosting is when you exhale some of the smoke, then inhale the cloud back into your mouth.
 Open you mouth roughly halfway and slowly exhale the smoke from your mouth for a few seconds. Be gentle, keeping the smoke from getting too far from your face.


Think of letting the smoke escape, instead of forcing it out.
 Keep your lips together and lean forward, sucking up all the smoke like a vacuum or Ghostbuster., Let the smoke out of your mouth and then bring it back, but you can do it much faster with a snap inhale:


Curl your tongue up to the roof of your mouth with your lips still closed and mouth filled with smoke.
Snap your tongue down as your mouth opens to push the smoke out in a puff of air.
Suck back in the cloud of smoke like a normal ghost, but do it quickly, before it fades away.

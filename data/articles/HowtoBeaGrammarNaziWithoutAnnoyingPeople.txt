 A Grammar Nazi is an individual who believes proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation should be used at all times. Being a Grammar Nazi is not just on the Internet. Being a Grammar Nazi is also not all about grammar. Understand that being a Grammar Nazi takes a lot of work and comes with a great deal of responsibility.;
, Ask yourself a few questions. Do I know the difference between two, to, and too? Do I know the difference between your and you’re? Do I know the difference between there, their, and they’re? Am I ready for the responsibility of spell checking, proof reading, and correcting every single day of my Grammar Nazi career? If you answered every single question with a “Yes,” then you are ready!

, No one likes a mean Grammar Nazi. For example, instead of saying, “It’s too, not to, you ignorant child”, try saying, “Too. Ha ha! Everyone makes mistakes. It’s okay.”

, Do not miss a mistake. Ever.
 It annoys them the most.
 It is rude, especially if it is your parents. If it’s your English teacher, he or she will probably not mind.
 In the middle of a casual conversation is the right time. In the middle of a class discussion is not.

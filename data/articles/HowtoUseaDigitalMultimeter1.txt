 Insert the black probe into the common terminal and the red probe into the terminal marked for measuring volts and ohms. The terminal may also be marked for testing diodes.;
, This may be represented by the Greek letter Omega, which stands for ohms, the unit of measurement for resistance.
, If you leave the resistor in the circuit you may not get an accurate reading.

 To do so, open a YouTube video you wish to embed, click the URL to select it, right-click (or use two fingers to click) the selected URL, and then click Copy.


You must do this on a computer since mobile links won't invoke the video player box in Outlook.
You cannot use a video from your computer to trigger the video player box on Outlook.
 To do so, enter https://www.outlook.com/ into your browser's URL box. If you're logged into Outlook on this computer, doing so will open your Outlook inbox.


If you aren't logged in, enter your Outlook email address (or phone number) and password before continuing.
 It's in the upper-left side of the Outlook page, just above your inbox's contents. This will open a new email window on the right side of the page.
 You'll do so in the "To" field at the top of the email template. Your recipient must have a Gmail address.
 To do this, simply right-click (or use two fingers to click) the email template's body, then click Paste in the resulting drop-down menu.
 It's in the bottom-left corner of the email window. Doing so will send the email to your recipient. When they open it, they'll be able to click the video box at the bottom of the email to open the video player.

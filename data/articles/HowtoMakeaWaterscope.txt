 A large juice bottle or milk jug works perfectly, and if the container has a handle (as most gallon and half-gallon milk jugs do), all the better.;
, Put a little warm, soapy water in the container, put the cap on, and shake it for a few seconds. Then rinse the container out.
 Use scissors or a sharp knife to remove the bottom of the container about an inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom. You may also want to cut the top off just below the bottle's neck - you'll have a bigger hole to look through if you do. If the container has a handle, make sure to leave the handle on the container intact, so that you can use it to hold your Waterscope.
 Make sure the piece of plastic is big enough to completely cover the bottom of the container, as you want it to seal the bottom and to stretch almost all the way up the sides of the container. Pull the plastic tight, and make sure there are no wrinkles or folds in the viewing area (the base of the container).
 Use duct tape to attach the plastic wrap to the sides of the container. Place the tape to be fairly high on the container, because you'll be dipping the bottom into the water. You may also find that a rubber band or two, stretched over the plastic wrap around the whole container, will hold the wrap in place.
 Wade into a lake or creek, and dip the bottom of the container into the water while holding the container straight upright. Look through the hole at the top. As long as no water enters the container, you should be able to clearly see underwater.

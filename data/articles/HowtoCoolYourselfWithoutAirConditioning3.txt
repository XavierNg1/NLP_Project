 Avoid going out between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., when the sun's rays are hottest. You can also avoid a sunburn this way. Instead, exercise or run errands early in the morning or late in the evening. The early morning and evening are usually cool enough to enjoy your walk, run, hike, bike, gardening, or yard work., Wear loosely-woven natural fabrics (cotton, silk, linen) rather than polyester, rayon, or other artificial fibers (with the possible exception of performance fabrics).Choose light colored clothing. Darker colors will absorb the sun's heat and stay warmer longer than light or white clothing, which reflects light and heat.
 Take off those shoes and socks, especially on extremely humid days. Wearing shoes and socks will make your feet sweat, and raise your overall body temperature. Go barefoot as often as you can.
 Grab some popsicles from the grocery store, or freeze a bag of chopped fruit such as watermelon, pineapple, or lemons. Cooling down can be a tasty experience too!

, Mint refreshes the skin and leaves a nice cooling sensation. Try a few minty or menthol products to cool your skin. Slather on lotion with peppermint (avoid your face and eyes), shower with peppermint soap, use a minty foot soak or other powders with mint. There are even a few minty recipes you could try, for example:


Watermelon Yogurt Mint Smoothie
Irish Cream Mint Chocolate Drink
Mint Truffles

, Smooth sheets help you stay cool, so opting for silk or satin can make you more comfortable. Crisp cotton sheets are better than flannel, which should be stored during summer months. Silk, satin, and cotton will feel smoother and cooler as you sleep.

 Before you breed dogs, you should understand what crossbreeding is. Purebred dogs have only been bred with other dogs of the same breed. There is no other breed in their bloodlines. Purebred dogs can be registered with kennel clubs.Crossbreeding is when two dogs of different pedigree breeds mate and produce offspring. This produces a crossbreed dog with the DNA of two different breeds. Some people call crossbreeds “hybrids” while others call them “designer dogs.” Dogs such as Labradoodles, Goldendoodles, and Puggles have been crossbred.
 When two dogs of different breeds mate, they mix the blood lines, eliminating the purebred status for the litter. Since many people are adamant about purebred dogs, and only purebred dogs can be registered with kennel clubs, many people work hard to make sure crossbreeding doesn’t occur.Crossbreeding changes the look of the dogs. If two purebred dogs of different breeds mate, the puppies will have a combined look of both breeds, changing the appearance.
Some crossbreeding combinations can cause problems when the mother dog gives birth. If a small female gets pregnant by a large male, she could give birth to puppies too big for her, which could cause problems.
 Some breed experts believe that crossbreeding should occur instead of pure breeding. Crossbred dogs usually have mild temperaments, unlike the fussy temperaments of purebred dogs. They also have a unique appearance due to the two breeds of their genetic makeup.Crossbred dogs also are generally healthier than purebred dogs. Because purebred dogs pass down sets of defective genes from both the mother and father, they are more likely to develop health problems. Crossbred dogs only get one set of those genes, making the health problems less likely.
 Responsible breeding occurs when you have experience with dogs of a particular breed. This can take years. If you train dogs or take them to competitions, you probably are experienced enough to breed dogs. If you want to breed dogs to make money, you should reconsider. This is not a good reason to breed dogs.


Make sure you have a good reason for breeding, like continuing the line of an exceptional show dog that aligns with the breed standards. Many people who breed for profit lower the quality of the breed. This also leads to more dogs in shelters and contributes to the overpopulation of dogs.

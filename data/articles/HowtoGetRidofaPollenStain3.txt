 This method is best if the stained garment is dry-clean only or the stain is on carpet, upholstery, or other surface that cannot be soaked. The kit should come with a reusable bag, cleaning cloths, and stain remover., Use a small amount of dry cleaning stain remover and a clean cloth to gently blot the stain; continue to blot without adding more solution until the stain is dry. If the stain remains, repeat with more stain remover and another clean cloth., Generally, you will place the garment in the provided bag along with a pre-moistened cleaning cloth and dry on a medium setting for about 30 minutes.

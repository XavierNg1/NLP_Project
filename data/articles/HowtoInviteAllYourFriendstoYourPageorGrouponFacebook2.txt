 In order to invite your friends to your Group or Page, you'll have to open the pertinent page itself on Facebook. To access Facebook, click the link provided.


For mobile, tap the Facebook app.
 You'll need to add your Facebook-registered email address or phone number, then your password.


Click or tap "Log In" when you're done.
 This should be in the top right corner of your Facebook newsfeed; "Your Pages" serves as a list of your currently-managed Pages and Groups.


On mobile, tap the three horizontal lines in the bottom right corner of your screen. Your Pages will be listed at the top of this menu.
 This will prompt a drop-down menu with a list of your Pages and Groups.


You can also click the downward-facing arrow next to the lock icon in the top right corner of your screen to view your Pages; you'll have to click "New Groups" in this menu to view your Groups.
Alternatively, if you know the name of your Page or Group, you can type its name into the search bar at the top of Facebook's page. It should pop up at the top.
 This should be listed directly underneath the "Your Pages" heading; you may have to click the heading to prompt a drop-down menu with your Pages first.


For mobile, tap the Page you wish to view at the top of the menu. To view a Group, tap the "Groups" tab in the middle of the menu page, then tap the corresponding Group name.
 You are now ready to add friends to your Group/Page!

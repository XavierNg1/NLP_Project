 Cover the top of the candlestick with hot glue, then quickly press the Styrofoam ball into the glue. You can use any size Styrofoam ball you want, but something around 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) would be ideal.Keep the ball proportionate to the candle stick. The smaller the ball, the shorter the candle stick should be.;
, Leave a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) long stem on each rose.If possible, use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Many silk flowers have wire inside the stem, which can ruin a good pair of scissors. If you cannot find wire cutters, use a pair of sturdy scissors you don't mind possibly ruining.
 If the rose is very loose, pull it out, add a drop of glue into the hole, then push the rose back in.You want the base of the rose touching the Styrofoam ball.


You can use tacky glue or hot glue.
 Make sure that all of the roses are touching one another, including the one in the center. Once again, if any of the roses feel loose, secure them with a drop of hot glue.
 When you are done, the entire ball should be covered in roses. Make sure that there are no gaps or bits of Styrofoam showing.
 Tie the ends of the ribbon into a large bow. For that final touch, snip the ends of the ribbon at an angle. A satin ribbon would work the best, but you can also use a sheer ribbon as well. It can match the color of your rose ball, or it can be an accent color instead, such as silver or gold.

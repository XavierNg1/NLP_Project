 Ask for a tour of the facility. They will be happy to show you around as they understand that without surveying the facilities you will not be able to make a decision. Set a date and time.
 You want to make a good impression. Some things to watch for:


Is the barn clean and tidy? The muck heap and dirty bedding should be kept in a pile away from the barn. There should be no broken glass or other dangerous items around.
Is everything in good repair? For example, does the barn seem run down or in danger of falling apart? Are any of the fences broken?
Are the stalls relatively clean? Horses should not be standing in puddles of their own urine, and stalls should be mucked out once daily.
Is the riding arena cramped or obviously too small for the size of the lesson?
For any individual activities you may pursue, are there facilities to encourage this? For example, is there a jumping arena, or a place to go trail riding?
Do the horses seem happy and healthy?
Is the owner and staff open and friendly?

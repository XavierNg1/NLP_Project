 Make sure you have a doll, baby shampoo, and a towel.;
,, If your dolls hair is curly, separate curls with your fingers. If it is straight, just brush out the tangles.
 So you don't get the scalp of the doll's hair wet, put her hair into a ponytail. Turn the water on to a lukewarm temperature and check to make sure it feels okay on your skin.
 With the water, rinse your dolls hair without any soaps or chemicals. This is so you can see how the water looks and gauge how much shampoo to use.
 Use about a dime-sized amount of baby shampoo in your dolls hair. Rub so you create a soft lather on your dolls hair.
 Rinse the suds out of your dolls hair. Make sure all the soap is out before you follow with the next step.
 Using a rag or small towel, gently wring out your dolls clean hair. Wait one hour before styling the doll's hair so you can be sure it is dry.

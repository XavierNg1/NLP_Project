 Look at the face of your car’s head unit and check if there’s a USB port, similar to what you have on your computer. Some modern car stereos have built-in USB ports to allow playing music from flash drives.


Check your car’s stereo manual and see if it supports iPhone connectivity. iPhone connectivity lets you hook up your iPhone directly to your car stereo using its data or lightning cable. Not all car radios that have USB ports support iPhone connectivity, so make sure to check your head unit’s manual first.
Newer cars may have an infotainment center that supports CarPlay, which is a more advanced way to connect your iPhone to your car using a Lightning USB cable.
 Plug one end of your iPhone’s data or lightning cable to the port at the bottom of your iPhone. Take the other end of the cable and plug it to the USB port on the car stereo.
 Press the menu button on your car stereo and set it to USB or iPhone mode. This will allow your car stereo to receive any information coming from your iPhone. Most car stereos will automatically change to iPhone or USB mode the moment you connect your iPhone to it.


If your infotainment center supports CarPlay, tap or select the CarPlay option that appears on the menu after connecting your iPhone.
Check your car stereo’s manual if you do not know how to set your specific car stereo to USB or iPhone mode.
 Open your iPhone’s music app to start playing your music on your car’s entertainment system. If you place or receive a call, your car speakers will act as your iPhone speaker and hear the voice of the person you’re talking to., See Use Apple CarPlay for more details.

 Start by doing some research. Find out how to get the best deal on each item, and keep track of the information in a spreadsheet or notebook.


Consider shopping at more than one place. Rather than picking everything up at the same grocery store, try to coupons or hit sales at more than one place.
Eat seasonally. When it's harvest time for a certain food, the prices drop significantly. Pay attention to when the foods on your list are in season. You'll not only save money, but you'll be eating food that's very fresh.
Farmer's markets are full of fresh, often organic produce at very low prices. Find local farmers' markets and strike bargains with the farmers. Many times, they'll be thrilled to sell at a discount if you buy regularly and in bulk.
 It's time to put your budget into practice. As you check items off your grocery list, keep these money-saving tips in mind:


Buy the least expensive variation of any type of food. Some foods come in pre-seasoned frozen packages, in cans, and dried in bags. Figure out which forms of the foods on your list are the cheapest, and buy those.
Give yourself plenty of time to shop. If you go when you're in a hurry, you're more likely grab the most convenient items instead of taking the time to figure out which items are the best bargain.
 You may get to the market and find that strawberries have jumped in price, but blueberries are on sale. Remember that your list is just a basic guide, and you don't have to come home with the exact items you had in mind.

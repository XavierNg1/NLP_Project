 An open fracture has a high rate of infection and the possibility of other serious bodily trauma. The quicker you get medical care, the less chance of the wound becoming infected.Call 911 or assign a specific person to make the call while you begin treatment.;
, If you didn’t see the accident happen, you’ll want to get a quick history from the person as soon as possible. Do this while you’re gathering what you need to treat the wound and calling emergency services. Depending upon how much blood is lost, or if the person becomes unconscious, you may be the one telling emergency personnel how the accident happened. Emergency personnel will want to know:


How the bone was broken: from a fall, car accident, blow, during a sporting event?
What the wound looked like immediately after the accident and if it continued to get larger?
How much blood was lost?
If the person required treatment for shock?

, This does not mean you should touch the wound; just look at it. If the open wound is caused by a penetrating foreign object or if the wound is caused by the sharp edges of bone opening the skin, the treatment can be different. Severity of the wound is variable. There may only be a small opening in the skin without visible bone or the wound may contain an area of bone that is quite large.


Bone is off-white in color and not necessarily the stark white color found in skeleton models. It is ivory in color, like an elephant's tusk or a tooth.
 A penetrating wound may have pierced an artery. If you remove the object, the artery may begin to bleed profusely and the person may quickly bleed out and die. Instead, treat the area with the foreign object in place, taking care not to touch or move the object., Because of the amount of force needed for an open fracture, there is a 40 to 70% chance of other serious trauma to the body which may be life-threatening. This could include profuse bleeding from the wound.

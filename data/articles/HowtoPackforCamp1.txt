 Don’t choose a camp based on something you don’t enjoy like computer programming, if you don’t like it. Research different camps based on your interests. There are so many different camps today that vary in a wide array of specialties.


A popular camp for young kids is rock camp. This teaches younger children about the history of rock and the rudiments of a rock instrument.;
, Your personal items are items or clothing you own that you cannot live without. This doesn’t include forms of electronics. For most camps these days, one aim is to remove yourself from electronics. Personal items are small knick-knacks that hold sentimental value to you like a doll, photograph, or charm.
 Depending on the duration of your camp, you’ll need a variety of clothing options. You should try to stay on the light side of packing. Consider the following for a one week camp, and double the amount for a two week camp:


6 short sleeve shirts
1 long sleeve shirt
4 pairs of shorts
1 swim suit
1 light jacket/sweatshirt
6 pairs of underwear
6 pairs of socks
1 baseball cap
1 pair of sneakers
1 pair of sandals, It might be more enjoyable if you bring some additional supplies like a day pack. Instead of bringing electronics for entertainment bring books or comic books. It could also be useful to bring a journal and a pen.
 All camps offer different services. Look into what your camp recommends you bring. These are to be taken seriously and can be adapted depending on the person. After registering for the camp, you should receive a packet of information either in the mail or through email.
 Depending on what camp you’ve chosen, you may be required to bring specific supplies. Check the checklist and information provided by each camp. Camps want you to be prepared and will give you the information of what you should expect well before the camp starts.

, Folding the right side first is the usual method for brochures. Then fold the 1/3 side halfway of your left-over space. Fold the paper in such a way that you donâ€™t crease over it as shown on the illustration.
 Make sure that each side is folded equally and if not adjust your folds accordingly.
 If you think the sides you have folded are equally balanced and even the spaces on the paper resulting from the fold are equal then press the folded paper. Press the paper with your fingers starting from the top of the paper all the way down.
 However this time press the bottom part of the paper toward its upper part.
 Apply this technique to your brochures, invitations and fliers.

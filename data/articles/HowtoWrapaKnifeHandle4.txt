 Make a loop at the end of your cord or leather strip and place it on the thin edge of the knife handle. The top of the loop should stop right at the bottom of the blade, and the bottom ends of the loop should run the entire length of the handle. Use your fingers to hold the loop in place., Use the piece of rope with excess and wrap it around the handle first, then as you come up, wrap it around the loop you just created. The rope will then go back around the handle in the opposite direction that you were wrapping it before., Continue to wrap the cord around the front side of the handle and then around the loop on the backside of the knife. This will create a wrapped braid down the side of your knife., When you finally reach the blade of the knife, you'll want to feed the remaining excess rope through, not around, the original loop, that you held in place with your fingers., Pulling the excess of rope at the bottom of your handle will tighten the wrap. Do this before you seal the excess at the top to make sure that the wrap is tight. Cut off the excess rope or leather strip at the top of your handle and use a lighter to burn the end of the rope., To quick release the cord from your knife, all you need to do is pull the cord out of the top loop and pull on the excess rope at the bottom of your knife handle. This will quickly undo the cord if you need to use it for something.

 In most states there is a method by which former members of the military, who are not retired or in some other way in possession of a traditional military ID, can prove their former service.


In some states the local circuit court clerk may serve as an alternate location.
 Each state differs, but all states offer some way to identify those who have served honorably. There are essentially three variations offered: A stamp or designation may be placed on the normal driver’s license. This is typically displayed as a red “V” or with the word “Veteran” somewhere on the card.
In some states, a special driver’s license for veterans is available. The license is slightly different from typical licenses depending on the state.
Those states without driver’s license modifications provide a unique veteran’s ID card. This card is one specifically designed to identify you as a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, and is supplementary to your driver’s license., In most states, proving your service is done by presenting your DD FORM 214 (DD214), the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, which is probably the most coveted and popular form for former service members. In absence of the DD214 there are three possible alternatives:


Presenting the DD FORM 215, which is the Correction to DD FORM 214, has enough information to show your honorable discharge from service.
Showing an active duty CAC can obviously be used to display your current service.
Displaying your retiree military ID card can be used to get whatever designation your state offers.
 Depending on state, this process could require a minimal waiting period and a small fee. Additionally, the waiting period may be extended if your state requires the VA to vet the veracity of your documentation.

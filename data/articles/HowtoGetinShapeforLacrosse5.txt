 Reaction speed and jumps are crucial for this position. To work on your jump, do jumping rope. Believe me, this works. You need to step to the ball in order to increase the percentage of saving it. Jump rope gives you flexibility. Reaction speed is essential also. If you have a sibling, make them throw lacrosse balls at you from 2 feet (0.6Â m) away. At first, catch the ball with your top hand(left hand if lefty, right hand if righty). After a while, use your stick. You will need to get used to the weight of your stick while moving it especially to your off side.

 You can typically refuse to do business with anyone for a non-discriminatory reason. This includes refusing to do business with someone who hasn’t paid you.


A firm “I’m sorry, I can’t help you” will usually suffice.;
, Some professionals, however, owe an obligation to current clients to continue to represent them until they make other plans. This obligation can be created by law as well as by your code of professional ethics.


For example, a doctor who refuses care might be charged with abandonment if they don’t end the relationship properly. Generally, doctors can terminate the relationship but only if they give the patient sufficient time to find other help.Attorneys must also follow certain procedures to end their attorney-client relationships. In some situations, you will need a judge’s permission to withdraw form an existing case.
 You might not understand your obligations. In this situation, you should meet with an attorney. Only an attorney can analyze your business’s situation and provide you with accurate advice.


You can find an attorney by contacting your local bar association and asking for a referral.Also think about hiring an attorney “on retainer.” This means that you pay a monthly fee and, in return, the attorney is always available to answer your questions.

, This will be located in the "System" section, beneath the Windows edition.
 Your processor model and speed will be displayed. The speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz). This is the speed of a single core of your processor. If your processor has multiple cores (most modern processors do), each core will be this speed.


If your processor is overclocked, the actual speed may not be shown here. See the next section for details on finding your actual overclocked speed.
 If you have a multi-core processor, the number of cores will not be displayed in this window. Multiple cores does not necessarily mean the programs will run faster, but it can be a big boost for programs designed for it.


Press ⊞ Win+R to open the Run dialog box.
Type dxdiag and press ↵ Enter. Click Yes if prompted to check your drivers.
Find the "Processor" entry in the System tab. If your computer has multiple cores, you'll see the number in parentheses after the speed (e.g. 4 CPUs). This will let you know how many cores you have. Each core runs at approximately the same speed (there will always be very minor variations).

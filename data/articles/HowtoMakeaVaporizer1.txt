 For this vaporizer, you will need a clear light bulb (100 watts is best, and don't use one that is painted white inside), a sharp knife, pliers, glass straws or tubes, tape, scissors, and the cap from a 500ml bottle.;
, Take your knife to cut off the metal tip of the light bulb where you would typically screw it into the socket. Try to cut it smoothly to avoid rough edges.
 Use the pliers to pull the filament out of the bulb. The filament is the metal wire that lights up the bulb when turned on. When you finish this, you should be left with an empty bulb.
 Put the plastic bottle cap over the end of the bulb. If it is too big, use a little tape on the inside to create a padding so it fits snuggly.
 You will insert two straws or glass tubes into these holes, so measure to size. Use your knife to cut the holes into the cap. If you have one, you can also use a drill to quickly create the holes.
 Place the straws/tubes into the cap and return the cap to the space over the metal in the light bulb. Once you are sure it all fits, you can remove the cap to add your preferred substance to the inside of the light bulb. Place a flame under the base of the bulb to create the vapor which can be inhaled through the straws.

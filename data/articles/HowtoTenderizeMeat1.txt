 If you want, you can lay a piece of wax paper under and on top of the meat to reduce the mess made by this method. Note: you should not put wax paper on top of the meat if you are planning on using a knife.


Keep in mind that using metal tools to tenderize your meat will break up both the meatâ€™s connective tissue and the meat fibers themselves.;
, There are two options that will work the best during mechanical tenderisation. Either you can use an actual meat tenderizer (which looks like a Medieval torture device) or a knife. The choice is yours.
 Tenderizing meat essentially means that you are pre-chewing the meat with a tool to make it thinner and more tender.








If you are using a meat tenderizer, hold it in your hand and bang on the meat like you would with a hammer and nail. Hit the meat evenly over the whole surface, flip it over, and continue to hit the meat with the mallet.
If you are using a knife, make cuts or scores that go across the muscles fibers. Your cuts should be long and thin but necessarily very deep.

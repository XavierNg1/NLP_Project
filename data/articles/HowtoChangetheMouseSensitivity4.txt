 The new DPI (e.g., 800, 1200, etc) will appear either on the monitor or on the LCD screen of your mouse.To decrease the DPI, keep pressing the button until the DPI number cycles back around from the smallest possible number (e.g., 400 DPI).
There is no “recommended” DPI, as it is a matter of preference. Start by setting it close to the vertical resolution of your monitor.For example, if your monitor is 1920 x 1080, try setting the DPI as close as you can get it to 1080. If you want it faster or more precise, increase it from there.
 If you bought a mouse labeled “gaming” or “precision,” it likely came with its own software that provides the option to change the DPI (sensitivity) settings. You will be able to change the DPI in the software.


You can download the software for most mice from the mouse manufacturer’s website. Visit the website (e.g., www.logitech.com) and navigate to the product page for your specific model. Follow the download link for your operating system.
If there is no software available for your mouse, use Changing Pointer Speed in Windows or Changing Pointer Speed on a Mac. You won’t be able to change the DPI, but you can increase and decrease the pointer speed.
 This varies depending on your model and manufacturer.
 Depending on your mouse, you may see a dropdown menu containing DPI values (e.g., 800, 1600, etc) or a slider. Increasing the DPI value from the default increases the speed of the pointer, and decreasing enhances precision.


There is no “ideal DPI” as it is a matter of preference. Start by setting it close to the vertical resolution of your monitor.If your monitor is 1920 x 1080, for example, try setting the DPI at 1200 (or as close as you can get to 1080).
 Open the game or application you use most and make sure the mouse controls are to your liking. You can return to the mouse software to change your settings at any point.

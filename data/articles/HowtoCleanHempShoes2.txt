 Specially formulated cloth shoe cleaners, like Lincoln E-Z cleaner, are designed to remove dirtiness from your shoes without damaging them. Purchase products like these at your local shoe store or in the shoe section of a general retailer.


The directions for your shoe cleaning product may vary depending on its brand. Always follow the label directions for best results.
In most cases, specialty cleaners are applied in the same way as soapy water: completely wet the shoe, apply soap to it in sections, brush stains lightly, and rinse the hemp thoroughly when the entire shoe is clean., To improve the stain fighting power of your washing machine, pre-treat stains with a mild soap and water or a suitable specially formulated cloth shoe cleaner. Use a dampened cloth to gently blot cleaner onto stains until they are saturated., To protect your shoes from damage, you may want to put them in a laundry bag before machine washing. Set the machine to a gentle, cold cycle for dyed hemp. Add a cup (237 ml) of white vinegar to the rinse cycle to freshen the shoes and neutralize any remaining soap.


Non-dyed hemp may be machine washed on a warm cycle. However, as hemp is somewhat sensitive to heat, you should only do this occasionally or for severe dirtiness.
Machine washing can be harsh on hemp shoes. Shoes that are delicate may be damaged by this cleaning technique. Preserve your shoes by only machine washing them infrequently.

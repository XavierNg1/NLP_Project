 While you can wear just about anything you want for such a casual game you might want something more athletic. You might consider wearing shorts, or sweat pants. These are going to be more flexible than other forms of outwear for your legs. A t-shirt will be more likely to flex with your movements as you play the game.Whatever you choose to wear you should expect it to get dirty if you fall.
 Consider where you will be playing tug of war before you pick your shoes. If you are paying a game of tug of war indoors, then a regular pair of sneaker should be fine. If playing outside, you may want to choose a pair of sneakers with rubber cleats or even go for a pair of boots if the terrain is muddy.Avoid metal cleats, steel toes, and shoes that have metal anywhere else on the sole. These types of shoes pose a hazard to your fellow players.
 This is optional, but it is a good idea. You should consider wearing head gear, knee pads, and elbow pads. These are the areas you are most likely to fall on and injure during a tug of war contest.While most casual games of tug of war donâ€™t require any padding you can still opt to put on protection to reduce the chance for injury. You can find rubber and plastic padding in any sport shop and many department stores.

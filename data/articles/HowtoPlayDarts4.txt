 The object of the game is to "close out" numbers 15-20 each three times; or to hit a double of one number and a single of the same number; or to hit a triple.
 In order, list the numbers 15 through 20 so that you can check off when a player has hit all three, or closed out a number.
 For example, you've closed out 16 but your opponent hasn't; you hit the 16, which means you get 16 points.
 It's not just who finishes first â€” it's who closes out with the most points.


The green bull is worth 25 points and the red bull is worth 50.

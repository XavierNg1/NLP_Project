 If you have a large litter of puppies, you should weigh each puppy daily. This will help you track their weight gain and make sure that each pup is getting its dietary needs met. This will also help you highlight which puppies are nipple guarding and which puppies are malnourished.For the best results, use an electronic scale designed for weighing small animals.;
, Watch your puppies nurse so that you can get an idea of which puppies are exhibiting guarding behavior. If the mother is producing enough milk, remove the three or four largest puppies after they have nursed. This will give the smaller dogs an opportunity to feed.This will also prevent your bigger puppies from developing alpha tendencies such as resource guarding.
 If the mother is not producing enough milk, you should remove the larger puppies before they nurse and feed hand-feed them twice a day. This will ensure that they get enough to eat and do not diminish the mother’s milk supply for the small puppies. Talk with your veterinarian about getting the proper formula for your puppies.This will also help you curtail resource guarding in your larger puppies.
Once you begin bottle-feeding the larger puppies, you should not allow them to nurse any longer. This will affect the mother’s milk supply and could make the malnourishment of the smaller puppies worse.
 While their smaller siblings eat, leave the larger puppies in a box with a heating pad or a hot water bottle. The big puppies will be content with the warmth. Leave them in the box until the smaller puppies have finished nursing.

 This project will help you to create laminated, fabric-covered bookmarks that feature the mother’s name and the date of the shower. You can add favorite quotes, short poems or other text to these bookmarks in addition to the date. The fabric can either match the baby shower theme or can consist of scraps that you have around the house. Bookmarks like these are great for a book-themed baby shower.
 Make commemorative labels for foil-wrapped candy bars. Use a word processing template, some clip art and some brochure paper to assemble these special gifts for guests. You can play a game with these candy bars. Draw baby and pregnancy related words on cards. Shuffle the deck of cards and turn them face down. Have guests take turns taking cards looking for a match. Guests who find matching cards get a commemoratively wrapped candy bar.
 Pictures taken throughout the baby shower from a guests-eye view will provide the mother-to-be with memories that she will never forget. With this craft, you can order specially colored cameras and then decorate them. You can also decorate the cardboard that wraps disposable cameras that are more readily available. If you’re in a hurry, just leave the cameras lying around without decorating them. The mother-to-be will still enjoy the pictures.

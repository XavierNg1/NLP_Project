 One idea might be to have them serve as the flower girl or ring bearer if they are very young. For older children, the role of bridesmaid or groomsmen might be appropriate.


Children can even be maid of honor or best man if wished.;
, This can be especially effective if you're blending two families. Ask your priest, minister, or rabbi if he or she is willing to incorporate this into the ceremony.


Have the whole family gather together for this and focus it on being about unity.
 This is often a fun way to involve children in the ceremony and they'll be happy to follow you around showering you with tokens of love.
 Children often love to be involved and can get very excited if they're given the chance to help choose items like table cloths, flowers, something borrowed or blue, etc. While this is not direct involvement in the ceremony, it's another way to keep them occupied and involved generally.

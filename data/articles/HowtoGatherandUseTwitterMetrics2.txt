,, You will be taken to another page. The page will tell you, based on number of followers, what the account is ranked compared to all people on Twitter and in the region the person lists in their profile's location field. It will also show you a graph which shows the number of followers over time. Below that, a table will appear which also shows the same information as found in the graph.


This metric can be useful in terms of identifying celebrities on Twitter as they will frequently be ranked highly in their geographic location and will have a graphs with steep incline because they will get a lot of followers in a short period of time as people find them.
The rank for a region may be a helpful number in terms of identifying if your account has the right amount of recognition for the size of the geographic location it represents. Example: If you run a candy store in a small town in South Dakota, 300 followers may put you in the top of your region and you might have good recognition in your market area.

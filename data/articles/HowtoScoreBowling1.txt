 A game of bowling has 10 frames. Within each frame, each player has 2 opportunities to knock down all 10 pins.If all 10 pins are knocked down by a player on the first roll of a frame, the player is awarded a strike and won't need a second turn in that frame.
If a player uses 2 balls to knock down all 10 pins in a frame, the player is awarded a spare. For example, the player may knock down 7 pins on the first roll and 3 pins on the second.
If a player misses all 10 pins on the first roll and then knocks all 10 down on the second, it's still considered a spare (not a strike) because it took 2 balls to knock the pins down.
An open frame is when a player doesn't knock all 10 pins down in both attempts.;
, The score card has a place for each bowler's name, followed by 10 boxes (one for each frame) and a final score box. Each of the 10 boxes has a set of 2 smaller boxes; these are to record the number of pins knocked down for each roll within the frame.


The final score box has 1 smaller box, which designates the third roll in frame 10 -- used only if the bowler gets either a spare or strike in the tenth frame.
 Depending on the rules you and your friends have determined, you may need to determine how to mark variations in game play. Once in a while, things out of the norm happen -- how will these be marked?


An "F" can denote when a bowler has gone over the line (literally) -- the line separating the walk-up to the actual lane. If they do, they receive 0 points for that turn.
If a bowler receives a split, you may mark an "O" around the number to indicate the pin set-up. As an alternative, mark an "S" in front of the number of pins knocked down. A "split" happens when the headpin has been successfully knocked down, yet there is still a gap between all the others still standing.
If the headpin was missed, sometimes the terms "wide" or "washout" are used. A "W" can be denoted on the card, but, in general, this annotation has fallen out of common usage.

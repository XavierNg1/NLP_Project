 You can pretend that you are talking on he phone with a friend, even if you aren't. You could also have a 'conversation' with a doll, stuffed animal, a pet, a plant, or any random inanimate object. You could also have a conversation with yourself.;
, This takes care of your loneliness, plus you can have tons of fun with your friends.
 If you aren't aloud to join chat rooms and you can't text your friend, find a program where you can 'chat' with a computer. Try this program where you 'chat' with an animal! http://www.adoptme.com/chats.php You can also try something like Cleverbot or Jabberwacky, which are more advanced than the Adopt Me program.
 If you don't, go outside and find a pet rock and care for it, or simply use a stuffed animal as a pet.
 These games, although usually played with friends, can easily be adapted to be played with only one player.
 Do whatever you want with them!

, For example, you could learn more about flirting, parties, coming up with conversation topics, making jokes, making friends and so on! Once you've learned about these, practice. For example, if you've learned about flirting, practice these techniques on a teddy bear and later on a boy/girl. This can be really fun to do! Just make sure that the tips are appropriate and don't have any really bad swearing in them or any sex-related things in them.
 Put on really sparkly clothes, wear super glittery make-up, put your hair up in a wacky updo and go crazy with the accessories. Just wash off all of your make-up and change your clothes, hair and accessories when you are finished.
 Laughing is an awesome way to get out of your funk.
 Try making your pose funny, creepy, awesome, and pretty.
, It can really make you feel better! If you take a bath, play with some bath toys even if you think that it is childish to do so, and if you take a shower, sing in the shower!

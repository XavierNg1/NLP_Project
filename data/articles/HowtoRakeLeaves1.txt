 Many people have an old rake in the tool shed, but an older rake may not be as efficient as a new one. To make raking more efficient, invest in a quality rake.








Look for a rake that has an ergonomic handle and that is lightweight. This will help to reduce the strain on your back.
Choosing a rake that has a wide end will also help to ensure that you can rake up as many leaves a possible with every sweep.;
, Proper body positioning is also essential to successful raking. Some things to keep in mind when you rake include:








Your hand positions. When you hold the rake, grasp it with both hands and change your hand positions now and then as you rake.
Your knees. Keep your knees slightly bent. Try not to bend too far forward at the waist.
Your movement. It is helpful to move backwards as you rake. Try to rake the leaves towards you as you walk backwards.
 You can also save time and energy by raking your leaves onto a tarp, sheet, or canvas cloth. Before you begin raking, lay out a tarp or other large piece of material on the ground. Then, begin raking the leaves onto the tarp.








Rake one area of your yard until the tarp is full, then drag the tarp to your main pile.
If you prefer, you can also rake your leaves directly into bags. Then, you can transport the bags to a mulch pile or other disposal area.
 As you rake leaves onto the tarp or into bags, make sure that you stomp them down now and then. This will help to ensure that you have plenty of room for all of your leaves.To stomp on your leaves, simply step on them or put one foot into the leaf bag to stomp them down.
If you are using bags, just try to avoid filling the bags too full. You should still be able to pick the bags up easily.

 Reach your thumb and forefinger into the tin or pouch, or break off a piece of your plug. If you are a beginner to dipping, your pinch really should just be a small amount between your thumb and forefinger, probably about the size of a quarter. As you get more used to the taste and strength, the size of your pinch can grow, depending on how long you want it to sit in your mouth and how strong of dose of nicotine you are looking for.
 Take your tobacco and put it down in your mouth between your gums and cheek of your lower lip.

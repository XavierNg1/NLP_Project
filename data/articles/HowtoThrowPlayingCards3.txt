 If you want to throw cards straight off the deck, hustler-style, grip the deck firmly with the long side of the cards in the palm of your hand, the short sides perpendicular with your body.
 It can be helpful to lick your thumb to get a bit of grip on the top card and slide it off more easily.
 It'll take some practice to get the motion firm enough to send the card, but light enough not to launch off the top several cards. Your thumb should come up off the deck slightly, launching them out and away, rather than down. A bit of wetness on the pad of your thumb should help.
 Once the card is launched, draw thumb back quickly, being careful not to touch the top of the deck, so you can keep shooting off cards like mad. It's fun!

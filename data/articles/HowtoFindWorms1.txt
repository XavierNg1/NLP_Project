 You can find worms at any time, but it will be easiest when it's just rained. The water drives the worms out of the ground into the open air. They'll head for dry land: sidewalks, roads, driveways, and patios.Look for worms on a humid day before it rains, or during a rain-shower. Try hunting on a cool and moist autumn day or evening.


If you are trying to sample worms for a study, fall is the best time to start looking. Most worms are sexually mature by the time fall rolls around, which makes it easier to tell them apart.
If it isn't a rainy season, consider watering the ground where you suspect there are worms. Make sure that the earth is thoroughly saturated. Then, wait a few hours and wait for the worms to come out – ideally, in the evening.;
, Walk delicately, and try to be patient. Worms can feel the vibration of your footsteps through the soil, and the concussive effect may drive them further underground. If there are a lot of worms out, make sure that you don't accidentally crush them under your feet!

, Check garden soil, fields, pastures, lawns, parks – anywhere with loose soil. Look under rocks, logs, and other objects that create shelter in the soil. Don't be afraid to dig deeper if you suspect that there are worms about.


Check your footprints. The pressure from your footstep will often bring curious worms to the surface.

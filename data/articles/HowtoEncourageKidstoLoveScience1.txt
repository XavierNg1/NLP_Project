 Science is the process of asking questions about the world and thinking of reasonable answers. To help your kids start down this path and come to enjoy the creativity that it involves, provide them with questions, not answers. This will get them to develop their own answers and help them love the process of investigation the is so important in science.For instance, instead of telling your kids why the sky is blue, you could ask them why they think the sky is blue. Listen carefully to their answer, then ask them how they arrived at this answer. Help your child locate resources to discover whether or not they’re right.;
, Even kids who aren’t passionate about science can learn to love it if you show them how it impacts their more immediate interests. For instance, if your kids love baseball, you could share some videos that explain the physics behind how baseballs travel through space and how gravity affects the ball’s course.If your kids love videogames, talk to them about the electrical signals and code required to program the game system and software., Love and appreciation of science often comes later in life as your kids gain exposure to different types of science. But if you’ve laid a solid foundation for them to understand scientific principles and processes, it will be easier for them to develop that passion as they grow.Provide encouragement whenever your child shows interest in a scientific topic.
Help clarify scientific ideas if your child asks about them.
 Kids often take after their parents, and if you have a positive attitude about science, your kids probably will as well. When you read something interesting that relates to science, share it with your child.

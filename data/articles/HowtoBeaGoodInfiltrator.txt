 What's your objective? Where is it? What's the route you're going to take? Write all this down to make sure you know it well.;
, Search the area with binoculars from a tree. Then, once you're certain you know the area pretty well, make a map with all the details, especially escape routes, hiding spots, and places where people might be. Also mark the route that you should take.
 If it's a spy mission at night, wear dark/navy blue. You don't want to wear black because it shows your outline. If it's in the forest, wear green and brown. If it's in a place where you can slip into a crowd, wear clothes that look appropriate. (Preferably with lots of pockets)

, Every infiltrator needs gear. First, a cell phone so you can call help if you're stranded (If necessary) REMEMBER TO TURN THE RINGER AND VIBRATE OFF ON YOUR PHONE!. Next, binoculars. They don't have to be expensive, and they should be pretty small. You will also need a small notebook and pencil for notes, some cash, and some pennies. You would be surprised how many people get distracted by pennies. They're pretty useful. The last thing you'll need is a pair of gloves. They protect your hands and also don't leave fingerprints.
 You can even have walkie-talkies so that they can monitor your position and can help you if you run into trouble. This person should have a copy of the plan.

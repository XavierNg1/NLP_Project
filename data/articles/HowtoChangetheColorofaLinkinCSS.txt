 For the sake of doing this without any errors, we'll use images from Adobe DreamWeaver. And we'll use google for the link.;
, So you should type <style type="text/css"> where it says <head>.
 Links consist of 4 elements. Link, hover, visited, and active.


Link is the primary color of your link, this is what color it will normally display.
Hover is a variable to make it change color, and stand out when your mouse goes over the link.
Visited is an after click variable, it will display this color anytime after you've clicked the link.
Active is the click on color, it will become this color the moment your mouse clicks and release it to activate the link.
 You want to make 4 elements after it, with an enter separating them. a:link , a:hover , a:visited , a:active. It's recommended you don't capitalize any of them.
, Alternatively you can simply type {color:;} the the selection of colors is much more limited.
, To do this in a CSS stylesheet, simply put /* */ .

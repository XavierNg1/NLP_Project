 Grills take a while to warm up completely so preheat your outdoor grill at medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Close the lid while heating.









Once you have heated your grill a bit, you can use a grill brush it clean before use.
 Use a metal spatula to gently place your fillets directly onto the oiled grill. Close the grill lid and cook for about 3 or 4 minutes.









Drizzle the fillets in a seasoning of your choice or marinate them prior to cooking.
Try some olive oil, minced garlic, black pepper, cayenne pepper, salt, lime juice, and grated lime zest or anything else you prefer.
 After about 3 or 4 minutes, use a metal spatula to gently flip your fillets. Close the grill lid and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until the fish flakes easily.
 Carefully remove your fillets from the grill and serve with fresh limes or zest. For best results, serve immediately.

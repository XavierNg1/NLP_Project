 This will help you concentrate on what you're doing. Another optional but good thing to do is put on some music to relax yourself!;
, These things are a computer, CD-R or a CD-RW drive, blank CD-R, CD Case, wrapping paper, ribbon (optional) Christmas card, gift tags and a pen or pencil. You'll also need song files and windows media player or iTunes, on your computer.
 Take your CD and go onto your computer. Then burn the CD with Christmas music or even your own recordings of songs! Some songs could be Deck the halls, Jingle bells, etc. It depends on your style.
 You can use a bag but personally wrapping is more festive and fun! Put your CD in a CD case first. then wrap it with some Christmas themed wrapping paper. There are also many articles on wrapping a gift to help you. But the process is just folding over again. Then (optional) tie a ribbon or use a ribbon that you stick on for a more festive look! Then insert your gift tag with the name of the receiver and the giver on it. Now you are done with your gift CD!

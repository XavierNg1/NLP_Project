 Do not make eye contact with it (hovering the cross in any area above the torso). There are three ways to kill the enderman.
 Jump and critical hit it, and keep critical hitting it. If it teleports, look for the trail of particles and it will lead you to the enderman, who is most likely behind you. Repeat and kill.


If you don't have good armor, get some tamed wolves (at least five). Do the first hit as a critical and let the wolves finish it. Feed your wolves after, as they will probably be injured from the enderman's attack.
Attacking the enderman's feet will not make the enderman teleport. If it does teleport, get to a 2 block high space, as the enderman will not be able to attack you. It is also a good idea to get your back against a wall, so it cannot surprise you from behind. Don't use a bow, or any sort of projectile, as the enderman will just teleport away.
 The enderman will try to teleport to you, but will be damaged by the water and teleport away. Repeat until the enderman is dead.
 The enderman cannot reach you, therefore, you will not get damaged. Or you can build a pole 4 blocks high and you will be in the range to attack the enderman but the enderman can't attack you as you are not in the range of the enderman's attacks. Watch out for spiders and skeletons, as they may knock you off the pole., To increase that chance, use a sword with the looting enchantment.

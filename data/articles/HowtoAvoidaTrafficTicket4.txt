 Know, however, that the posted limit applies only to ideal conditions. Drive 5 or 10 mph (8.0 or 16.1 km/h) under if it is raining or there is snow/ice on the ground.
 In addition, many jurisdictions have laws that require you to drive in the right lane unless you are passing, so you can be ticketed for cruising in the left lane.
 If you’re going to speed, you’re less likely to be ticketed if everybody else is doing it. (However, if you are pulled over exceeding the speed limit, "going with the flow of traffic" cannot be used as an excuse for receiving a speeding ticket.) It’s not uncommon in many areas for the posted speed limit to be something of a joke. If everybody’s going 80 in a 70, chances are you can get away with it — in fact, if you’re going significantly slower you may be a hazard—but if you treat that as a license to go 85, guess who’ll get nabbed.
 If you see brake lights up ahead, especially on that car that just blew by you, there may be a speed trap just out of your view, or a radar detector may be alerting the driver in front of you. It pays to watch the behavior of truckers, in particular, because truckers down the road can use CB radio to warn those behind them. Additionally, motorists going the opposite direction might flash their lights at you to warn you about a cop.
 Take notice of someone driving roughly the same speed as you and let them get a good distance ahead, then watch them for any sudden stops or other behavior that may indicate a speed trap.

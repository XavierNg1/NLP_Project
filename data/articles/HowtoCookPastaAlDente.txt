 You will be cooking pasta as normal; only the time will vary. You can follow directions on boxed pasta, or you can visit the wikiHow article.;

Some boxes of pasta have directions for al dente. Because the directions aren't always perfect, you will have to taste the pasta as it is being cooked to know when it is al dente.
 At this point, it should still be somewhat crunchy. Remember to blow on the pasta to cool it before tasting.
 Al dente pasta will feel firm, not crunchy, when you bite down with your front teeth. You can also break a piece of pasta in half and look at the cross sectionâ€”al dente pasta is mostly cooked with a small core of uncooked pasta running through the middle.
 Getting the timing right will take some practice, but eventually you'll be preparing al dente pasta like a pro!

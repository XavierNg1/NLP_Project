 Look for small spice jars or jars of a similar small and cylinder shape. They must have decent lids on them, to keep the contents safely inside., Small candy-coated chocolates, jelly beans, tiny boiled sweets, etc. are ideal for adding., Decide whether you'll only use one type of candy or layer different candies before filling. If layering, do at least three layers to make it look effective. Then place the lid on top.

It may be a good idea to tape down the lid if it's not tight enough on its own.
 This can be done in many ways, some suggestions include tying a ribbon bow around the neck of the jar, piercing a miniature windmill through the top if the lid is made from cork, adding a label with the birthday party date and the guest's name, adding stickers or scrapbook cutouts, and so forth.

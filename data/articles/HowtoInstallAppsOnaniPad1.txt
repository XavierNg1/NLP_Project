 The app store is a light blue icon with an encircled "A" made of paint brushes on it; you can usually find it on the home screen, or you can swipe down from the middle of your iPad's screen and type "App Store" into the search bar to find it.


Any app for iPad or iPhone can be downloaded from the App Store.;
, This is in the bottom-screen toolbar. If you don't have a specific app in mind, your other options include the following:


"Featured", which shows you apps selected by Apple.
"Top Charts", which shows the most popular apps of all time.
"Explore", which allows you to browse apps by alphabetically-listed category (e.g., "Books", "Education", "Games").
 "Search" is the blue button in the bottom right corner of your keyboard.
 Scroll down to view apps related to your inquiry, or tap an app to view its rating, reviews, and description. Once you settle on an app, you can continue.
 This will begin the installation process.


For paid apps, tap the price, then tap "BUY"., This is the password you use with your Apple ID email address. You normally only have to do this if purchasing an app--free apps simply download.


If you don't have an Apple ID, you'll need to create one now.
If you're paying for an app, you will need to enter your payment information before it begins downloading. Follow the steps on your screen to do so.
 The "Open" option becomes available when your app finishes downloading.


You can also exit the App Store and access the app from your home page.
Depending on how many apps you have, the new app may be installed several swipes right of your iPad's home page.
 You have successfully installed a new app on your iPad!

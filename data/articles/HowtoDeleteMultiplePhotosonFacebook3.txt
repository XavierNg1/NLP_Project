 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device and tap on it.
 If you logged out of your previous Facebook session, you will be asked to log in again. Enter your login details in its respective fields and tap “Log in” to access your account.
 Tap on your name on the header toolbar. You will be brought to your Timeline, or wall. Tap on the Photos box, right below your cover photo, and you will be brought to your Photos screen.


The photos on the mobile app are organized by albums.
 The album will be opened and the photos inside it will be displayed.
 Tap on the photo’s thumbnail to view it on full screen.
 Tap on the icon with three dots on the bottom taskbar to bring out a menu. Select “Delete Photo” from here.


A confirmation message will appear to check if you really want to delete the photo. Tap on the “Delete” button, and the photo will immediately be removed from the album and from Facebook.
Repeat Steps 4 to 6 for other photos you want to remove from Facebook.

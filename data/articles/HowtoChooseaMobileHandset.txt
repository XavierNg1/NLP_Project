 Will you use it for emergencies only, when out meeting somebody or in place of your landline or a combination?;
, Choose which network looks right for you. It is a good idea to ask the people you will call the most what network they use, calls are often cheaper within the same network than between networks. You should also look at external reviews of the various networks to see what they do well or poorly. You may find that reception is poor for one network where you live or that people are unhappy with the customer service on another one.
 You should have some idea of how much you intend to use your phone. Based on the monthly cost of the contracts or the cost per minute/per text of calls on a Pay As You Go plan you should be able to work out whether it makes better financial sense to have a contract or Pay As You Go. For example, if you expect to spend £5 a month on calls and texts and you can get a phone from between £70 and £100 it will be better value than a contract where you will pay £25 a month and get a free phone. If, however, you will make hundreds of minutes worth of phone calls every month, it will be better value to get a contract that gives you those minutes for free.
 The only way you can use a phone from a different network is to get various codes. And even then you're at the risk of you not being able to use all of the tools on your phone, such as the internet.
 bluetooth, or a camera. Do you need your phone for email and when travelling abroad? Are you going to carry it in your pocket or handbag and if so do you need to worry about size and weight or is functionality and available gadgets more important?

, You can also go into the store, where a 'friendly member of staff will be there to guide you'. You should compare the features of each potential phone in order to help decide which phone best suits you.

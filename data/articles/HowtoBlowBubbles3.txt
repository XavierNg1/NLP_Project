 Now that you know how to blow bubbles, you can start playing fun games with your friends. Give everyone a wand and see who can blow the most bubbles in one breath. Remember that a steady, even flow of air will create more bubbles than a strong burst!

, This is another fun game to play with friends. Have everyone start at the same time and see who can blow the biggest bubble using the small-sized wand. If you have a friend who's sitting out, ask them to take a picture!

, If you made a giant bubble wand, it's fun to see whose bubble will last the longest without popping. You can make the game harder by having the contestant move jog in place, put their hand inside the bubble, or bend up and down - all without letting it pop.
 It's like regular darts, only a lot more fun! Have someone blow bubbles in front of the dartboard. The person throwing darts should try to pop as many bubbles as possible to get points for his or her team.
 This is a great activity for a rainy day, when you want to play with bubbles but you can't go out in the sun. Blow a bubble and carefully transfer it to a plate. Gently place the plate in the freezer. Check it out in 1/2 an hour or so - it should be frozen solid.

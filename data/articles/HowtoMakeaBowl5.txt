 It should be in very good to excellent condition––if it's stained, pass on it. Doilies can be purchased from thrift stores, antique dealers and many online auction sellers.
 Before finalizing the bowl choice, check that the doily sits over it well. If not, choose one of a better size. Turn the bowl upside down in readiness for covering with the doily.
 Either will work, choose according to whatever you have available. Note that sugar water may attract insects if stored for a long period of time. In each case, work over a surface where drips won't be a problem.


Pour fabric stiffener into another bowl or basin. Dip the doily into this bowl or basin.
Make sugar water. Dissolve 3-5 tablespoons of sugar in boiling water. Heat without boiling, until all of the granules disappear. Dip the doily into this mixture. Make sure it is thoroughly covered.
 Adjust to ensure that it is sitting evenly around the bowl––if not, you'll end up with a lopsided doily bowl shape.
 Let dry for approximately 48 hours. Don't touch until at least 24 hours have passed by.
 Let stand until you're absolutely sure the whole surface of the doily is completely dry.


Trim off any plastic wrap or fabric stiffener that is stuck to the doily.
 Add candies, sewing bits and pieces (a few old wooden cotton reels look superb) or a pile of ribbons. It's a lovely item just by itself on display too.

 Speed picking is something you can use for a dramatic effect, or to play occasional blazing solos free of hammer-ons and pull-offs. To do it, simply "sweep" the pick down or up across the strings. However, as you do, you need your fretting hand to speed through the scale at the exact same speed. The goal is to only "pick" all the strings once but still play 7-8 notes. As you sweep, you play 1-3 notes per string. Once your pick reaches the next string, your hand must too.









Basic hint: Get the heaviest pick you can find, and let it glide across the strings very lightly, at an angle, for the best results.
This is well mixed with chromaticism -- the notes come so fast that a few of them "off key" actually work pretty well.

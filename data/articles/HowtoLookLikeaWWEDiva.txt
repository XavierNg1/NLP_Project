 Do not be afraid to get some muscle. You can't be weak and scrawny and still be a diva. Hit the gym to do some weight training. Try to aim for three times a week, maybe for 1/2 to 1 hour each session. Be sure to also balance in some cardio. This includes a wide variety of exercises, just do things that you enjoy that get your heart beating. This includes dancing, jogging, kick boxing, etc. Try to do cardio 1/2 to 1 hour each day, about five times a week.;
, With all the hard exercising you will need to do, it will not be very successful without a proper diet. Cut back on sugar, caffeine, and alcohol. Practice portion control. Eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables. Balance the amount of carbs with protein. Carbs are not bad by the way, just be sure not to eat too many or too little. Also, stay away from refined flour, and opt for whole grains instead. Visiting a dietitian may be beneficial in order to find a healthy meal plan that works for you.
 The divas wear costumes that are often bright, shiny, and skin bearing. This shouldn't translate into street wear, but you can take a few tips. The divas are confident in their bodies, and like to show them off. Therefore, aim towards clothes that have structure and are fitted. Clothes that are colorful and stand out in a good way are also appropriate.
 The divas are strong and they know it. You must be assertive and confident with who you are. You don't want to look like someone who wants to fight, but like someone who wants to resolve problems civilly, and will completely kick your butt if necessary. Keep your composure and grace, but be willing to get your hands dirty if desperate times call for desperate measures.

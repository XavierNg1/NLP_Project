 For a recap, you pick up some momentum and you glide. When you need to turn, you simply turn your feet the way you want to turn, and keep your balance., Now turn normally, but just as you are starting to turn, lift your back leg so that it is in the air. For balance, it is easiest to put it behind you, but if you don't want to do that, then try putting your leg behind you and then bending at the knee. This looks amazing, but it is hard to keep your balance while doing it., Then bring your other leg down and push off of that foot to continue skating., Soon it will be smooth and beautiful.

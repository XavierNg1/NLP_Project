 Fruit flies (also called vinegar flies) are attracted to fermented beverages like beer and wine. For an effective fruit fly trap, leave an open beer can sitting out with a small piece of paper taped over the lid. Poke a small hole in the paper to allow the flies to enter the can. They will be unable to find their way out and will eventually drown in the beer.;
, Smear some Vaseline around the inside rim of an empty jam jar, and then place a piece of beer-soaked bread in the bottom of the jar. Leave the jar out overnight in the area where cockroaches have become a problem. The roaches will crawl into the jar to consume the beer-soaked bread, but will be unable to get out because of the Vaseline.
 Earwigs can be a perennial problem in the garden. To help reduce their numbers, bury a plastic cup in the ground so that it is flush with the surrounding soil. Fill the cup halfway with beer, and the earwigs will fall into the cup and be unable to get out. This technique also works with slugs and snails.

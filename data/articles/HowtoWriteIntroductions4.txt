 An abstract is a summary of the experiment. It assumes that the reader knows something about the subject area, but has not read the paper itself. It should be around 200 words.An introduction, meanwhile, details the type of experiment, its objects and importance, along with general background information needed to understand the experiment. It has nothing to do with the findings of the experiment.
 Whether you're working on temperature models, DNA/RNA replication, or plate-tectonics, a good introduction adequately explains what the experiment is going to be about. A great introduction will make it clear which factors will determine whether the experiment is going to be successful.
 What do you aim to figure out by undertaking this experiment? These objectives should be related to, but not synonymous with, your hypothesis. Your objectives will be analyzed in your conclusion, and are therefore extremely important to be clear about.
 It may be helpful to list any theoretical predictions for what the experiment might yield, especially if your experiment resulted in a groundbreaking finding. This provides a contrast between what's expected and what is actually true.

 If you have trouble making friends, that may mean you need a little practice learning what to say at home. It's fine if you need to practice a bit first. Ask your parents to help you figure out what to say to someone you'd like to be your friend or practice on your own.Make eye contact when you walk up to a kid you want to talk to. In addition, make sure you smile.Say "Hello!" Once you've said hello, invite your new friend to sit with you at lunch or to listen to your favorite song. For instance, you could say, "Hi, I'm Jessie. I know you don't know me, but I was wondering if you wanted to sit with me at lunch?"

, Everyone likes to hear that they look nice or that you like the shirt they're wearing. If you want to talk to someone new, try a greeting first, but then launch into a compliment, such as "You're shirt is really awesome! I love unicorns, too."Giving someone a compliment makes them feel good, and it gives them an opportunity to say something back to you. It gives you an instant connection.
 Kindness goes along way in making friendships. For instance, maybe you could offer to help a classmate who's having trouble lifting a box, or maybe you could carry a book for someone. When you do nice things for people, they want to respond in the same way, and it can open the way for friendships., If you're not big on talking to people you don't know, start with people you do. That is, the more you hold conversations with people, the better you will be in any situation, even when making new friends., When you make new friends, sometimes it's best to spend some time making that friendship stronger by spending more time together. If you can go to your house, you can do activities together and learn about each other.
 If you're unsure how to act around other kids your age, watch what other people do. See how your mom treats her friends. Watch how other kids talk to each other. The more you observe, the better you will be at doing it yourself.

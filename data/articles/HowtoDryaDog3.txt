 Towel drying is a little more work than using a chamois leather because the towel will become heavy and soggy when it soaks up the water. Nevertheless, this method works, and you likely already own towels.
 Replace each towel as it becomes wet. The larger the dog, the larger the towels you will need.
 Place a soft, absorbent bath towel over the dog's back and gently rub the dog's coat to absorb the water. You can rub quickly and vigorously, but do not rub too hard., As the towel becomes too wet to absorb any more water from the dog's coat, replace it with a new, dry towel.
 After drying the dog's back, move to its stomach, then its chest, and finally its paws., As you rub, be especially gentle around the dog's chest, neck, ears, and paws.

  If your school has an annual valentines-giving on Valentine's Day, why not share your love for others by buying some cute valentines with a small treat or making homemade valentines?  Write/have a short, sweet message on your card and maybe attach a Valentine's Day themed treat to it.  Yummy!
,  Since it's Valentine's Day, wearing red or pink is classic, but you can wear whatever you want.  Make sure it's comfortable, 'cause Valentine's Day is all about making yourself feel good, and tight or scratchy clothes have the opposite effect.  Wear some loose, soft clothes.  A big white t-shirt with a large pale pink cardigan, black leggings, and comfy converse is nice.  Wear something simple but slightly formal.,  The night before, treat yourself!  Wash your hair with a sweet-smelling shampoo and a moisturising conditioner that leaves your hair silky smooth. Wash your body with a relaxing smelling scented body wash.  Apply a refreshing face mask.  After, apply moisturising lotion to your body and face.  Maybe paint your nails a pretty pastel color with hearts on it or something.  :),  A pretty way to style your hair is to braid your hair while it's damp the night before, then go to sleep.  When you wake up in the morning, carefully undo the braids and loosen the waves up.  Apply some hairspray.  Or just leave it natural, but make sure you can easily run your fingers through it.  A simple updo is cute too.  Ponytails are great for any occasion.  Add some hair clips/accessories.,  They can be healthy, they can not.  Strawberries with hearts in the middle are very Valentine's Day themed and creative.  Maybe bring some pink cupcakes with hearts on them. Homemade is even better!  Share your yummy treats and share your love with everyone, that's what this day is about.,  That's all you need to do to have the best Valentine's Day ever.

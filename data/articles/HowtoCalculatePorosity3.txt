 You can measure the volume directly if your sample exactly fills a container with a known volume. You can also transfer the sample to a container such as a pre-measured beaker to measure volume. If you are unable to measure the volume directly, you can calculate the volume mathematically.

Transferring the sample from one container to another may affect the porosity by disrupting the material.
 It is not important exactly how much water you measure out. The two things that are important in this step are measuring out more water than you will need to saturate your sample, and writing down exactly how much water you started with. This is the only way you can know how much you used.
 This is an easy step, but can tricky. You want to add enough water so that all of the pores in your sample are filled, but you do not want to add any extra water. While it is important to get as close as you can to exactly saturating the sample, there will be some degree of error. Get the water level as close to the surface level of your solid sample level as possible., To do this, you will need to subtract the volume of water that is left from the volume of water you started with. This will leave you with the volume of water that was poured out. The volume of water you used is (approximately) equal to the pore volume of your sample., Now that you have the volume of your sample (Vs{\displaystyle Vs}) and the pore volume (Vp{\displaystyle Vp}), you can add them together to get total volume (Vt{\displaystyle Vt}). It is now possible to use the equation Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = (Vp{\displaystyle Vp}/Vt{\displaystyle Vt}) x 100% to find your porosity (Pt{\displaystyle Pt}). , Enter the appropriate values into the equation. Be sure to keep track of your units and make sure that they cancel out appropriately, as porosity is a unitless value. A calculator might be handy for this step, also.

, This is optional, but the final manicure looks nicer with a base color in place.
 In this article, owls are painted on the thumb and ring finger, but you can paint them on all of your nails, or as many as you want., Start out with a large bar that goes across the bottom of the nail. Then draw two ears on either sides. You can use the nail polish brush at first and then take a detail brush to make the body more rounded and the ears nice and pointy.
, Using the nail polish brush, take a lighter color (here it is shown as blue) and draw a semi circle at the bottom of your nail.
 Take a dotter tool and the base color (nude) polish and dot two eyes above the belly.
 Take the body color (plum) and dot on the pupils. Now you're done with the owl's eyes.
 Take a detail brush and a different lighter color (here the color lavender is used). Draw a small triangle below the eyes. This will be the nose.
 Use a dotter tool and the base polish (nude) to create polka dots all over the owl's belly. This will represent feathers. Now your owls are done.
 Make sure the base color is completely dry, and apply tape over your nails, so only the tips are showing.
 Let it dry for around two minutes.
 Presto! French tips. You can make the tips rounder with a detail brush if you like.
,, Then take a Q tip dipped in nail polish remover, and clean up your nail edges.
 Now your owl nails are done!

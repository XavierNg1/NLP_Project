 70+ Ranged is Required to get to Armadyl's Eyrie. 65+ Defence to last longer. (75 Defence would be a huge help) 60 Strength or 60 Agility is required to even get into the GWD. And at LEAST 43 prayer would help tremendously. And 55 Magic would help for the ability to high alchemy drops. i.e Runite Limbs or Rune daggers (p+).;
,, Food (Monkfish or better). Something like a few rocktail and some monkfish. Excalibur(For the Defence boosting Special Attack). 2-3 Ranging Potions(If you have 72+ Herblore, you can make your own Extreme Ranging Potions. Staff of fire and nature runes. Games Necklace if you haven't completed Edgar's Ruse. A Ring of Wealth if you want to make more money. Bones-To-Peaches tabs. Climbing Boots. A mith grapple. Do NOT forget the Mith grapple. And a rope if its your first time.
 Death Plateau. Defeated Dad in Troll Stronghold. And if you want to get there quicker, Edagar's Ruse for the Trollheim Teleport.
 If you haven't completed Edgar's Ruse, use a games necklace to teleport to The "Burthorpe Troll Invasion." There are plenty of pictures of route on how to get there. Look one up. Follow that and once you get past the battlefield where Dad is, put on protect from melee and go to the cave. The cave should be in the shape of a horseshoe. Exit the cave and follow the path north. There will be thrower trolls up ahead. Be sure to use protect from missiles. Push the big rock aside and talk to the fallen knight to the north. Be sure to use Protect from Melee. Now, use your rope on the dungeon entrance. Congratulations! You are at God Wars!

, Walk south until you see an agility shortcut. It requires no needed Agility level. But it does require 70+ ranged. But there are Aviansies al around the main dungeon. Equip your Mith Grapple and swing across the chasm. You are now at Armadyl's Eyrie!

 Talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated against certain viruses. There is no vaccine for the common cold, but you should get vaccinated against the flu virus every season. There are vaccines for other viruses, such as HPV (Human Papilloma Virus), chickenpox, and shingles. Be mindful of the fact that getting vaccinated involves getting a shot or two; however, this should not deter you â€” the benefits of the vaccine are worth the short period of discomfort the shot causes.
 Because of this, it is really important to wash your hands whenever possible. Use warm water and soap to wash your hands as thoroughly as possible. You should wash your hands:


After traveling on public transportation, going to the bathroom, sneezing or coughing, touching your face and mouth, contact with someone who is sick, and handling raw meat.
Before eating or touching your mouth, nose, eyes, or face.
 Avoid sharing:


Food or drinks that someone else has touched with their lips, as well as toiletries, pillows, towels, and chapstick.
 Also, after the illness has passed, it is wise to clean areas of the house that may have residual germs, such as washrooms, bed sheets, and kitchen counters.

 Arrabbiata is a quick and easy tomato sauce. It’s spicier than some other tomato sauces, and it’s slightly richer because you cook the tomato paste right in the oil.


Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. You'll be adding the tomatoes to this, so use a pan with high walls.
Add the tomato paste and hot pepper flakes to the hot oil.
Turn the heat to low and stir all the ingredients together. Cook the mixture for about four minutes., Pour the tomatoes in to the frying pan with the tomato paste. Stir to combine, and then remove the pan from the heat. Pour in the hot water and stir everything to combine.


You can also use red wine in place of the water.It’s best to make this sauce fresh while you're making the pasta to serve it with. When you cook the pasta, reserve ¼ cup (59 ml) of the water when you drain the pasta, and use that to add to the arrabbiata sauce.
Because pasta water has some leftover starch from the pasta, it will help to thicken the sauce.
 Add cooked pasta to the arrabbiata sauce and toss them together to coat the pasta with the sauce. Garnish with salt, pepper, fresh herbs, and cheese, to taste.This sauce recipe is ideal for 4 cups (1 kg) of uncooked pasta.

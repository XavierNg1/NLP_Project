 If you're making a turkey for Thanksgiving or another holiday, try a standard seasoning with some parsley and sage. This will produce a classic taste for your family to enjoy.In a small bowl, add 1/4 cup of fresh chopped parsley. Then, add one tablespoon each of sage, rosemary, and thyme. Add two tablespoons each of olive oil and melted butter, as well as half a teaspoon of both salt and pepper. The kind of olive oil you use doesn't matter.
Mix all your ingredients together until you have an even, uniform mixture.;
, If you want something a little different, try a lemon seasoning. This will make for a fresh, savory turkey.Mix 1/4 cup of unsalted butter with a teaspoon of lemon zest. Then, add a teaspoon of chopped thyme and a teaspoon of chopped marjoram.
Mix all the ingredients together into a uniform mixture.
 Many people love the taste of garlic. If you and your loved ones are fans of foods heavy in garlic, a garlic-herb rub can make for a great turkey seasoning.Mix three tablespoons of room temperature butter with two tablespoons each of rosemary and thyme.
Mince three garlic cloves and mix them in with the butter/herb mixture.
 If you want something sweeter, think about maple syrup. A maple syrup glaze can provide a somewhat unexpected but pleasant taste for your turkey.You actually apply this mixture after cooking the turkey for two and a half hours. You will mix two tablespoons of the pan juices with 1/4 cup of maple syrup. Then, rub the mixture all over your turkey.
Then, roast your turkey for 15 more minutes to let the flavor set in

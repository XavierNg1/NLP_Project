 Make a medallion necklace similar to what might be worn at a Native American powwow by using seed beads and felt. Bead designs into a circular piece of felt, and attach that to a leather or faux leather cord.


You can create any design you want on the medallion with different colored seed beads. To sew on beads securely, use nylon beading thread to pick up four beads, stitch through your foundation material, then loop back through the last two beads before picking up four new ones.Use a sharp needle that can go through the felt for your medallion but still thin enough to fit through your beads. You can use larger beads, or a thinner foundation material and attach it to felt later, if you’re having trouble with this.
 Put a stone on display by stringing it on a cord to wear as a necklace. Use turquoise, coral, or other precious or semiprecious stones commonly found in Native American jewelry.


Try using a natural material for the cord such as leather or suede, or an imitation version of these.
Look for a stone in a jewelry store that has a pre-drilled hole or a jump ring to run a cord through. If you can’t find this, you can try wrapping a stone in thin, flexible wire in order to attach it to a cord for your necklace., Attach one or more feathers to the bottom of any pendant or medallion for a natural touch. You can also feature feathers exclusively in your necklace by wrapping the feather quills with cord.


Use natural feathers rather than ones that have been artificially dyed.
You can also thread beads onto the quill of a feather for decoration and to help attach it to the cord or chain of a necklace. Push a bead onto the quill, then thread a headpin (flexible pin with a flat end) through the bead in the opposite direction. Then bend the headpin around a jump ring or your cord to attach it.

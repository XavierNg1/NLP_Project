This test will tell you where your paternal line came from and information on others with the same paternal DNA. You will see the word "Haplogroup;" this just means the group of people with similar paternal line DNA as you.
In addition to finding out where your father's line came from, you will find out where people with your Haplogroup live today.
You will find out the ethnicity and country of origin of your father's line. In many cases, people are surprised by the results. Your father's line may not be where the rest of your family is from.
 Y DNA testing is done on men only. If you are a woman, you need to have your father, brother, paternal grandfather, etc, take the test for you.
, There are many reputable providers of these tests, including Family Tree DNA, Ancestry, 23 and me, and others.


Examine the features of each company's test, but most are fairly similar.

 Regular physical activity is important for good health and longevity. Plus, engaging in exercise releases “feel-good” chemicals into the brain called endorphins, helping to lift your mood and clear your thinking. If you have a moment of alone time to spare, get your body moving.


In addition to boosting your mood, exercise also enhances energy, fights disease, improves sleep quality, and helps you manage weight. Go for a walk/run with your dog. Hike through the local woods. Ride your bike to the farmer’s market on weekends., Sometimes, you may be so over-engaged with those around you that you do not allow yourself time to properly rest. Napping too late in the day can interfere with your nighttime rest, but as long as you time it right, your nap can provide much needed energy and restoration.


Just keep your naps to a short period of time (say, 20-30 minutes) and several hours before you were planning to go to bed at night., When you’re not surrounded by family or friends, you may get a special opportunity to catch up on chores that need completing. If you are faced with long bouts of solitude, make a list of projects you have wanted to get done, and start moving through the list.This will make your periods of solitude productive and also help the time go by faster.
 Truth is, some people schedule activities and events for nearly every second of every day. This pursuit of “busyness” can make it seem as if you are being productive when, in reality, you are not. Some people believe downtime is a sign of weakness or not trying hard enough, so they aim to stay busy.


Be mindful that downtime can be incredibly positive when it is used for self-soothing and restoring activities. However, if you are using your downtime for mindless activities or distractions, you could be adding to your stress rather than relieving it.
Assess the things you do during alone time and see if they have a positive benefit or are simply distractions until you are around others again.

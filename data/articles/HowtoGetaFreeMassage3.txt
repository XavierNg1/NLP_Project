 If you can't find a friend who is interested in trading massages, use the internet to locate a free massage. Start with the search term "free massage resources" and look for trusted sources.


Be cautious when conducting a broad search online and avoid "adult services."

, There are a wide range of massages offered in what is known as massage exchange groups. However, be careful not to get involved in illegal activities camouflaged as massage services.


Never meet someone that you found online in a private place. Always meet people at a public location to discuss services. Make sure you are comfortable with each other before making any future plans. Bring along a friend for safety purposes. If you feel uncomfortable, leave immediately.
If you decide to meet at a massage studio, research the person and the premises before you go. A Google search will sometimes yield helpful information. If you ever feel the slightest bit of discomfort about the situation, don't go.
Sometimes there is a membership fee for using a massage exchange website.
 Use the phrase “win a free massage” to search for contests. Enter as many contests as you can find.
 Most licensed massage facilities offer gift cards. Request a gift card for your birthday or for a holiday gift from your friends and family members. These gift cards can be costly, so you probably should not expect to receive them often.

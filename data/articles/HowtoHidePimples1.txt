 Pick a mild soap for your face. Don't use cleansers that are astringents or facial scrubs. Also, pick one that doesn't have alcohol in it. Those types of products can make matters worse.Even though you shouldn't use a harsh cleanser, you can use some acne products that may help. Look for ones with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.Salicylic acid clears blocked pores and can reduce swelling and redness; benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria and exfoliates skin.
Wash with lukewarm water and your cleanser. Hot water can dry out your skin.;
, Most makeup removers contain alcohol or other chemicals that can irritate your skin. Most people also tend to rub harder when using cleansing cloths because it's more difficult to take makeup off with them. These effects can make your pimples worse.Use soap and water to remove your makeup when dealing with a blemish.
 When you get out of the shower or after you wash your face in the morning, use a towel or washcloth to rub the zit lightly. The shower will have loosened dead skin on the top of the zit, so lightly rubbing it will pull off that skin.
 When you clean your face at night, make sure to moisturize after you're done. Use a light moisturizer intended for your face. You can also apply moisturizer in the morning after you wash your face, but you should mainly focus on the dry spots.
 Put an ice cube in a washcloth. Hold it on your (clean!) skin for about a minute. If the pimple hasn't reduced, wait 5 minutes before applying for another minute.

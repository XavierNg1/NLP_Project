 You can also use just about any other type of paper for this, including cardstock, construction paper, or even plain old printer paper. You can also make the square smaller, but it must be a perfect square.
 Take the bottom left corner, and fold it towards the top right corner. Run your fingernail along the crease to make it nice and sharp. Unfold the paper when you are done.
 Take the bottom right corner, and fold it towards the upper left corner. Run your fingernail along the crease, then unfold the paper. You should now have an X in the middle of your paper.
 If you take a look at your paper, you'll see four triangles, all pointing towards the middle. Cut one of those triangles out, using the creases as a guide. You will now have a center triangle, and two side flaps.
 Take the left side flap, and fold it down onto the triangle, following the crease you made earlier.
 A glue stick will be the least messy, but you can also use liquid glue if you are careful. If you are using double-sided tape, make sure that you put the tape all along the edges.


If you are using liquid glue, consider brushing it on in a thin layer using a paintbrush.
 You should now have a triangle shape. Run your finger over the triangle to seal the glue or tape. Then, run your fingernail all around the edges to sharpen them.
 You can leave your bookmark as is, or you can decorate it further with stickers. You can also write a meaningful message or quote on it, or even draw a picture.
 If you just used tape, then your bookmark is ready to go. If you used glue, paint, or markers to decorate it, however, you might want to give the bookmark a little time to dry. This way, you won't ruin the pages of your book.

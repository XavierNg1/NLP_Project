 Jakob Nielsen, a webpage design expert, researched the efficacy of website design in getting donors to submit donations to different charities online. His research determined that bad website design leads to fewer donations. Donors not only expect a user-friendly experience, but they also want information about the organization's mission and how the funds will be used., Before donors commit to submitting a donation, they want to see information about your goals and work. Write a mission statement and display it prominently on the homepage of your website. Include details about the work you have done and your future goals. Donors want to give to organizations that share their ideals and values. But they also want to know how you plan to achieve your goals., List any pertinent details about how the funds you receive are to be used to accomplish your goals. Donors want reassurance that their money is going to the cause they want to support. They are more likely to donate if they know your organization is trustworthy., Make sure all of your content is clearly written and doesn’t include confusing terms or have missing information. Donors want to be able to have all of their questions answered before donating. If you are part of a larger parent site, make your site look and operate similarly to the parent site. It’s confusing if your site is completely different. Also, make it easy for donors to find the donate button.

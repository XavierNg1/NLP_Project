 Having fun with your dog indoors doesn’t mean you can’t leave the house. You and your dog can enjoy going on socialization outings when you can’t be outside. For instance, take your dog to the pet store to pick out a new toy or just meet the other dogs there., You can also take your dog for a visit to the vet’s office, just for fun. Your dog will probably enjoy getting attention from the employees there and it will also make it feel more at ease when going to the vet’s office for health checks, since it won’t associate this place with only pain or uncomfortable procedures., If there are any coffee shops or restaurants in your area that are pet friendly, take your dog to these places every once in a while. Your dog will love getting to meet new people and getting tons of attention from patrons and employees.
 If you have friends with dogs, set up play dates with them for when you have to be indoors. Your dog will enjoy getting to play with another dog and you can enjoy hanging out with your friend.


You can also take your dog to doggy day care, where it will have the chance to socialize and play with a number of other dogs.

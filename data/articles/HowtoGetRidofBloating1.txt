 Roughly 20 to 30 minutes of rapid walking can aid in the digestive process. Walking quickly will help relieve bloating better than a slow walk.Walking is gentle enough to prevent further stomach upset, but it also provides enough physical activity to keep food and trapped air moving through the digestive tract. The increased heart rate and breathing causes the digestive muscles to push air and food through the intestines.;
, Bloating can come with a host of other uncomfortable feelings. Heat can reduce the pain from bloating, and it can help relax you, which can relieve the gas or constipation causing the bloating.There are many ways you can apply heat:


Place a heating pad on your stomach for direct heat.
Take a hot bath or shower.
Relax in a sauna.
 For five minutes, gently apply pressure in a small circular motion to a spot roughly four finger-widths above your belly button. This technique is known as acupressure. Putting gentle pressure on your abdomen can ease physical stress on the stomach, reducing any present tension and bloating. If your bloating is caused by constipation, it can also help encourage going to the bathroom., Lay down on your back in a dark room. Read a book. Meditate. Relaxation can help relieve the symptoms of chronic bloating. If you are frequently stressed and you suffer from bloating, try taking some time out of your day to peacefully rest.Your body will be relaxed enough to either pass the gas or constipation that is causing your bloating.

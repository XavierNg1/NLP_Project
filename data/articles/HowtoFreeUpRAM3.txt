 The cost of memory has dropped significantly over the years, so upgrading the RAM in your older computer may be much cheaper than it used to be. Consult your computer’s documentation to determine what RAM is compatible with your system. Check out our guides for installing desktop RAM and notebook RAM.
 Mac OS X is fairly efficient when it comes to memory usage, but sometimes programs with large memory consumption will set aside memory and then not free it when the program ends. To clear your Mac's memory, first launch the Terminal. This can be found in the Utilities folder, which is located in your Applications.


In the terminal simply type "purge" and press Enter. The system will process for a couple of minutes.
You can check the before and after memory usage by opening the Activity Monitor in the Utilities folder.

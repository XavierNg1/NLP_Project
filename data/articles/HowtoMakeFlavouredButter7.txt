 You may alternatively mix 1T hot English mustard, or supplement the mild with a little other strong mustard.


Mixing the mustard can give a good balance as the butter will make the strength of the mustard seem more mellow. Too much hot English mustard can have an acid taste however, so the key is to balance to your tastes.
Mustard butter is also good mixed with chopped capers, thyme or chives.

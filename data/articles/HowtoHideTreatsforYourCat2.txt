 To play hide and seek with your cat, start by putting treats in its favorite toys, such as a stuffed mouse toy. Use toys that have a slot in them to hide treats or cut a hole in your cat's stuffed toys to put the treats inside them.If you do not want to stuff the treats in your cat’s favorite toys, you can just use the treats themselves. However, using a stuffed toy can prevent small children and other animals from getting at the treats.
 Start by showing your cat the toy stuffed with treats or the bag of treats. Let it smell the treats so it is aware of the smell and can use it to hunt down the treats.You may also use verbal cues for your cat, such as, “Look at the treats” or “Smell the treats.”

, Make sure your cat can see where you are hiding the treats. Put them all over the house so your cat has to move around to get them. Once you have hidden the treats, wait for your cat to find them.For example, you may hide the treats in your cat's favorite hiding spots, such as under furniture or on high shelving in your home. Or you may hide the treats near your cat's bed or its scratching post.
 Once your cat finds the treat, reward it with verbal praise and heavy petting. Try playing the hide and seek game once a day, rotating out the hiding spots so your cat gets better at hunting down the treats.Over time, try not showing your cat where you are hiding the treats. This will help your cat learn to find the treats on its own. This can up the challenge of the game for your cat.

 Begin trying to predict the weather for several days using clouds, and record your observations as well as your success rate. If you want, you can also take pictures.
 Knowing the climate of your area and how seasons often turn out can help you predict weather as well.
 It will take a while to be able to predict the weather with a degree of accuracy, so keep a positive attitude.

 The only way to obtain Celebi in Pokémon Crystal is by unlocking the Celebi Quest, which is hidden within the game. GameShark can be purchased online.


If GameShark isn't available, you can use Code Breaker or Game Genie. These devices are already proven and used by many console gamers.
If you plan on using another method aside from using GameShark, keep in mind that there are risks of messing up your Pokedex. The safest way to obtain Celebi is by using this method.;
, Before anything else, start your game with your GameShark or other similar device and then inject this code into your game: 0173D2D0.


After inserting the code, head to any Pokemart and buy one GS Ball.
After purchasing GS Ball, save your game and then shut it off.
 Switch your game back on with GameShark (or other device) and then insert this code to unlock the quest: 914089DA.


After inserting the code, make your way to Kurt, who lives in a house in the northwest corner of Azalea Town.
Talk to him and he will then take the GS Ball from you.
Kurt will then tell you that he will give it back the next day. Do so and retrieve the GS Ball from him.
 Now that you have the GS Ball, head straight to Ilex Forest as Kurt suggested. The forest is located in southern Johto, directly west of Azalea Town. Find the shrine, a small structure located within the Ilex Forest, and once you find it, approach the structure and put the GS Ball in the shrine. Celebi will then appear.


Catch Celebi like you would other Pokémon: decrease its HP or throw a Pokeball that has higher rate of capturing Pokémon without the need of halving its health.
The Celebi that appears will be level 30 and has the chance of capturing a Psychic or Grass-type.

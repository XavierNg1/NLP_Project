Imagine what you want to have accomplished, decided or established at the end of your retreat. That will help you define your goals and purpose.
Be specific about your purpose. Your purpose should be more focused than "strategic planning," for example. Identify specific actions or ideas that you want to have come out of the retreat.;
, You might have large goals that cannot be accomplished within one retreat.


Prioritize your needs and desires. If you know you will not have the time to accomplish everything, choose 1 or 2 priorities for this retreat, and end the day with a plan for addressing the other issues.



Talk to the people you will invite on this retreat, and see if they have any ideas about the goals you should set for the retreat. When people are consulted ahead of time, they will be more invested in the retreat and its outcomes.

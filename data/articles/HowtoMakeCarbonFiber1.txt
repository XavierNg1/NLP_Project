 Before you can start making something from carbon fiber, you need to have a mold. The mold shapes the carbon fiber into the form that you want. You can buy molds online, or at other retailers. Carbon fiber parts are popular in automobile and motorcycle industries, and you can often buy molds from suppliers.In some cases, you can use the original part as a mold to make the carbon fiber part. This will not work well if the part is damaged.;
, At a minimum, you should wear protective gloves, goggles, and a face mask. This gear will help prevent the inhalation of potentially fatal fumes or the absorption of harmful solvents through the skin. In addition to the gear, work in an area that is relatively well ventilated to avoid excessive gas build up.
 Before proceeding, the mold should be sprayed with a material that allows the part to separate from the mold once it is finished. These materials are usually a specialized type of wax that does not interfere with the curing process of the part. You can order a mold lubricant online or buy one from a carbon fiber retailer.The wax is not to be confused with the resin. The wax creates a layer between the mold and the resin, and does not harden.
 For best results, make sure that all nooks and crannies of the mold are completely saturated with the resin. Depending on the size of the mold, you may need multiple cans of resin This will create the surface needed to apply the carbon fiber.Unlike the wax, the resin will harden and be removed from the mold as part of the carbon fiber piece.

 You can purchase a dental pick at a local store (e.g. Target, Walgreens, Walmart, etc.). Do not start scraping with the point of the pick. Begin by turning the pick sideways and using a circular motion to remove the dirt and debris. A circular motion is better for your coins than moving he pick up and down or left to right., An X-acto knife can be used to scrape dirt off of your coins. Always use a curved blade instead of a flat blade as flat blades can really damage your coin. Hold the coin in your hand and then use the curved part of the blade to scrape the coin. Be very careful and go slowly when you do this.Use circular motions and keep the blade as flat as possible.
 A microscope, a magnifying glass, or a table magnifier can help you with your mechanical cleaning. This will allow you to see the coin and the details better. Different areas of the coin may need a different tool, and the magnification will allow you to see that. Make sure you have good lighting when you are cleaning., Toothpicks, plastic knives, and soft erasers can be used to clean the coins as well. All of these are made from materials that are softer than your coin so the risk of damage is minimal. Try different tools to see which works best on your coins. Also, wear safety glasses so you do not get any debris in your eyes.Work on a small area of the coin. You can apply a little bit of lubricant (i.e. olive oil) to help loosen the dirt as well.

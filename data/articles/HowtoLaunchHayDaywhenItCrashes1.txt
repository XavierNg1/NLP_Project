, Search for Hay Day in the app store. Look for the game app from the results. If your current version is up-to-date, you will only see the “Open” button beside the app.
 If the app is outdated, you will find an “Update” button instead of “Open.” Tap this button, and Hay Day will be updated to the most recent version. Bug fixes that may resolve the crashing problem may be included in the latest version, so this should alleviate it.
 Once the update is done, close the app store. Look for the Hay Day app on your device and tap on it. You can now play Hay Day again.

 Look in the mirror and practice your facial changes at home. Take note of the way you notice your mood change as you change your face. Remember which tricks make you feel most pleasant so that you can practice them during the day to keep a pleasant expression.Take a pen and clench it in your teeth—imitating a smile. Do you notice yourself feeling happier?
Now take the pen and hold it in your protruding lips—creating a frown. It will create the feeling of being unhappy.
Practice vowel sounds. A long “e” forces a smile, “ah” imitates the expression of surprise. Both of these induce pleasant feelings.
 Notice the tilt of your head. Having a slight tilt to your head is a subconscious sign that you’re engaged and paying attention. This encourages a pleasant disposition.Avoid constantly checking your watch, phone, or how others are reacting.
 You want to have eye contact and crease your eyes. Creasing your eyes is different from squinting—it’s a good thing to practice in the mirror. The most inviting eyes are fully open yet relaxed., Neutral lips or a frown-shaped pout is much less inviting. Keep a small parting of your lips to relax your facial muscles and convey warmth. With your mouth relaxed, turn the corners of your mouth up.
 If you’re forcing a pleasant expression, it can often be picked up on by other people. They’ll become suspicious. The best way to avoid this is to actually feel what you’re portraying. Take time out of each morning to think of reasons you have to be pleasant. Take a moment to appreciate them and carry this feeling throughout the day.

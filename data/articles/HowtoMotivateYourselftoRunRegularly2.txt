 Find someone who is a wonderful person to have a conversation with so that you can really look forward to your runs together. It helps to find someone who is reliable too, and that you make sure to wake yourself up and head out the door on time to meet them; you don’t stand your running partner up in the dark! Find someone to meet up with, and you will rarely miss a run.
 That’s all you have to do. The secret is – you’ll run once you get out the door. You don’t have to run long, but as long as you run a little, you’ll continue to build up the habit.
 Don’t focus on how hard it is, or you’ll never keep doing it. Think about the beauty in the surroundings as you run. Enjoy the quiet and solitude, or the conversation if you have a running partner. Use it for contemplation, for stress relief, for release.

 The only way to lose weight from your cheeks is to lose weight overall. If you slim down, you will slim down on your face too. Many people start to see facial weight loss after trimming down just a few pounds. If you commit to losing weight, you have to improve your diet and consider starting a new exercise routine.


Work on eating three healthy and balanced meals every day. Eat several servings of fruits and vegetables each day, as well as healthy carbs and proteins.
Develop a healthy exercise routine. Working out for just thirty minutes a day can have a dramatic impact on your mental and physical state.
For serious results, you can cut 250 calories out of your diet and burn 250 calories a day. If you do this, you will lose one pound a week.
 Go to the gym and use machine weights, dumbbells, or even your own body weight to keep up your body's lean muscle tissue. Doing strength training will help you preserve muscle all over your body, including your face. And the more muscle you have, the more easily you'll burn fat.
 Some medications can cause you to retain more water. If you're serious about losing weight from your cheeks, talk to your doctor about switching to a prescription that won't make your face puffy. Just make sure that you're not sacrificing any necessary medications for your looks.

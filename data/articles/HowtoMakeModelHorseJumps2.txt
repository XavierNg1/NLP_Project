 You will need to either balance the items in place or use some basic structural supports to keep the jump upright.
 Choose four sturdy twigs of the same size as posts. Choose lots of thin sticks around the same size for the fence material of the jump.

Poke the four post sticks into the ground in pairs at a length that is less than the fence twigs. Keep the paired posts close together, with just enough room to slide in the twigs.
Pile the twigs in, and the posts will hold them in place as they build up to form the jump. Make it as high as you please.
 Simply build up a jump by laying craft sticks one on top of the other to the desired height. You could use rubber bands or twist ties to keep the jump in place if you're worried about knocking it over, Find wood pieces that already look as if they'll make a great jump. You can use them as they are if sufficiently large, or build them into a small wall jump., Keep them in a shoebox or similar container for safe keeping.

 This will only work when commenting on a YouTube video in a Google-owned space like YouTube or Google+. Simply add the time in minute:second format. For example, 2:43 would link to 2 minutes & 43 seconds in the video you are commenting on.

When the comment is posted, it will automatically be made into a link to that time (2 minutes 43 seconds) in the video that you are commenting on. The label of the link will just be "2:43". So you can tell someone "Take a listen at 2:43 to hear what I am talking about". Unfortunately, this does not work in Facebook comments.

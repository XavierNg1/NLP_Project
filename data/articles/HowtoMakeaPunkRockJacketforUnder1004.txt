 From the top side of the jacket, make the hole in the jacket and poke the spike through, or a few tiny ones and poke your pronged stud through. Then flip the jacket over and use your flat head screwdriver to press down the prongs, or screw on the backing of the spike. This is the most time consuming part of creating your jacket!

, Use a thimble to push your heavy duty needle through the tough material, and stitch anyway you want! You can use dental floss, fishing line, or thread the same way.
 Add super glue to the back of the patch before placing it onto your jacket then stitch it down, or safety pin it on. That will help keep the patch in place, and it looks more professional, if you want it to look professional.
 Sometimes, simply using a wet washcloth, or baby oil/olive oil will work.

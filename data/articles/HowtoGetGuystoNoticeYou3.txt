 It can be hard to tell if someone is interested, but you should be able to tell if he makes an effort to spend time with you.


If he initiates conversation and smiles a lot, then there's a good chance that he is interested. That said: many guys get shy when they like someone, and you shouldn't write someone off just because he hasn't made a move.
 This can be anything from a trip to the beach to a house party.
 Some guys like to make the first move, but most will respect a girl who goes for what she wants. Make sure that you get to know him before you ask him out.


It doesn't have to be a fancy proposal. Ask him if he wants to hang out, and have a specific activity in mind: for example, ask him out to a movie, or ask him to a school dance. Some schools hold a "Sadie Hawkins' Dance" or "Sadie's" specifically designed to girls a chance to ask guys.Consider hanging out with him in a group setting before you ask him onto a one-on-one date. This will set the stage and give you a better idea about whether he is interested.
 Wait for the right moment. If you can get him alone, consider asking him one-on-one; you may find that there is much less social pressure when you don't have an audience.


Get to know him before you ask him out. Don't approach him out of the blue; make friends, hang out with him in groups

, If he isn't interested, don't make him uncomfortable. If you've become friends, try to be satisfied with friendship. Either way: continue to be yourself, and good things will follow.


You never know what will happen. Maybe he'll fall for you down the line; maybe you'll fall for one of his friends; maybe you'll meet someone new and wonder why you ever liked the other guy in the first place.
You don't want someone who isn't interested; you want someone who truly likes you for you. Don't sell yourself short. Be true to yourself.

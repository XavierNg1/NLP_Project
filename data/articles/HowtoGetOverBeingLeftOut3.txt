 Forgiveness is more about you than it is about other people. Carrying resentments about people who have hurt your feelings is harmful to your well-being. Therefore, it is beneficial to your happiness and well-being to forgive the people who have hurt you, even if they do not apologize to you.Try writing a letter to the person that you do not send. In the letter, express how being left out made you feel and explain that you want to forgive the person for your own benefit.
 If a group of people have been excluding you on a regular basis, then it may be time to look for some new friends.Real friends do not exclude you. Look for people who will appreciate you for who you are and who will not do things to hurt your feelings, such as leaving you out.


Try joining a special interest club or after-school sports team to meet people who will share your interests.
 Another way to avoid being left out is to take the initiative and invite people to do things with you. Invite your friends to meet you at the mall or to go see a movie with you over the weekend. Or, throw a party and invite everyone, even those who have excluded you in the past.
 It is hard to be left out, but sometimes having time to yourself is a luxury so try to enjoy it if you can. If you are left out and you donâ€™t have anything else to do, then try to do things that you really want to do on your own.


For example, you can read that book you have been dying to check out, finish drawing a self-portrait, take a long bubble bath, or watch one of your favorite movies.

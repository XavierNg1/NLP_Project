 The most important thing to look for in your popper is a unit that feeds in hot air from vents in the side of the popping chamber, as opposed to a grate in the bottom. (One with the single grate in the bottom does not force enough air to keep the coffee from burning and would be a major fire hazard). With this in mind, take a look around the marketplace and see whatâ€™s around. Brands of poppers to look for are 1) Proctor-Silex Popcorn Pumper and Poppery II by West Bend.;

The plastic lid that comes with the unit may be unsuitable for its new role - it might melt, so throw it away.
Extend the chamber to roast larger batches. Glue an extension made from a food tin to the top of the unit using epoxy resin. (See Tips for alternate method.)
Make a simple lid from a kitchen sieve and a flat panel with holes in it (such as pieces of meccano) to collect the chaff.
 You need raw green coffee beans to roast. Luckily there are a lot of places you can get these from. Search the Internet and shop around. Three of many sources are Gen-X Coffee, U-Roast-Em, and Sweet Maria's. (You can insure the future of coffee growers by buying only those beans from sites that support Fair Trade practices).
 While the wafting coffee aroma can be wonderful in small doses, filling the house will soon affect furniture and carpets causing them to emit an unpleasant odor. Ideally, roasting can be done outside.

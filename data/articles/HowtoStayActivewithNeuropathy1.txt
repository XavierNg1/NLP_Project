 Walk outside or on a treadmill. If you haven’t been very active, start out by walking for five to ten minutes per day. Gradually increase your time by adding five minutes to your walk each week. Ideally, you want to walk for 30 minutes a day, three to five times per week.Alternatively, you can break up your 30 minute walks into increments of 10, for example, walk for 10 minutes after each meal.
Make sure to use a cane, walking stick, or walker when you walk if you do not have good balance.;
, Swimming is great for neuropathic patients because it is very low impact, helps control swelling, and regulates blood pressure. Falls are also less of a concern because of the water, so it is safer to do vigorous exercise. It’s an exercise that involves many muscle groups without putting too much strain on the joints. Patients whose pain prevents them from walking or cycling can choose swimming as an alternative.Swim for 30 minutes, three to five times a week.
Water aerobic classes are also great. Find one at your local gym.
 Stationary bicycles are also low impact exercises that are easy on the joints. You can either purchase a stationary bike, or get a gym membership. Bike for 30 minutes, two to three times per week.Stationary bikes cost around $100 to $250. Alternatively, you can purchase a mini exercise bike for $30.

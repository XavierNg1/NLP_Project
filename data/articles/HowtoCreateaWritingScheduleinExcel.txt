 When Excel opens, you'll see a blank workbook.;
, Most versions of Excel open with 3 worksheet tabs at the bottom, labeled "Sheet 1," "Sheet 2" and "Sheet 3." To have a tab for each month, you'll need to add 9 more.


In Excel 2007 and later, click the Insert Worksheet tab to the right of the rightmost worksheet tab. (It displays a small worksheet with a tiny orange starburst to its upper left.) A new numbered tab will appear to the left of the Insert Worksheet tab.
In older versions of Excel, right-click (click your right mouse button) on any tab and select "Insert�" from the pop-up menu. Select "Worksheet" from the options in the Insert menu and click "OK." A new numbered tab will appear to the left of the tab you right-clicked.
You can also add a tab by pressing the Shift and F11 keys on your keyboard. A new numbered tab will appear to the left of the tab whose worksheet was previously displayed.
 The default names of "Sheet 1," "Sheet 2" and so on aren't meaningful names; you'll need to change them to the names of the months. You can do this in one of the following 2 ways.


Double-click on the tab. The tab name will be highlighted, as your cursor changes from an arrow to an insert bar. Type in the new tab name.
Right-click on the tab and select "Rename" from the pop-up menu. The tab name will be highlighted as above. Type in the new tab name.
 On the first (January) worksheet, create the following column headings in the first row of the spreadsheet: Publication, Article Title, Editor, Tasks, Payment, Deadline, Date Sent, Reply Received, Comments.


Most of these headings will spill over past the width of the column. To expand the column width, place your cursor on the divider between two column labels so that it changes to a vertical line with horizontal arrows projecting from it. Double-click your left mouse button and the column width will automatically adjust to fit the title entirely within the column.
Once you have entered the column names, you may want to bold or italicize them to make them stand out from the information in the columns. To do this, select the titles by dragging your cursor through the cells containing the titles. To bold the selected text, click the Bold ("B") button in the Home ribbon menu in Excel 2007 or later or the toolbar in older versions of Excel; to italicize it, click the Italicize (slanted "I") button.
To copy the column headings to each of the other worksheets, select the headings and press the Ctrl and C keys on your keyboard simultaneously. Click each successive tab, and when its worksheet displays, press the Ctrl and V keys simultaneously to paste the headings into each of the other worksheets. (You will have to adjust the column widths to display the entire heading within the column.)

, For the most part, the column headings are self-explanatory, but the following information is provided as suggestions to make the writing schedule easier to use.


If you're working on several articles for the same publication during the same month, list them all together, using one cell in the "Publication" name and successive vertical cells for each article.
If you frequently call or e-mail your editor while working on your assignment, you can list your editor's phone and e-mail in the cells beneath that person's name or insert columns to the right of the name column. (To insert a column, right-click the column to the right of the column where you want the new column to appear beside and select "Insert�" from the pop-up menu. Select "Entire column" from the Insert menu and click "OK.")
Use the Tasks column to break down a lengthy assignment into smaller tasks, such as "Research," "Interview," "Outline" and "Writing." (Do this in the rows beneath the row in which you entered the article's title, rate of pay and deadline.) You can then enter your own deadlines for each task, each earlier than the deadline for the article itself and enter the completion dates in the "Date Sent" field. (If you do this, you may want to bold the deadline date for the article and the date you sent the completed article to your editor.
Use the Comments column to note whether the article was accepted or rejected, if a rewrite was requested and when it was sent or to summarize your editor's comments.
 You can do this by using the Sort dialog. In Excel 2007 and later, you access this by clicking the Sort button on the Data ribbon, while in older versions of Excel, you select the Sort option on the Data menu. Your most likely priorities to sort by are either the deadline for the article or the rate of payment.


To sort the entire worksheet, click the button in the upper left where the row and column labels meet, then access the Sort dialog. Indicate that your data has headers or a header row to exclude it from being sorted, then select either "Payment" or "Deadline" as the column header to sort by. If your version of Excel provides "Sort On" options, choose "Values." If sorting by "Payment," choose "Descending" order ("Largest to Smallest" in Excel 2007 and later); if sorting by "Deadline" choose "Ascending" order ("Oldest to Newest" in Excel 2007 and later).
If you plan to break an article down into smaller tasks, do the sorting before adding the additional tasks, particularly if you prioritize by deadline, as the individual dates will be considered in the sort.
 Use a name such as "Writing Schedule," followed by the year. This way, you can create a new workbook for each subsequent year by doing a "Save As" to create a new workbook for each successive year.

;
, Only a thin coating is needed. This will ensure that the chips do not end up sticking to the tray.
 With the same pastry brush you used to brush your baking tray, hit your tortillas with a neutral cooking oil. If you want to brush both sides, go ahead. There's also another, quicker method for applying the oil:


Brush only one side of a tortilla with oil. Place the oiled-side of the tortilla face up on a cutting board. Oil only one side of another tortilla and place it on top of the previous tortilla, oil-side up again. As you continue to oil your tortillas and stack them, the oil on one side of your tortilla will transfer to the un-oiled side of the next.This leaves you with a stack of perfectly-oiled tortillas: fully-covered but not drenched in oil. Your tortilla chips will be crispy but slightly, deliciously chewy.
 If you have your own idea of how you want to chop your tortillas, go for it. Get creative. Otherwise, tortilla chips are ordinarily cut into either triangles or squares. Here's how to do each:


Triangles: Cut the round tortillas in half to create two semi-circles. Cut one half in half again, and then do the same with each resultant half. Cut the other semi-circle in the same manner.






Squares: Cut off the rounded edges of the tortilla first. This should leave you with a stack of tortillas in the shape of a square. Make two cuts lengthwise, and then make two cuts perpendicularly.
 If possible, place the un-oiled sides of the tortillas facing down so that they come in contact with the oil applied to the tray.
 They are done when their edges lift slightly from the tray and feel crispy. The center of the tortilla chips may still be slightly soft, but should crisp up when it begins to cool.

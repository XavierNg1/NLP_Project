 Don’t wash them before you’re ready to use them, though, as strawberries act like sponges. They absorb water fast, which speeds up spoiling.


Discard strawberries that are bruised, mushy, moldy or not ripe. Keep strawberries that have a deep red color and are plump.
Don’t remove the stem before washing as that way the strawberries will just absorb water.;
, It’s important not to ever soak them in water.


Wash the strawberries under clean running water.
Keep moving them gently with hands making sure each one gets washed.

Rather than being submerged, strawberries need to be given a quick rinse.
 When left wet, berries start going bad fast. Even if they are left wet to air dry, they will absorb the water and taste less sweet.


Let them drain in the colander for a minute.
Pat them dry with a paper towel. Be careful not to damage the fruit.
Alternatively, spread them on a clean kitchen towel and gently rub them dry.

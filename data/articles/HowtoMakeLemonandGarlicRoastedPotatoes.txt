 Wedges are recommended as they are more attractive to serve, as well as will cook more crisply.;
, Mix with clean hands or a large spoon to ensure the flavours are well combined. If the pan is not reliably non-stick, cover the bottom with olive oil before adding your ingredients.
 Ensure the barbecue has a lid, if not, you may improvise using the lid the roasting pan came with (if available), or another roasting tray as a lid. Foil may be used as a lid but is not ideal as it doesn't fit well to the pan and often blows off in the hot air movement of the oven or barbecue.


Ideally the potatoes should stay moist and steam themselves until the end when the lid is removed to crisp them. If they are exposed right at the beginning, the flavours may burn and be bitter by the time the potatoes are tender.
 Lift the lid away from you so any steam comes out in the opposite direction to you. The water should nearly be evaporated and the potatoes forming a golden crust. Stir or turn the potatoes for even browning and to re-coat them in the lemon, garlic and herb oil. Roast for another 15 minutes or until tender. If the potatoes are looking a little dry, add a 1/4 cup of boiling water and if desired, sprinkle with some lemon zest for an extra lemon zing just before serving.
 Ideally remove the roasted lemon portions as while these can be an attractive garnish, they aren't very good to eat. Garnish with fresh lemon wedges and fresh herbs if desired or tomato sauce!

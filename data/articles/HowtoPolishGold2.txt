 Begin by cleaning the gold. Put a gentle dish soap and water onto a soft, clean dishcloth. Gently rub the surface of the gold. Then, rinse off the gold with water and allow it to air dry.
 Pour one-part ammonia and six-parts water into a bowl. Ammonia can be purchased anywhere cleaning products are available, like Walmart. Make sure to wear gloves and be fully clothed when handling ammonia.
 Put the ring into the mixture. Allow it to soak for up to one minute. Do not leave the gold in the mixture for longer than a minute.
 Take the gold out of the ammonia mixture after one minute. Inspect the gold to see if the scratches have been mostly removed. Dry the gold with a tissue or let it air dry. Repeat the process if necessary.

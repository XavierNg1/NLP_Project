 It doesn't have to be perfect, but making the circle perfect is recommended because the face will turn out better. Make sure the circle is big enough to fit in the eyes, nose, and mouth, but not as big as making the drawing a caricature.;
, The neck should be small and slim. It should be right under the head, connected to the circle.
 The collar should connect to the neck. To draw the collar, draw an oval shape around the neck.
 From the tips of the collar, draw a few lines to make the shirt. Make the shirt a little bit long to emphasize Mr.Blabidiboo's body.
 Mr.Blabidiboo's pants are longer then the length of the shirt. There should be space in between his two legs.
 The shoes should be a little bit round. It should be right under Mr.Blabidiboo's pants, leaving no space for socks or anything else.
 It should be bent, and connected with the sleeves of the shirt.
 The hands should be connected with the arms. Mr.Blabidiboo has around three to four fingers.
 Inside the circle, there will be a big space for the facial features. Where the eyes are usually placed, draw two small circles, evenly spaced apart from each other. On the left small circle, draw the pupil facing upward. On the right small circle, draw the pupil facing downward.
 A few spaces below the eyes, the nose should be placed. Mr.Blabidiboo's nose is pointy, the pointy part facing the left.
 It should be in a D shape, the straight line facing the nose, and the curve facing the chin.
 Mr.Blabidiboo's hair is thin and wavy. Draw five wavy strands of hair on top of the head. Don't make the strands thick, because Mr.Blabidiboo is already a grandfather, and he is very old.
 The five strands of hair should be coloured grey. The mouth is colour red, the shirt is colour magenta, and the pants are colour dark blue. The shoes are black, and his skin is colour peach.

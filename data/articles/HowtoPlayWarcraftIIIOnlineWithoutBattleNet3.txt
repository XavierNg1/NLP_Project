 You can download the client from the Garena+ website. Run the install file once the download is complete. The client installation file is about 60MB in size.
 Run the installer once it’s done downloading. The installer runs automatically, you just need to tell it where to install the files. The default location will work for most users. Run the program when the installation is finished.
 If you already have a Garena account, enter it and log in. If you need to make a new account, click the Create an Account link at the bottom of the launcher. Enter a valid email address and create a user name. Garena will check to see if the name is in use. If it is, you will have to pick another name.
 Use your newly-created account to log in to the Garena+ program. Log in with your username, not your email address. Your friend list will open.
 Click the LAN button in the friends list. This will open the Garena+ game browser. Click the Games button, and select Warcraft III from the options. This will open a list of lobbies for Warcraft III. You can select your region in the left-hand menu.
 Click the Menu button in the lower-left corner of the game browser. Select Settings from the menu that opens. In the Game Settings tab, scroll down to Warcraft III. Make sure that the executable is set correctly in the “Executable Settings” field. Click the gear icon to browse for your Warcraft III program files.
 After you’ve configured your game settings, you can join games in the lobby. Click Server List to see available games. Once you join a game, Warcraft II will automatically launch and join the game through the LAN menu.

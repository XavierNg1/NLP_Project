 There are a variety of waterless pet shampoos on the market for cats that can’t stand water. Opt for an all-natural, non-toxic foam shampoo that will not dry out your cat’s skin. Look for a veterinarian recommended brand, or ask your veterinarian for advice about choosing the right product., Choose a time when your cat is relaxed to apply the shampoo. Read the instructions to see how much product to use, then distribute foam evenly throughout your cat’s coat. Massage your cat as you apply the shampoo to keep it calm and content., After distributing the foam evenly through your cat’s coat, remove any excess foam with your fingers and wash your hands. Brush the remaining shampoo through your cat’s coat with a pin brush. No rinsing is necessary.

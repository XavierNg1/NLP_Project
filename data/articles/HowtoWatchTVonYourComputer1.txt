 Streaming TV sites often have a large number of ads, and you will find it much easier to find the right links by installing an ad-blocking extension for your browser.


AdBlock is one of the most popular ad-blocking extensions, and is available for Firefox and Chrome. It is not available for Internet Explorer.;
, There are a variety of sites online that allow you to watch live streaming TV without the need for a subscription. Because of the dubious legality of these services, you will likely need to sift through several different streams and endure a few popup ads to find what you want. Popular streaming TV sites include:


TubePlus
AllMyFaves
Stream2Watch
Many live streaming sites are usually primarily focused on sports, though you can find sites that host videos of all the episodes of your favorite shows.
 Most streaming sites are organized by category, though many have search functions as well. Browse the categories until you find a channel or program that you want to watch.


The availability will vary from site to site.
 When you select a program or channel, you will often be given several options for streams. These are the feeds you can select for watching your program. Oftentimes these are taken down due to legal requests or poor connections, so you may have to try several before you can find one that works.


Often these feeds are actually hosted on different sites, so you may be required to connect to several different sites before you can find a working stream.
 When you select a stream, and ad will usually be playing over the video player. You will need to wait for the ad to finish, and then click the “X” in the corner to close it. You may have to close multiple ads to see the video.
 Many local sites will stream their original content on their website at the same time it airs on TV. This is usually just the news, but you may be able to find some additional programming.

 Not all notes can be bent on the harmonica. Only holes one through six can be bent when drawing air through the instrument. You may find that you have better luck with one hole over another, but with enough practice, you should be able to bend notes freely.


Some holes bend more than others. If you aren't able to bend some notes as much as others, don't worry. This is natural.
The numbers on your harmonica should be on its mouthpiece, above each hole., Since you can only bend a single note at a time when playing the harmonica, you'll have to practice your lip or tongue blocking until you can consistently sound a single note. You should do this by drawing air into the instrument, and not blowing., As you inhale to play your single note on the harmonica, you should alternate between the sounds "Eee" (like the vowel in bee) and "Ooo," (like the vowel in shoe) without breaking or pausing between those vowel sounds. This trick can oftentimes help beginners get a feel for bending notes.


Your jaw should lower when you transition from the "Eee" to the "Ooo" sound.
Another vocalizing technique that might help you uses the sounds "Tee" and "Two." Create these by striking the roof of your mouth close to your teeth when transitioning between the hard "Eee" and "Ooo" vowels.You can also use this inner mouth T-strike to give punch to your harmonica playing.
 Bending is largely intuitive. Once you learn how to bend notes on the harmonica, you'll likely develop an instinct for this technique that will help you master the other draw bends more quickly. Remember to be patient with yourself as you learn. After all, bending notes is an advanced technique.

Make sure to get a few extra caps from your vet's office., It's important to blend the food so it flows easily into the feeding tube. If your food remains solid and chunky, purchase a higher quality blender. Tube feeding will not be successful if you cannot get the food to the right consistency.Ask your vet for blender recommendations.

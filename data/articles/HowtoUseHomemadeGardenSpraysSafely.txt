 Always use containers that are clean and intact. Do not use containers with cracks, split parts or loose parts.;
, Given that the contents of some organic sprays are more toxic when concentrated than the plant in its original state, do not use your cooking pots and pans to make organic garden sprays. Visit the thrift store and buy a pot for this purpose and write clearly with a permanent marker "Spray-Making Pot - Do Not Cook With" on the side.
 This is probably the most important aspect of storing any garden spray. If everyone knows what the container contains, they are immediately aware of how to deal with it. It also helps you to remember long after you have a made it. Your labelling should include:

Date of manufacture






Ingredients






Use instructions (can be as simple as "spray on roses"






Any relevant warnings and medical advice







, As with any gardening product, keep well out of the reach of children and pets. A lockable cupboard is the best option.
 Always cover up when using an organic garden spray. This will protect your skin from contact with what may be an allergen for you. While the plant may not affect you in its normal state, when concentrated, you might suffer a reaction if it gets on your skin.
 It is important to never inhale anything sprayed in the garden, organic sprays included. Spray away from your face area and stand to one side of the spraying. Do not spray on days of high wind or heat. If you are concerned and suffer from allergies, rashes etc., it may pay to don mask and safety glasses when spraying.
 Do not overdo spraying - even organic, low-toxicity sprays can be overkill for a plant if you use too much. It can also harm surrounding plants and beneficial insect life, and possibly harm pets, so stick to the usage guidelines.
 Wear gloves when handling and using organic sprays. And it still pays to always wash your hands at the end of every gardening session.

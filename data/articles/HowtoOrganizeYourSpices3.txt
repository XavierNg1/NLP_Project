 Fresh spices typically last only a few days. When organizing spices according to their shelf life, it’s best to use those that are freshest first. By placing spices that will “expire” soon in an easy-to-reach place, you increase the chance that you’ll actually use them.Bay leaves, basil, celery seeds, and most other fresh spices last five to seven days.
Fresh chives and mint generally last seven to 10 days.
Herbs, too, tend to age quite poorly. Make use of them as quickly as possible.
Dried flowers, zested citrus, and flowers should be tossed after about three months.
 Most of your spices are probably in their ground or dried forms. These spices don’t really go bad – they just lose their force of flavor. Some spices do this faster than others. Generally, spices lose flavor after one to three years.Powdered spices that tend to lose their flavor quickly include black pepper, ginger, and turmeric.
Seasoning blends often lose potency after just one or two years.If you purchase prepackaged spices, you might get a “use by” date on the container. Use this date to guide your organizational process.
There’s no way to determine exactly how long a particular spice will be effective. Flavor retention depends on storage conditions, temperature, and the inherent properties of the spice itself.
 Whole spices tend to stay fresh and usable for the longest time. Store your whole black peppercorns, mustard seeds, whole cloves, cinnamon sticks, and so on in airtight containers toward the back of your pantry or in an equally out-of-the-way place.Whole spices stay fresh for about four years.Extracts, too, have shelf lives of about four years (except for vanilla extract, which has an unlimited shelf life).

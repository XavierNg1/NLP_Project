 Before running out to the market, make a list of all of the meals that you wish to prepare for the week. Try to incorporate some of the ingredients that you plan to purchase for one meal into the making of other meals, making one ingredient available for more than one dish. For example, left over Italian bread from last night’s dinner can easily make a tasty French toast the following morning.
 Marketing strategies are used in an effort to try to tempt you into buying a product that you do not need. Avoid being enticed into a purchase that is not on your shopping list.


Making a list based only on the meals you plan to make for the week will help you save money when shopping—you will buy only what you need.

 Think of it as a new room. How would you like to live in it? Grab a piece of paper and sketch out how you'd like your room to look like. Start with the basics like a Clothes Space, a School Space, a Sleeping Space, etc. Different spaces are devoted to different activities. Next, write down any other spaces you would like to create for the things you like. For example, a Music Space, a Reading Space, etc. You might not have room now, but this might change.;
, Make sure all of your junk is removed from the room and put out into the room for organization. This includes the closet and bathroom (if you have your own) too.
 This "stuff" wastes a ton of space that you can use for other Spaces like a cozy Reading Space!

, Hang up all of your clean clothes in your closet.
 Get some containers, they can be from the store or just old shoe boxes you have. Separate your stuff in the containers such as maybe one container for hair stuff or one for pencils. The pencils one could be in a funky jar. Speaking of drawers; drawers also make great containers to put your stuff in. Just remember; everything should have a home.
 Remember to hang most of your clothes up so you can always see the choices you have. You can organize them by color, style, or season! Another great idea is to hang a billboard up in your closet and you can hang your jewelry or purses! It works great for girls!

, Always keep it organized by having a monthly tune-up session. Once a month, clean up your room.

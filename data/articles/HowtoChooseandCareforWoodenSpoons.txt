 When selecting your wooden spoon, always look for those made from hardwood. These spoons will be stronger and more durable than ones made from pine or other softwoods. Softwood wooden spoons will crack, split, and can absorb aroma and moisture too easily.


If you're not sure what type of wood the spoon is made of, ask.
Think about supporting a local craftsperson who has made such spoons; they will undoubtedly use quality hardwood, the finishing will be lovelier than mass-produced ones, and you'll be helping to keep their craft alive.;
, The best way to wash a wooden spoon is to clean it immediately after use, using warm, soapy water. Don't use abrasive cleaning sponges on it, just the soft sponges.


Stand wooden spoons up to air dry. They should be thoroughly dry before you put them away.
 Wooden spoons can be kept in the drawer, preferably with other wooden and soft utensils. Avoid storing with metallic utensils as they might dent the wood. Alternatively, store the spoons standing up in a utensil container â€“ this can be a particularly effective look in a country-style kitchen.
 Wooden spoons are great for the following:

Stirring hot meals like risotto, soups, sauces, stews, and stir-fries






On non-stick pots and pans






For mixing cake and other batter in the mixing bowl.

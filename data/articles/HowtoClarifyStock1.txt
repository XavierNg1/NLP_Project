 As you let your stock simmer, the fat will rise to the top creating a foamy buildup.


If there is an excess of foam or fat buildup, it’s possible that you have your heat turned too high. Stock needs to be slowly simmered over a long period of time, not boiled.
Typical stocks should be simmered anywhere from 4 to 6 hours long.;
, You can do this while your stock simmers in multiple intervals to cut down on the amount of fat you will need to strain later on.Stirring the fat into the stock will make it harder to remove later and give your stock a cloudy appearance.You can do this with a wooden or heat safe spoon.
 You can purchase a sieve or colander and cheesecloth at most grocery stores. Line the sieve with cheesecloth and drain your stock through it. This should separate the large pieces of bone and vegetables from the clear stock.


Make sure to do this over the sink in case there is spillage.
You can also use a colander instead of sieve.
Do not push down on the food at any time while you are draining it.If you don’t have cheesecloth you can use a coffee filter., Filter your stock again. This second filtering should remove most of the fat that remains in your stock.

 In this alternative form of treatment, needles are used to stimulate acupuncture points. Two points, PC5 and PC6, are targeted in particular. These points are located near each other, just above the wrist crease.The stimulation of these points is thought to reduce pressure and swelling in the area that leads to pain and numbness.
 In this alternative treatment procedure, low level lasers are applied along the course of the median nerve to relieve the patient of the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. It is hypothesized that laser light can penetrate deeply in the tissues where it has a “photo-bio-simulative effect”. It is also believed to improve cellular repair by stimulating the immune and circulatory system.A medical practitioner with expertise in low level laser therapy will usually perform this therapy. The session is done once to see if it will be effective for you; if the symptoms subside, it can be done at least once every two to four weeks.
 Another alternative treatment to carpal tunnel syndrome is the performance of yoga routines, specifically those routines that focus on upper body postures and awareness of proper structural alignment and focuses on opening, stretching, and strengthening of the joints of the upper body.A beneficial yoga program for carpal tunnel syndrome would be a 1 to 1.5 hour session twice a week for a period of two months.

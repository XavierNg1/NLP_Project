 To make rag curls you will need small pieces of fabric, about four or five inches long and about an inch wide. How many you need will depend on how tight of a wave you want.









Begin with twelve strips, six for the top layer of your hair, six for the bottom.Cutting up an old pillowcase or old shirt can be an economical way to get fabric.
 You will have six rag curls that go around the crown of your head, then another six that go a little below. This means you’ll have two sections of hair on each side and two sections at the back in your first layer of curls.









Pull a small handful of hair away from your face. If you divide the side of your head into quarters, it will be one quarter of that hair.
 Place the rag at the tip of your hair and begin rolling under. At first it will be tricky and the tip will want to come out. Keep tucking it back in and roll your hair upward.


Watching what you’re doing in the mirror will help as you’re first learning.
 Take the two ends of fabric and tie them together to secure the curl. You will want the knot to be snug enough that it will not come out as you sleep, but not so tight that you cannot untie it the next day.
 Allow the hair to dry overnight by sleeping with the damp rag curls. In the morning, undo the knots to release loose waves.









Run your fingers through your hair to turn ringlets into waves. Do not use a comb or brush as this creates frizz.
Apply hairspray to set the waves if you have hair that easily loses body.
 If you struggle with using rags to curl your hair, purchase foam curlers instead. The process is exactly the same, only instead of tying a rag to set the curl you will instead clip a plastic cross-bar or special pin.


Some people find sleeping on curlers to be uncomfortable or difficult.
Remember that the size of the curler will determine how loose or tight the waves are. Big curlers make loose waves.

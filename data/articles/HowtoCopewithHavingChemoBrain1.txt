 Keep a planner or daily organizer. In your planner you can write down things you need to do for the day, events, birthdays, and other reminders.


Consider using your cell phone as a planner. If you have a smart phone, you can set audio-visual reminders for tasks that you need to complete.;
, Chemo brain makes it difficult to remember tasks, so a to-do list can help you stay on track. To-do lists would ideally be written in your planner or on your cell phone. It is best to keep all important information in one place so you donâ€™t get mixed up.


Create a to-do list in the evening for the following day. Write down any calls or errands that need to get done.
Consider writing a to-do list in a very visible place in your home. The downside is that you have to take the list with you when you leave, and remember to put it back up when you get home!

, Record addresses, phone numbers, or any important information immediately. Write these notes in your planner, cell phone, or a sticky note.


Keep a message board in your home. Place your message board near the phone or on the refrigerator. That way you and your family will know exactly where to find and write urgent messages.
 Since chemo brain affects the memory, it is helpful to keep your belongings organized. Create a specific place for your keys, wallet, laptop, medications, and any other important items. Remember to put things back in their designated spot after use.


Put a basket at your front door for your keys, cell phone, and wallet.
Put medications or supplements in a place where you will take them. For example, keep supplements on the kitchen counter if you take them before breakfast.

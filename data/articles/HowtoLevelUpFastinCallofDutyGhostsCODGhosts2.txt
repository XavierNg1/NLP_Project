 During online matches, you will gain more XP when you kill an enemy in a killing spree. That is called Buzz kill and it awards you with 150 XP.


You can check the online game ranking to identify enemies who are most likely to be in a kill streak. They are mostly on top of the chart.
 Using or deploying kill streak rewards automatically grants you additional XP. That being said, it is advisable for you to have low-tiered kill streak rewards so that you can easily achieve them.


Some of the low-tiered yet effective kill streak rewards are SAT COM, Guard Dog, and I.M.S.
For beginners, since stringing kills can be a bit difficult, choosing Support Strike Package instead of Assault Strike Package helps.
 Sometimes some players get together and setup their own private matches meant for boosting. Mostly, this is invite only but if you can get access to these lobbies, you will surely be having a good time ranking up with other players.


You can also host your own private game session and invite other players to join in.

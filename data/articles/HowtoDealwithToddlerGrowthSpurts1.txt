 Growth spurts often lead to troubled sleep for a long stretch of time (usually weeks) while your baby quickly gains weight and grows. Growth spurts occur at any time but may also happen specifically during the third, sixth, 12th, 24th and 36th week after birth. While growing, your baby might act as if he is in a fog because he is not getting the sleep he needs.


Luckily there are ways you can help your baby sleep better, as described in the following steps.;
, Your toddler’s body grows mostly at night while he sleeps, so it is a good idea to let your child sleep as much and as long as he can. Don’t wake him up to feed him; just let him keep sleeping.If you notice that your child’s nightly sleeping patterns are being disrupted, consider changing his napping schedule during the day. This will be discussed at length in the following step.
 If you let your child sleep too long in the day, he may be too restless and stimulated at night to stick to his normal sleeping pattern. Playing soothing music may help your child to fall into a short nap more quickly.


If your child seems to not need a nap during the day, then let him just keep going through his day without a nap. This may help him to sleep better at night.
 You can engage in activities that keep him stimulated during the day so that when it comes to sleeping time at night, he will be less stimulated and more likely to sleep. Being active during the day may also help him to sleep through the entire night. However, do not overstimulate your child right before bed, as this could lead him to have a hard time falling asleep. Suggestions for afternoon and evening activities include:


An afternoon walk or bike ride through the park.
A calming activity in the early evening such as drawing, story time, or listening to his favorite music.

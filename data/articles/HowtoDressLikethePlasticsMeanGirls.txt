 This being said, have lots of tank tops in different colors. Some colors you must have are: white, black, pink, brown/grey. Once you get those you should go get more colored ones. You also need to buy lots of different colored sweaters and cardigans to go with your tank tops.;
, If it's really hot and you want to put it up, just put it in a complicated looking braid or a pretty updo! But normally you should wear your hair wavy, in ringlets/curls (Gretchen), or perfectly straight on your back (Regina). The only exception to the ponytail rule is if you're playing a sport or in Gym Class.
 You must wear pink on Wednesdays. Wear either a pink shirt, skirt/shorts, OR a belted pink sundress. A good option is a pink shirt and white bottoms, with pink and neutral accessories. Don't wear everything pink or you'll look like a little girl playing dress-up!

, If they're not with you take a picture of it on your phone and send it to them.
 You need lots of skirts. Two essentials are a black pencil skirt and a white mini or pencil skirt. You can wear printed or bright colored jeans any day, as long as they're not normal blue jeans, but never ever wear track pants on a day other than Friday. You also shouldn't wear athletic shorts except for Fridays, Gym class, and sports.

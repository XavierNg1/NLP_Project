 If you're out of other cleaners, vinegar and window cleaners can work on carpet, too. Work with 2 parts water to 1 part vinegar or window cleaner. If you are using vinegar, add a drop or two of dish soap or laundry detergent into the mix for added odor-fighting power.
 Using a brush or a sponge, scrub the affected area with your solution. If you're using vinegar, the smells will be pretty potent, but they all will go away in time.
 Once you're sure you've gotten the entire area, walk away. You've done all you can do! Let it set for an hour or two, taking action on those smells and the residue.
 Once it's started drying, it's time to vacuum it up with your dry/wet vac. If that's not an option, soak up the liquid with a dry towel. Constantly apply pressure, forcing the liquid into the towel.


If any soapy residue remains, take a damp cloth and gently blot the area. Then take a dry cloth to it and resume the process as normal.
The smell may linger while it's still wet; trust that it will go away when it dries!

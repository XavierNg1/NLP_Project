C5 - Moving the Queen Bishop pawn two spaces forward is defining move of the Sicilian Defence. This aggressive first move is strong, because if an exchange occurs with white's queen pawn, than black's centre pawns still remain in play, while black is structurally weak. This move also avoids symmetry with white.
 The main advantage of this move is it clears the king side pieces in order to perform an early kingside castle. It is also strong as it controls one of the centre squares.
D6 - This logical move forms a pawn chain and stops e5 chasing the knight

, However, 3.d4 is more aggressive and best.
G6- The final move of the pawn formation. This move sets black up to complete a king side Fianchetto; finishing their defences and setting themselves up for a strong queen side attack.

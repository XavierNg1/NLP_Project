 This method will align the text midway between the top and bottom margins on the page. To start, highlight the text the same way as you would if you were aligning it horizontally (see method above).


If you haven't typed anything yet, skip this step. When you're done, the text that you type will be centered vertically.
 Follow these directions:Click "Page Layout" in the upper toolbar (to the right of the "Home" tab that's selected by default).
Click the "Page Setup" button.
In the window that pops up, click the "Layout" tab.
 In the tab you just selected, look for the "Vertical Alignment" box. Select "Center."

, Clicking "OK" will change the alignment and return you to your document. If you like, you can use the options under "Apply to" to change which parts of your document are centered vertically.


For example, if you have highlighted text that you want to center vertically, be sure to choose the "Selected text" option from the "Apply to" menu.

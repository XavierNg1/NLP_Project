 Floral centerpieces give off a sense of elegance. At each table during the reception, have a floral centerpiece set out that matches your wedding colors. Elegant colored flowers dotting each table will create a classic, graceful vibe for the reception.You can have one big centerpiece on each table or have a series of smaller centerpieces congregated throughout longer tables.
 Candles give off a nice elegant vibe. Try placing candles on tables or near the food buffet. Use elegant colors, like ivories, whites, and light shades of pink, purple, and blue. For extra elegance, use intricate, attractive candle holders, like crystal candle holders.
 Instead of going for the traditional bride and groom wedding topper, pick something with an extra touch of elegance. For example, you could have a word like "Love" spelled out in sparkly, gold lettering or have a topper in the shape of something like a heart on your cake., Umbrellas can give off a classic, graceful feel and work particularly well for a vintage wedding. If you want to add some elegance, invest in umbrellas. Have umbrellas hovering over tables at the reception. This will both provide guests with shade and add a touch of elegance.Incorporate your wedding colors. If your colors are ice blue and light pink, for example, choose umbrellas in these colors.
 Lanterns can add a lot of elegance to a wedding reception. This can help especially if your reception falls near nighttime. Instead of using lamps, have lanterns set up around the room to provide light. You can also place a small lantern on each table at the reception area.

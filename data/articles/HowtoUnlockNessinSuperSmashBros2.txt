 A Brawl is simply a match with 2-4 people. You find it right in the main menu to the upper left. Play five matches of any type, mode, or character group and you'll get to fight Ness. Beat him to unlock him., You can use a variety of characters to do this, the easiest being Fox, who's Down+B move reflects any projectiles shot at him. Once you've reflected 10, across any mode, you'll get the chance to fight Ness., If you lose, you can simply play another round of Brawl to get another chance. Ness is small, with a dangerous grab, but he has low range on almost all of his attacks that makes him easy to beat. Use your speed and A attacks to weaken him for an easy kill., This single-player mode is a great way to unlock characters quickly. You won't even have to fight against Ness to get him! To get Ness, you must get to and beat the level "Subspace."

This level is pretty far along in the game, almost at the end. It is usually faster to use the other two methods to get Ness instead.

 Get it as flat and smooth as you can on a level surface. Missing any wrinkles now will cause them to become more pronounced after being folded and stored.


Smoothing out some sweater materials may be more challenging than others.
 Take one arm and fold the arm over the face of the sweater, towards the other side of the sweater. Grab the cuff of that arm and fold it back over the face of the sweater, towards the side that the arm is on. Do the same for the other sleeve. 








Try to keep the edge of the sleeve flush with the edge of the sweater.
 Take the hem and start to roll the sweater upwards, towards the neck. Stop the roll when it reaches the neck of the sweater.









Don't make your roll too loosely as it may come undone.
 Take one end of the sweater and bring it over to meet the other. The fold will be directly in the center of the sweater.









Use this method to fold the sweater into small storage spaces.
Some larger sweaters might need to be folded more than once.

 The yolks of hard boiled eggs can produce sulfur and related chemicals that react with the copper to change the color to a darker brown or black. While this method will take longer and may not produce as dramatic results as using liver of sulfur, you do not need any equipment other than hard boiled eggs and a sealed container.;
, Use two or three eggs for copper jewelry, or more if you have larger or multiple items. Place the eggs in a pot of boiling water and let them sit for at least ten minutes. The over-boiled sulfurous smell and greenish ring around the yolk are good indicators that the eggs will darken your copper.
 Use a spoon or other utensil to break the eggs into pieces. If the container you will be using is a bag, it may be tidier to place the eggs inside it first.
 Try not to have the eggs touch the copper if you want to avoid colored spots on your copper.Instead, place the copper objects on a small dish or on the other side of the container.
 Fasten the lid or seal the plastic bag. The container must be airtight in order for the gases produced by the egg to become concentrated enough to affect the copper.
 Depending on the freshness of the eggs and the quantity of eggs used, you could start to see results within twenty minutes or several hours. Check back every half hour to an hour, or if you want your copper to become much darker, leave it overnight.
 Use a clean cloth to wipe off excess color if the copper became too dark, or if you want to create a more variable, less even effect.

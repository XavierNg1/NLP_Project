 On your Status page, tap the Add Status button in the upper-right corner. Then, tap and hold the white circle at the bottom of your screen to record video.


Alternatively, you can select a video from your Camera Roll at the bottom of your screen.
 The video strip will be at the top of your page. Drag the left edge to where you want your video to start, and the right edge to where you want it to end.


If you're working with a long video, you might face a restriction on the maximum length that you can add to your Status. This upper limit for a video is usually 30 seconds.
 This will upload your video as an animated GIF image file when you add it to your Status. Your video will look the same, but the file format will be changed.


Tap on it again to change it back.

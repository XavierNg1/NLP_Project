 A Diamond Sword is highly recommended. Wooden or stone tools are not.;
, This makes it teleport away and just completely rage, and it could get the first hit. Hit him first.
 Hide in a very close tree; there probably will not be one though. Then, make sure leaves or a block covers the Enderman's head. Hit him in the feet. He will not teleport.
 Endermen are less likely to teleport away if you are hitting their feet (the bottom of their legs).
 You should fill your hunger bars. Full hunger bars, or 90% full or more, will heal you slowly.
 Make sure you have full hearts.
 Diamond is recommended.
 You might lose some hunger bars.
 It could run out. You could instead bring multiple damaged armour/swords, if you have them.
 Put cobblestone right above your head, as low as possible. Like #3, but this is better because, well, trees don't spawn everywhere you want 'em to. Cobblestone is highly recommended, because Endermen cannot take cobblestone and cobblestone is probably the easiest block to get that they will not take. These basic blocks they will pick up: Grass block, dirt and sand. They even pick up gold blocks, diamond blocks, iron, melon blocks, pumpkins, TNT, clay, gravel, glass blocks/panes, stained glass blocks/panes, red sand, podzol and gravel.
 A buddy will make it much easier to kill mobs. Note: If you have your friend (or even brother/sister/relative) in your house, open to LAN by doing this: In your single player world, press Esc on your keyboard > Open to LAN > Start LAN World. Your friend/relative must be on a computer linked to your computer's network.

 The American Girl Doll typically costs over $100. Go to their website, find which one you want, and write down how much it costs. That's the amount of money you need to obtain.


Add any accessories to that cost. Beware about getting too many accessories, though. The price will quickly rise.
Shipping will cost about an additional $13, but you can try to convince your parents to pay for that.;
, Look in your wallet, check your piggy bank, and search the cracks of your couch for change. Once you have all your money, subtract that from the total cost of the doll you want. That's your target!


Say you find that you have $28.50 and the doll you want with its accessories is $120. That means you'll have to raise $91.50.
 That way you'll always know how close you are to earning your American Girl Doll, and you'll feel a sense of progress. It may take a while, so be patient.


Remember to subtract anything you buy from your total.
Keep your money in a safe place. Put it in a jar and hide it somewhere like in your dresser or desk drawer. That way your brother or sister can't find it, and it's less tempting to spend it.
 The key to saving is not spending. You've made a goal to save enough for an American Girl Doll. Don't waste your money on small things you don't want as much.

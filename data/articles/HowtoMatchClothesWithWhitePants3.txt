 This is a great way to show off your longer, slender legs. Matching a loose top with tight pants will let you flaunt your bottom half while wearing a fun and flouncy top.


To show off your legs even more, throw on some strappy heels. The higher they are, the more they'll do the trick.
 Choose a tunic in a solid color or a simple pattern, and tie a sash or belt around your natural waist. If the tunic doesn't have a pattern around the neck, wear a long, fun necklace. If it does, try a simple pair of earrings to accentuate your look.


Wrap the look together with a pair of narrow heels.
 Choose a blouse in a solid neutral color to create an elegant look. Accessorize with silver or gold jewelry, depending on the shade of white pant and on the color of your blouse. Wear it with a nice pair of simple close-toed heels.
 The white camisole can be more cream-colored or off white and will will still look great with a pair of white jeans. Just put it all together by wearing an open button-down brown or black sweater that falls at mid-thigh. Pair this look with close-toed heels that are the same color as the sweater.

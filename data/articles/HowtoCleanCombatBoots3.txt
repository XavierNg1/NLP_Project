Blot the entire interior of each boot to remove as much soap and water as possible., Allow boots to air dry naturally. If possible, clean them at night allow them to dry completely overnight. Avoid drying boots near a heat source (e.g. heating vent) as the materials can warp., Moisture inside your combat boots can leave a persistent bad odor.

 Another way to make a firefly jar without actual fireflies is by coating the inside of a jar with glow stick liquid. Acquire a glass jar with a resealable lid, such as a mason jar. Clean and dry the jar, inside and out.Crack glow sticks to activate them. Cut off one end and empty them into your jar. Use several different colors, but add them one at a time.
Try to avoid direct contact with the liquid from a glow stick. That said, the liquid is considered non-toxic and will only cause mild skin irritation. Wash it off with soap and water if contact occurs
If a substantial amount of the liquid somehow gets in someone's mouth or eyes, flush with water and contact poison control.
 Glitter will both reflect and refract the light in the jar, creating an ambient, magical effect. Add a bit of glitter and swirl the jar in between each time you add liquid from another glow stick. You can also simply add as much glitter as you want at any point, but doing so incrementally helps the glitter mix with the glowing liquid.Different colored glitter may add a further layer of color and complexity to your jar.
 Once you’ve added as many glow sticks and as much glitter as you want, cap the jar and carefully shake it with both hands. Continue shaking until the glowing liquid and glitter is dispersed evenly on the inside walls of the jar.For a smaller jar, a half dozen glow sticks may be plenty. For larger jars, you may want to use as many as a dozen glow sticks.
 The jars will glow the brightest as soon as they are made, and will slowly lose their glow. Try making a few and placing them in the corners of a dark room for an especially enjoyable lighting effect.For maximum appeal, place the jars near a blacklight. Blacklight can also be used to “recharge” a glow stick firefly jar.
Aside from novelty shops, light bulb retailers, and online, you can also find handheld blacklight bulbs and fixtures at pet supplies stores.

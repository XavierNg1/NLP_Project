 A nice way to decorate fabric headbands is to use fabric paint. You can either decorate them free style or use fabric stencils.


Fabric stencils allow you to paint letters onto the fabric, so you can spell out cute words like "Love" or "Star" or "LOL" or even your name.
Just cover the stencil in the fabric paint and press it firmly onto the headband. Use a small paint brush to carefully fill in any gaps in the paint.
To add a little bit of glitz to the headband, you can shake some glitter onto the fabric paint while it's still wet.
 A cute and easy way to decorate a fabric headband is just to attach a bunch of colored feathers.


Take a selection of three feathers and hold them at the stems. Fan the feathers out slightly.
Use a a dab of hot glue to attach the bunch of feathers to one side of the fabric headband, just above where your ear will be.
If you like, you can glue a large sequin or pin a brooch over the stems of the feathers to cover them up.
 You can make some simple but cute flower attachments for a fabric headband using felt.


Take a square of felt and trace out a flower shape (using a stencil of necessary). Trace out two more flower shapes, each one slightly smaller than the last.
Sit the smallest flower inside the medium flower and the medium flower inside the biggest flower and use some hot glue or a couple of basic stitches to secure.
Glue a crystal, button or pearl into the center of the flower, then glue the flower onto the headband.
You can leave it at a single flower or you can make more to cover the entire headband.
Alternatively, you can just cut the tops off of some fake plastic flowers and glue those to the headband instead.

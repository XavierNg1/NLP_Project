 When you did your budget, you set aside a specific amount of money for your travel. Learn whether it makes financial sense to pay in cash or with a credit or debit card.


Check with your credit cards and banks before you use them overseas. They might charge you to convert currency, and it might save you money to pay with your card rather than using it to withdraw cash from ATMs.
 Centrally located hotels are often more expensive. Use online travel sites such as Hotwire, Priceline, Expedia and Kayak to look for hotels that fit your budget.


Consider alternative lodging such as hostels and bed & breakfasts. You might also want to try camping or apartments and homes that offer reduced prices on long term rentals.
Stay with friends and relatives whenever you can. If someone you know is willing to put you up, take advantage of the offer and save some money.



Be frugal by eating at a few good restaurants, and spending the rest of your food money on items you can pick up in grocery stores or farmer's markets.
 Many cities and destinations have bus tours that you can hop on and hop off. Sites such as Viator offers inexpensive sightseeing opportunities and lists the most affordable tours to take.
 You may want to buy 1 or 2 special items, but do not spend a lot of money on things.

 Sarepia Forest isn't recommended, clanners would gobble you up. You could drown in Crystal Sands. Probably the best place is Appondale, not to hot and not to cold, it is more or less a good hamster habitat. Jamaa Township works too, though don't pick the middle. Choose a place near the fountain and pillow room entrance. You also might want to live in a shop or small building. Outback Imports is recommended and the Flag Shop as well. Members can even use their dens as that the Enchanted Hollow is underground, large, cozy and makes a perfect hamster burrow! You might get lonely in your den though, so consider taking your hamster family along with you.;
, Eat kibble, run from foxes and wolves, clean yourself, take a nap. Do what wild hamsters do! You could advertise "If you want to be in a hamster family go to ___" You could put your home or Members can put their den (enchanted hollow).

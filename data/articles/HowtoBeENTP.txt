 If you are ENTP, then you most likely are known by your friends to be filled with information and ideas. Channel this into useful purposes, and do not always start with blueprints and plans. ENTP people mostly come up with these as they go along, but as a warning, this trait can easily backfire.;
, ENTP people often have witty senses of humour and are avid debaters. They will suffer if not around other people, because they thrive in large social environments.
 A cognitive function is a part of the hierarchy of the personality system, and the SI function keeps the ENTP person together. All ENTP people have a dislike for rules and for organized society, but being a complete nonconformist will not work. You must choose a sensible boundary between being absolutely submissive to authoritarians and being a rebel.
 True ENTPs regard "that can't be done" as a personal challenge to succeed. All ENTP people have an animus that drives them on even in the face of great problems.
 ENTP people account for only 2-5% of the population; if you are one, you are likely to achieve great things. The problem, unfortunately, is that many ENTP people, despite being pragmatists, are easily distracted and not hard working. This is something that is difficult to get past, but the more that you force yourself to work without distractions nearby, the better chance you will have of success.
 Because of the ENTP's skill in many types of analysis, they often see things in social relationships that are ignored by everyone else. You must keep in mind, however, that all motives, even if you have good intuition, are not what they seem.
 Many great people such as Nicola Tesla, Walt Disney, and Thomas Edison were ENTPs. Your gregariousness combined with your intellect makes you a likely candidate to succeed in life!

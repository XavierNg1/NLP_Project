 Fortunately, not all candy will wreck a healthy-eating plan or lead to a sugar crash. Dark chocolate, for instance, actually has health benefits, when eaten in moderation.Whenever you’ve got the option, go dark. Since it’s often more flavorful, it can do a better job of satisfying that candy craving, too.
In particular, dark chocolate covered fruit can both satisfy your sweet tooth, as well as the parts of your brain that tell you you’re sated.
 Another way to nip a candy craving right in the bud is by having a Jolly Rancher, or another hard candy. The main benefit here is that you’ll be consuming less calories and sugars than other candies, and since they take longer to melt in your mouth, you’ll likely wind up eating less candy., Chances are, you’ll find yourself (and your kiddos) chewing a few different candies before the night is through. This is totally fine, if you can keep it under control. One of the best ways to do so is share in your child’s excitement with them. Lay down on the floor and help them sort their candy when you get.


This will also help you ensure that only safe items got into their stash.
Tell them beforehand that they’re allowed to have a certain number of pieces tonight by saying something like, “Nice haul Timmy! I know you’re probably pretty excited. As you sort, think about which three pieces you want to eat tonight and which you want to save for other days.”
Set a limit for yourself too, by deciding early in the evening and reminding yourself throughout the night with thoughts like, “Alright, I’m only eating three pieces tonight. Is this one of them?”
If anybody protests, ask them how many pieces they’ve already eaten. Chances are, they got a head start.

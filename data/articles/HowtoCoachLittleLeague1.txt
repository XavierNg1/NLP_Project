 The first step in becoming a Little League coach is to volunteer for the job. There will probably be a formal application process and an interview, though each local league is different. The league’s manager and other officers will consider you for the position if one is available.If you have substantial knowledge of baseball rules and strategies, or prior coaching experience, you are more likely to be considered for the position.;
, Before the season starts, or early in the season, you should receive a contact sheet from the league with information about all the kids on your team. In some cases, you might need to provide parents with this sheet yourself. This sheet should have each player’s full name, address, their parents’ phone numbers and addresses (if the parents live apart from their child).This sheet (or a secondary sheet) should also include detailed medical information, such as allergies, blood type, and any other relevant medical information.
Some leagues might require you to collect additional information. Consult your league handbook to ensure you have all the necessary information on your players.
 As soon as you have phone numbers for all the players on your team, call their parents and introduce yourself. Explain to the parents what the league’s general rules are and what your expectations for the team are.During this call, you might also want to speak to the player briefly about how you’re looking forward to seeing them on the field. There’s no need for an extended conversation, however, since you’ll have lots of time with the players during games and practice.
 Every little league is a bit different. Obtain your league’s handbook and read it several times so you can familiarize yourself with the league’s rules, policies, and regulations.Keep this rulebook handbook close during games and practice so you can reference it if necessary.

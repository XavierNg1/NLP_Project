 To help you get a good idea, think what things you like to do. If you love to play sports and you are in a baseball team, make a movie about that. Or perhaps you like dogs, so you could make a movie about a dog. Also, think about what type of stories you like and what message you want to give the audience. There are many types of stories: love stories, action and superheroes, accidents, friendship, competition, comedy,... Do some research about the topic of your story too. If you are making a movie about the gold fever in California, go to a museum, search online...;
, When you hand them out if it doesn't have many details a person could imagine it way different from you. To avoid that problem you should make a storyboard (next step).
 A storyboard is a comic of the script. It shows what happens in every scene, but it's not very detailed. It needs to show what place they are at, the character's positions, what they are doing. If drawing is not your thing, don't worry. You can still make your movie look good without this.
 They can be friends or family, but make sure that they are going to take it seriously and that they are not quitting on you. It might ruin all your job. If an actor isn't comfortable, or embarrassed with his part, don't make him do it. Otherwise the acting won't be as good, and there might be more possibilities that he quits on you.
 It might be really bad if the filming day comes and you don't have the costumes.

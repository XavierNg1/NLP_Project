 You will need:


Loom bands- it's easiest to use one colour at first.
Beads- if you have a bead kit it's perfect, but you just need some beads with a hole big enough to fit a piece of string through.
String- coloured is best, the best is the string you get in a bead kit. Make sure that it is long enough to fit around your wrist.
Your fingers.;
, Start by putting one band in a figure of 8 position on your middle finger and index finger. Then put another band normally on your middle finger and index finger above the first band.
 Then take your string, thread it through the second bandÂ and tie it on to the figure of 8 band.


Next, hook the figure of 8 band on to the second band, like you would in a fishtail band.
 Thread the string through the middle of this band. Then take a bead and slide it to the bottom of the string.


Take the second band and hook it on to the third band. Don't worry if the bead pops out- you can rectify this at the end.
 Remember, put each band on your middle finger and your index finger, thread the string through, slide the bead on the string, hook the band onto the bead, then put another band on your fingers. Continue doing this to the end.


Remember, don't let go of the string when a bead is on it or the bead will slide off of the end.
Get plenty of bands and beads- you don't want to run out halfway through.
 Then hook the end to the 'S' clip. Poke the beads that have popped out into the bands if you want, but it looks good either way. Cut the loose end off the string. Your loom band with beads is now finished.

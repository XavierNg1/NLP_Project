 Before you begin canning, sterilize your lids and cans by boiling them. Submerge your cans and lids in a pot of water. Bring the water to a boil. Then, let them sit in the water for three to five minutes. Turn the water off and let the cans sit until you're ready to use them., Leave about half an inch (about 1.2 centimeters) of headspace on top of the can. Take a small spatula and run it between the soup and the side of each can to remove air bubbles., Place your lids on the cans and screw them on tightly. Then, screw on any lid rings. Make sure to keep screwing the lid and rings on until you can no longer move them. It's important to make sure the cans do not break open during the canning process., Fill a pot big enough to contain your jars with water. Then, place a cloth towel on the bottom of the pot. The cloth towel will keep your cans from moving around during the canning process., Place each jar into the pot. Submerge them completely in the water. If necessary, add more water to cover the cans.If your jars are still hot from being submerged in the boiling water earlier, use tongs to move them.
 Let the water come to a boil. Once the water comes to a boil, set a timer for 85 minutes. Keep an eye on the pot for the entire boiling process. Leaving the pot alone over the stove is a fire hazard.Check the water level periodically while the jars boil. If the jars are no longer submerged in the water, add more water to the pot.
 After 85 minutes have passed, turn off the burner and remove your jars from the stove. Use tongs to avoid burning your hands. Place them in a safe area where they will not get bumped or otherwise disrupted. Let them cool overnight.Once the jars are cool, loosen the rings slightly. This prevents rust.

 A cube is a three-dimensional shape that has six identical square faces.In other words, it is a box shape with equal sides all around.

A 6-sided die is a good example of a cube you might find in your house. Sugar cubes, and children's letter blocks are also usually cubes.;
, Since all of the side lengths of a cube are the same, the formula for the volume of a cube is really easy. It is V = s3 where V stands for volume, and s is the length of the sides of the cube.


To find s3, simply multiply a by itself 3 times: s3 = s * s * s

, Depending on your assignment, the cube will either be labeled with this information, or you may have to measure the side length with a ruler. Remember that since it is a cube, all of the side lengths should be equal so it doesn't matter which one you measure.


If you are not 100% sure that your shape is a cube, measure each of the sides to determine if they are equal. If they are not, you will need to use the method below for Calculating the Volume of a Rectangular Solid.
 For example, if you find that the length of the sides of your cube is 5 inches, then you should write the formula out as follows: V = (5 in)3. 5 in * 5 in * 5 in = 125 in3, the volume of our cube!

, In the above example, the side length of our cube was measured in inches, so the volume was given in cubic inches. If the side length of the cube had been 3 centimeters, for example, the volume would be V = (3 cm)3, or V = 27cm3.

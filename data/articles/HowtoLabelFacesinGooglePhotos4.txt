 Start by opening Google Photos on your mobile device or by pointing your web browser to http://photos.google.com.
 The label you want to change should appear first in the search results.
 Now you’ll see that face label’s page, containing all photos associated with that face label.
 A brief menu will appear.
 To change the current label name to something else:Backspace over the current label name.
Type a new name for the label.
Tap the back arrow to save your changes.
 The photos will not be deleted, just the label will be removed.


The next time you search for something in Google Photos, you’ll notice that the face formerly associated with this label will now appear in the list of label-less faces. You can add a new label at any time.

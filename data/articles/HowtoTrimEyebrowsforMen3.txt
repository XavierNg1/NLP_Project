 If you want to make the investment, buy an electric trimmer specifically designed for eyebrows. Otherwise, if you have a beard or mustache trimmer, use this. It’s not a good idea to use hair clippers, as the blade is too wide and won’t give you much precision.Only use an electric trimmer if you have bushy eyebrows that need to be thinned and shortened.
You must use caution with an electric trimmer because there is a large margin of error, and you don’t want to remove too much of your eyebrow.
A nose trimmer also works well because of the narrow blade width.
 The goal of trimming with an electric trimmer is remove length and bulk, so comb the hairs outward. Hold the comb in place when the desired length to be cut is in the teeth of the comb.

Leave about one millimeter of hair in the teeth, and repeat later if you need to remove more.
It is better to trim a little bit at a time and repeat than to trim too much on your first pass.
 Turn the trimmer on and press it to the comb near the outer edge of your eyebrow. Gently and carefully move the trimmer along the comb, trimming the hairs as you go.It is important to keep both hands steady so you don’t remove more hair than you intend to.

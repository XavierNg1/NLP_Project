 Load up a new playlist and listen to some music. Find a comfortable spot to sit and listen closely to the music. Focus on the lyrics and the musical strains. See if you can hear when different instruments are played.


Listen to the music through headphones. Music with a faster tempo will require you to pay closer attention if you’re trying to track the music, instruments and lyrics., Turning on the TV or watching a good movie can distract you from the task or thought at hand. Get absorbed in the storyline of a TV show or movie.


Make sure to choose a movie or TV show that doesn’t remind you of your problem. For example, if you’re distracting yourself from the emotional pain of a breakup, don’t watch a movie that focuses on a person who ends a relationship with someone.
 Video games offer compelling narratives that can suck you into their worlds. If you are playing a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, you will interact with others online, which will take your attention away from your problem.
 Find a good, juicy story or revisit an old favorite novel. It helps if the book is a fairly easy read. If you have to process a lot of what you’re reading or constantly look up vocabulary, then you might lose your momentum to get lost in the story.
 Dive into a project with multiple parts. This will engage your attention with various steps and instructions. A good project could be working on a model, painting a picture or building some shelves for your living room.

 The soil does not have to be perfect, because garlic will take whatever it needs from the soil you provide. However, outdoor rather than greenhouse planting produces a richer head of garlic.;

Use flat beds if you have sandy soil that does not hold water well. This is typical in coastal areas of Florida. Flat beds are planted on the natural ground.






Plant garlic in raised beds if you reside in regions of Florida that are inland, and your soil is rich and moist. The raised beds will help reduce fungal infections that might occur after heavy rain because the water drains more easily. Raised beds are built up and lifted off the natural ground.
 This is possible only in warmer climates such as Florida. In northern climates, garlic would freeze in the pots.


Fill a planter with potting soil to prepare the garlic bulbs. The best soil for garlic has a pH of 6.5 or 7. The pH level reflects the number of hydrogen ions in the soil. It classifies soil as acidic or alkaline.
 Add some compost if you have it available, to richen the soil.

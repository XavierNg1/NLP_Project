 You can quickly copy and paste image files to and from different locations on your computer. You can copy image files off of a digital camera, from a flash drive or CD, or just copy them from one folder to another. Use your operating system's file explorer to locate the image files you want to copy.
 You can drag a selection box around all of the files you want to copy, hold the Ctrl or Command key and click individual images to select multiple individual files, or you can simply select one image.
 Once you've selected the images that you want to copy, right-click (Ctrl-click on a one-button Mac) and select "Copy" from the menu. You can also press Ctrl + C (PC) or Command + C (Mac). The image files will be copied to the clipboard.


When you copy something, the files stay in the original location and new copies are made at the new location. If you'd rather delete the originals when you paste to the new location, you can cut instead of copy by pressing Ctrl + X or Command + X.
 Navigate to the location that you want to paste the image files in using your file explorer. Right-click on a blank space and select "Paste" from the menu. You can also press Ctrl + V on a PC or Command + V on a Mac. The files will be pasted to the new location.


If you Cut the files instead of Copying them, the files will be deleted from the original location after you paste.

½ cup (100 g) palm sugar
3 tablespoons honey
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon dried mustard powder
¼ teaspoon dried ground chipotle powder

, Put the lid on the blender and blitz the mixture until it's completely smooth. Don't worry if the cherry ketchup isn't thick. It will thicken up as it cooks. Pour the chipotle cherry ketchup into a saucepan., Turn the heat on to medium and let the ketchup come to a boil. Reduce the heat, so the ketchup bubbles gently. Let the ketchup simmer for 45 minutes. Try to stir the ketchup every 5 minutes to prevent it from sticking to the pan.The ketchup should thicken as liquid evaporates. It should look glossy once it's finished simmering.
 Carefully pour the ketchup into a clean storage container. You can store the cherry ketchup in the refrigerator for up to one month. If you want to process the ketchup in a water bath, you can store it for up to one year.

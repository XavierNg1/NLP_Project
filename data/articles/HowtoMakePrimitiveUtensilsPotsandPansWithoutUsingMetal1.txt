 You can do this by squeezing it for a minute or two. This helps because as the clay is heated, the molecules expand, which makes the clay softer and easier to work with.;
, You do this by lightly pressing while making circular waving motions with your hand on the clay. It doesn't have to be perfect, it will even itself out a little in the next step.
 Now, since this is primitive pottery NO POTTERY WHEELS, sorry! OK, now do something VERY sophisticated. "Stab" the clay with your thumb. Come on, really do it hard! But Be careful to leave at least half an inch thick bottom, or your bowl may break!

, Or you can make it taller by repeating this motion, but not very much, then pinching and pulling upwards. Don't exaggerate height nor width as the bowl may break. There must be enough clay in all areas to support itself!

, Just do what makes you happy!

, Just put the right temperature your package says, and cook for 15-20 minutes.
 The clay is softer when first out of the oven then when cooled down. The overall result will be harder if you pop it directly in the freezer when out of the oven. Do this immediately!

,


Use pale yellow paint as the base.
Then do your "Tribal" designs.
When finished, you can use the lighter to burn parts of the bowl. DO NOT PUT THE FLAME DIRECTLY ON THE BOWL! This will result in the bowl igniting.
Instead leave the flame an inch or two away until the area you're heating is light brown at the center. That's your bowl!

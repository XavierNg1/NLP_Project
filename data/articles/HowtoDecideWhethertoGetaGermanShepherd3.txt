 If you have a family, partner, or people living with you, you must consider their opinions about owning a German shepherd before purchasing one. If other family members rather have another breed of dog, then reconsider getting a German shepherd.You also need to be sure that your partner or family members are comfortable with handling a German shepherd on their own when you are away.
 If you plan to keep the dog outside in the backyard most of the time, then reconsider your decision to get a German shepherd. German shepherds need constant companionship, not only for socialization purposes, but also because companionship is a natural part of their personality.If you are bothered by a dog that will follow you everywhere, then perhaps a German shepherd is not for you.
 German shepherds, like most dogs, are pack dogs. Therefore, early on, you need to establish your leadership. If you cannot provide calm, confident, and strong leadership for your dog, then they will take things on for themselves. This will make them very hard to control.A confident leader is not someone who is loud, harsh, or demanding, but is someone who is mature, firm, and fair in all areas of treatment of the dog.

 Before you do anything in gymnastics (or otherwise, for that matter) you should fully stretch your body. Not stretching your body completely could result in injury.;
, Pullovers work best, but a kip can also suffice.
 Once you mount, take your dominant foot (right handed, right foot; left handed, left foot) and swing it over the bar. You now should look like you are doing the splits on the bar.
 You do not want your hands facing "forward," (fingers pointing towards the mats, and you can see your knuckles) you want them "backwards." (Fingers pointing in the direction you're facing, and you can see your thumb.)

, If for some reason, you can't make it around the whole bar, you should hook your front leg (dominant leg) on the bar so that your shin and foot are on the other side of the bar, while your knee and thigh are on the suds closest to your body. This prevents you from the instinct to "let go" when you can't make it around the bar.
 Raising both of your legs up does two things: it propelled you to go faster (and further), while guarding your legs from friction with the bar, which makes very uncomfortable burn

, Don't push down just yet; this is the position you should assume before you officially start the stride circle.
 Remember, if you do not make it all the way around, hook your leg!

, Unless you have done this several times and know exactly how much to push down, you probably won't have enough momentum to travel the whole way. That is why it is exceptionally important to rely on your arm muscles the last quarter to get you up the bar.
 You know how to do a Stride Circle!

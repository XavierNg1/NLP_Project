 Grip the can of Skoal in one hand so it is turned on itâ€™s side. Hold it so your fingers have a strong grip on the lid of the can and your pointer finger is curled on the side of the can.This method is often done by chewers who have not mastered the pointer finger slap method of packing. Though it may not get you as tight of a pack as the pointer finger method, it is sufficient for the occasional chewer.
 Keep your palm flat, as this will act as the flat surface you are going to use to pat down the tobacco in the can., Grip the can tightly and firmly hit the can against the middle of your palm, keeping your wrist loose. The side of the can should tap against your palm and you should hear the tobacco pack together in the can.Make sure you tap the can five to eight times before you plan to chew for a nice, tightly packed chew.

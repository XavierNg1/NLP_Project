 Lists are a great way create structure and order to goals that appear chaotic or impossible.Think of your list as an assembly line where each step reinforces your ability to complete the list, to focus on the importance of each task, and commit yourself to finishing the homework.
If procrastination persists, make the tasks even smaller. Remember, every waterfall starts with a drop of water, and every marathon starts with the first step. If motivation eludes you, keep breaking things down until the first step is so simple you can't help but to succeed.
 Accomplishing even the most simple, mundane task is important. If you do a small task as you awaken, it's more likely to encourage further accomplishments. The same applies to homework. Writing your name or a title, highlighting something important, creating an outline, whatever it is, doing a small portion will instill pride and lead to lead to other tasks.
 Without a timeline, procrastination is possible until the homework is due, or until you are forced to cram. Put the timeline requirements on your list. Integrate a calendar into your timeline and assign specific work for each day remaining before the deadline.


A 1000-word essay due at the end of the week could be 100 words every hour if you have a lot of time, or 500 words per hour if your homework is due sooner.
Determine the number of days left on the homework and divide it into equal parts. For instance, five days means you have five equal parts on which to work.
Math homework with 25 questions could easily be completed in an hour if each question were given two minutes.

, While free file software is clearly preferable, understand that you may need professional (paid) software if your output needs are extremely specific in terms of codec, size and other factors.
 If you downloaded the program online without paying for it, consult appropriate forums for pointers or post on forums with specific questions you may have.
 Most programs have either an "Add files" option, or will let you drag and drop the file(s) manually onto the conversion screen.
 Add any applicable parameters for size, resolution, codec and other factors in the Settings menu, if your program has one.
 Open the drop-down Output Folder and select the destination where you want the converted file to be retrievable from. Skip this step if you want to use the default location for converted files.


Choose output file nomenclature that will help you find and retrieve files easily.

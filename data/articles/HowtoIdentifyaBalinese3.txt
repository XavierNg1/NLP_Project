 If you arenâ€™t able to confirm the breed of the cat on your own, bring the cat to a breeder. You may bring the cat back to the breeder who sold you the cat or to a breeder in your area who is familiar with Balinese cats. The breeder will often be able to look at the physical attributes and the temperament of the cat to determine if it is a Balinese.


Going to a breeder who breeds Balinese cats is an even better option, as they will have the expertise and knowledge to determine if the cat is Balinese.
 Your vet may also be able to help you identify the breed of the cat. Bring the cat to the vet and ask them if they can confirm the cat is Balinese. Even if they are not sure, they will often be able to recommend a breeder who can provide this information for you.
 DNA tests done on cats to determine breed are over 90% accurate. Ask your vet to refer you to a DNA lab that does tests on animals. Most DNA labs will require a swab from the inside of your cat's mouth to run tests and determine the breed.

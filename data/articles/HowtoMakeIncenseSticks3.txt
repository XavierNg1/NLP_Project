 When making your own incense, the ration of makko and water to scent takes some time to get right. To make sure you always learn your lessons, write down the ratios you use as you test out the following recipes, or your own:

If you have a hard time lighting the incense, you likely need more makko next time.

If all you smell is the makko, or the sticks burn very quickly, add less makko next time., Sandalwood is one of the most common and beloved incense scents. The following ratios should help you get these classic smells burning quickly:

2 parts sandalwood, 1 part frankincense, 1 part mastic, 1 part lemongrass

2 part sandalwood, 1 part cassia, 1 part clove

2 part sandalwood, 1 part galangal, 1 part myrrh, 1/2 part cinnamon, 1/2 part borneol


, The following recipe can be easily adapted as well. Try it with some clove or cinnamon for a spiced taste, or mix it in with wood scents like cedar for a rustic incense:

1 part palo santo wood, 1 part tolu balsam, 1 part storax bark, 1/4 part vanilla bean (powdered), This recipe goes will with pine in place of cedar as well, and a bit of myrrh can be added too to increase the old-world incense feel of the mixture:

2 parts cedar, 1 part vetiver, 1 part lavender flowers, 1/2 part benzoin, handful of dried rose petals


, This recipe can be adapted wonderfully with some cinnamon chips or cloves as well, and mixes nicely with vanilla as well. While it calls for fresh pine needs and leaves, powders and dried leaves work as well, though they might not be as strong:

1 part pine needles, 1/2 part hemlock needles, 1/2 part sassafras powder, 1/2 part cedar leaf (Thuja occidentalis), 1/4 part whole cloves


, The herbal, floral, and strong notes of lavender combine to make an in-the-mood scent that few can resist. 60% of the time, it works every time.

1 part ground lavender flowers, 1 part ground rosemary leaves, 1/2 part ground rose petals, 4 parts red sandalwood powder

 These events are perfect for meeting company representatives and finding employment opportunities in your field. They allow you to ask questions of a company’s representatives and thoroughly research job opportunities. Universities often organize these in order to provide better employment options for their graduates. Before attending a job fair, be sure to practice your introduction: this is your “elevator pitch.” Make sure it includes the following:


Your specialty/preference. If you’ve specialized in applying statistical models to public health issues, you’ll have a specific skillset better suited to particular organizations.
Your educational background. Especially important if you’ve yet to find work, your education is the best gauge of your suitability.
Your interest in the organization/position. It’s important to research organizations prior to the job fair, so that you can accurately tailor your introduction to each one., Online job boards are a useful resource for any profession. Biostatistician positions, especially entry-level work, can be found across websites such as Indeed, Glassdoor and LinkedIn. These job postings give you the chance to research specific companies and tailoring your resume and cover letter for each application.
 Job postings for biostatisticians are not always widely advertised. You can often find contact information for hiring managers and human resources individuals on websites such as LinkedIn. Do not hesitate to send your resume and cover letter to individuals with these positions within companies that hire biostatisticians. You might apply at just the right time when there is an available job posting. Otherwise, they’ll keep your application for consideration when a position becomes available.

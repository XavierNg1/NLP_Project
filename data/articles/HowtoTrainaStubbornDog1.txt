 Are you using a high enough reward for your dog? It doesn't matter if we like the item; your dog has to love it.The most common reward is a treat. Try boiled chicken, string cheese, or chicken hot dogs. You could try a bone or dog treat. You want to reward the dog when it responds to your command and behaves. If the dog ignores or rejects your command, no treat.If treats are the preferred item, keep them handy so that you can practice throughout the day, such as anytime you get up for a drink/snack or bathroom break.
You could toss the treat on the ground so the dog has to get up. Then, wait again until the dog chooses to sit, without any encouragement from you. When the dog does, say, "Yes!" in a happy tone, and deliver a super yummy treat. Repeat this 5 or 6 times.;
, Sometimes a dog is not food driven, so consider whether they are into a ball or a tug toy. Other dogs just love attention. You have to figure out what makes your dog happiest, and then use that as their reward.Praise is simply a happy, excited voice and gentle touching. This is the cheapest and easiest reward to offer. You could also use a favorite toy as a reward.Touch is another great way to reward a dog. Some dogs respond to being petted or their tummies being rubbed. A brisk 10-minute walk can also be a reward if you are able.
 Be very consistent and repetitive. A solid training program takes a minimum of two years of consistent and organized training.


You will get as much out of your dog as you put into them. If we say our dogs are "stubborn," we are basically making excuses for not learning how to teach our dogs to understand us.
Ensure everyone around the dog has the same rules and expectations. Everyone in the household should use the same commands for tricks and set out the same limitations. Don't feel sorry for the dog and violate your own rules at times. The dog will learn the wrong lesson.

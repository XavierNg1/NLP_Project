 Keeping your lid closed while lighting can cause gas fumes to build up. This can create an exploding hazard. If the gas has been turned on with the lid closed, turn off the gas and open the lid. Wait a few minutes for the gas to dissipate, then start the process over., In most cases, a propane tank is used to supply your grill with gas. Propane tanks are usually stored beneath, behind, or to the side of the grill. Attach the gas line firmly to the propane tank and the gas intake for your grill.Depending on your grill, the hookup for your gas may vary. When in doubt, follow the usage instructions. If you donâ€™t have these, look up a digital manual with a keyword search for your grill online.
Some grills may be connected by a direct line to the natural gas supplied to your home. This kind of gas supply acts the same as a tank, but is stationary.
Smaller tabletop grills oftentimes have small canisters of gas which are screwed into the valve of the grill before it can be ignited.
 This is usually done by turning a circular shaped valve on top of the propane tank. Some grills may have a secondary valve on the grill that you need to open for it to receive gas. Open the valve fully, then wait about a minute for the gas to move through the line to the grill., Generally, this involves turning a regulator knob on the front of your grill for the burner closest to the igniter to its highest setting. This will allow gas to flow through the grill up through the grate. Press the igniter button to cause a spark inside the grill and light the gas. Follow the ignition instructions for your grill for the best results.Different grills may have different designs, like ones that have the starter and regulator knob combined. Follow the grill instructions when confused about the ignition procedure.
Once one burner is lit, you can light burners next to the lit one without the igniter by simply turning on the regulator knobs for these burners.

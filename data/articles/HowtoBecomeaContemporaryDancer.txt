 If there are no contemporary classes, consider joining a lyrical dance class––lyrical dance is similar to contemporary.


Find a good dancing school that suits your timetable, is close to home and fits in your budget.
Ask for a trial lesson or set of lessons; it's important to feel comfortable with the class and click with the teacher.;
, Contemporary dancers need to be flexible in order to do leaps and jumps and numerous different moves. Stretch every morning and evening and slowly, bit by bit. Learn to do the splits. With stretching and exercise, you will become more flexible over time.


Stretch before each class.
 Pick out the moves you're not so good at and practice them over and over again. Any moves you learn may come in handy if you have to choreograph a piece of dance. Even if that isn't required, learning all the basic moves will aid you to learn more advanced moves.
 In turn, share tips too. This is an important source of information to help you to become a better dancer.


Observe how other contemporary dancers move and learn from their actions. Which way do they point their toes? How do they keep their legs up? Ask them!






If you want to copy others but you're not sure how, ask for guidance.
 Try to aim for daily practice sessions for the best outcome.

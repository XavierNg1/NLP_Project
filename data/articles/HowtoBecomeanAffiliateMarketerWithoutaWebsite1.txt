 Examples of such communities are forums, discussion boards, chat rooms, and blogs.


Perform an Internet search using keywords such as "forum" or "discussion board" with the subject of the affiliates you are promoting. For example, if you are promoting exercise equipment, search for "exercise forum" or "fitness forum.";
, This practice may help boost your affiliate income when members begin to view you as an active, trusted presence on each website.


Engage in discussions and participate in online events on a daily or weekly basis. You can also start discussions about topics that are relevant to the products you are promoting through the affiliate links.
 This procedure will allow you to verify if you are allowed to post affiliate links to these sites. Some online communities may prohibit affiliate links and consider the links as advertising spam.
 If you belong to a forum or discussion group that requires you to register for an account, you may be able to take advantage of a signature box in which you can post affiliate links. The signature box can then be displayed each time you reply to or write a post on the website.

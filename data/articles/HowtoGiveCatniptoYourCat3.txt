 Your cat's reaction to catnip should happen very quickly after it smells it (one or two sniffs of catnip is sometimes enough to evoke a "high" in your pet). Note that sensitivity to catnip is hereditary, and approximately 1 in 2 cats won't react to the herb at all. If your cat does react, you will observe it:


Sniffing
Purring
Licking and chewing the catnip
Rubbing its chin and cheek
Rubbing its body against things (e.g. the carpet)

, If you offer a cat catnip too often, the effects can wear off completely. Opt to offer catnip to your pet only once a week to maintain the "high" it experiences from the herb, which generally lasts for about 5-15 minutes. It may take up to two hours for your cat's behavior to completely return to normal, during which your cat will not be susceptible to the effects of catnip., If your cat has the bad habit of scratching furniture and other important household items, use catnip to train it out of this behavior. Purchase a catnip spray (from your local pet store, or online) and spray a scratching post for your cat. When your cat feels the overwhelming need to scratch, it will opt for the alluring surface of the scratching post instead of the couch or kitchen table.

 Aside from 911, it’s good to have the non-emergency numbers for your local police and fire stations in your area, poison control (1-800-222-1222), a doctor and/or hospital, a tow service, etc. Store these as contacts in your phone, and post a list of the numbers in an easily accessible place, like on a refrigerator.If you have children, it is also a good idea to make contact information for parents or guardians and their workplaces available.
Depending on your situation, it may also be useful to have numbers for things like suicide prevention, addiction recovery, mental health care, or other services that you may need.
 An “In Case of Emergency” (ICE) contact is someone you would like contacted in the event you are injured or in another serious situation. If responders find this information, they can get in touch with the contact and let them know what has happened.You can label a card (“In Case of Emergency, Contact”), write down the information for your contact, and then place the card in your wallet.
You can also store the information in your phone.
If you usually lock your phone, you can save a screenshot of the ICE information and use it as the picture for your lock screen. That way, responders can still access it.
 911 service is provided throughout the US and in Canada. If you are in another location, you will need to know the emergency number that services that location. For example, the common equivalent number in Europe is 112. If you are abroad or planning to travel, you can check the US State Department’s website for a useful list of emergency numbers in countries around the world.

For things like basil or spinach, gather them into a neat stack (like a pile of cards) then slice lengthwise to make long strips approx 1mm or 1/25th of an inch wide, or roll the stack up and slice them the same width.
Rolling them can make it easier, but too big a roll will be harder. Its fine to roll up herbs such as basil, but not ideal for lettuce or anything you will serve raw as it may bruise them and the final result won't be as crisp.
As cabbage and lettuce leaves are already in layers, its easier to cut them into wedges and then take smaller portions of that wedge, gently pressing them flat to slice the same way without rolling to maintain crispness.









Aim to remove thick fleshy parts of the cabbage or lettuce to make the slices more even, however this is not essential, but is desirable when catering for a formal event.

 Pull on a pair of rubber, vinyl, plastic, or latex gloves. Cover your work surface with a cheap, plastic tablecloth or some newspapers. This will keep the dye from staining your hands and your work surface.


If the dye spills, wipe it up immediately with rubbing alcohol.
It might be a good idea to wear an apron or old clothes that you don't mind possibly staining.;
, The more water you use, the lighter your dye will be. It might be a better idea to start off with Â½ cup (120 milliliters) first, do a test swatch, then add more water as needed.
 Stir the solution with a spoon or skewer.If you are using liquid dye, shake the bottle first.
Don't add salt or vinegar., The tray needs to be big enough to fit your paper. You can also use a baking dish or a rimmed baking sheet., Choose thick paper, such as watercolor paper or hardcover book pages. Set the paper into the tray, then press down on it with your hands so that it sinks into the dye.If you are working with expensive paper, consider doing a test swatch using a scrap instead.
 Allow the excess dye to drip off of the paper. Don't worry if the paper looks dark. It will lighten slightly as it dries.
 Sandwich the dyed paper between two stacks of paper towels. Gently press down on the paper towels to absorb the excess dye., Cover your ironing board with a thin cloth. Place the dyed paper on top of the cloth. Cover the paper with another cloth. Turn your iron to the lowest setting. Pass the iron over the paper.This will help keep the paper nice and flat as well.

 When you recast a loan in the U.S., you pay a significant chunk of your mortgage balance, also known as the principal, in one go. Your lender will change the conditions of your existing loan and calculate a new monthly payment based upon the new, reduced principal. This will lower your monthly payments, improve your cash flow, and save money in interest over the lifespan of your loan.Your lender may charge a modest recasting fee., To reduce the lifespan of your mortgage, aim to make an extra payment every year. It may seem counterintuitive to pay more to save, but this will trim your interest payments over time. In addition, this extra payment will reduce the reminder of your principal, which will cut back on the loanâ€™s lifespan. While you may be paying more upfront each year, you can save thousands on the interest payment.For example, if you have a $200,000 mortgage with a 6% interest rate that is fixed over a 30-year period, you will pay $1,199 each month for your principal and your interest. Paying one more installment of $1,199 every year can cut your mortgage span by 5 years and help you save $47,000 in interest., Rescheduling your mortgage payments is a simple way to decrease the lifespan of your mortgage. If you pay half of your monthly payment every other week instead of once a month, you will make 26 half-payments each year. This means you will be paying 13 monthly payments instead of 12. The additional money will be applied to your remaining principal. This can help you pay off your loan more quickly and reduce your interest rate payments.If you set up bi-weekly payments, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage that is $270,000 with an interest rate of 3.635% can save $26,511 in interest over the lifespan of your loan.Talk to your lender about paying your loan biweekly instead of monthly.

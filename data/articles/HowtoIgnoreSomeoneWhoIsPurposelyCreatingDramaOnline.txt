 It can be very irritating when you're in a discussion, especially a heated one, and then having some person make a rude comment or a smart remark. The main thing is don't overreact to this. All this person wants is to get a rise out of you and see you get mad. So if your on the screen, just take a deep breath, drink some water and calm down. If your having a face to face problem, then walk away from the discussion or, say well you are entitled to your own opinions. That clearly states that you don't want to fight about it.;
, If this person makes a remark about your looks, use that as a joke to show it doesn't bother you. An example would be: Other person-"You're so ugly!" You-"You're right, I should go around wearing a Cinderella mask." Have fun with it and show the person you're not bothered with it. Then if they are trying to be malicious, they will stop because you will become a boring target.
 If someone is trying to make you look bad in front of people, then just smile. That will accomplish many things!

, If you are always fluid and calm, then what can people do to you?

 Pretend you are picking a massive wedgie. Fall over on the ground, stay there for 15 seconds, then jump up and say "I'm alright everyone". Better yet, walk with a large step, or opening your mouth large when speaking.;
, Say random things like "Meep eep a deep" and "Oh snap" when you and your friends are in an awkward silence. Bring a pet rock to school (with googly eyes -- awww!), or give out candy canes to your whole class when it's in the middle of June. Be unpredictable -- everyone will be on the edge of their seats!

, Choose colours like bright orange, bright green. You can even get massive fake afro hairdo. For the less daring people, try a less crazy 'do, like if you have blonde hair, dye it brown, or if you have brown hair, bleach it. However, you might get into trouble in some strict schools, but oh well.
 And jump up and down. And say stuff like "I'm a hummingbird" and act like you are a hummingbird.
 If you were a girly girl or a pretty boy, you could be a Goth to freak everyone at school. Plus, you might make some other Goth friends.The down side is, you might really freak people out., Get some fake blood run it down your arms find a ledge and yell, "You can't stop me! It's over, I'm gonna do it" but this approach is a tad extreme and can get you expelled from school.
 Part of the trick is acting different just subtly enough to unnerve, rather than to make them think you are completely crazy.
 This tends to freak people out. Around your friends you should sit there and talk to your imaginary friend. Call them something out of the blue like: 'Ethel' or 'Lillian-George'. If someone denies that you have an imaginary friend or they sit on him/her, chuck hissy fit or get really angry at them. After yelling, sob to yourself and make the person feel bad. Complain that they have hurt your feelings. WARNING:your mates might think you have a mental problem and send you to an asylum or counsellor. Your parents will freak out too.

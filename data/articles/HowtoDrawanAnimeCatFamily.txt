 Make them slightly rounded and relatively far apart.;
, It's not flat, it rather has the shape of a hill. A spiky line indicates the fur.
 Again, indicate the cat hair.
 They should be curving from the head so they get slightly smaller at the bottom.


Draw the paws and toes. The toes can be cutesy small or big (depending on the character) and usually have four toes, but some artists only draw three for simplification.
 Make small loops near the paws.
 It's curved slightly above the bottom of the back legs.
 It can be in a number of positions, but to make it simple, the tail could be curved around the paws. Make it fluffy or thin and short-haired.
 Start with the nose - a small triangle with the point facing down.
 It has some kind of “W” shape but curved softly instead of with pointed edges.
 Start each with a long oval for the iris. The pupil should be the same length and can be at the side or in the middle, (it should fill most of empty space) and a half triangle around it with an opening at the bottom.
 Place them above the eyes in a shape to give the cat the expression you want it to have., Inside of the ears, draw a 75% curve that ends in three lines for ear fur.
 Three lines pointed separate directions will do the trick. They should not be touching the head and the middle one should be longer than the other two. They can also be curly if you want.
 You can add any extra things you want - small teeth look naughty in a cute way, whereas big teeth and claws look aggressive. Moderate eyelashes make female cats look cute, while long eyelashes make a cat look vain. Long fur is often associated with precious lap cats, short and multicoloured fur is given to average domestic cats and strays. A collar can seem like a piece of jewelry, indicating the cat's worth to it's owner.
 Stripes, spots, socks, underbellies, tail tips, ear fur, muzzles, eyelids... Each and every cat should have it's distinctive features.
 Voila! Your anime cat family is finished!

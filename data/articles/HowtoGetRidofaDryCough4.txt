 If postnasal drip is causing your cough, consider taking a decongestant, which shrinks nasal tissue that has become swollen and reduces mucus. Decongestants come in the form of nasal spray, pills, and liquids.It is best to use decongestant nasal sprays for no more than three days. Using them for longer than three days in a row may cause rebound congestion.Decongestant nasal sprays may also contain Oxymetazolinewhich is a decongestant, but if used more than three days can damage the nasal passages.
 Antihistamines limit histamine release in your body, which can create drainage in your nose and throat and cause you to have a persistent cough.Antihistamines may be particularly effective during allergy season, or if your cough is a result of a mild allergic reaction to something in your environment, such as pet dander or mold.
 If you are having trouble sleeping because of your cough, or you are coughing so much that your chest or muscles hurt, you may consider taking a suppressant at night. Just keep in mind that suppressants are not a cure.

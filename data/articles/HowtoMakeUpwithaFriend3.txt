 For example, if you and your friend enjoy eating lunch at a certain restaurant, consider purchasing a gift card from there.
 If that is not an option, try to leave the gift at your friend’s house. Keep the gift private and don’t include others in giving it.
 Let your friend know that you hope to hear from him or her very soon.

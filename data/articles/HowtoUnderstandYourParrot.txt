 Just as you brush your teeth after every meal, your bird must clean its beak too. You'll see your parrot wiping its beak on the perch after eating.;
, Before your bird’s bedtime or nap, you may hear strange grinding noises coming from your parrot. This is the sound of a contented bird, and is nothing to be alarmed about.
 Just like us, your bird needs to stretch from time to time.
 It's normal for your parrot to take a few naps during the day.
 Birds are territorial creatures and will defend their environment if they feel threatened. They will scream or make a sound like boiling water. Sometimes a change in your appearance will make the bird think that you are a stranger.
 Birds will preen (groom) themselves on a regular basis.
 Your bird may be excited, nervous, lonely, or happy - check your bird's body language to make sure.
 Some birds are prone to night frights, These “night frights” occur when there is a loud noise in the middle of the night that will end up startling a bird into a thrashing frenzy.

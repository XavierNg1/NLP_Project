 To start, you need to warm your ducle de leche. It will not be spreadable straight out of the jar, so warm it up until you can easily spread it.You can do this in the microwave or over the stove.
 Measure out your vanilla and mascarpone. Mix them together until they form a light, spreadable dip-like substance. Set this aside for now., Place a skillet over medium heat. While it's heating up, butter each of your 8 bread slices on one side. Then, place the slices, with the butter side facing down, on your skillet.Grill the bread slices until they're golden brown.
You may have to do more than one batch if your skillet isn't big enough to contain all the bread.
 Take a large plate. Place four slices of your bread on the plate, with the un-buttered side facing upwards.Spread two tablespoons of raspberry preserves on each side. Then, spread two tablespoons of the mascarpone mixture followed by one tablespoon of dulce de leche.
Top off each sandwich with the other four slices of bread.

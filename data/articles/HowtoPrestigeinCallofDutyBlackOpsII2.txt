If you want to reset your multiplayer stats, you must first reach level 55 on whatever prestige you are at, and prestige again.



The prestige option is now locked again, but a new option will be unlocked - Prestige Rewards.



A warning will appear, telling you about Fresh Start.

When you use the Fresh Start prestige award, your Multiplayer stats, along with any prestige you're at, will be reset. You will lose all your previously unlocked camos, and all emblems and calling cards. It will be as if you have never played a Public Match before.



You will now be level one again, and everything that you might have unlocked will be reset. Any emblems you have unlocked will be reset as well.

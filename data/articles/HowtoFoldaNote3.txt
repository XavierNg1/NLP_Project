 Use a valley fold.


Note that the width will be halved but the height should remain unchanged.
 Bring the upper left corner diagonally down and to the right. Fold the lower right corner diagonally up and the to left. Unfold when done.


The edge of each corner should be aligned with the edge of the note.
Crease the edges well so that the fold leaves a mark.
 Bring the upper right corner diagonally down and to the left and the bottom left corner diagonally up and the the right. Unfold.


Again, the edge of each corner should be aligned to the edge of the main body of the note.
Crease well before unfolding.
 Fold the top edge down so that the edge meets with the lower marks left behind by your previous folds. Fold the bottom edge up to the corresponding lower crease.
 Push on each corner of the note, gently pressing it in between the top and bottom layers of paper.


When done, there should be a triangle at the top of the paper and a triangle at the bottom. When looking at the top triangle from the bottom, each tucked-in corner should form an "M" shape.
 Slightly lift the left edges of both upper triangles, exposing the bottom portion of the note. Bring the left edge in vertically toward the center and fold. Repeat with the right edge.


You should now be left with a double-sided arrow shape.
Each edge should meet with the exact vertical center of the note.
 Bring the bottom arrow up so that it overlaps the top arrow.
 Slightly unfold the note and tuck the overlapping bottom arrow into the fold of the original top arrow.


You should be left with a secure arrow that has one head.
This completes the arrow style fold.

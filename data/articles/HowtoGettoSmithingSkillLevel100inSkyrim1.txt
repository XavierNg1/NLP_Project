 You may also steal them if you want to take the risk.;
, Spam iron daggers (1 dagger requires 1 iron ingot and 1 leather strip), these short blades give you the most xp, for the least money/equipment out of all create-able armor/weapons. You also don't need any perks, you'll be able to make them from the start of the game.
 You only need around 500 daggers to get to level 100 smithing from scratch, this may sound like a lot but you'll get there in around 5 hours. (including waiting for stock to resupply e.t.c...)

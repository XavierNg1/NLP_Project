 If you want to freeze just the leaves, you will need to pinch them off, and discard the stems. You can also freeze the cilantro whole, and break off a few leaves whenever you need them.
 This will protect the delicate herb from the cold and keep it from going mushy.Simply place the herb into a bowl and toss it with a teaspoon to a tablespoon of olive oil. How much olive oil you use will depend on how much cilantro you are freezing; the more cilantro you have, the more oil you will need.
 Try to keep the cilantro spread out evenly in the bag. If you are using whole cilantro, try to keep the stems and leaves as straight as possible. You may need to use more than one bag.


If you do not have any freezer bags, use regular re-sealable bags instead, one inside the other.
 Zip the bag close part way, then gently press down on the bag with your hands until it is flat. Close the bag the rest of the way. Be careful not to crush the cilantro.
 If you are storing other types of herbs in the freezer, it might be a good idea to write down "Cilantro" on the bag as well., Try to place it so that the herbs are laying down flat and straight.

 Lay paper towel, or a white fabric towel, flat on the spill. Don’t press down or you might push the spill into the felt. Replace with dry towels multiple times until the majority of the spill is absorbed.The most important thing is to clean the spill up as soon as it happens to reduce the time it has to soak into the felt and the table board beneath it.
 If you spilled something besides water, gently dab at the spot with the damp towel. Rinse the towel multiple times to pull up as much of the spill as possible. Don’t apply too much pressure as you dab at the spot.Never scrub at the spot because this will mess up the felt.
After you have blotted the stain away with water, you can dab it with another dry towel to help it dry out faster, then allow it to air dry.
 If blotting the stain with water does not sufficiently remove it, mix a solution of vinegar and water at a ratio of 50/50. Dip a cloth in the solution and dab at the stain again. The vinegar will break the stains chemical bonds better than water. Rinse the cloth and dab repeatedly as needed.


Vinegar is a less harsh solution than chemical cleaning products so it is safer for felt tables.
 If blotting the stain with a damp cloth does not completely remove the effects of the spill, use a cleaning product. Only use a cleaner that says it is specifically for pool table felt. Carpet cleaners and other stain removers can damage the felt worse than the spill did.Only use cleaners as a last resort if the spill is bad and can’t be blotted away.
Seek help from the manufacturer or a professional pool table dealer to determine which product you should use.

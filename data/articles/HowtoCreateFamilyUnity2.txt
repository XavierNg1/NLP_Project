 Routines allow each member of the family to know when and where certain events will happen. Daily routines, such as a 6:00 dinner time, serve as touch points through the day to bring the family back together. The key to setting routines is to keep them predictable. If you must, write it down for each member of the family.You can also create longer running routines, such as a weekly grass mowing or a monthly road trip.
 For a family to be unified, each person has to pull their own weight. This means that you will have to assign tasks to each individual that everyone else can expect will be carried out. Each time the chores get done properly, it re-enforces trust and respect between family members. You may choose to give each person permanent chores, or rotate the chores every so often so that they are evenly dispersed.With children and teens, it can be helpful to rotate the chores. This way, everyone learns to cook, to do laundry, etc. This eliminates any feelings of unevenness in the chore disbursement, and teaches all children to be relatively self-sufficient.
 Some household responsibilities will come up that are not covered on the chore list. When this happens, they should be split between family members, or different family members should rotate doing them. This shows the kind of cooperation and respect that is vital for family unity.Once the responsibilities are finished, the whole family can reap the benefits and enjoy your time together.

 These online tools allow you to simply enter in the number of full-time employees you have and the hours worked every week by part-time employees. Then the online tool will do the calculating for you to give you an estimated FTE value. Reputable calculators can be found at https://www.healthcare.gov/shop-calculators-fte/ and http://www.healthlawguideforbusiness.org/fte-calculator.
 You will need both your total number of full-time employees and the hours worked by your part-time employees. This information should be readily available in your accounting records. Remember that full-time employees are those who work more than 30 hours per week., Enter your employee data into the calculator in the relevant fields. Be sure to check whether the hours worked are entered on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis and edit your data appropriately. Double-check your information before pressing "calculate" to make sure that it is correct.
 Keep in mind that the calculation you get from the FTE calculator tool is just an estimate. You can use this number for roughly estimating FTE values for yourself for guidance or educational purposes. But these calculations should never be used as a replacement for legal or tax advice from a professional in the field. And when you need a 100% accurate calculation for business reasons, youâ€™ll need to use a different method.

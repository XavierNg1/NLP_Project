 If you notice your child has been acting well, praise those behaviors. In fact, it's a good idea to keep pointing out what they're doing well throughout the day. Reinforcing good behavior encourages kids to keep doing that behavior.For instance, if you notice your child has been good about staying by your side, say so: "You've been staying right by my side all day. Good job, Robbie!"

, While you don't want to reinforce bad behavior by trying to distract your child with a reward, you can offer them a reward if they are good all day. For instance, you could say you'll get hot chocolate at the end of the day if your child is good all day.Stick by what you say. If your child isn't good, you shouldn't follow through with your reward.
 One way to help kids get in the spirit is to get them thinking about other people. Let them help make small decisions about gift-buying, so they can think about giving it to other people. Not every kid will want to get in on the action, but many kids will love to help.For instance, you could say, "Which color of socks do you think Daddy would like best, blue or green?" Alternatively, you could say something such as, "We're going to buy a toy truck for Casey because she likes them. Which one do you think she'll like?"

, No matter what you do, your children may just not be in a mood to behave through a long shopping trip. If that's the case, the wisest course of action may be to come back another day (if at all possible) rather than just trying to just forge ahead.

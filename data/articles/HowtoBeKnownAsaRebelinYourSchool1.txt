 Learning new things is the first big step in becoming a rebel.Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and have new experiences.


Try listening to different styles of music than you usually do, or try reading a book by an author that you have never read. Reading is a great way to expose yourself to new ideas.;
, Don't just accept the rules or practices at your school without thinking about them. Contemplate them and decide if they make sense or not before deciding whether you to obey them.


Use the 5 Whys interrogation technique.Ask the question "why?" until you understand the root of cause or problem with a rule. For example, if your teacher asks you not to chew gum in class, ask "why?" Likely, she will respond that is the rule. Ask "why?" Your teacher will then explain the reason if there is one.
 Being rebellious is a sign of normal brain development and helps develop analytical thinking as an adult.Learn not to accept what others think is right, and find out what is right for yourself. Having your own opinions will not only make you more of a rebel, but it will make you more interesting to have a conversation with as well. You might even sway others to begin seeing the world as you do.


Ignore public opinions. Be yourself. Some people may not like your attitude or the image you project, but part of being a rebel is learning that everyone has an opinion.
 Say what you think, even if it isn't popular or appropriate. Don't say what others expect you to say just to live up to their expectations.

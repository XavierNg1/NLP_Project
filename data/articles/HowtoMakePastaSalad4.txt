 Fill a jar with ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of extra virgin olive oil and ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of red wine vinegar. Add ¼ cup (55 grams) sugar, 1 tablespoon of oregano, 1 teaspoon of salt, and ½ teaspoon of pepper. Close the jar and shake it until the olive oil and vinegar are no longer separated. Set the jar aside. This will give the sugar time to dissolve.
 You can also use regular pasta instead of tri-colored ones.
 Rinse all of your vegetables. Then, prepare the ingredients in the following ways:


De-seed and chop enough green peppers to fill 2 cups (350 grams).
Dice enough tomatoes to fill 2 cups (400 grams).
Chop enough red onions to fill 1½ cups (225 grams).
Cut 8 ounces (230 grams) of pepperoni into thin slices. Cut the slices in half so you get half-moon shapes.
If you were unable to find pre-sliced black olives, you will need to slice them yourself. You'll need enough to fill ½ cup (90 grams).
If you want to add some cheese, cut 8 ounces (250 grams) of provolone cheese into small, bite-sized cubes.
 Do not add the cheese yet if you are using it. You will add the cheese just before serving the salad.
 Cover the bowl with some plastic cling wrap and leave it in the fridge.
 This is enough salad to feed 8 to 12 people.

 After rinsing and drying sorrel leaves, pack the leaves tightly together, layering a couple at a time on top of one another. Roll the leaves from the side until they are in the shape of a cigar. With a sharp knife, cut the roll into thin ribbons. ¼ pound (.11 kg) of leaves should give you about two cups (475 mL) of sorrel., Slice up 1 ½ lb (.68 kg) salmon. Combine it with one tablespoon (15 mL) of shallots, dry white wine, and ½ cup (120 mL) chopped tomatoes in a saucepan.One way to make the sauce is to add cream to the wine after simmering, then combine it with wilted sorrel.
 Add ⅔ cup (160 mL) of heavy cream to a cooking pot. Heat the cream and then turn down the heat to keep it at a simmer. This prevents it from curdling under the sorrel’s acidic properties., In a separate pot, combine three tablespoons (700 mL) of butter and along with the sorrel. Use medium heat to melt the butter and begin cooking the sorrel. Stir often until the ingredients melt into a strong green color.
 Remove the simmering cream from its pot and pour it into the sorrel mixture. Stir the ingredients together and turn down the heat to keep them at a low simmer. Add two tablespoons (30 mL) of chicken stock, vegetable stock, or vermouth.
 Taste the sauce and add as much salt and pepper as you’d like for flavoring. You may also add more stock or vermouth to further thin the sauce.

 As your bathtub fills with warm water, add a couple of squirts of a mild dish washing liquid to it. Let the mixture bubble up and create suds. Once it's filled, let the solution soak for 30 minutes. Leave your tub filled up and let the soap solution break down soap scum and grime. Choose a dishwashing liquid that has a grease cutting agent for the best results.;
, Once you've allowed the solution to soak, you can remove the plug in the tub to drain it. Once all of the water is drained, use the faucet to fully rinse off any remaining soap from the surface of the tub.Saturate a clean sponge into warm water to rinse off hard to reach places.
 Use a nonabrasive cloth such as a microfiber cloth to dry down the entirety of the bathtub. Make sure to get all the areas of the bathtub, or soap scum may be left behind.


Do this once a week to keep a clean bathtub.

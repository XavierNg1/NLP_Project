 A bacon-cheddar cheese ball is a smoky and sharp cheese ball peppered with chunks of crisp bacon. To begin making this cheese ball, cook the bacon in a skillet on the stove for 5-8 minutes or until crisp. Reserve 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of the bacon fat in the skillet.

To cook the bacon, place the strips in a skillet and place it on the stovetop. Turn the heat up to medium heat. You will see that the bacon begins to release its fat, which will help to cook the bacon and make it crispy.Flip and turn the bacon every minute or so for about 5-8 minutes until it becomes browner and crispy. Then remove the bacon and reserve 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of the bacon fat.
 After you remove the bacon from the pan, lay down a few layers of paper towels, then place the bacon on top and allow the excess fat to drain off. Then crumble the bacon with your fingers into small pieces., Chop the ½ cup (120 ml) of pecans on a cutting board. Then heat the 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of bacon fat in the skillet and add the chopped pecans. Sauté the pecans for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, the remove them from the skillet and let them cool for 10 minutes., While the nuts are cooling, shred the 2 cups (480 ml) of Cheddar cheese. You can use sharp cheddar cheese or smoked cheddar cheese if you want the flavor of the cheese to compliment the smokiness of the bacon.Chop the green onion into ¼ inch (6.35 mm) rounds.
 Place all the ingredients in a large, mixing bowl, then mix them by hand until they are all combined. Once the ingredients are mixed, shape the mixture into a ball., Once you have formed the cheese into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap. Store it in the fridge for about 4 hours to let it become firm. Then serve the cheese ball or store it in the fridge for up to one week.

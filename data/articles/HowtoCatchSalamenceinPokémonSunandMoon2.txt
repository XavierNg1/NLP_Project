 For this method, you should have progressed through the game and cleared Akala island to unlock Adrenaline Orbs in the Poké Mart.,  The grass should be located on an overhang on the east.  Run around in the grass until you find a bagon.  Bagon has a pretty low encounter rate, so it will take a while to encounter.,  Then use False Swipe or Hold Back to get Bagon to 1 HP., When Bagon calls for help, it usually will call another Bagon.  ,  It will take a while, as there is a 1% chance of finding a Salamence, but be persistent and you will find one., Since Salamence can sometimes be challenging to catch, try using Ultra Balls once again.

If you knock Salamence down to 1 HP by using false swipe or hold back once again, you will likely be able to catch him with a regular pokéball.

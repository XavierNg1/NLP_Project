 Place the rice, water, and oil (or margarine) in a 2-qt (2-L) microwave-safe dish. Add the salt, if desired. Stir to combine.


Only prepare 1 cup (250 ml) of dry Arborio rice at a time when using the microwave method.
You can add 1/4 cup (60 ml) more water if you prefer creamier rice or 1/4 cup (60 ml) less if you prefer drier rice. The cooking time should remain the same, more or less, but it's best to keep watch and remove the rice early if it appears finished before the full amount of recommended time.
 Loosely cover the dish and place it in the microwave. Cook it for 5 minutes on 100 percent power.If covering the container with its lid, open any top vents or leave the lid slightly ajar to prevent too much steam and pressure from building.
If the container does not have its own lid, cover it with a sheet of microwave-safe plastic wrap.
 Reduce the microwave power setting to 50 percent and continue cooking the rice for another 15 minutes.


Note that cooking times may vary depending on microwave wattage, so you'll need to watch the rice closely during the last few minutes. Remove the rice once you see that all of the liquid has been absorbed.
Check the texture of the finished rice to verify doneness. The grains should be moist, but they should also have a firm "bite" in the center.
 Remove the dish from the microwave and let it rest for another minute. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving it.


You can serve the rice plain or toss it with additional margarine, Parmesan cheese, or black pepper.

 Sit down with your child, tell them they are not in any trouble and that you want to talk about school. Ask them how school is going. Give them the space to talk. Listen attentively and write up some notes afterward. If necessary, ask your child follow up questions to figure out whether there is a problem with a teacher, a classmate or a particular subject.For example, you could ask them:


“What do you think of your teacher this year?”
“Do you have any new friends at school?”
“Are there any really hard classes this year?”
“What is hardest about school?”;
, It is important to know whether it is one subject in particular that your child finds difficult. Although your child may be performing poorly across the board, it could be that one subject is at the root of their challenges.Start by asking your child if there is a particularly challenging subject and then inquire with their teacher:


“Is there one subject in particular that they are having a hard time with?”
“Do you think one subject is at the root of their struggle?”

, If the subject matter of one or more of their courses is too easy, your child may not be sufficiently engaged. You can determine whether it is too easy by examining the textbooks or other course materials, as well as by observing your child doing their homework. If the materials are too elementary, their struggle may be a result of disengagement rather than any learning difficulty., It is possible that your child’s school struggles are a result of inappropriate placement. Examine the textbook and related course materials to see if they are at an appropriate level of difficulty. Then, observe your child completing their homework and see how much trouble they have with it. If the material is too difficult for them, they simply need to take a lower level subject that includes appropriate introductory material. After taking the introductory course, your child may be in a better position to perform.

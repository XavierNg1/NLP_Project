 The easiest way to get rid of unused paint thinner is to find someone who needs it. Offer it to a friend or neighbor, or donate it to a local organization that could use it for renovation projects.
 Many municipalities have permanent sites available for the drop-off of hazardous materials like paint and paint thinner. Search for facilities in your area by contacting your local government, or using an online search such as Earth911.com in the US, or gov.uk/hazardous-waste-disposal in the UK.


Most hazardous waste facilities will accept pain thinner in a sealed metal or glass container. Contact your local facility if you have a large amount of waste to dispose of.
 Many jurisdictions hold annual or semiannual events for the disposal of hazardous waste. These events can be found through your local government website. Many states in the United States have a Department of Environmental Protection (or a similar branch) that organizes these events.

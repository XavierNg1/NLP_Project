 Don't use terms like "cult," "brainwashed," or "mind control." This may cause the person to become defensive, instead of being open to listening to you.Instead, be polite and inquisitive.

For example, say "I can tell you really respect Pastor Johnson. Can you tell me more?"If they ask you to join the cult, listen respectfully. If they press you to make a decision, say that you need more time to make a thoughtful decision.
 Consider your relationship with them and their stage in life when deciding how to talk to them about their desires, goals, and plans for life beyond their group, including educational plans and talents and gifts they may have (musical, software, knitting, anything), as well as family plans., Ask them how they feel about the restrictions and limitations of the cult. Keep your tone indirect and open, rather than confrontational."How do you feel about the group limiting what you are allowed to wear?"
"What do you think about the group only allowing you to date certain people?"
"I heard that your leader predicted that the world would end last year. I don't know what to think of that. What are your thoughts?"

, Avoid telling the person what to think, or forcing your ideas on them (even if you are obviously right). Being heavy-handed may drive them deeper into the cult.If you ask a question, and they don't know how to answer, let them sit and think.

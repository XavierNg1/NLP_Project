 Many dogs know obedience commands. Of course, you will know if your own dog knows commands such as sit, down, stay, and no.Communication can sometimes be the key to better understanding and a problem solved.


Verbal restraint is very valuable in those instances where a dog might get loose and start running. A well trained dog can be recalled with "come" if it is running towards danger. Proper training at an early age can help you gain this valuable restraint over your dog.
Use verbal communication first but it can also be combined with other restraint techniques.;
, Collars can be used to restrain dogs if the animal just needs general restraint. However, collars can be slipped out of, as dogs can twist trying to get away and hurt themselves or the people handling them.


Never hold the collar around the neck of a dog with protruding eyeballs (like Pugs.) If they struggle you can literally cause their eye balls to pop out of the socket, injuring the eyes and in extreme cases causing blindness., Harnesses, which fit around the dogâ€™s chest in front of and behind the front legs, are a great choice for restraint. They do not put pressure on the dog's neck like a collar does. This is a big plus for dogs with trachea that collapse or for dogs that pull very hard when on the leash.A dog is less likely to slip out of a harness than they are with a collar. In general, a harness gives a more secure and safer hold on a dog.

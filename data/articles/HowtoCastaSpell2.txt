 Many magicians consider the phases of the moon, the time of day, and other astrological configurations to be of great significance in the effectiveness of any spell. For instance, a spell seeking some kind of new beginning should be cast during a new moon, so your wish can come to fruition as the moon becomes full. Some occult research will help you figure out how to optimize the timing of your spells.
 Colors have different meanings in different magical systems. Once you look up their significance, pick one or two colors that match your intention and use colored candles or crystals to involve them in your spells.
 For expert occultists, all these items have some sort of magical significance. Go to your local new age store to pick up materials that will give power to your spells.
 Different occultists call on all sorts of different deities and religious figures to work their magic. Find a system of spiritual symbolism that works for you, and invoke those characters in your spells. Just be carefulâ€”some of these spirits have ideas of their own and can twist your intentions if you can't control them.
 In the end, casting a spell is all about directing your mental energies towards a goal. Whether or not something supernatural occurs because of your spell, stating your goal clearly and in a ritualized way can help you focus, give you confidence and make you work harder to make it happen. The more you believe in the power of your spell, the more likely it is to have a positive effect on you.

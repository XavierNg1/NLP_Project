 The easiest way to do this is to drag the PDF file into an open Chrome window.


You can also right-click on the PDF file, select "Open With", and then select Google Chrome from the list of available programs.
If the PDF won't open in Chrome, type chrome://plugins/ into the Chrome address bar and then click the "Enable" link under "Chrome PDF Viewer".;
, You can find this in the row of buttons that appears when you move your mouse to the lower-right corner of the Chrome window.

For example, let's say you have a 10-page PDF file that you want to split, with the first 7 pages in one file and the last 3 in another. In the Pages section, you would enter "1-7" to create a PDF file with the first 7 pages. You can then repeat the process to make the second document.
 You can choose the location that you want to save it as well.
 This will allow you to create two (or more) new documents from the original.


For example, your first split created a new 7-page document and now you want to create another document with the last 3 pages. You would open the original file again, go through the print options, and set the range as "8-10". You'll now have two new documents: one with the first 7 pages and the other with the last 3.

 Dampen the sponge and place a small pile of baking soda on it. Place the sponge against the effected wall area and gently rub in a circular motion. You will probably need to rinse and repeat depending upon how dramatic the line and the color. (This is probably why people find that toothpaste also works - toothpaste contains a large amount of baking soda!)

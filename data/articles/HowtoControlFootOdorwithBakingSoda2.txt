 Your shoes may be the root of the problem if you have sweaty feet. Shoes that are always damp and warm from being worn make an excellent environment for bacteria to grow.Some of the bacteria and the associated scent can then easily transfer to your feet every time you wear your shoes.
 Pour 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the heel of each shoe and shake some of the powder down to the toes. The baking soda will absorb moisture in the shoes, which will reduce the chances of growing odorous bacteria. Additionally, baking soda absorbs the already existent odors, reducing the scent left in your shoes when you put them on the next day., Do not wash the shoes with water to remove the baking soda. Remember, moisture will only increase the chances of growing bacteria and, as a result, making your feet and shoes stink.If you are having trouble removing all of the baking soda, try using a hand towel or knocking the shoes off on a hard surface.
 If you've got an older pair of shoes, or one that has built up a particularly pungent odor from being worn when working out, you may need to let the baking soda work for longer. Leave baking soda in these shoes for days at a time, replacing the powder every other day if possible.

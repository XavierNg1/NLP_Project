 Different types of wood bleaching processes require different types of bleach, and different types of bleach, in turn, call for different types of agents to neutralize their action.


If you’ve used alkali peroxide—which is popular for lightening the color of wood—you will want to neutralize with white vinegar.This is an inexpensive neutralizer that you can find at your local grocery store.
When bleaching with oxalic acid, which is good for removing stains such as iron, you want to use baking soda as a neutralizer.Like white vinegar, baking soda is cheap and can be easily found at the grocery store.
Chlorine bleach used on wood only needs to be rinsed several times with distilled water., Use your chosen bleach to remove the stain from your piece of wood, or to lighten its color, allowing the bleach to sit for the recommended amount of time.
 Once you have achieved your cleaning or color lightening goal, rinse the wood several times using distilled water before you move on to any neutralizing methods.


This will be sufficient for neutralizing the effects of chlorine bleach.
 If you are using vinegar to neutralize peroxide bleach, mix one part vinegar to two parts water. To neutralize oxalic acid, mix two tablespoons of baking soda with a half pint of hot water., Use a sponge or a rag to apply the neutralizing agent to your wood in any place that the bleach has touched and allow it to dry.

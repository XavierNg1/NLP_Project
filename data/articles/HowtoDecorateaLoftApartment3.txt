 Most loft apartments do not have closets, so you will need to be creative and use whatever you do have.


Use bookcases to hold more than just books. Stack magazines, baskets of pictures, even items such as shoes and folded sweaters.
Take advantage of furniture pieces that can be used for storage and divide up your space. Armoires and trunks are good for this purpose. You can also find bench-type ottomans that open up and hold blankets, sheets, towels and anything else you need.
 You can also take advantage of Craigslist sales, garage sales and thrift stores.


Look for budget-friendly items that will fit in your loft space and provide storage. Large bins, bookcases in different sizes and tables, benches or trunks will usually work.

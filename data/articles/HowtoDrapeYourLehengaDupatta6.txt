 Fold your dupatta to create narrow pleats and then drape the pleated fabric over your right shoulder. Pin the dupatta to your right shoulder.








Make sure that the fabric that is hanging down in front reaches just below your knees.
 Reach back and grab the back section of your dupatta with your left hand. Grab one corner of the dupatta and wrap it around your left hip. Bring the fabric in front of you, but allow most of it to hang down at your side.
 Fold the corner of the fabric once to pleat it. Then, wrap this corner around your left wrist once and pin it in place. Make sure that the pin is not visible.

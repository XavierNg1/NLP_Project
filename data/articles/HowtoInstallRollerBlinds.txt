 You'll also need a drill bit, but which kind of bit depends on your materials. If you're drilling into concrete, brick or plaster you should use a 5.0 mm diameter masonry drill bit. If you're drilling into wood or steel you should use a 3mm diameter high speed steel drill bit.;
, Mark out your drill holes, using the brackets provided as templates for the holes. Ensure that the brackets are perfectly level so that the blind rolls up and down straight. Do this by using a level when measuring and marking for your holes.
 Drill your holes into the wall, and then screw the brackets into place. Double check that they're in the right spot before you put them in place.
 Slide the end on the opposite side of the chain into the brackets first, and then slip in the chain side. Make sure the blind is firmly attached to the wall so that it won't come crashing down when you pull on the chain to roll or unroll it. Give it a few test rolls to make sure it works as expected.
 By law, the looped chain must be attached to the wall by the chain tensioner provided. Make sure you firmly attach this chain to the wall to keep it in place.


You can also attach chain stoppers to the chain to mark the blind's up and down positions. These are small balls that will prevent you from rolling the blind past these spots.

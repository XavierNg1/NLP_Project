 Before you go shopping for cosmetics, learn your face - its shape, its flaws, its best features, and its skin type. This will help the beauty advisor at the department store introduce you to products right for you.;
, Think about past experiences with cosmetic purchases and know what you liked and disliked about them. This will help you describe what you are looking for to the beauty advisor and keep them from convincing you to like something youâ€™re not sure you want.
 It's OK not to buy a $500 bottle of night cream or a $90 lip gloss. Don't be intimidated into purchasing something you weren't prepared to due to its price. There are many great skincare and color products for the budget conscience.
 If you don't know a product's purpose or how to apply it, ask. It's worthless to buy anything if once you get home you can't use it.
 It is highly recommended (especially to those with sensitive skin) trying out a product before purchasing it. Ask for a makeover or a mini-facial first. Many counters ask you to purchase items to receive these services, but at least this way you don't have to worry about having a problem returning it because you can take a day before using your purchase and see how you like it and if it's color, you can see how others like it. This is also a good way to find out how to apply it by watching it applied on you.
 It is unacceptable not to be able to try it first.

 Copy and paste music files into this Folder. Right Click/Open With/Some 'Media Player' to play the song. # Right Click on file/Open With/Choose Program/ to change your default media player. Highlight and check 'always use this program to open these files'.;
, This simplifies addressing. Copy and paste a song say 'Example' from 'My Docs'/Music Folder. It will probably be listed as some kind of audio file, mp3, wma, wav or some other. Audio extension converters can be obtained on line, to convert wma or wav extensions to mp3 or vice versa, and others.
 This address requires 'Folder Songline' to be in same Folder as web page. You can put up any number of above 'links' with corresponding song titles. But the extension must be '.m3u'.
 It is not an html file, so you can create it on your desktop and 'Save As' to your web page. Create a Notepad Desktop file and call it say MP3. On the very top line place the code: http://www.Domain.xxx/SongLine/NameOfSong.mp3. If it is a wma file, the address should be http://www.Domain.xxx/SongLine/NameOfSong.wma or other extension.
 Then 'Save As'. On 'Save as Type'/'All Files'. On File Name/ type Name of Song.m3u (Must be m3u). Then Browse to HTML file folder 'SongLine', and 'Save As'. The extension of 'Saved As' must be m3u, but is not to be confused with the http:// address at top of page, which remains mp3, ama or whatever in all cases. You need both the song file and the 'Audio Play list File' for it all to work.
 In Transfer Protocol, transfer the Folder 'SongLine' to the server-side, in the same portal as the web presentation page. Both the song file and the 'MP3 Audio Play list File' must be transferred to the server-side 'Folder/Songline'. Transfer the html file presentation page displaying the song.
 Change name of song file and title on web page. You can use the same Notepad file to add new 'Audio Play list File'. Use the same address, single line at the top, and just change the name of the song title only as: http://www.Domain.xxx/SongLine/New NameOfSong.mp3 Save/Save As: as directed in Step 4, 'New Song Name.m3u' into html Folder Songline.
 Create 'Audio Play list Files' one at a time and 'Save As' into SongLine Folder, as per Step 4. Place any number of <A HREF="SongLine/Example.m3u"> on your web page. Transfer whole affair to on-line server-side.

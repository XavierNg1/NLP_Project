 It will fly up and move in the direction of the nearest stronghold, a very rare underground structure. You throw an Eye of Ender by right clicking while holding the Eye (or by tapping "Use" on Pocket Edition).
 You will know you have found a stronghold when the Eye of Ender starts flying towards the ground.


The Eyes have a 1 in 5 chance of being destroyed after each use so bring a lot of them.
 You will probably have to dig a bit to find the stronghold.
 The stronghold will be full of mobs, so clear it out and light it up.


Don't dig straight down, as the End Portal frame is suspended directly over a shallow lava pool! If you aren't above the frame itself, you could fall into a deep dark cave and take fall damage, along with a potential attack from various hostile monsters.

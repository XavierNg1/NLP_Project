 This prank is especially useful on cake-loving siblings. Find a clean, new kitchen sponge and place it on a plate. Next, frost the sponge with icing and sprinkle it with sprinkles. Leave the plate of “cake” on counter with a fork. Sooner or later, your sibling won’t be able to resist trying a bite!Don’t use an old kitchen sponge. The icing won’t stick to the wet surface and it will smell bad.
 Surprise your sibling in the morning by freezing their breakfast. Pour a bowl of cereal the night before and put it in the freezer. The next morning, pour a small amount of milk onto the surface of the frozen cereal to make it look realistic. Place the frozen cereal in front of your sibling and watch as they attempt to eat it. This prank probably won’t work if your sibling doesn’t like cereal. They may refuse to eat it and your efforts would be wasted.
 Wait until your sibling makes themselves a cup of tea or hot chocolate. When they’re not looking, drop a few raisins into their drink. The dried fruit will sink onto the bottom of the cup. When they finish their drink, they’ll see small black insect-like chunks floating towards them.This trick works best with warm, opaque drinks like coffee, hot chocolate, and tea with milk.
 Find an old fast food drink cup with a lid and a straw. Take the lid off of the drink with the straw still inside. Next, open a small packet of hot sauce. Place the end of the straw in the hot sauce packet, set the packet and straw in the cup, and carefully replace the lid. Offer your sibling a sip of soda. When they take a drink, they’ll get a mouthful of hot sauce.Fill the cup with ice after inserting the straw and hot sauce packet. This will make the drink seem more believable.

 Scrape out the seeds into a heavy saucepan.;
, Once you see the mixture simmer, remove it from the heat.
 Then, separate the yolk and the whites and beat the eggs until well blended. Pour the eggs into the pan with the simmering sugar, milk, and cream.
 This will take about 3-4 minutes. Once time is up, remove the thickened mixture from the heat. Do not leave this stage too long or you'll end up with custard.
 After the mixture has cooled completely, pour into a suitable freezing dish (such as a baking tray with lid or cover) and place in the freezer to freeze. Periodically every 20-30 minutes, remove from the freezer and stir the mixture.


The mixture can also be whisked over a large bowl containing ice to speed up the cooling stage.
 When the ice cream has firmed up and can be scooped out with a spoon, the ice cream is ready to serve. Use a spoon or ice cream scoop.
 Add a few scoops to each bowl, top with fresh mint leaves and serve.

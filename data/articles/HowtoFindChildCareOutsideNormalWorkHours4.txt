 If you are leaving your child at a daycare, you should go scope out the facilities before you leave your kid there. Make sure that the location is clean and safe and that the caregivers are well paid and happy about their jobs. You might also inquire about what they will feed your child and if they will get any exercise. You do not want to leave your child in a place where they will get ill or be abused by their providers.When visiting with the head of the daycare, ask questions like “How much education do your caregivers have?” and “What will you feed my kid during the day?”

, When you are looking at child care providers, you should do some interviews before you hire anyone. Ask questions about their previous childcare experiences, what kind of first aid experience they have, and if they have had any kinds of legal trouble associated with children in their care. It is particularly important to interview any person who will be providing your child in-home care.Be sure to interview your family and friends, as well as any strangers that you are considering to watch your children.
You should ask things like “How long have you been watching children?” or “Do you have a certificate in CPR?”

, You should also ask around and see what other people think of specific child care providers. Ask your friends and coworkers who they would recommend and what they think of any potential providers. You can also go online and check a providers ratings and see if they are certified by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) or the National Association of Family Child Care (NAFCC).For non-accredited providers, you can also use Yelp or the Yellow Pages.

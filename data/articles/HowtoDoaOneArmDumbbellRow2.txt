 Use a controlled motion and especially at the lowest position to protect your elbow and shoulder.


Do a full range motion with your upper arm going past your body with light weights to exercise middle upper back muscles.
With medium to heavy weights, pull the weight to the level of your body. The prime mover here is the latissimus dorsi muscles and muscles can only contract, so once your upper arm goes past your body the muscles used will be the rear shoulder and upper middle back muscles.
For most exercise, including calisthenics, the turnaround at the bottom should be with control. For this exercise, do not drop the weight and let your elbows "snap" or your shoulders "slump" from the falling weight. Use control at the bottom position of this lift.
 Do not' twist your body or allow your back to round/your shoulders to hunch. Form is everything in this exercise.

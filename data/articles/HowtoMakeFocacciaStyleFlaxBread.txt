Let the batter sit for 2 to 3 minutes to thicken up. Don't leave it too long because it will become excessively thick to spread.
 Spread it out evenly. It will tend to mound in the middle - spread it away from the center somewhat to ensure a more even thickness. Do this until it is about an inch (2.5cm) or two (5cm) away from the side of the pan.


The closer it is to the side of the pan, the thinner the focaccia will be at the end of cooking.
 You can also see if it is done by touching the top gently. If it bounces back a bit, it's done. It should also be browner than what you would expect flax bread to be.
 Cut into whatever size slices you want it to be. Don't use a sharp knife. Try using a spatula.

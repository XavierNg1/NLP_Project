 The Theatre Development Fund (a non-profit created to promote theatre attendance and support the performing arts industry) has three TKTS booths in New York City that sell discount tickets for Broadway and off-Broadway shows. You can go to whichever location is most convenient, but make sure you check that location's hours on the TDF website (tdf.org).;
, This is a good way to pass time while waiting in line. (Do plan on having some wait time--this is a very popular method among avid theatregoers.) TKTS recommends having three shows in mind that you would like to see because ticket availability is limited.
 Discount percentages (even for the same show) may be different every day, so if you have a maximum ticket price in mind, TKTS staff can help you find a show that will fit your budget.
 TKTS sells Broadway tickets for same-day performances only, so between the time spent waiting in line for tickets and then seeing the show, this method will take up most of an afternoon or evening.

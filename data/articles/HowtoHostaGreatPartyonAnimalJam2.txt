 Call out at Jamaa Township, "Epic {Theme Here} party at my den!" After about fifteen people come, head back to your den and begin to party!

, Don't just sit there doing nothing, have a competition or a dance-off! If you do nothing, your guests will grow bored and leave. You may even want to host a mini fashion show.
 Eventually, the time will come for the party to end. Tell everyone, "Okay, everyone! The party is finished now. I hope you all had fun!" If people refuse to leave, and become a hassle, lock your den.
 If your den looks fine as it is, then leave it! If you think people will come in and say, "What happened here?!" then clean it up.

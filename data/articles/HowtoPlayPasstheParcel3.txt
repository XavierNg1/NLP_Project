 Only this time, you have extra work to do. Instead of a gift on each layer, you leave a label. The label should state "For the person who...". Add reasons such as: "is wearing green", "has a pink ribbon", "likes penguins", "got an A in math this week" etc. The labels should be more descriptive the better you know the children, and less descriptive for parties where you aren't very familiar with the children.


Colors, hairstyles, types of clothing and shoes are always a safe bet.
Read "Tips" for how to make this more fun for adults.
 This version does not require music. Rather, each player reads out the labels and everyone in the group has to guess who the parcel is meant for. The person who made the parcel should act as the umpire if there is any disagreement.


Everyone should still sit in a circle; it makes seeing each other a lot easier. If it's for adults, everyone can be seated on couches and chairs in a sort-of circular way around the room.
 The last unwrap is the winner; sometimes it can be nice to make sure that this goes to a particular person, such as the birthday girl/boy or the kid who never wins anything.

 Make sure that the bowl is safe to go into the microwave.If you can't find any crackers, some cookies or cereal would also work.
 The large, chunky flakes will look the best, but you can use the kind that are cut up too., Stir it with a spoon. Mash those cracker bits up so they get soggy., This will be just enough to make the vomit a little chunky, but still watery. Use oven mitts or a pot holder to take the bowl out of the microwave., You could also chew up a mini carrot, then spit it back into the bowl. This will make the vomit look even more real., This will help give it some color and ickyness.If you don't have honey, you could try maple syrup, agave nectar, or pancake syrup.
 Make sure that you scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.
 Pour it down the front of your shirt, or dump it into the toilet. Get some on the floor. You can also take some into your mouth, then lean over and spit it out. Make some puking sounds!

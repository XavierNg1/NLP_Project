External identification: Make sure to purchase a collar as soon as you can since no matter how careful you are dogs can still get on the loose. You can buy one in many different styles and colors but make sure you get one that fits nice and snug; preferably one that fits two fingers. Have the correct information; the dog's name and your cell number for people to contact you in the case he/she gets lost.
Microchip Identification: In the case your dog gets lost and the collar comes off it is important to get a microchip placed by the vet. Then if someone returns the dog to the vet they can easily find s/his owner.;
, This is extremely important to prevent rabies in your dog., Due to dog overpopulation this is a very important part of owning a dog. If s/he isn't already add to the list of things to do as soon as you can.

 Wait an additional hour or two for the oven to cool. Most self-cleaning ovens do not allow you to open them until they are completely cooled.
 If it still says words like “Lock” and “Cool,” then it is still in the midst of the cooling process. It is best to wait until it is finished.
 Note that it will still require a cool down period before unlocking.

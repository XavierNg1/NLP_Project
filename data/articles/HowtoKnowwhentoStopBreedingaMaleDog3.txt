 As your dog ages, keep a critical eye on him and evaluate him frequently. You should make sure the dog continues to adhere to breed standards. If your dog is not up to standards, he should not be bred.


For example, your dog’s coat should stay a certain way, and his gait should be up to par. These things may deteriorate with age and may affect the dog’s breeding.
 If your male dog has produced a smaller litter size than you expected, it may be time to stop breeding him. This can be an indication of a fertility problem with your male dog.You can compare the litter sizes to previous sizes of litters your dog has sired.
If your dog hasn’t sired many different litters, you can compare the litter size to litters from other dogs of the same breed.
 Some male dogs can experience hormonal changes, which can affect their reproduction. Due to these hormonal changes, your male dog may no longer be interested in mating with females in heat.

 If you are swatching a pressed powder such as eyeshadow or blush, you should press the pad of your finger lightly on the surface of the makeup and rub it in circles a few times. This will lift the product from the casing onto your finger.


Notice the consistency of the product. Sometimes fakes are creamier or softer than the genuine products. Donâ€™t be fooled by this.
If you are swatching lipstick or any other makeup that uses an applicator, rub the product directly onto the skin. For example, run the tip of a lipstick directly onto the surface of the skin to see how the color appears.
If you do not want to use your fingers, you can also use a brush. Rub the brush on the product in order to coat the bristles with enough product to transfer it to your skin. Try a concealer or eyeshadow brush, which can be obtained at any beauty supply store.
 Once you have some of the product on your finger, gently swipe it along the inside of your arm, where the skin is soft and hairless. You can also do this on the back of your hand, whichever is easier for you. The goal is to see how the makeup appears on the skin., The counterfeit MAC products usually have less pigmentation than the genuine ones and will require you to go over the surface of your skin two or more times to be able to clearly see the color on the surface of the skin. Swatching it next to a similar or identical product should allow you to see the discrepancies between the two products.

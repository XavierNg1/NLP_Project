 This will enable the group members to focus on the task in hand. Too many meetings try to do too much.


Clear perception of what the goal will bring to the organisation/person/situation motivates others and ourselves.;
, We all process information through our senses in a variety of ways. We may all visualise, feel, express the goal through a different preferred sense. Building rapport helps to keep us communicating in a way others can relate to

, Gathering possible ways of getting there should be a conversation, a sharing and an exploration. The group should discuss options, review pros and cons, and settle on the best path available.
 Observing behaviour in meetings can demonstrate that the attendees are so busy trying to undermine others, make a point, find a soundbite, or deal with anxiety that they don't remain subject-focused. Meetings like this are often a waste of everybody's time.
 Set roles and expectations. Who would like to do what? Whose strengths would suit which part of the task?

, It's best to keep specific goals small on the path to change. Change sometimes takes a long time but if the culture and attitudes are to develop, the organisation needs to be ready to embrace the change.
 Emotional intelligence from within the group can assist members to consider new options and alternatives. A supportive meeting environment helps ensure that people don't just stick to the status quo and get stuck in a rut.
 Information sharing does not always need to be undertaken in meetings. Ongoing conversations in person, via email, and using other technology can help groups meet their goals. An information sharing Wiki is a great place to share information on a topic and invite others to consider.

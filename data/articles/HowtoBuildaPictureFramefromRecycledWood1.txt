 The length should be the height and width that you want the picture frame to be. The wood can come from sources such as old frames, old furniture, old wooden items, etc.


If you can't cut wood yourself, have a hardware store do it to your required measurements. You may need to make a token payment for the help.;
, Glue the ends, then place the width sides on top of the longer lengths. Overlap the wood, to make it interesting to look at.
 Glue to the back of the frame on three sides but leave the top edge unstuck. This allows room for you to slide in the picture.
 Personalize the frame with your choice of designs. Suggestions include:


Use markers to add stripes, spots or patterns
Use glitter to add color
Glue wooden cut-outs to the frame.
 Done.

 For these earrings, you will need 22 gauge wire, small wire cutters, jeweler's pliers, French hook earwires, and rondelle cut beads.While specialty jeweler's pliers will be easier to work with, any other type of round nose pliers will also work fine. Other small pliers will do in a pinch.
Rondelle beads are small, round, flat beads typically used as spacers in beaded jewelry. They can be made of anything from glass to precious gemstones. Pick one to three colors to work with.
Depending on the exact size of your rondelle beads, you'll be using about three per earring.
 Unravel a small piece of your wire from its spindle. Straighten it out so you can get an accurate measurement. Measure out four inches of wire for each earring and cut using your wire cutters., For each earring, use your fingers to bend a length of wire so that it forms an oval or teardrop shape.Have the two ends cross at the top into a V-shape. The entire wire should now resemble a fish.
 Slide your beads of choice onto each wire loop. Add only about as many will fit on the bottom edge of the teardrop. This will be about three rondelle beads., Use your pliers to hold the right side wire. Twist it gently to form a loop. Fold the right side wire underneath the left.
 Using your fingers, wrap your right side wire around the crossing point twice. Trim off the small portion of right side wire that remains. Then, wrap your left side wire around the crossing point from top to bottom. At this point, your earring should be made up of two loops separated by a short, tight coil. Your beads will be at the free end of a much larger loop opposite a tiny, more circular one., Use your pliers to gently open up each earwire's small circular fastener (its jump ring). Hang each of your earrings onto an open fastener by its smaller loop. Use your pliers to close the earwires back up, and you now have a finished set of handmade earrings.

Don't apply so much that it drips down your face.
 If you do this in the morning, just go about your day normally at home, or go out with the oil and stain on your face if you’re confident enough! If you do this at night, you might as well sleep with the baby oil on you.


Cover the stained area with gauze bandages or cotton balls and athletic tape to make sure the oil and dye don’t get all over your pillows and sheets while you sleep.
 Use your hands or a washcloth to gently scrub the stain away.

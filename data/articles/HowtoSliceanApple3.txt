 Hold the apple upside-down, and slice vertically through the fruit a few centimeters away from the core. Make two parallel cuts: one on each side of the core, so that the apple falls into three pieces.
 Make two more vertical cuts in the apple, equidistant from the core but perpendicular to the first two cuts. The apple should be sliced into a neat grid with nine clean pieces. The central piece is the core., The band should be tight enough to hold the apple solidly together. If the rubber band is loose, try double-wrapping it. Alternately, wrap the apple in saran wrap or anything else that will hold the pieces together.
 Now, you have an easy-to-eat apple snack that you can bring along with you on your daily journey. The band will hold the apple together without exposing the delicate insides to the air. This will keep the apple from browning.,

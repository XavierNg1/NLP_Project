Although they are mature enough to understand the reasons for the relocation, they might not accept it or be prepared emotionally to leave their friends and their status. There is no doubt, moving can very difficult at this age.
 Many parents postpone telling their teens they are moving, hoping that it will be a surprise and they will accept it easier but often that's not the best method. Telling your teens early on will generally make it easier all the way around. This will give them time to process the ideas and prepare for the loss of their friends. Saying goodbye to their friends takes time and it's not an easy task. Many of them like to do special things together so they will have good memories. You might even plan a moving away party for them with all their close friends.
 Teens usually have their social skills developed by now and have no problem making new friends but even the most social teens may worry about fitting in with the new crowd or starting over again. Before spending money on new school clothes it might help to visit their new school and let your child take notice of any certain styles or fads that may be new to your child.
 Remember they are experiencing a sense of loss and need parental support. They will be less likely to show signs of anger, resentment or even depression if you support them well.

 To do a basic set of curls, section your hair first. Use hair clips or hair ties to section your hair into four different sections There should be one in front, one in back, and two on the sides of your head.








Make sure the sections are roughly equal.
 Un-clip your hair from one of the sections. It does not matter which section you start with. Take a strand of hair about an inch wide and hold your curling wand vertically at the side of your head. Starting with the tips, wrap your hair around the wand. Hold the hair for three to four seconds before releasing your hair from the wand. You should be left with a long, wavy curl.








If the curl is tighter than you want, run your fingers through it to loosen it.
 Keep curling your the section you started with strand by strand until it's fully curled. Repeat this with each section of hair until you have a full head of curls.
 Take the hairspray you regularly use. Give your hair a gentle misting. This should help your look stay in place throughout the day.

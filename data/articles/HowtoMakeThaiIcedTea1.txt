 Fill a pot with boiling water, then add the tea leaves. Cover the pot with a lid, and let the tea steep for 5 minutes


For a more traditional tea, use Thai black tea leaves.;
, If you used a tea infuser, simply pull it out. If you used loose tea leaves, pour the tea into a separate pot through a fine, mesh sieve, and discard the loose leaves.
 Add the sugar first, and stir it until it dissolves. Next, stir in the condensed milk.
 If you are in a hurry, you can put the pot into an ice bath. Do this by filling a sink with ice, placing the pot into the sink, and then stirring the tea with a whisk while it cools down.
 Fill 6 glasses with ice, then fill each glass Â¾ of the way with tea.


If you need to make fewer servings, simply pour the rest of the tea into a pitcher, and store it in the fridge.
 Evaporated milk is the most traditional, but you can also use whole milk, half-and-half, or coconut milk.

 You can connect with the MS community by joining an online group. Online groups are geared towards the specific interests of those living with MS.

 Blogs are another way you can connect with others online in the MS community. Many MS organizations have blogs you can follow and interact with others on.

The information is not back by medical experts, but the tips and stories come from people living with the condition.

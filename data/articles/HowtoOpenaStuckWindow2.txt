 Spread wax from the bottom of a candle into the window channel. The wax will help allow the window to slide up and down and prevent future sticking., Wood may swell due to humidity causing windows to become stuck. Drying out the wood may help the window open more easily.Run a hair dryer along the edges of the window frame for several minutes. After drying the wood, try opening the window.
Place a dehumidifier in a room with stuck windows. Lowering the humidity in the room should help reduce the swelling of the window frames.
 If the window is in a wooden frame, place a wood block along the channel where the window opens and hammer it gently to depress the wood. Make the channel wider to allow the window to move more freely.
 Be careful when using spray lubricants as they may discolor some surfaces or damage some types of paint.


If the window opens outward on hinges, spray the hinges with the lubricant for smoother operation.
 After you get the window to open one time, open and close it several times to loosen the action of the window. If it still sticks, check the frame to ensure that it isnâ€™t warped or damaged from water.


Window frames with severe water damage may need to be replaced entirely.

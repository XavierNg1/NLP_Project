 An equilateral triangle has three equal side lengths and three equal angle measurements, so if you know the length of one side, you know the length of all three sides.For example, you might have a triangle with three sides that are 6 cm long.
 The formula is Area=(s2)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(s^{2}){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the length of one side of the equilateral triangle., Make sure you substitute for the variable s{\displaystyle s}, and then square the value.

For example if the equilateral triangle has sides that are 6 cm long, you would calculate:Area=(s2)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(s^{2}){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}Area=(62)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(6^{2}){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}Area=(36)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(36){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}


, Itâ€™s best to use the square root function on your calculator for a more precise answer. Otherwise, you can use 1.732 for the rounded value of 3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}}.

For example:Area=(36)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(36){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}Area=62.3524{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {62.352}{4}}}


, This will give you the area of the triangle in square units.

For example:Area=62.3524{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {62.352}{4}}}Area=15.588{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=15.588}So, the area of an equilateral triangle with sides 6 cm long is about 15.59 square centimeters.

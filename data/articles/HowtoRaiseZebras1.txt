 If something bad happens to the zebra, all the responsibility is yours. Make sure you read all the rules of your country/state for owning a zebra before applying one.


Make sure you don't apply an endangered or rare species of zebras.;
, You have to have at least 2 years of experience for caring exotic animals (including one year for the animal you want to own, which, in this case, is the zebra). You will also need to be interviewed, including everyone in your family about zebras, so be prepared. Don't forget that your house needs to be suitable for a zebra.


Zebras can only be pets in some states only. If you have a zebra as an illegal pet, huge penalties may apply.
 You'll need $3000 - $7000 for only one zebra. You'll need a huge property enough to fit one zebra. It's great if you actually live in the safari rather than the city. You'll also need to build a huge and strong fence around the area so they don't escape.
 These two states have only a few restrictions on exotic-pet ownership, and you don't need permission from the local governments to start a zebra farm.

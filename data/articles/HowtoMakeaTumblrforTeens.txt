 We all have our inner-fanatics! Are you obsessed with Harry Potter? Do you love The Hunger Games or Twilight? Is True Blood the best show on tv? Do you fangirl over the members of One Direction or The Wanted, or even Foo Fighters, The Strokes, Arcade Fire or The Beatles? Do you just really love fashion and models? Maybe you just love grungy things! Or perhaps you just really love all things Disney or you love animals or you love make-up or you like skateboarding. You can just simply enjoy everyday humor and you want a blog to share about your life. ;
,, There's blogs for pretty much anything. Search on the tags anything like "fashion, Miranda Kerr, James Franco, nirvana, psychedelic, elephants, landscape, Pretty Little Liars" etc, and from there, start reblogging the things that you like and you want on your blog!

,, Pick a theme, try going to the blogs you follow, if you like their theme, look for a link that says " install theme" on the upper right corner and click it to get that theme! Have your ask box open so people can talk to you. 

, Talk to people and make friends! Over time you will bond with these people and make cool internet friends!

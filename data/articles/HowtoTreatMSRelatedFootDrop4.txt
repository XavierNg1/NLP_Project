 Generally, foot drop is easily treated. This is usually done through physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, or other treatments. However, the first treatment may not work for you. Often, it takes multiple attempts to find the one that is right for you and your lifestyle.Don’t get discouraged if the first treatment is not successful. Foot drop is treatable once the right treatment is found for you.
 Most of the time, there is a treatment available to help foot drop. Working with your doctor and physical therapist, you will come up with a treatment tailored to your specific MS condition and your lifestyle. However, not everyone is accepting of treatments. To ensure success, don’t be reluctant to try treatments suggested by your care team.Many people just assume foot drop means they cannot walk. This is not true. It may be a challenge, but one that you can overcome with the help of your care team. For example, your physical therapist may recommend using a cane to improve your stability and prevent falls. Work with your physical therapist to learn the proper way to use a cane for foot drop.
Adapting your body and your way of doing a certain activity can ensure you keep doing what you enjoy.
 Early detection is essential for successfully treating foot drop. When you suffer from foot drop, your toes drop down when you lift your leg to take a step instead of pointing up. This causes you to drag your foot and toes on the ground. You may have experienced a scrape on your toes due to this, and your toes may slap against the ground.You may notice a high stepping gait to try to correct the dragging of your foot.
You may swing your hip in an exaggerated way to keep the toes from dragging the ground.
Your foot may appear limp.
You may find that your foot is numb, tingles, or is painful.
You may trip often when climbing stairs, stepping off a curb, or walking across an uneven surface.

 You don't need to think about those right now. Take a good break from the studies.


Don't throw anything away, just in case you need to sit an exam again. You never know.;
, It's done now and you cannot change it so put it to the back of your mind.


Avoid doing post-mortems on the exam with your friends. There is no point and at least one of you is bound to be completely wrong.
 Do not feel guilty about not studying. It can be hard to come off the study treadmill initially but let yourself do so quickly. Sleep in if you can, take longer to get ready in the mornings and relax often.
 Choose books, comics, magazines and papers that interest you so that you can enjoy yourself when reading. None of this should be a chore.
 These will require having energy again, but they may also energize you by being there. Grab some friends and either hold a party of your own or go to other parties you know about. Dance the night away and catch up on all the missed gossip.
 Lie back, turn on the music and simply enjoy listening to it for a while.
 Grab a few friends and do some interesting drives. Or grab your soulmate and take a long drive somewhere special. Go to places you love visiting and enjoy your time there.
 Watch as many as you like. Or, watch films online or on TV. Invite friends over, so that you won't be lonely.
 Go for a bike ride, a swim or a visit to the gym. Get a new exercise regime underway, to help you restore fitness that you might have neglected during the exam period.
 Go for a hike, a stroll or even a camping trip. Getting into nature can help you to relax and feel completely away from everything for a time.


Try some stargazing. It's a relaxing and fun way to spend a few nights with friends, on the back lawn. You could even pitch tents out there together.
 Spend more time with your pets. They might have noticed you were stressed for a while, so give them your less stressed self now and plenty of attention.

 Before using a stretching spray, read any warnings and instructions provided on the label.


Some stretching sprays may not be safe for all forms of leather. As a result, you should verify that the label does not warn against use on specific types of leather boots.
The instructions are usually fairly similar, but there can be slight variations here or there. To ensure the most benefit and least amount of damage, follow the instructions carefully.
Also make a note of the active ingredients used in the stretching spray. Some sprays are made of little more than rubbing alcohol, in which case, they can be used interchangeably with rubbing alcohol for the purpose of stretching your boots out.
 Spray a small amount of the stretching spray onto a hard-to-spot area of the boot, like the very top back or very bottom of the leather, near the sole of the boot.


Some stretching sprays may stain certain types of leather, especially if the leather is light in color. Performing this test can save you from creating a large stain on a clearly visible portion of your boot.
If the area you test stains, do not use the spray for the rest of the boot. If it does not stain, the spray should be safe to use.
 Douse the tight area of the boot with your stretching spray, as well as the surrounding area. Make sure that the spray is evenly spread out over the entire area.


Apply the spray from a distance of 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm).Let the leather absorb the spray for 30 seconds or so.
You do not need to spray areas that are nowhere near the portion of the boot you plan to stretch.
 Put the boots on your feet as soon as the leather has absorbed the spray but before it feels dry to the touch.


Keep the boots on your feet for as long as possible to maximize the stretching effect.
 Slip off the boots when necessary, but check them again a few hours later to see if the stretch held. If not, repeat the process a second time.

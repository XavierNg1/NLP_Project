 Place the stained item in a sink or bath tub. Rinse through the back of the stain with cold water. Avoid rubbing the fabric, as it can cause blood stains to set into fabric., Using an enzymatic cleaner to treat blood stains is a good choice, as enzymes are proteins that have been engineered to break down other proteins. Purchase an enzyme-based pre-treatment spray, or make an enzyme soak using 4 cups of cold water and 1 tbsp. of enzyme detergent. Let the treatment set in for 30 minutes, then rinse with cold water.Avoid using enzymes on wool or silk items., Hydrogen peroxide is an effective tool for removing blood stains, but it is better to use on light-colored clothing as it may fade or discolor fabric. Test a small, hidden corner of the fabric by adding a drop of hydrogen peroxide and letting it sit for several minutes. If no discoloration is visible on the test spot, apply a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to the stain and blot it with a clean cloth.Reapply the hydrogen peroxide as needed until the stain disappears.
 Fill your kitchen sink 3/4 full with cold water. Add a cup of table salt to the water and soak the stained item in the water for an hour. Rinse the stained item and launder it as usual.Alternatively, make a paste of salt and water, apply it directly to the stain, and let it sit for an hour.
 After pre-treating, launder the stained item as usual with a detergent that contains enzymes (which will usually be indicated on the bottle). Most environmentally friendly brands of detergent use enzymes because they are biodegradable. Be sure that the stain has lifted during pre-treating before washing it, as it is likely to set in permanently after being laundered and dried.

 A good gauge for your cardâ€™s value is the card count. This is the number of cards available for the exact same card. The lower the number, the fewer cards there are, the rarer it is. A card with 1,000 count is rarer than a card with 5,000 count. Find this number on the lower right corner of the rear of the card.

 The precise amount in the can makes all the difference to its balancing ability. This amount isn’t precise (not without a heaping helping of math), so you will have to adjust as necessary., You want to tip the soda so that it rests on the groove that encircles the bottom of the can. Take care, as the movement of the liquid will cause the balance of the can to teeter until the liquid comes to rest.


You’re looking to reach the center of balance between the can and liquid inside. On most soda cans the amount of liquid required will be the same, but this can depend on the size of the can.Keep trying until you get the feel for the tilt and the balance. Work slowly! Move too hastily and you will spill the soda everywhere.
 Keep your hands close to the can on your first tries so you won't spill it everywhere. If the can will not balance, you may have to drain additional liquid from the can, or even add more liquid.


Lean the can "backwards", away from the opening you drink out of. That way, if it does fall over, you can pick it up again before much spills out.
 Once you have mastered balancing the can at a 45 degree angle, try giving it a gentle push. It will slowly roll around on its edge and look even more astounding. Behold the power of science!

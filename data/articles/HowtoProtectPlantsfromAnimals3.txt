 As the deer population explodes throughout the United States it's wise to select plants that deer don't normally eat. These plants are not deer-proof as a starving deer will eat anything. However these deer-resistant plants are last on the menu. Other plants will be munched on by critters regularly but grow back so rapidly they survive the attack.

Many garden catalogs, plant reference books, tags and websites will list plants that are deer resistant and rodent proof. There are some plants any animal won't touch because it's poisonous. Euphorbia lathyris Gopher Spurge is very toxic to gophers and moles and they don't like even it's smell. Toxic as well for humans if eaten. Many bulbs are also toxic to eat for both rodents and humans. Garlic and related plants are not very appetizing to many wild animals but a delicacy for humans.
Consider buying yellow cherries which birds don't like. If your interested in growing cherries as a food crop, you might want to try growing cultivars with the fruit being pink or yellow in color instead of traditional red. These taste the same as the red ones and birds don't eat them for some reason.
Choose more suitable plants for a landscape as well. Sturdy tall ornamental grasses and shrubs will be very much able to withstand a playful dog, munching deer better than delicate annual flowers.
Try planting a species of plant that you know the wildlife favors in your landscape somewhere in your landscape along with your desired plants.If you plant a sunflower patch or a native wildflower bush that produces berries the birds are going to most likely eat those more aggressively than your prized blueberries.

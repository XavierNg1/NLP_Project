 iTunes will play videos that are in the following three formats: .mov, .mv4, and .mp4.


A good test for whether your video will play in iTunes is to try opening it in QuickTime, if you have it. If it plays in QuickTime, you can play it in iTunes.
If your video file is not in one of those three formats, you'll have to convert it. There are a variety of software downloads online that can accomplish this. Browse around forums and read reviews to find the best one for your needs.;
,,, Locate the video file you want to put into your iTunes library. To select multiple files, hold down Control (Windows) or Command (Mac) as you click.
 Once you have selected all of your files, click "OK" or "Open" to add them to your library.
 You can also drag and drop your video files from a folder right into iTunes, as long as they're in the correct format.

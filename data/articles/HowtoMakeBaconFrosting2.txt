 Blend on high speed for about two minutes, until the mixture is light and fluffy., Blend on low speed for a few seconds so the extracts can combine in with the frosting., Chop the bacon slices into inch-sized pieces. Pour the heavy cream into the frosting and toss in the bacon bits. Blend until properly combined., Add the shredded coconut into the frosting and blend for about a minute until the frosting is blended fully. The results should be a white colored frosting with the bacon bits., Use the frosting to top off cupcakes, cakes, muffins, brownies, and/or any other desired desserts. Store any leftover frosting in the fridge covered with plastic wrap.

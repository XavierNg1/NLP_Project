 One stick needs to measure approximately 70cm (27 inches) in length, while the other should measure approximately and 30 centimeters (12 inches) in length.

The longer stick is called Ălăk and the shorter one Dolăk.;
,, Put the two stones or bricks at a distance from each other equal to the length of the shorter stick, Dolăk, then balance the shorter stick on top of them. This is the stick that the players will hit., The members of the groups are selected by the “heads”, who are usually the older and more experienced players on the playground., The team is chosen by drawing lots. Once chosen, have this team stand behind the stones. The members of other team, keeping a short distance between each other, stand 20 to 30 meters (65.6 to 98.4 ft) away from the first team., The player must then hit the shorter stick (Dolăk) balanced on the stones or bricks. It needs to be hit hard, in order to cause it to move towards the part of the playground where the other team is standing. If the players of the other team can catch the stick in the air before it hits the ground, they will win the round, which starts off the next round (switching teams). However, if they fail to catch the stick, it will fall somewhere on the ground.

Throw long and hard. The farther the stick falls from the stones, the harder the next move will be for the first team to achieve.
 The aim is to ensure that the Dolăk falls a distance shorter than the length of the Ălăk (70cm/27 inches) from the stones or bricks. This will then start the next round.

The team will also win if the Dolăk passes through (in between) the two stones.
 The team with the most accurate throws will win the whole game.

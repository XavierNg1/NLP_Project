 While you can do a lot to prevent your white carpet getting dirty, it is recommended that you get your carpet more thoroughly cleaned by professionals every 12 to 18 months.This method, also known as steam cleaning, involves pre-spraying the carpet with soap, then applying a fine spray of hot water to rinse the soap. Finally, the waste water should be extracted so that no soapy film remains on the carpet.It is also beneficial for health reasons as the hot temperatures kill any mould, bacteria and pollutants stuck in the soft surface of the carpet. As many as one hundred times more pollutants are found indoors than outdoors., There are lots of businesses offering to clean carpets, but make sure to select one with insurance (in case something happens to your carpet during cleaning) and a valid certification.


Ensure that the company has the necessary qualifications from the IICRC (Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification). You can find further information on their website.Get multiple quotes from different companies and beware of "discount" carpet cleaners., Professionals will likely do a more thorough job but they can be expensive. You can rent a steam cleaner from a hardware store and give it a go yourself.


Vacuum before you begin to get the top layer of dirt off as steam-cleaners are designed to wash the carpet and get at ground in dirt.Remove furniture and pick up all items lying around the floor.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific device you are using.
Most carpet steam cleaners lay the water down when you push the machine forward and extract it when you pull back.
If this is the case, be sure to slowly pull the machine over the carpet to extract as much water as possible.
Excess water left behind may soak the carpet padding and cause mould or mildew issues.Use in the summer months when you can keep windows open for ventilation and to speed up drying.

 Use windshield cleaner to clean the inside and outside of your windshield at least once a month. If you know you are about to drive for a lengthy period at night, make sure to clean your windshield beforehand as well.Alternatively, you can use a mixture of water, dishwashing detergent and vinegar to clean your windshield. Mix six cups (1,400 ml) of water, a tablespoon (30 ml) of detergent and a cup (240 ml) of vinegar together until well-combined. Fill a spray bottle with the mixture and use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe your windshield clean.;
, Clean your side mirrors and windows once a month, or as they become dirty. You can use the detergent-vinegar solution to clean these as well. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth. Wipe the inside and outside of your windows clean, as well as the surfaces of your outside mirrors.To avoid streaks, make sure to dry your windows and side mirrors with a clean microfiber cloth afterwards.
 You can use toothpaste to do this. Wet your headlights with a damp cloth. Apply a tablespoon (30 ml) of toothpaste to each headlight. Using the damp cloth, scrub the toothpaste over the entire surface. Scrub for one minute, focusing on dirty areas. Then rinse the headlights with water and dry them with a clean microfiber cloth.If the toothpaste method does not work, then you may need to get your headlights professionally buffed and cleaned.

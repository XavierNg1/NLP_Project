 There are 8 food allergens that the FDA must identify on package labels. Wheat is included in the list, but the 3 other grains are not required to be labeled by the FDA.


Look for the word "wheat" in the ingredients list. You also may see "contains wheat" directly following the list.
Read the label carefully for rye. Rye contains gluten, an although it is not typically used as an ingredient in foods, it will be labeled in the ingredients list if it was used.
Check for barley. This grain is widely used in foods and will be listed in the ingredients. Be careful to look not only for the word barley, but barley malt or malt. These may be listed under "flavoring."
Look for oats as an ingredient. Although plain oats do not contain gluten and are safe to consume when on a gluten-free diet, they often are mixed with or contaminated by wheat.;
, Some labels will only list a certain ingredient without breaking it down. For example, a container of ice cream may list cookie dough as an ingredient, but may not be required to list the ingredients of the cookie dough, which may contain flour.
 These are labels that advise the consumer that the food may have been prepared near products containing gluten (or within the same processing plant). These labels are not required by the FDA and are placed on packaging by the manufacturer, so look closely at the entire label.

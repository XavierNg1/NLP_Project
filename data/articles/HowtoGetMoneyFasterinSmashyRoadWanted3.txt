 These cars give you 5x money for each piece of money you collect. You must have a vast amount of game money to get legendaries, or you can us real money to buy the legendaries. If you do plan on using real money, it is highly advised that you get The Beast rather than the Money Man. The Beast has more speed and health than the Money Man.
 Stay in the middle of the road, and move when about to crash.

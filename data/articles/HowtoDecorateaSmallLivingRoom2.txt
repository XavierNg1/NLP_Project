 Mirrors can easily make a small space look larger -- we've all walked into a room that, upon first impression, was huge, but with a second glance, it was just our eyes being tricked. If you can, use a mirror that expands vertically.


Sometimes it's not that simple, however. Mirrors work best by reflecting light -- so make sure they're facing light itself or a light-colored wall. Check to see what gets reflected in your mirror by standing in different points of the room.
 To really appreciate any room, the lighting has to be right, but this goes double in a small room. All curtains should be light and airy and able to be drawn back -- after all, natural light is best.


To avoid the space taken up by lamps, go for wall sconces; you don't need an electrician anymore for that, either -- the new-fangled ones can be attached anywhere. If applicable, get light over pieces of artwork, too. Think in natural light (from windows), ceiling lights (preferably dimmable), sconces, and table lamps. If there are no dark corners in your room, you've succeeded.
 There are going to be things you need in the room that you may wish you didn't, so get creative when it comes to storing them. Invest in some cute cubes, boxes, or baskets. They'll be less distracting and keep the room from feeling overwhelming.


Keep the knickknacks on your tables and mantle to a minimum. The less clutter in the room, the better you'll feel about being in it. Put away what you don't need and what doesn't heighten the ambience of the space.
 If your budget allows, design some light-colored cabinets or shelving you can build into the room. Not only will this draw the eye upward, but it gives the room character and function, too. And more storage for you!


If you don't have the option to build in, get creative. Utilize space under pieces of furniture or put up a shelf or two. Buy an end table that can double as a bookcase and place hooks on the walls.

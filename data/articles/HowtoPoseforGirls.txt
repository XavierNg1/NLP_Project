 Stand next to the poster of a movie with your favorite star in the picture. Pose as if you were standing next to him, facing him. Have a friend take a picture because it looks as if you were really next to him.;
, Stand in the doorway, and strike a pose as if you were a mannequin. Do not move your body or your face. People will stop and stare at you, wondering if you were real, or fake.
 Walk behind him, as if you were going inside, but stop right behind him. Have a friend take a picture, and it will look as if you were with him.
 The scene will always remind you of the time you were visiting that particular site. If you are alone, ask a stranger passing by, to take your picture and hand them the camera or cell phone to use.

For example if you're really fun and crazy, do a funky one with maybe a different pose, angle and colors.
 You could create different effects for the picture on your phone and also edit!

, Remember people want to talk to people who look natural, confident and not fake so don't do the whole "caked in makeup, flash in the mirror, body out" if this isn't you because you'll give a false image.


However if that is you and you want a sexy picture in underwear for example make it subtly sexy. Pull a pout, curve your body and maybe make a suggestive gesture such as holding your thong down or your finger in your mouth.
Remember a sexy smile can be achieved by tilting the head to the side and back and putting your tongue behind your teeth.
Be careful with pictures like this though! Make sure you look at it intently for a long time before you upload just in case of any little issue that you may notice later for example your underwear on the floor behind you!

, It should not be busy and should help focus on the attention on you for example contrasting colours, if you're in black have a sharp white background!

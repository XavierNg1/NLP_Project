 Line a baking sheet with an oven-safe silicone baking mat. Place the baking sheet in the oven and allow it to warm up.
 Combine the three ingredients in a 2-qt (2-liter). Allow the ingredients to boil down into a syrup, reducing the heat once it actually begins to boil. Cook over medium-low for 30 minutes., It should be about 285 degrees Fahrenheit (140.6 degrees Celsius). Once the syrup reaches this temperature, you should remove of from the heat., Mix the peppermint extract into the syrup quickly to make sure that it is thoroughly combined before the syrup begins to cool., By now, it should be sufficiently warm., You should pour the syrup into the center of the mat, rather than near the edges, and allow it to spread naturally., Fold the edges of the mat up to keep the syrup in a confined, narrow strip until it cools just enough to stop running., Once it partially solidifies, begin pressing and folding the syrup in a kneading motion. Use the edges of your silicone mat or other non-stick utensils. Continue kneading for 25 minutes, until the syrup turns glossy., Spray nonstick cooking spray onto your hands to prevent your skin from sticking to the cooled candy., The ball should be a little smaller than the size of a golf ball., Pull the candy out, stretching it into a rope. Note that this process takes considerable strength and speed, and may work best if you have someone to help you., Bring the ends together and twist the halves of the rope together., Bend the top of the twisted rope into a hook or cane shape., Place the finished canes on the silicone mat and harden at room temperature. Store the candy away from the sunlight.

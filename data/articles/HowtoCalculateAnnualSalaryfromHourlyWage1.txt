  If you receive a pay rate per hour multiplied by the number of hours worked per week, then you are paid hourly.  Another term for this is a non-exempt employee.  The amount of your paycheck may change each week depending on how many hours you work.  If your work hours do not vary but you are still paid by the hour, then you are still considered an hourly, or non-exempt employee even though your check is the same each week.,  Your supervisor or someone in human resources can tell you how much you make per hour.  If you don’t want to ask, you can figure it out from your pay stub.  Find where it tells you the total gross pay on your pay stub.  This is how much you earned before taxes and benefits were taken out. Divide that amount by the number of hours you worked that week.

 For example, suppose your gross pay was $200 for a week in which you worked 10 hours.  Calculate $200/10=$20{\displaystyle \$200/10=\$20}.  Your hourly salary is $20 per hour.  


,  Take your hourly salary and multiply it by the number of hours you work each week.  This tells you your weekly salary.  Multiply this by the number of weeks in a year, 52, go get your yearly salary.If you work 40 hours per week and you earn $20 per hour, calculate your weekly salary with the equation 40∗$20=$800{\displaystyle 40*\$20=\$800}.

 Then calculate your annual salary with the equation $800∗52=$41,600{\displaystyle \$800*52=\$41,600}.
  If your hours vary every week, keep track of your weekly hours for about one month.  Then calculate the average number of hours you worked each week.  Multiply that by 52 to find your annual salary.

 If in one month you worked 30 hours the first week, 25 hours the second week, 35 hours the third week and 40 hours the fourth week, the average weekly hours is (30+25+35+40)/4=32.5{\displaystyle (30+25+35+40)/4=32.5}.

 If you earn $20 per hour, then your annual salary is (32.5∗$20)∗52=$33,800{\displaystyle (32.5*\$20)*52=\$33,800}.

 To recycle a coffee can in a kid-friendly project, you can make a small (and relatively quiet) toy drum. Begin by decorating the exterior of the can with your child in any way you want. Paint, construction paper, and stickers are all excellent options for decorating the drum.
 Cut a circle out of felt that is a bit larger than the opening of the coffee can. Secure this felt over the opening of the can using a rubber band. The felt forms the drum head of the drum - the surface that is struck when the drum is played.
 To play the drum, you'll need to improvise some drum sticks. Pencils or pens make adequate impromptu drum sticks, but you can make more sophisticated mallets by gluing foam balls to the ends of thin wooden dowels.

 Dietary changes are also needed to treat liver disease in older dogs. Different liver diseases will require different diets. Your vet will recommend the diet that will best meet your dog’s nutritional needs. These diets are available through your vet.Examples of these diets are:


Low-copper diet to prevent copper buildup in the liverLow-protein diet if your dog has a shunt in its liverLow-sodium diet if your dog has ascitesHigh-fiber diet to prevent nitrogen buildup, Vitamin K and certain liver proteins play important roles in blood clotting. Your dog gets Vitamin K through its diet. Because liver disease can prevent these blood-clotting proteins from working properly, your dog will need vitamin K to prevent bleeding problems.Check the vitamin K levels in your dog's new diet. If the vitamin K levels are too low, your vet may recommend a vitamin K supplement.
 Antioxidants neutralize free radicals, which are chemicals produced in the body that can damage organs. To prevent your older dog’s liver from getting damaged by free radicals, give your dog an antioxidant like vitamin E or SAMe.Your dog may receive enough vitamin E in the food it eats. Ask your vet if your dog will need a vitamin E supplement.
SAMe is given as a supplement.
 In addition to vitamins E and K deficiency, liver disease can also cause a vitamin A deficiency in older dogs. Your dog may need a multivitamin to prevent other nutrient deficiencies.Ask your vet for recommendations on which daily multivitamin would be best for your dog.

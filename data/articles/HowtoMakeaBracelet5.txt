 Men tend to prefer simple looks using masculine materials. Use materials like leather and metal, and wooden or glass beads as opposed to colorful plastics. Avoid bright colors and ribbons. If, however, you know that the man in your life would prefer something different, go with what you know they would like.
 An easy style to try would be a simple leather braid. Begin by purchasing leather strings in whichever color you prefer. You may even get a variety of colors and mix them.


These string should appear even and not be too wide, as this will make them easier to braid. You will also want to ensure that the leather is strong. It should not be too thin, like the leather used to line clothing.
You do not need to get real leather. If you object to the use of animal products, faux leather can be easily purchased to create the same look.
 Braid the strings in as complex or simple a pattern as you wish. You can do a standard braid or you can look up more complex braiding in either a book or on the internet. Try a French sennit or various Celtic knotting techniques. Weave until you have reached the desired length.
 Finish by creating a toggle clasp by knotting one end of the extra strings and creating a loop with the other. Be sure that the knot is small enough to fit through the loop but not so small that it comes out too easily. A little extra string coming from the knot can help ensure that the clasp will stay closed. Alternatively, the ends can simply be tied. Youâ€™re done!

 Follow all of the steps previously mentioned, from preparing the yeast mixture to removing excess gasses from the dough.
 When you have removed the excess gasses from the dough, place it on a clean surface and stretch it out with a rolling pin. It shouldn't be too thin.


In the middle of the dough (lengthways), place half of the pastry cream and all of the figs in syrup.
Roll up the dough and join the ends to give it a ring shape.
 Use the rest of the ingredients to decorate the top of the ring, starting with the remaining pastry cream and following with the candied orange peel, almonds, and Maraschino cherries.
 Pre-heat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Place the ring in the oven and cook it for approximately 30 minutes.
 Remove the ring from the oven and dust it with powdered sugar. Wait for it to cool before serving.

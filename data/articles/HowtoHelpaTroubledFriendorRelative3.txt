 Be prepared:


Reassure that there is nothing wrong with them for feeling this way. Meeting anyone for the first time often causes fearful reactions and is a form of stress - and all sources of stress can make one anxious, forgetful and foggy in thought.
Explain that - as with all things new - it will take time to become accustomed to therapy, but encourage them to see how it goes for the first few sessions. Suggest they ask the therapist any questions they have regarding the initial the process. This will likely put them at ease as well as empower them.
Explain that if at any point during the therapy they feel uncomfortable with the therapist, for any reason or at any stage, they can switch to another. If they understand that this is their right, they will not feel trapped or obligated.

Ask appropriate questions, to avoid misunderstandings.
Take notes, get a printout or ask for literature about your role--even if you have a good memory.

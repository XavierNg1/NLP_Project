 Fill a kettle or cooking pot with four cups of water. Place the kettle or pot on a stovetop burner set to high heat. The water should reach a rolling boil in roughly 10 to 15 minutes.;
, While your water boils, zest a lemon to get the grated lemon peel. Then mince the fresh ginger root. Finally, bruise or crush the cardamom pods to release their aroma and strong flavor.
 Place the tea bags, cinnamon sticks, minced ginger root, lemon zest, and the cardamom in a large bowl. Then pour in the boiling water. Cover the tea and let it steep for about five to six minutes., Once the time is up, remove the tea bags and strain out the spices. You can use a large grated spoon to remove the tea bags and the cinnamon sticks. For smaller pieces of ginger and lemon zest, you might consider pouring the tea through cheesecloth. Serve the tea immediately after straining.

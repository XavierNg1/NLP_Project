 Keep in mind, however ,if you are cutting warm bread, you'll need to go for thicker slices. This will help keep the bread from going all mushy., Hold it just firmly enough to keep it in place, but not so firmly that you are squashing it., Keep the knife at a slight angle., Position the knife so that it is parallel to the cutting board. Carefully bring it down towards the board., If the bread is warm, you might have more luck with thicker slices.

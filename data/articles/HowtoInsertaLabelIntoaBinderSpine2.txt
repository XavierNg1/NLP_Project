 Open up your binder and bend back the front and back covers until they are completely in the other direction. Then stand the binder up so that the spine is vertical.Opening up your binder like this creates more space in the plastic covering for you to insert your label. Standing it upright makes it so that gravity can assist in getting the label inside.
If you have an older binder and you are concerned about it cracking or breaking by turning it inside out, you can just open up the binder until it is flat, which will still create more room in the plastic than when it is closed.
 Take a thin ruler and slide it inside the plastic on the spine where your label will go. This will open up the pocket and unstick it from the binder, which may happen after some disuse.


Move the ruler gently from side to side in the plastic if your binder is wider, making sure the whole pocket is open and unstuck.
Note that this may not work for smaller binders that are only 1 inch wide or less, as a common ruler is typically wider than this.
Take care not to over-stretch or tear the plastic on the spine by inserting a ruler that is too big or has very sharp corners.
 Use something hard and sturdy to help hold open the spine plastic and help ease your label inside. Try placing a ruler behind your label to guide it into the pocket.


If it will fit, try using the eraser end of a pencil to gently push your label in from the opening of the plastic. The eraser may help “grab” your label to better push it in.
You can also guide your label in with a piece of cardstock of the same size. Just insert it behind your label at the same time. Once you have both about halfway into the plastic, gently pull the cardstock out while you hold the label in place and then guide it the rest of the way down.

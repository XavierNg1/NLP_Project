 To keep your lips moist, you should apply lip balm throughout the day. You can use one that is petroleum based, beeswax based, or that uses a natural oil. Just try to avoid lip balms that contain fragrances, flavors, or dyes because these ingredients may irritate your lips.








Apply lip balm any time your lips feel dry. Never lick your lips because this can cause them to dry out even more.;
, Too much sun exposure can dry out your lips. If you will be spending time out in the sun, then protect your lips with a lip balm that contains sunscreen.Look for a lip balm that contains a sunscreen with at least SPF 15 protection.
 Matte lip colors can dry out your lips, so it is best to avoid these types of lip color if your lips are prone to dryness. Opt for moisturizing lipsticks instead.









Always apply lip balm before applying lip color, no matter what type of lipstick you use.
If you decide to use a matte color, then apply a heavy layer of lip balm before applying your lipstick.
 If you prefer natural products, then you can also use a natural oil or gel to moisturize your lips. Just dab a few drops of oil or a pea sized amount of gel onto your lips and distribute it evenly. Some good choices include:



Aloe vera gel.Make sure that you choose one that is made from 100% aloe vera and that has no extra ingredients. You can also use some aloe vera fresh from an aloe vera plant.

Coconut oil. This oil is solid at room temperature, so it is similar to lip balm.

Olive oil. A few drops of olive oil can also moisturize dry lips.

 If you already do this, increase the time or difficulty. However, always remember to speak with your doctor before changing your exercise routine, and you may want to hire a professional to help you build muscle safely.;
, While you're on the sidelines, find a bench to sit on. If possible, find something to lean against, and keep your legs and neck relaxed, along with the rest of your body.
 Inhale and hold for eight seconds (remember not to count too fast!), and exhale. Repeat this 2-4 times (if you smoke or used to, four times is recommended). And always remember to breathe - in excitement of the game, you may be tempted to hold your breath, but this isn't a good idea.
 Though you should stay alert during the game, it's good to relax your muscle and your mind for a while - for example, while on the sidelines or going to a game.
 This will help you avoid injuries and keep your stamina up. Always do this before playing, even if it's just a short game with friends.
 Always drink before and after playing. However, don't drink directly before a game, and drink little amounts often instead of gulping down all your water at once.
 Stretching, drinking water, and relaxing are all good ways to keep up your stamina.

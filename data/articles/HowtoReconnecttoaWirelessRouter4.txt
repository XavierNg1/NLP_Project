 This is the icon resembling a series of curving lines that's in the top-right side of the menu bar., It should appear in the drop-down menu below the Wi-Fi icon. If you assigned a name to your router when setting it up, the name will appear here.

If you didn't use a custom name for your network, you'll likely see the router's brand or model number (for example, you might see "Cisco" and a series of numbers and letters for a Cisco router).
 This is either the password you created for the router when you set it up, or the default router password that's on the back or bottom of the router unit.

If you purchased your router and modem together, look for the password (also called a "network" or "security" key) on the back or bottom of the modem as well.
 Doing so will reconnect your Mac to the router.

 Low or decreasing levels of HCG may be cause for concern, but not always – only your doctor can tell you for sure.Before you feel stressed or frightened, have a conversation with your OB/GYN. They will ask you if you’re having any symptoms that might suggest your pregnancy is at risk, like vaginal bleeding or abdominal cramps.Most likely, repeat testing will be done.

Ask questions like, “Is it possible I’m not as far along in my pregnancy as we believed?”
If your pregnancy is at risk, your doctor may tell you to rest in bed until things improve. You can also ask if there are any medications safe to take during your pregnancy that might help prevent miscarriage.;
, HCG values are usually just used as guidelines, and a single low reading is nothing to worry about. Ask your doctor to check your HCG level again in a couple of days, so that you can watch for trends., If your HCG is low or decreasing on a urine test, have a blood test done – this reads HCG levels more accurately. Depending on the stage of your pregnancy, you may be able to have an ultrasound done to check on your baby. Even after just 5-6 weeks, an ultrasound is more accurate than HCG levels., HCG is not a hormone that you can increase or decrease safely by yourself, and keeping a healthy pregnancy depends on a delicate balance of hormones that should be supervised by your doctor. Do not use products claiming to increase HCG. These are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and might actually cause harm to your baby.

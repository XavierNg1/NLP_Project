 You may choose to eat the heart and liver. However, it is not recommended that you consume the brain, spleen, eyes, tonsils, or lymph nodes. Put any organs you plan on saving in a clean plastic bag.
 If it is okay with the property owner, you may leave the waste organs (intestines, spleen, etc) for scavengers. Otherwise, pack up the organs in another plastic bag to bring with you.
 Transport your deer home. Get your carcass chilled, or on ice, as soon as possible.

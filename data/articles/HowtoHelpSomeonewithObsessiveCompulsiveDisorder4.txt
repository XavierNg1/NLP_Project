 Gaining perspective on the disorder through education is very important, because there are quite a few misconceptions regarding OCD.It is important to challenge these misconceptions, as they are likely to get in the way of a fulfilling relationship with your loved one.


One of the most popular misconceptions is that people with OCD can control their obsessions and compulsions – which is not the case. For instance, if you believe they can change their behavior whenever they want to, you will only get frustrated when they don’t.
 Getting educated about OCD can help you more easily accept that your loved one has it.This can be a painful process, but when you know the facts it will be easier to be objective, rather than emotional and pessimistic. Acceptance will allow you be productive and turn your attention to future treatment options, rather than ruminate on the past.


Understand common types of rituals and compulsions such as: hand washing, religious behaviors (such as praying a scripted prayer exactly 15 times in order to prevent something bad from happening), counting, and checking (for example, checking to make sure you locked the door).Young people with OCD may be more likely to disengage in activities or avoid them altogether due to fear of obsessions or compulsive behaviors. They may also have difficulty with daily living (cooking, cleaning, bathing, etc), and higher anxiety levels overall., In order to be able to help someone with OCD, you may benefit from understanding the ins and outs of the disorder.You can't expect to help someone with OCD before you know about it and understand it to some degree.

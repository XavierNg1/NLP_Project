 If you are a nervous rider you should probably get a calm horse until you are more confident with your riding skills.


Mares and geldings are recommended as they tend to be calmer, but calm stallions can also be found.
A gaited horse (Tennessee walker, Walkaloosa, Saddlebred, Missouri Fox trotter, etc.) Is an amazing first horse.
If you have experienced horse friends, bring them along; the more the better.;
,


If they don't let you ride the horse, go to a different stable.
, If you like the horse, you need some time to see how it behaves everyday. Be with the horse as often as you can.


Do everything you would do if you were to own the horse, leave no stone unturned.
Have the horse looked at by a vet.



Don't rush into buying a horse. This is a big decision and may take time.
If you feel the owner was not upfront about anything, be sure to address this.

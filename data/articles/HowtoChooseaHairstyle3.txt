 A good haircut should direct attention to the things you like about yourself. Ultimately a haircut or hairstyle should make you feel confident and attractive, so use it to your advantage.


For instance, if you love the length of your neck, try a short haircut or a high updo to show off your neck.
To draw attention to your eyes, get brow-skimming bangs that make your eyes pop.
 The right haircut can help you hide or downplay features you don't like as much.


If you have wide ears, avoid a cut that's too short as well as severe ponytails and buns (or, for men, wear the sides a little longer to create the illusion of comparable width around the ears).
If you have a broad, deep forehead, you can cover it up with bangs.

If you dislike the length of your neck, hide it with long layers.
 Coloring your hair can be extremely high-maintenance, but it can also help even out your skin tone and improve your overall appearance. Selecting the right shade and tone can be tricky, so consult your stylist about which color would look best with your skin tone.

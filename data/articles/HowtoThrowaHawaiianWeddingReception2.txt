 As guests enter the wedding and/or reception, adorn each with a lei, which is a necklace made from fresh flowers. In Hawaii, leis are presented at celebrations as a symbol of appreciation, love and respect.


Select maile leis or kukui nut leis for the men. If you are worried that men won't want to wear a necklace of fresh flowers, offer maile leis, which look like leafy green vines, or kukui nut leis, which are strung kukui nuts.
Consider silk leis if your budget is tight. While fresh flower leis are traditional for Hawaiian celebrations, silk flower leis are less expensive and can be saved as keepsakes following the wedding.

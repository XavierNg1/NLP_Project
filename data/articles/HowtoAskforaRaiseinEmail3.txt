 Is your boss overwhelmed with employee evaluations, urgent deadlines, or difficult budget decisions? If so, you should probably wait until things calm down before approaching them to ask for a raise., If revenues are up, clients are happy, and the company is stable or expanding, this is probably a great time to ask for a raise. Avoid asking at a time when the budget is tight. It’s almost certainly the wrong time to ask for a raise if layoffs are happening., It makes sense to time your request with an increase or shift in your responsibilities. For example, it might be a good time to ask for a raise if:You have recently taken on a new project.
You have just completed new job-related training.
You have helped build an important relationship with a new client or business partner.
 When you’re asking for a raise, it’s best to combine a written request with a one-on-one discussion. Send a brief message to your boss letting them know that you’d like to discuss the possibility of a raise. Either immediately before or immediately after your meeting, send an email clearly stating the details of your request.

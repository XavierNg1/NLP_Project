 You can also visit a local branch, but opening an account online is simple and easy. Although it doesn’t matter where the bank is located, you might want to consider opening an account with a bank that has a branch near you.
 Most banks offer a range of business checking accounts; some may have a small monthly fee and unlimited check writing, some may offer interest on your balance or some might feature overdraft protection. Choose the type of account that most closely suits your business needs—there is no point in paying monthly fees for options you don’t need or will never use.
 When you begin the process of opening an account, you will have to supply some specific information. If you are a sole proprietor, you will need to have the following information at hand:


Your Social Security Number or your EIN (Business Tax Identification Number)
Business License (the license should show both your name and the name of your business)

, Although you will always have to provide your Social Security number or EIN, if you are obtaining a business checking account as a general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership (LLC), or any other type of partnership or corporation, you will also need a business name filing document or business organizing document that has been filed with a state official.

 On a mat or a blanket, sit comfortably with your back and neck straight. With your palms open to the sky, place your hands on your knees. Then, take a deep breath in.Kapal Bhati Pranayama literally translates as “the shining forehead.” When practiced regularly, Kapal Bhati Pranayama can increase your metabolic rate, which can help you reduce and control your weight. It also stimulates the abdominal organs, and it can improve the functioning of your digestive tract.;
, As you exhale, pull your navel in toward your spine. You may keep your right hand on your stomach to feel your abdominal muscles contracting. Don’t over exert yourself; pull your navel in as much as you can.The exhalation technique is active and forceful. Try throwing out your breath by using your abdominal muscles to forcefully push out your breath.
 As you relax your navel and abdomen, your body will naturally inhale. Repeat this process 20 times to complete one round of Kapal Bhati Pranayama.Two to three rounds of Pranayama is sufficient.
Remember to keep your awareness on breathing out.

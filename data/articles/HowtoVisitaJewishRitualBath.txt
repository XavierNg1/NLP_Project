 While not a requirement, they can offer helpful advice and answer any questions you might have.
 The mikvah is constructed under very strict rules, and the water typically comes from a natural source, like a spring or even rainfall.

The mikvah is used mostly by Chasidic and Orthodox Jews, though any Jewish person may use it.
While women's mikvahs usually have a female attendant on hand, men's mikvahs may or may not. Make arrangements in advance if you will need assistance or personal guidance using the mikvah.
The mikvah is generally visited before a Jewish wedding, during conversions to Judaism, when koshering utensils (there are separate, smaller mikvahs for this purpose that do not require bodily immersion); after childbirth and the menstrual period, and on the eve of the Jewish High Holidays.
 Take a shower or bath to remove dirt and germs prior to visiting the mikvah.,, Then, immerse yourself completely in the water. You may want to do this several times.

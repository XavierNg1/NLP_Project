 Usually most items and racers will attack from behind, so unless you're dragging items or using an invincibility power-up, you will most likely get hit. But with this technique, you will learn how to dodge them without breaking a sweat., Now you can see the race-track from a completely new different perspective. You can now see how close or far the racers are, which is more accurate than the map. You can even see how close the items are and where they are heading., If it is a racer trying to streamline, move out of the way so they cannot do it. If it is a racer with a power-up, quickly dodge them. If it is an offensive item, find a strategy to evade the item. And if it is a homing item like a red shell, hope for the best and drag any items you have with you.

Go to the Social Security website featured in the Sources section of this article, then click on the "Apply for Disability" button.
Answer the basic questions about your impairment on the right side of the website within the "To Start the Application Process" section, then click on "Apply for Benefits." You will then be taken to the online disability paperwork.
 The application process will require you to fill out the Disability Benefit Application, the Adult Disability Report, and the Authorization to Disclose Information form.


Enter your personal and medical information about your disability into each corresponding field on the forms. You may need to refer to all the information you compiled regarding your disability.
Click on "Next" at the bottom of every page of the online application to be taken through the disability paperwork.
 When you have completed the online disability paperwork, you will be given instructions that inform you of paperwork needed by the local SSA office, such as your birth certificate.


You will also have the option to send your paperwork by mail, if you do not want to physically visit the Social Security office.

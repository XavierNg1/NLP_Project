 Flashcards are one of the best ways to memorize vocabulary words. Write down the word on one side of an index card and the definition on the other side.You can quiz yourself or have someone else quiz you.


You can use electronic flashcards too. There are computer programs and smart phone apps that are specifically made for studying information on flashcards: you enter the “front” and “back” of the cards and scroll through them.;
, One way to study vocabulary more quickly and effectively is to know common root words, prefixes, and suffixes. Being able to identify these can help you make educated guesses about vocabulary words instead of just having to memorize a long list of words that have little meaning for you.The prefixes un, in, il, and ir often indicate “not.”
The suffixes –ive, -ative, and –itive indicate that a word is an adjective- one that describes a noun.
The prefix man usually has to do with using your hands.
The suffix phobia indicates a fear of something.
The prefix re means back or again.
The prefixes sur, sub, suc, sup, and sus often mean under, below, or secretly.
The prefix psyche indicates a relationship to the mind.
The prefixes mono (one) and poly (many) indicate a number or amount.
The suffixes log, logo, and ology suggest the study of something.
 Even if you do not have flashcards, the act of writing down the words and definitions will help you remember them.


If you have time, try writing the words and definitions more than one time.
If you have a visual memory, try using different colors. You may be able to remember the color of the word and visualize the definition during the exam.

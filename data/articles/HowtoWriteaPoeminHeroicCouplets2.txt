 Before you start writing, ask yourself what you want your poem to do. Do you want your poem to protest a political injustice, describe an event in the world or in your life, or describe how beautiful or ugly something is? Once you know your goal, you can tailor your writing to that goal.Do not feel as if you have to choose profound material in order to write a poem. Instead, write about something you know well, that you have experienced first hand, or that is nearby. Remember that what makes a poem profound are hidden details and a unique perspective.
For example, "Whilst doing a degree at Houston University, // In marine biology, Ken started to do archery, // Along with shooting which he took to more, // Until the world stage was an open door.", Choose words that accurately express a feeling, a texture, a smell, or a sound. You do not need to choose impressive or poetic words, but words that describe your subject matter.For example, if you are explaining light, there is a difference between “glowing” light and “glittering” light.
Be as descriptive as possible, but do not state the obvious. For example, if you mention fire, you do not need to say the hot fire because everyone knows fire is hot.
 Abstract words refer to concepts and feelings like liberty, happiness, love, and hate. On the other hand, specific or concrete words describe things that people experience with their senses like red, warm, and eerie.Use concrete words to help the reader get a “picture” of what the poem is talking about, for example, “The red, dusk sky mirrored the anger I felt.”
For example, "The club is an athletics fields event, // But Emma did previously loudly tent, // Discus and shot put, and in Sochi 2008, // She came in 8th discus, shot put 7th gate."

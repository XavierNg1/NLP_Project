 The sex of a guinea fowl can be determined most reliably by its vocalizations. Guinea fowls do not begin to vocalize until they are about 8 weeks old.If you have young guinea fowls, known as keets, wait until they are around 2 months old before listening for their vocalizations.Female guinea fowls may not start vocalizing until much later in life, so you may have to wait even longer to determine the sex of your guinea fowls.;
, Male guinea fowls make a 1-syllable call that sounds like ‘chek.’The male’s vocalization will either be a chirp or a yelp repeated at varying intervals.The vocalization has also been compared to the sound of a machine gun., This is where things can get a little tricky, since female guinea fowls also make the 1-syllable ‘chek’ sound. However, females also make a 2-syllable call that can sound like a variety of words, like ‘buckwheat,’ ‘put-rock,’ or ‘qua-track.’Typically, the first syllable will be short and the second syllable will be longer and rising in tone.

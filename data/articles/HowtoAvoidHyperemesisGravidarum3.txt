 Drugs like ondansetron and metoclopramide are used to avoid hyperemesis gravidarum. These drugs are considered 5HT3 receptor blockers. These are the receptors in your body that get activated when your body wants to vomit. These medications block the receptors, thereby keeping your vomit triggers from being activated.Metoclopramide is generally prescribed as 5 to 10 mg taken every eight hours., Antiemetic drugs can decrease feelings of nausea or the desire to vomit. However it is recommended that you talk to your doctor about what medications might be right for you. Some antiemetic drugs that are used to combat nausea include:


Promethazine.
Chlorpromazine.
Metoclopramide.
 Prednisolone has been shown to have an effect on hyperemesis gravidarum. It can stop vomiting and can also help you gain back the weight that the condition has caused you to lose. Steroids decrease the stimulus to the brain centers that are responsible for vomiting.Prednisolone is administered three times a day for a period of a week depending on the severity of hyperemesis gravidarum and then reduced in stepwise fashion.

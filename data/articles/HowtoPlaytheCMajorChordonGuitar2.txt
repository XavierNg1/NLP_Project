 This variation on the C Major chord starts at the 3rd fretâ€”hence the name "third position." Place your fingers as shown below:









Place your first finger at the 3rd fret, on the 5th string. Press your finger flat into the neck so that all five strings are held down on the 3rd fret.
Place your second finger at the 5th fret, on the 4th (D string). This is the G note.
Place your third finger at the 5th fret, on the 3rd (G string). This is the C note.
Place your fourth finger at the 5th fret, on the 2nd (B string). This is the high E note.
When you strum, don't play the bottom or top strings. Just play the middle four.
 For this version, place your first finger across all the strings at the 3rd fret. Place your other three fingers as described above. This is called a barre chord, or sometimes "bar chord." You lay your index finger flat on the guitar, fretting all five strings on the 3rd fret. Now you can strum the bottom two strings with the others.
 Will start this next position on the 8th fret. Notice the frets are much closer up here, and the notes sound somewhat higher.









Place your first finger at the 8th fret across all the strings. Push down so that you've got all the strings barred.
Place your second finger at the 9th fret of the 3rd string (G string). This note is an E.
Place your 3rd and 4th fingers at the 10th fret, on the 4th and 5th strings, respectively. Strum all the strings.

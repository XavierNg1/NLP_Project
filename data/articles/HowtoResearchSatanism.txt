 If you want to know about Buddhism, do not ask a Scientologist; likewise, do not ask a Christian about Satanism. Be conscious that contradicting 'Satanic' organizations will offer different information on Satanism. This is their opinion; they are entitled to it, but if you want to research Satanism (not just an offshoot of it) you should seek the source/founding of the religion. At The Church of Satan's website you can find all the information you need or methods in which to obtain further information such as The Satanic Bible.;
, There is a difference between Satanism and Devil-Worship. Satanism, being referred to here in this Wiki-how, is the religion formed by Anton Szandor LaVey based on The Satanic Bible. Devil worship refers to the practice of believing in the reverse of Christianity. There are also theistic or traditional Satanists who believe in a real Satan, which members of the Church of Satan do not.

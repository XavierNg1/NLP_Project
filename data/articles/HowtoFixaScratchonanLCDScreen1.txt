 Scratch repair kits work well on surface-level scratches, but deep nicks or chips in the plastic won't be affected by a scratch repair kit., "Displex Display Polish" and "Novus Plastic Polish" are both quality scratch repair kits available from Amazon. Best Buy and Walmart tech departments may also have scratch repair kits in-store., Microfiber cloths, unlike paper towels or traditional napkins/cloths, won't scratch your screen during the buffing process.
 Scratches should be easier to see when the screen is dark.
 Usually, scratch repair kits require that you spray a solution onto the scratch and immediate area around it, then gently buff the scratch with a microfiber cloth.
 There should be a fine mist of solution on your screen.
 Do this until the screen appears dry.


You should move the cloth in circular directions rather than left-to-right or up-and-down. This works the solution into the scratch.
 If the scratch appears to be gone, then your repair worked!

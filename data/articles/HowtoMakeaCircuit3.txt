 Remove power from the circuit before cutting any leads. It does not matter if you cut the positive or negative lead. You can use a pair of wire cutters to cut the lead anywhere in the circuit. The switch will provide control of the circuit no matter where it is located.It is dangerous to cut into a live wire (one with power on it). Always disconnect the circuit before cutting leads.
 Once you have cut one of the lead wires, you can attach it to the switch. The switch will have two simple terminals. Attach the lead wire coming from the battery to one of these terminals., The second piece of wire should be attached to the bulb holder terminal. Attach this piece of wire to the second terminal on the switch. This will again complete the circuit., As you flip the switch on and off, it will open (break) and close (complete) the circuit. This will either prevent or allow electricity to flow. When the circuit is open, the light will be off. When the circuit is closed, the light will turn on.

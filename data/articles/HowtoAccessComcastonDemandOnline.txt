You can filter your choices by using the menus on the left side of the screen. Television shows can be filtered by genre, collection, network or the day of the week they normally air, while movies can be filtered by release date as well. Both television shows and movies can be searched by using the alphabetical menu or entering the name of the title in the search box which unfortunately is not available any more.



If you chose television shows, a new window opens allowing you to scroll through the episodes available to choose the one you want to watch. Choose the correct episode by clicking on the title.
If you choose a television show or movie that requires a subscription, you will be prompted to sign into your Comcast online account in order to confirm that you subscribe to the service. If it is not one that requires a subscription (such as HBO) you will not be prompted to log in.

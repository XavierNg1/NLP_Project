 People may not listen to you if you talk too quickly, mumble, or apologize for speaking up. Speak in a clear, assertive voice, and make sure you’re loud enough for people to hear you. Don’t repeat yourself after you make your point.If you aren’t confident about speaking up, experience is the best way to get more comfortable with it. Practice talking to others in low-stakes situations, such as when you’re with a group of friends.
Consider joining an organization like Toastmasters to become a more confident speaker.
 Get the other person’s attention by letting them know you want to talk about something important. Say something like, “I need to discuss something with you. Do you have a minute?”, If you tend to ramble or tell long stories, people might stop paying attention to you, or they might not know what point you’re trying to make. Keep it short when you’ve got something important to communicate.Planning what you want to say before you say it can help you avoid rambling.
 If you are upset or angry, be careful not to take your feelings out on the other person. They probably won’t hear anything you have to say if they feel like you’re attacking them. Express yourself calmly, and avoid calling names or making accusations.Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements to keep the conversation calm and civil.
For example, say, “I feel like I don’t matter to you when you when you don't listen to what I have to say,” instead of, “You obviously don’t care about me.”

, When you listen actively to someone, they’ll be more likely to do the same for you. Focus on what the person is saying, instead of just planning your own reply as they talk. Practice mirroring to make sure you understand what they’re thinking and feeling.Mirroring means restating someone’s point in your own words. One example of a mirroring phrase is, “It sounds like you feel hurt because I didn’t come to see you last week. Is that right?”

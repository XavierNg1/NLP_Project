 Start at the back of the pole, with your inside foot close to the base of the pole. Use your dominant hand to grab the pole at about head height. Allow your arm to straighten, so your weight is hanging away from the pole.
 Keeping your outside leg straight and swing it out to the side and step all the way around the pole, pivoting on your inside foot at the same time. Allow your knee to bend slightly as you turn to make the movement more graceful.
 Place your outside foot down just behind the other foot. Transfer your weight to the back foot and hook your inside leg around the front of the pole, getting a good grip right behind the knee.
 To finish off, arch your body backwards, lowering your hand to allow for a deeper arch. This is where flexibility comes in. Arch your back only as far as you feel comfortable and make sure that you have a good grip with your leg and your hand. You can tie your hair up or let it fall behind you if it makes you feel sexier.
 Straighten your body and your leg down from the pole and prepare to do the next move. The basic wrap-around move is a perfect move for beginners of pole dancing and is a great transition to more complicated moves.

The baby’s knees should be higher than their bottom, forming an M-position. Adjust the baby so that their knees are in line with your belly button., Begin to slide the fabric over your baby. First work the fabric over the baby’s bottom. Then, slide the fabric over your baby’s back. The lower rail of the sling should be extending between each of the baby’s knees. Reach into the sling to pull the bottom panel over the baby’s stomach.You should be supporting the baby’s weight with one hand as you adjust the fabric.
 If there is excess fabric around the baby’s back and bottom, gather it and move that fabric toward the rings. Tighten the top rail by pulling on the corresponding inside rail. You can also tighten the bottom rail by pulling on the corresponding outside rail., Now that the baby is in position, spread the fabric over your back. Spread it over your shoulder as well.

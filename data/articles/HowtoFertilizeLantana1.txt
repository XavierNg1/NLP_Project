 Soil pH for lantana should be between 6 and 6.5.If the pH is 6.8 or higher, lantana may not be able to absorb the nutrients even though they are available.;
, The amount of sulfur or lime required to change the soil pH varies, depending on the soil texture.


For example, it takes Â¼ pound of aluminum sulfate to change the pH of 25 square feet of sandy soil from 7.5 to 6.5 but it takes 1/2 pound of aluminum sulfate to make the same change in loamy soil., The nutrient levels present in the soil should be used to determine which fertilizer ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium is best for lantana. Fertilizers are sold with the ratio of Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium listed on the bag.


If nitrogen levels in the soil are at an acceptable level, use fertilizer with a ratio of 0-10-10 or something similar. If the phosphorus levels are already good, use fertilizer with a ratio of 10-0-10.
Do not use compost or compost tea to fertilize lantana. Nutrient levels in compost are highly variable. It could have nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium levels that are too high which can damage lantana.

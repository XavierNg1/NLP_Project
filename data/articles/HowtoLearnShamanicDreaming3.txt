 In order to glean the Shamanistic insights of dreams, you must practice remembering them. The first step is to spend an adequate number of hours sleeping. As the night goes on, your period of REM sleep (dreaming sleep) will grow longer, providing you with more substantial details to hold on to. Your first dream of the night will be the shortest, but after 8 hours of sleep, dream periods can last 45 minutes or more.
Dreams that happen later in the night may contain more Shamanic value.
 Have you ever remembered a dream upon waking, only to have it quickly slip away? Keep some paper and pen near your bed and write down your thoughts as soon as you wake up.This will serve you well in two ways:


Over time, this practice will help you to recall your dreams without needing to write them down.
When you have a record of your dreams, you can analyze them later to glean additional Shamanic wisdom.
 By engaging in a meditation practice during the day, you will strengthen your mind’s ability to relax into a successful dream-state, as well as your capacity to retain the messages of your dreams.Guided audio meditation with binaural beats can be a simple way to engage with a meditation practice.
If you do not like guided meditation, simply try sitting quietly for 5-10 minutes and taking deep breaths.
For best results, meditate every day to every other day.
 Consuming alcohol will reduce the amount of time you spend in REM sleep, thereby, reducing your number of vivid dreams.If you have time to sleep in the next morning, however, you might experience “REM rebound” where you can make up for the REM sleep you lost.
 Before you go to sleep each night, say “I always remember my dreams.” Repeat this every time you go to sleep. This will help you orient your mind toward lucid dreaming and Shamanic symbolism. In time, you will manifest the ability to remember your dreams.

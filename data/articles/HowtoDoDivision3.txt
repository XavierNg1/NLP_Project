 To divide fractions, simply write the first fraction followed by the division symbol and the second fraction.








Ex: 3/4 รท 5/8

, The second fraction becomes its own reciprocal.









Ex: 3/4 รท 8/5

, To divide fractions, you're essentially multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.









Ex: 3/4 x 8/5

, Just do exactly what you would do to multiply two fractions.









Ex: 3 x 8 = 24

, Finish the process of multiplying the two fractions.









Ex: 4 x 5 = 20

, Now that you've multiplied the numerators and denominators of both fractions, you can form the product of the two fractions.









Ex: 3/4 x 8/5 = 24/20

, To reduce the fraction, find the greatest common factor, or the largest number that divides evenly into both numbers, and then divide both numbers by that number. In the case of 24 and 20, 4 is the largest number that goes evenly into both numbers. You can confirm this by writing out all of the factors of both numbers and circling the largest number that is a factor of both:









24: 1, 2, 3, 4,6, 8, 12, 24
20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20

Since 4 is the GCF of 24 and 20, just divide both numbers by 4 to reduce the fraction.
24/4 = 6
20/4 = 5
24/20 = 6/5



, To do this, simply divide the denominator into the numerator and write the answer as your whole number. The remainder, or the number that is left over, will be the numerator of the new fraction. The denominator of the fraction will remain the same. Since 5 goes into 6 one time with a remainder of 1, the new whole number is 1 and the new numerator is 1, creating a mixed number of 1 1/5.









Ex: 6/5 = 1 1/5

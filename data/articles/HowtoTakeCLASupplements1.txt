 There are number of claims made by people who manufacture and distribute CLA supplements. The primary reason people buy CLA is to lose weight. But CLA has also, in some studies, been linked to the prevention of heart disease, reduced likelihood for diabetes and various cancers, and stronger bones., There are several versions of CLA which vary at the molecular level. Evidence suggest that the most effective one contains the trans-10, cis-12 isomer (an arrangement of atoms). Trans-10, cis-12 CLA is sometimes stylized on supplement packaging or in medical articles as t10, c12 CLA. Use this type of CLA when possible.If you’re unsure what isomer a certain CLA supplement contains, ask the nutritionist at your local health store for assistance. They might have more information about the product.
CLA supplements are made in two basic ways. Some are manufactured through chemical processes, while others are made using animal products like beef or dairy. In some cases, the supplements will be made of a combination of both methods. But these manufacturing methods don’t affect how effective the CLA is., Only purchase a brand of CLA that is respected. Many brands of supplements are not properly labeled and include ingredients other than those on the label. Ask doctors for a recommendation. Friends interested in good health might also be able to suggest CLA supplement brands they prefer. One sought-after and reputable brand is Tonalin.Tonalin brand CLA is readily available from major nutrition stores.

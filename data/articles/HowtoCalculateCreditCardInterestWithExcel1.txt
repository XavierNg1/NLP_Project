 Pull out your most recent statements. At the top or bottom look for the current balance, minimum payment percentage, and annual interest rate for each card.;
, Label cell rows A1 through A5 as follows. Credit Card Name, Beginning Balance, Interest Rate, Minimum Payment and Interest Amount., Use one column for each credit card. So the information for the first credit card will be entered into column B, rows 1–5. The next credit card will be entered into column C, rows 1–5, and so on.If you are unable to locate the minimum payment percentage on your statement, divide the minimum payment amount by the ending balance for that statement to arrive at a percentage. You need to calculate the percentage because the dollar amount will change each month.
Assume a Visa card with a $1,000 beginning balance, 18% annual interest rate and a minimum payment of 3% of the total.
In this scenario, you would enter $30 as the minimum payment, or the formula "=1000*.03."

 Defining people as either a Type A or a Type B personality is very popular, especially in the business world. This system of classifying personalities into one of two overall types also has research linking it to health and achievement.You can define your personality by finding out whether you are more a Type A person or more of a type B person.


Take an online personality type quiz like the Personality type A/B Test on the University of North Carolina Charlotte website.You may also look back on previous work evaluations or job feedback to give you an idea.
Compare your list of traits to the characteristics of Type A and B personalities. Look to see if you have more traits that are Type A or more that are Type B, keeping in mind that most people have traits that fit into each category.
 Type A personalities are generally successful, hard-working and very conscious of time. If this fits you and you are also competitive and goal-oriented, you may define yourself as a Type A personality.Type A people are also often more hostile, stressed, anxious, and impatient compared to Type B people.
For example, if you tend to get very stressed and extremely upset when something makes you even a little late, you may be Type A.
Or, for instance, you might be Type A if you would skip a night out with your friends without a thought in order to finish a report.
Check your list of traits to see if you mentioned words like: hard-working, driven, busy, focused, or impatient to see if you are Type A.
 You may define yourself as Type B if you are more laid back, creative, and tolerant of others.Type B people are late more often than Type A, but also have less anxiety.


Look at your list of traits to see if you included: relaxed, easy-going, peaceful, not always reliable, or a good imagination.
Think about whether you usually procrastinate when you have assignments or work to do.
For example, would you rather play a game of basketball than work on a report thatâ€™s due?

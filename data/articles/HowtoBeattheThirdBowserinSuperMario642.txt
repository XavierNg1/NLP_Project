 This time, you will have to scroll a message from Bowser. While you technically don't have enough stars to access the final Bowser, the door will still open for you, however the stairs are supposedly endless., You can do this by performing the backwards long jump move., If you have successfully done the glitch, you should now be at the top of the stairs, and notice the painting of Bowser, as well as a hole you can jump in to access the final level.

 Let a friend who knows both of you begin the conversation with an introduction. A personal introduction is like a reference, and she’ll be more likely to engage in conversation than if you fly solo., Find a place where you can talk one on one and you’ll have a better chance of getting to know her. Although friends can be a nice buffer when conversations aren’t going well, they can also be a distraction to making a connection.Suggest you move to the bar to get a drink.
Tell her you’re having a hard time hearing and want to move somewhere quiet.
Say you really like to get to know her, and ask to talk somewhere else.
 Take her on an emotional roller coaster. Getting a girl to feel a flood of emotions will open her up to want to make a new connection.Talk about a happy event in her life.
Share a sad story that was emotional for you.
Talk about a memory that makes you laugh.
Ask her about pets or friends from childhood.
Make her laugh and feel good about something happening in the moment.
 Saying “You’re pretty,” is very generic and doesn’t make an emotional connection. Show her that you notice details by complimenting her hair, accessories, or a specific aspect of her personality.
 When she tells you a day that isn’t full of events, suggest meeting for lunch or dinner at a specific time and place. Show her you are confident and make decisions by having the time and place already determined.
 Once you are back around other people, keep your attention on her and flirt in front of other people.


Pay close attention to her body language; she might like to keep your new connection quiet at first.

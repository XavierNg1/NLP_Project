 If you don't have a set lunch hour or break time, figure out a gap in your schedule where you can take 30 minutes or an hour off to have lunch. For example, if you're a student, see if you have regular breaks between classes sometime in the afternoon. Plan to eat lunch between economics and math class.


Think about your personal appetite as well. When do you tend to get hungry? If your hunger tend to spike later in the day, for example, plan on a late lunch break.;
, It can be hard to unwind if you're worried about people needing you. Make sure people at your office know when you'll be gone, how to contact you in the event of an emergency, and who to talk to in your place if you're unavailable., A schedule can be great and keep you on track, but don't get stuck in a rut. This can result in your lunch break feeling routine and boring. Make slight changes on occasion.For example, if you normally go to a particular diner for lunch, choose a different diner. If you usually run errands during lunch, take a break to read a book instead one day.

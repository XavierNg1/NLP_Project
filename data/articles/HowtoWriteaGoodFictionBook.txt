 Imagination has no limits. Don't let other people steal your ideas.
 Plain and simple, it may come in the form of a dream, or perhaps that annoying dog across the street sounds like it's saying cookies. Any idea can be excellent.
 No matter how ridiculous or stupid it may sound, it could be good. Maybe that idea about the dog that says cookies is lame, but someone will like it, or you can change it a bit later on.
 What color is the dog? Is it a boy or a girl? It could even be both! Why does it want cookies? How does it get the cookies? There are many questions that you can answer but decide on the story line before you get on the details.
 Bob Atkinson is a great author and illustrator and he doesn't copy Nick Bland. Be yourself.
 How many pages or chapters are there? Get the basics.
, Change it if it says its incorrect, if it doesn't seem right check with someone who knows English as a profession. Don't leave it to chance.
 Does it make sense? Have your friends and family read through it. Let them make changes with a pencil or pen.
 (If you want to) Have fun!

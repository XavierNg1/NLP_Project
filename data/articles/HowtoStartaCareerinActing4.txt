 Before jumping into anything, make sure it is legit. If something sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. There are a lot of people out there who try to make money by taking advantage of aspiring actors. You want to be sure that all of the jobs you audition for are legitimate and are not just trying to take your money.


If you are not sure about an audition, call your local SAG/AFTRA office, and express your concerns. They are very knowledgeable and will be able to provide you with sound advice.
 If you hear about an acting opportunity on the radio, or read about one in the newspaper, there is a chance that it is a scam. Sometimes, casting directors and film productions will hold open calls for films, but the information about those projects should be readily available. Hundreds of trained actors send their head shots and resumes in to legitimate agencies each week which means that agencies have no need to go out and search for "New or Fresh Faces.", There are many professional looking websites that promise to get you an audition and help you to become an actor. These are most likely scams that will do nothing but take your money., If a talent agency tries to charge you money for pictures, it may be a scam. Talent agencies try to take advantage of actors with no experience by getting them to believe that they have to pay for pictures. There is no reason for you to ever do this. If you find yourself in this situation, you are better off walking away.

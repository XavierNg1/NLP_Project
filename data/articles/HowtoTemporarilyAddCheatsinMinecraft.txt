 you know how to do this;
, If you like to play with snapshots or mods, you will most likely have more than one profile, just select the one you want.
 The big grey button that says play, its at the bottom of your page, press it

, This cheat does not work in multiplayer.
 If you want a new world with temporary cheats, just make a new world, name it whatever you want, select survival, and make sure to turn cheats off.
 or press whatever button you use to get to the Minecraft menu (the one that gets you to the screen that has "return to game" and "save and quit to title".
 It might seem silly to do this, you are not trying to create a server here! but press it anyway

,, To make your game no longer in server mode (so you can pause it etc...), just go back to the title screen

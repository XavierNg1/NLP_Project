 Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (220 C) and lay a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of your baking dish or roasting pan to prevent the potatoes from sticking. Melt 1/4 cup (55 g) of butter in a small saucepan and stir in:1 garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon of chopped parsley
1 tablespoon of lemon juice
1 teaspoon of finely chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon of finely chopped rosemary
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

, Wash and scrub 4 medium sweet potatoes and pat them dry. Use a sharp knife to carefully slice away and discard a thin, horizontal piece off the bottom of each potato. This will give you a sturdy base to cut the potatoes. Slice down through the sweet potatoes every 1/8-inch (3 mm) taking care to leave 1/2-inch (1 cm) at the bottom.Cut slowly and evenly so you can control the pressure as you cut. If you push hard, you may slice through the potatoes.
 Set each of the sliced sweet potatoes on the aluminum foil and use a pastry brush to spread half of the herbed garlic butter over them. Put the potatoes in the preheated oven to bake for 30 minutes. Carefully take them out of the oven.The sweet potatoes should just start to feel tender after briefly roasting them.
 Spread the rest of the herbed garlic butter over the potatoes and use a fork to spread the slices apart a little. Put the potatoes back in the oven to bake for another 30 minutes. Remove the sweet potatoes and serve them immediately.You can sprinkle extra herbs over the potatoes to garnish them.
The sweet potatoes should be crisp on the outside and soft on the inside once they've finished roasting.

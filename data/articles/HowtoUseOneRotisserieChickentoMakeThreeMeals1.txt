 Try doing something like have it for dinner the same day that you buy it with a side of broccoli and some fresh rolls. A good tip would be to cook it for an additional 45 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C) before serving - just to make sure it is fully cooked through. Take it out of the plastic pan into a covered roasting pan with a little bit of water.
, Toss into a sandwich sized Zip-lock bag.
 Toss into a gallon sized Ziploc back. Store in the fridge.

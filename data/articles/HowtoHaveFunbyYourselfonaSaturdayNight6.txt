 Not only is knitting relaxing, but you end up with a useful product at the end of your hard work. Knitting requires a little practice and some supplies, so head to your local craft shop and pick up needles, yarn, and an instruction book. Practice simple patterns and items first, like scarves., Using materials you already have around the house, make small models, wreathes or wall hangings. Look around for craft supplies you may already have, like clay, glue, pipe cleaners or cardboard, then let your imagination run wild. Make a model of your favorite cartoon character with clay and paints, or make a small flag with some fabric and paints.
 Making your own stained glass is easy and fun. All you need are pieces of glass, a brush and special glass paint from your local craft store. Choose colors you like, then apply them to your pieces of glass with the brush. Be sure to let them dry for a few hours. Then use your glass pieces to make jewelry, a sculpture or filling for an accent bowl.

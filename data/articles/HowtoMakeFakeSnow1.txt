 Take a cotton ball or cotton swab between your fingers and pull to stretch it out into wispy snow. Lay them out as a field of snow in craft projects, or reshape them into balls to make miniature snowmen.;
, Make a video of fluffy, falling snow by pouring this in front of the camera.









This also works as fallen snow. To make it more fancy, combine 4 cups (960mL) flakes, 1⅓ cup (320mL) liquid starch, several drops blue food coloring, and glitter.
 Punch small holes from white paper and use the punched circles as snow. This works best when blown in front of a fan.
 To refill a snow globe, pour in glycerine and small thermocol balls. You may use glitter or small beads instead of the thermocol.
 Mix ¼ cup (60mL) each of table salt and talcum powder. Spray the surface with spray-on craft glue or dab on white glue where you want the "snow" to stick. Sprinkle the sparkly mixture on the wet glue and allow to dry. Turn the project upside down to remove excess "snow."








, Start with white flour or baking soda. Add water one small spoonful at a time, mixing it up with a fork. Once you've formed a paste, cover the ground of a small winter scene. You can shape this into snowy hills and slopes with your hands. Sprinkle more flour over the top once finished.

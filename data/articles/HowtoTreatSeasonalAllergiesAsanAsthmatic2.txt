 One of the go-to treatments for allergies, including seasonal allergies, is antihistamine medications. When your body releases histamines to attack allergens, it causes allergic reactions, such as a runny nose and itchy eyes. Antihistamines help to combat that reaction.You can get many once-a-day antihistamines over-the-counter, including loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine.These medications are non-drowsy and are safe to take every day.You can also take other antihistamines that may cause drowsiness, such as diphenhydramine., Decongestants help to relieve stuffiness in your nose. While they don't affect the reaction as much, they can help to relieve your symptoms, which can help you breathe easier. These medications come in both pill form and nasal spray form.These medications are available over-the-counter. However, you should not use the nasal sprays for more than three days in a row. Even pill decongestants should not be used for more than five days in a row.
 Another option is a nasal spray called cromolyn nasal solution.This nasal spray affects the mast cells, which releases substances that cause allergic reactions. You can use these sprays continually to treat both seasonal and long-term allergies.This medication is available over-the-counter.

 This translates to "my name is_____"


"MO-eg-toh e-meh eh __________";
, This is a somewhat gravelly sound. While "heet" is pronounced like "hate," natural speakers almost slur the two together, almost like "hee-EIGHT."


"Ick hate"

, The words will somewhat glide together. This translates as "I am called."


"Jhe- ma- pelle"

, This one most people already know, but they still get tripped up by the double-L. In Spanish, the double-L sounds like an English "y."


"Meh Yam-oh"

, Really differentiate the three syllables, keeping them sharp and distinct.


"Ikh High- saa", For more formal hellos, you can also say, "Ονομάζομαι" ("To o-no-ma mou e-ne,") which translates to "I am called."


"Meh Leh-neh"
You can also change things up with "Λέγομαι," ("Leh-go-meh,") meaning "I'm named.", Like in French, the words need to somewhat slur together. The "v" sound in the middle should sound about halfway between a V and a W.


"A neh-wem", Icelandic is one of the world's hardest languages, but luckily fo you "My Name is" is quite easy.


"Yeg hey-tih", Not that this sounds completely different from how it looks. The "se" at the end sounds much more like "sha."


"Mish-ah", No, that "3" shape is not a typo, it's just a part of the Russian Alphabet. If you don't have time to learn the whole thing, the pronunciation isn't tough. This translates into "I am called."


"Men-ya za-voot", These are the English equivalents of "My name is ____" or "I'm ____."


"Mi Chiamo" (Mee Key-ah-mo). → "My name is...."
"Sono: (soh-no). → "I'm...", If you know how to speak Italian, Spanish, or French, the pronunciation is very similar.


"Me-he no-men es"

, You can also use the phrase "mă chiamă" as well.


"Ma new-Mesk"
"Ma key-ama"

, Like in German, you're looking for three well-pronounced, distinct syllables. The second word sounds like "height," as in how tall something is, in English.


"Egg Height-er"Note: this may also be spelled "Jeg heter." This second versions is the more formal, traditional spelling. Both are correct.
 For more formal, longer phrase, you can use "Moje meno je ____" ("My name is ____"). The words in Slovak tend to be slightly jammed together, especially here, where they might sound like one word.


"Vol-am say", For more formal conversations, try out "Mitt namn är." This is tricky one, as the letters aren't used quite the same way in English. Try to make the "i" in "mitt" sound like an "E" sound. "Yog Heat-err"
"Mit Nam Aer"

, Esperanto was invented in Poland after WWII as a politically neutral, global language.


"Mee-ah No-mo Ehs-tas"
"Mee no-me-jas"

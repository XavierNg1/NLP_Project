 The intro will make or break your essay. The key is to attract the teacher's attention away from the TV or computers screen and fully onto your essay. In the intro, be creative. Use an analogy, tell a personal experience story, whatever you do, start out with a something different!

, Teachers are human beings too! Any kind of emotion in the intro or conclusion (more likely in the conclusion) will get the teacher to start thinking. Talk about how your pet dog has been your personal hero in your life trials. Or fall back on the ol' reliable--hope. Talk about the hope to one day create a more peaceful world. Talk about the hope to one day reach that elusive goal. Remember, there is always hope.


If you talk about something briefly at the very beginning of your intro, refer back to it quickly in your conclusion. It'll remind your teacher you know how to write an essay and you know what you're doing.
 Start off sentences with the same start to add more emotion. Example: "Sometimes the world gets too out of hand. Sometimes the world just needs a better hero. Sometimes, I can be that hero."

Either you can outright quote them, such as "If we don't come together right now, on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed" (Remember the Titans). Or you can change it up slightly to show off your creativity, such as "The grass actually ISN'T greener on the other side."

, By using too many simple words, the teacher may not notice it at first, but he will notice your lack of strong vocab. Insert a few good words here and there, and if you're slightly in doubt on what a complicated word means, just don't use it. Misusing a word can rip your essay into pieces in the teacher's mind.

 Encourage the audience member to shuffle it as many times as he or she likes. This trick is based on probability, not misdirection.
 Request just the name of the card, not the suit.









For example, just "king" and "ten" will do. Saying "king of spades" and "ten of hearts" is more specific and significantly reduces the probability of this trick working. If they mention suits, say something like "Hey, I'm new at this, let's just stick with "king" and "ten"" with a smile.
When the audience member says "king" and "ten," she is actually naming four cards of each kind since the suit is not specified. Combined, the two cards create eight total possible cards: king of diamonds, king of clubs, king of hearts, king of spades, ten of diamonds, ten of clubs, ten of hearts, ten of spades.
The theory is that of these eight possible cards, at least one of the kings will be next to one of the tens., Wait about 30 seconds to a minute before continuing with the trick. This helps build the illusion that you actually have something to do with the cards being drawn to each other.


This is the only real physical gesture you will make during this trick. Try to have as little to do physically with the trick as possible. This will strengthen the notion that you really performed the illusion.
 Amazingly, the two cards will (hopefully) appear together somewhere in the deck!









Sometimes, there may be a card separating a king and a ten. If this occurs, simply tell the audience that you didn't concentrate hard enough. Perform the trick over and take your chances that the two cards will end up next to each other., Don't actually touch the cards, otherwise the audience may think you've secretly placed a hidden card next to another.

Be aware that this trick sets up a chain reaction that can lead to stinging eyes, creating a bloodshot appearance.
You should only do this with clean hands to prevent the introduction of germs into your eyes., Your eyes’ natural response to dryness is to water to rehydrate and protect each eye. By keeping your eyes open for an extended period of time, your eye will become dry and start to water. You might even turn this into a game with a friend and have a starting contest., The stinging sensation caused by pulling on your lashes or pulling out your lashes should make your eyes water nicely.

This causes a slight surge of fluid (tears) once you are finished and your yawning muscles relax. If you can make yourself yawn, your eyes should water., Though you shouldn’t stare into bright lights for long periods of time, as this can be harmful to your vision, some actors have used bright lights to trigger their eyes water.

 You will gain valuable research experience at both the undergraduate and graduate levels if you select a school close to the habitats and species you want to study. For example, if you want to study ocean life, choose a school in close proximity to the coast., One way to get experience as an evolutionary biologist is through an internship or research assistantship. Ask your professors about opportunities to work or volunteer in their laboratories. As a graduate student, you can apply for research assistantships that will not only give you valuable experience, but also help you pay for your education., Once you complete your education in evolutionary biology, you can begin applying to jobs. Most evolutionary biologists work in the government sector or in academia. For academic positions, you will need to apply about a year in advance. Government and private sector positions are open year-round.

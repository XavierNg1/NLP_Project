 Use this method for any phone or tablet that runs Android. If you use the YouTube mobile website instead of the app, download the app or log in on a computer to get access to all history clearing functions.


On the mobile website, you can remove individual videos from your history, but not all of them at once., On Android devices, this icon looks like three horizontal gray bars with the red YouTube "play" icon next to them.Touch this to open up a list of menu items.


In some versions of the YouTube app, you may need to select a "Settings" icon instead., Choose this option from the list to be taken to your watched videos history.
 Select "Menu" to open up more options. "Remove from Watch History" will remove the individual video you are looking at from your history. "Clear History" removes every video at once.
 Return to the main screen of the YouTube app. Go to Menu → Settings → Search → Clear search history to make YouTube forget all searches you have made on YouTube.You can also prevent future searches from being stored in your history, by selecting "Never remember history" or "Pause search history" in the same Search menu where you found the "Clear search history" option.

 Go back to the basic principles of conversation that were taught to you when you were a child. Don’t interrupt the speaker in the middle of their sentence. This includes interrupting the speaker to finish their sentence. When you are the listener, simply listen.Don’t finish the speaker’s sentences, even if you know what they are going to say. Allow the speaker to complete their thoughts.
 A good reason to speak when you are listening is to ask questions. Use questions to prompt further conversation or to gain a deeper understanding of what the speaker is saying. Be sure to wait until there is a break in the conversation so that you do not interrupt the speaker.Avoid derailing the speaker by asking a question that will stray them away from the topic. If you must do this, be sure to guide the conversation back to its original topic.
 You are not actively listening if you are just waiting for your chance to speak. Instead, you are thinking about what you are going to say. You could miss important parts of the conversation and possibly even repeat something that has already been said.

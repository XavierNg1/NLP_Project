 Turn the oven on and set the temperature at 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).
 In a shallow dish, combine the milk and the breadcrumbs. Let the mixture sit until the milk is fully absorbed, which should take about 5 minutes.
 In a saut√© pan, heat up some olive oil and add the onion and garlic. Continue stirring in the pan until the onion turns slightly brown.


Alternatively, you can simply add onion powder and garlic powder.
 Mix the breadcrumbs, onion, garlic, meat, salt, pepper, oregano or Italian seasoning, cheese, egg, and 1/3 cup of ketchup together in a casserole dish or another type of deep pan and stir thoroughly.
 Spray or grease a casserole dish and smear 1/3 cup of ketchup along the sides and bottom of the dish. Pour the meatloaf mixture into the casserole dish and smooth the top.
 Put the meatloaf in the oven for 45-60 minutes. Cook until the meatloaf is brown and lightly crisped all over.
 If you have a meat thermometer, insert it in the middle of the loaf; it should read 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) when the meat is done cooking.

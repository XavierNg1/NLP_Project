 If you want a quick fight, this step is almost mandatory. A bow is one of the easier ways to kill a blaze, seeing that they can fly. Also, obtain some snowballs. It is a good choice to store the snowballs as snow blocks, and will save time. If you throw snowballs at them they will weaken and you can easily finish them off with a sword. Finally you can collect their experience points.
 (and lava) Brewing directions can be found here.
 Also build a small 3 block high wall out of cobblestone. It doesn't have to be too long, and should have a small roof.
 Start charging your bow. Do not try to shoot the blaze until your bow is fully charged.
 Be sure that you are close to the end of the wall so you can hide faster. If a blaze is waiting for you on the "safe" side, kill it with snowballs.
 Get behind the wall and start charging your bow again. Repeat until the blazes are dead.
 You may have to build your way to the drop, as blazes fly. Set the difficulty to Peaceful.

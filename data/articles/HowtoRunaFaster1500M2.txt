 Set your watch to one minute and run at a normal pace. As you run, count the number of times your left or right foot hits the ground. When the timer stops, multiply this number by two.For example, if your right foot hit the ground 80 times, then your cadence is 160 steps per minute (spm).
 In your run, incorporate 20-second intervals of running that are five percent faster than your normal cadence. If your normal cadence is 160 spm, for example, then incorporate an interval of 20 seconds at 168 spm during your regular run. After 20 seconds, slow back down to your normal pace.Practice this three to five times a week.
 Once you are comfortable running 20-second intervals, increase them by 15 seconds. If you ran for an interval of 20 seconds at 168 spm during week one, for example, then increase the interval to 35 seconds of 168 spm during week two. Repeat this until you can run the whole minute at 168 spm.
Once you are comfortable running at your new cadence, then increase it by another five percent and repeat the process over again.
 A metronome will help you find your rhythm while you run. Set the metronome to your desired beats per minute, for example 160 bpm if your cadence is 160 spm. Keep your running rhythm in tune with the metronome.

 Add 8 ounces (225 g) of cream cheese that’s been softened to room temperature, 1 tablespoon (10 g) of minced scallions, 1 tablespoon (4 g) of minced fresh dill, 1 tablespoon (4 g) of minced fresh parsley, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk, and a pinch of kosher salt to the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Beat the mixture on low until it is well blended.You can also use a handheld electric mixer to beat the ingredients together in a large bowl.
 Once the cream cheese spread is prepared, take 2 bagels and use a sharp knife to cut them into rounds lengthwise. You should create 3 rounds from each bagel for a total of 6 rounds.Plain bagels are a classic option for lox and cream cheese, but you can use any flavor that you prefer.
 After you’ve sliced the bagels into rounds, use a butter knife to smooth some of the cream cheese mixture over 3 of the rounds. Add a slice of lox to each round on top of the cream cheese mixture.You can add some capers to the lox and cream cheese if you like.
 Once you’ve added the lox, top each of the bagel pieces with the remaining 3 rounds to create sandwiches. Serve the bagels with lox and herbed cream cheese alongside some light salads or hearty soup.

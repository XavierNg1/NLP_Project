 Tomatoes respond best to receiving the right amount of water during the entire growing phase; too much or too little water will harm the growing rate. The best way to achieve this is to put the tomatoes on a drip watering system that measures out equal quantities of water daily. See How to Build a Drip Watering System for Outside Plants.;
, Tomatoes are more prone to splitting in intense heat. If you live in a growing zone subject to high heat levels during the growing season, it is vital to shelter the growing tomatoes. Put up shade cloth, or plant the tomatoes in an area that gets shading from other plants or a building during the hottest part of the day.
 Too much of a good thing can cause the tomatoes to grow too quickly and split. Compost provides a more steady and slowly released form of fertilizer.
 Mulch helps to keep the water levels sufficient and not too clogged, nor too dry. This can be an excellent way to keep moisture in and prevent the tomato plant from drying out. Top up as the growing season progresses.
 Ask your local garden center for guidance. Older varieties tend to be more prone to splitting than newer ones, but ask about the tomatoes available.
 The tomatoes are very susceptible to bacteria and viruses once split and the flesh begins to change as soon as there is a split. Cut away from the split area; the rest of the tomato should be fine to consume.

 The mountains are perhaps one of the best places to go on a romantic camping trip. The great views, the seclusion, and the sounds of mountain streams and creeks will really set the tone for a wonderful time. Some popular and beautiful destinations include:


Shenandoah National Park, Virginia
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina
Ramsau near Berchtesgaden, Germany
Silver Falls State Park, Oregon
Yosemite National Park, California;
, Next to the mountains, the beach is one of the most romantic places you can camp. Consider a beach within driving distance of your home, or you can plan a road trip to a far away beach you’ve never been to before. Don’t just think about the ocean, though - you can go camping on a beach by a lake just about anywhere. Consider some possible options:


Hunting Island, South Carolina
North Bend Park & Campgrounds, Virginia
St. George Island, Florida
Praia do Telheiro, Portugal
Lake Oljaren, Sweden
Big Sur, California, In addition to mountains and the beach, you can also plan a getaway to a place that holds special meaning to you and your partner. Think about places you’ve camped before, maybe somewhere near where you met, or anywhere you share meaningful memories.
 After you’ve chosen your general location, you should hone in on a specific campground. The best sites for romantic camping are those that are secluded or sparsely visited. This way, you’ll have a quiet spot to enjoy each other’s company.If you’re going car camping, pick a spot toward the back of the campground – away from other campers.
If you’re visiting a national or state park, ask a ranger for recommendations about beautiful and secluded camping sites.
Ask friends who may have visited the region or park you plan on going camping in.

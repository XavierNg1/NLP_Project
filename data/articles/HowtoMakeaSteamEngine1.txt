 Use tin snips or shop scissors to make a smooth horizontal cut about 1/3 of the way up from its base.;
, Fold the rim of the can in on itself to eliminate its sharp edges. Take care not to cut yourself as you do so.
 Most soda cans have a circular base that curves into the interior of the can. Push this out by flattening it with your fingers or using the bottom of a small glass or jar to smooth it.
 You can use a paper punch for this, or you can make the holes with a nail and hammer. You will need a hole slightly larger than 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) in diameter.
 Crumple foil and place it under and around the candle to hold it in place. Tea light candles come in small tins, so the wax should not melt and spill into your aluminum can.
 The 1/8-inch tubing should bend easily around the pencil. You will need enough coiled tubing to stretch across the top of the can, plus about 2 extra inches (5.08 cm) of straight tubing on each side.
 Center the coil over the wick of the candle. Try to have about the same length of straight tubing sticking out of each side of the can.
 Bend the straight sections of the tubing so that they go in opposite directions on each side of the can. Then, bend them again so that they reach below the base of the can. When you're done, you should have a coiled section of tubing in the middle over your candle that stretches downward into two opposite-facing "jets" on either side of the can.
 Your "boat" should float comfortably. If the tubing ends don't quite sit below the water line, try weighing the can down slightly, but be careful not to sink it.
 The easiest way to do this is to place one end in the bowl of water and suck through the other like a straw. Alternately, you can hold your finger over one end and hold the open end under a running faucet.
 Over time, the water in the tubing will heat up and begin to boil. As it evaporates into steam, it will shoot out of the the "jets" of the tubing, causing the entire can to spin in the bowl.

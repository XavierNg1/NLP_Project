 When it comes to dark lipstick, precise application is key. Instead of rolling it on straight out of the tube, it’s better to use a small lip brush to paint it on. You can purchase these at any cosmetic or beauty supply store.
 Using your lip brush, carefully paint your lips within your natural lip line. To make your lips look most natural, apply the product into the center of your lips. Then, brush it outwards so that it becomes lighter as it reaches the outer corners of your lips.
 After you’ve applied one coat of your lipstick, use a tissue to gently blot your lips. Then, using your fingertips, lightly pat translucent or nude powder into your lips. This will help set your first coat of lipstick, as well as give your second coat something to stick to.
 A second coat will help ensure your lipstick stays on all day or night. Use your lip brush to apply it exactly as you did the first coat. Double check your work, and make sure it looks perfectly even.If you desire, you can also outline your lips in a matching color lip liner. This can enhance and define the border around your lips.
Another option is to apply concealer with a small concealer brush around your mouth to perfect the border between your lips and skin.

 Don’t be afraid to raise your hand if you don’t understand something. Your teachers are there to help you! If you think you need extra help, see if your teachers will work with you before or after school. They might also be able to give you extra practice work.

Teachers are very busy. Even if your teacher does not have extra time to help you, don't get upset. Ask your teacher if you can work with a partner who can help you learn the topics you are struggling with.

Try to be specific when you ask for help. For example, don't say, "I don't get fractions." Instead, ask, "Can you explain again how to change fractions so they have the same denominator?" If the teacher knows that you have a specific problem, it will be easier to take the time to stop and help.
 There are a lot of websites that help teach math. Some of them have written lessons. Others have video lectures. It might be helpful to look at these web sites with your parents, or an older brother or sister. They can help you find the math topics you are working on in class.

Some good sites with written lessons are Cool Mathand Math is Fun.A very popular site with videos is Khan Academy., You might be able to get a tutor through your school, so talk to your teacher. Your parents can also take you to a tutoring center, like Sylvan or Huntington. Or, you could get a personal tutor. A personal tutor works with your teacher and parents to give you one-on-one help.

Your parents can find you a tutor through websites like WyzAntor Varsity Tutors. Most tutors will meet with you in person, but you can also find a tutor who will work with you online through the computer.

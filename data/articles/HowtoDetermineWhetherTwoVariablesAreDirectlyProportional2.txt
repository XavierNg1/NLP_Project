 You should be given a list of coordinates, or have a graph from which you can determine the coordinates of the points. If you donâ€™t have the coordinates of points on the line, you cannot use this method.

For example, you might be given the set of points xy214263{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}x&y\\\hline \\2&1\\4&2\\6&3\end{matrix}}}

The x-coordinate of the first point is 2, and the x-coordinate of the second point is 4.
 To do this, determine which factor, or constant, the first x-coordinate is multiplied by to arrive at the second coordinate.

For example, if the first x-coordinate is 2, and the second x-coordinate is 4, you need to determine what you multiply 2 by to get 4:2k=4{\displaystyle 2k=4}2k2=42{\displaystyle {\frac {2k}{2}}={\frac {4}{2}}}k=2{\displaystyle k=2}So, the x{\displaystyle x} variable grows by the constant 2.
 Use the same two points you used to determine the growth of x{\displaystyle x}. Use algebra to determine the factor by which the two coordinates vary.

For example, if the first y-coordinate is 1, and the second y-coordinate is 2, you need to determine what you multiply 1 by to get 2:1k=2{\displaystyle 1k=2}1k1=21{\displaystyle {\frac {1k}{1}}={\frac {2}{1}}}k=2{\displaystyle k=2}So, the variable y{\displaystyle y} grows by the constant 2.
 If x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} changed at the same rate, or by the same factor, then they are directly proportional.For example, since the x-coordinates changed by a factor of 2 while the y-coordinates also changed by a factor of 2, the two variables are directly proportional.

 Take riding lessons, or read online about horses. You at least have to know the basics about horses, to understand the books.;
, Ask your parents if you could lease a horse or buy one. However, this may not be realistic for some. If you already have one great.
 Show Jumping, Dressage, Cross Country (Eventing) (optional). If you want the blue ribbons like the CanterWood Crest girls this is a must.
 Sasha, Heather, Alison, Callie and Julia have to keep their grades up to be on the team. Always have school come first then horses. If you need help ask the teacher or friends. Maybe even a tutor, whatever it takes.
 Whatever flavor you want, you could order online or at your local store. Target has a good selection. When it comes to business the Canterwood Crest Girls always have their game face on, and lip gloss.
 You don't have to blow a bunch of money like Heather. Go to a used clothing store, or swap your old clothing with a friend.



Must haves:

Tan or white riding breeches.
Different colored polo shirts.
Black or brown tall riding boots.

, The girls are always natural. Foundation powder. Go for a light brown, light cream eye shadow. Light brown eye liner and black mascara. Top off this with bronzer on cheeks to give you a tan glow. Or a light pink for color.

 While you should already be familiar with the most relevant facts about the importance of vaccinations, you might not have the time or authority to convince someone to see the importance of immunizations.


Handing someone a pamphlet saves time, allows people to take in information at their own pace, and verify the authenticity of what you’re saying by checking the sources cited within the pamphlet.
If you are a doctor or public health official, you could make pamphlets available for individuals to take in the front office or lobby of your facility.
If you are a friend of someone thinking about getting vaccinated, you could obtain pamphlets in order to help educate your friend about the importance of immunization.
 If you’re a doctor or public health official, you can hang posters with facts and images relating to the importance of vaccination in the lobby or waiting room of your facility.

 Both you and the delegate will need Gmail accounts, as this feature is available only with gmail.com addresses.


You must set up Email Delegation through Gmail's standard desktop browser. You can't grant access to delegates through Gmail's iOS or Android app.;
, This icon is found in the upper right hand of the page and appears as a mechanical gear.
 This will take you to your General settings information.
 The “Accounts and Import” section will allow you to grant access to another Gmail user.
 Select “Add another account” under the field "Grant access to your account".
 Enter the delegate’s gmail.com address and select “Next Step”.
 A confirmation request will be sent to the delegate's email account.
 The delegate should login to their personal Gmail account through a standard desktop browser, as email delegation cannot be accessed via Gmail's iOS or Android application.
 It will contain a request for you to accept the delegation.
 Doing so will activate the delegation.


Confirmation and verification for the delegate may take up to half an hour.
 You'll find it in the upper right hand of your browser window.
 It will now appear under your own. You can now read and compose emails on behalf of the other user.

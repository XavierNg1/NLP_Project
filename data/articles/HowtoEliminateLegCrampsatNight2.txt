 Set your leg on a towel or bed sheet stretched horizontally out. Fold it in half hamburger style, so it encloses the part of your leg which has the cramp. Grab the open end and hug it as a child would hug a security blanket. This stretch works by compressing the leg and effectively massaging it.
 In a sitting position, stretch one leg out and another leg (the calf you want to stretch) bent, so that the knee approaches your chest. Take hold of the bottom of the toe from the bent leg and pull it toward your body as much as you can., Lie down on the side where the thigh does not have the cramp, and face the wall. Extend the leg that has the cramp so that it is perpendicular to the rest of the body, and so that it is fully straight and touches the wall. Hold for 10-20 seconds before bringing your leg back, to stretch the muscle in the back of the thigh.
 In a sitting position, stretch one leg out and another leg bent. Bring the heel of the bent leg close to your buttocks. Keep your heel on the ground but lift your toe up, holding until the stretch loosens up your muscle.

 This line can be reached at (202)456-1414. When you reach the switchboard, ask for the Greetings Department. Wait patiently until you are connected with the Greetings Department.


In some cases, you may have to wait some time before an operator is available to take your call.
 The recording should explain the requirements for receiving a letter from the Greetings Department. After that, submit your request in the fashion described by the recording. Include:


Your name, address, and phone number
The date of birth, name, and address of the honoree

, If you've had difficulty making a phone request for a birthday card from the president, you may have better luck with an online or snail mail request. Just like the other methods for requesting a birthday card, be sure to make the call 6 to 8 weeks before the birthday.

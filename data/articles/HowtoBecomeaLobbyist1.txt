 Lobbyists try to influence policy in a couple different ways. At the end of the day, their job boils down to being sociable and influential. Are you:


Adept at getting your way, even when significant challenges present themselves?
Good at meeting new people, maintaining connections, and growing your network?
Skilled in doing favors for other people?
Experienced in explaining complex issues to people in simple, direct terms?;
, You don't need a college degree in order to become a lobbyist; nor do you need to pass a certification requirement. All you need is the ability to make meaningful connections with politicians in important places, and the ability to sway them along the way. On the other hand, most people who become lobbyists do have at least Bachelor's degrees. The only things that matter when it comes to education as a lobbyist are:


Your ability to analyze information and develop a coherent political strategy.
Your ability to stay informed and up to date on global and political issues.
Your ability to predict which issues will stay important, which issues will fade from importance, and which issues will become important in the future.
 Are you fast-paced and action-oriented? Your ability to succeed as a lobbyist may depend on these qualities. Lobbyists get paid to produce results, which means that if circumstances intervene and keep you from getting your desired results, you'll have to pivot quickly and find another way to get the job done.

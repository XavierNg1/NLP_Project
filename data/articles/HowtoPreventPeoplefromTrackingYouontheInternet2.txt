, Nowadays, using WEP encryption or no encryption at all is as dangerous : don't do that !

, He/She can log, save, store everything that your are sending to/receiving from the internet through his/her proxy! He/She can even unset encryption provided by the protocol you are using (such as HTTPS, SMTPS, IMAPS, etc.) if you are carefree. Doing so, they could catch your credit card number and so one. It's far far more safer to use HTTPS when possible directly to the site than using such dangerous monkeys-in-the-middle.
 This is the only way to make sure than nobody except you and the remote server can understand what you sent and what you received. Use SSL/TLS every time you can, avoid plain FTP, HTTP, POP, IMAP and SMTP (use SFTP, FTPS, HTTPS, POPS, IMAPS, and POPS instead). If your browser say a certificate is wrong, leave the website. Period.
 All your data will go into that, they can log, store, save anything, they can give you fake webpages to get your credentials and even directly use them on the good website so that you don't even notice you gave it to strangers.

 Mix the yeast and warm water in a bowl. Leave it on the side for 15 minutes.
 In a separate bowl, add the sugar, flour, salt, and milk. Give the yeast a quick stir and then combine it in the milk bowl. Add the egg yolks and melted butter. Mix everything together thoroughly. Use cling film on the bowl and cover tightly. Leave the bowl on the side for an hour and let the batter rise. Do not leave it alone for more than an hour since it will taste fermented., Whip the egg whites and add them to the risen batter. Use a whisk and gently combine., Heat a frying pan over medium heat with a little vegetable oil. Spoon some batter and slowly pour it into the pan to create a small pancake. If you can fit more, add more spoonfuls to the pan to make more than one blini at a time. When you see bubbles in the batter, turn them over with a spatula and cook for another 20 to 30 seconds. Place the finished blinis on a tray while you finish the rest of the batter cooking., Add a generous spoon of sour cream on the top of each one. Add a small spoonful of caviar and a sprinkle of chopped chives on the top of the sour cream. Enjoy!

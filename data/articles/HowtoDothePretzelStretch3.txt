 Get into a heel stretch position so that you are holding your left foot with your left hand. Then, reach up with your right hand and grab your foot with your right hand also.
 Use both hands to pull your leg in closer to your body, towards your ear. Your thigh should be pressing against your stomach.
 Next, release your left hand but continue to hold onto your foot with your right hand. Take your left arm and loop it in front of your left leg. Press the back of your left leg with your left arm and reach towards your back with your left arm.
 Steady yourself and then slowly release your left foot with your right hand. Reach around your right side with your right arm and grasp your left hand.








Hold your position.

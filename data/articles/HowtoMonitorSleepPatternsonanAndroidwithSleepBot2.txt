 Tap SleepBot’s icon (square clock) from your device’s home screen to open the application.
 Tap the “Smart Alarm” button at the center of the app’s screen and choose the range of time you’d like to wake up. SleepBot’s alarm settings will go off during the time you’ve set to wake you up.
 The app is capable of recording any sign of movement or sound around you while you sleep. This helps in giving a more accurate result as to why you might not be having a good rest.


To set the app to record movements and sound, simply tap the “Track Motion” and “Record Sound” buttons at the center of the screen respectively to enable this feature. The buttons will have a blue checkmark as a sign that it’s already activated.
 This will begin recording your sleep pattern.
 The app will stop monitoring. The application will then display (in linear graph form) the report about your sleep pattern.
 The results will help you identify if there are any movements or sounds nearby that may be affecting your sleeping pattern. The report will show the following results:


A linear graph of movements showing its intensity and the time these motions were recorded
A linear graph of sounds showing its intensity and the time these audio were recorded
The duration of your sleep
Your personal rating of the quality of sleep you have
Short notes

, After viewing the report, you can opt to save it by tapping the “Save” button on the lower right corner of the app screen, or discard it by tapping the “Delete” button at the bottom center. You can also cancel the report by tapping the “Cancel” button on the bottom left corner of the screen.
 Do this by tapping the “Back” button of your Android smartphone or tablet.

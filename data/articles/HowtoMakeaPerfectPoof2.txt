 Gather the hair at the top of your head and separate it from the rest of your hair. Make sure that you've taken equal amounts of hair from each side. Just as in the previous method, you can imagine a crown resting on your head and grab the hair within the crown's circle.
 This is very important for getting the perfect poof with this method. If your hair isn't flat, it won't come out right. Having "dirty hair" will help with accomplishing this, since it tends not to be frizzy or wayward, as is freshly-washed hair.
 Hold it back with a small rubber band. For the health of your hair, avoid rubber bands that are just bare rubber. You want at least some type of covering to shield your hair from snagging. The size of rubber band depends on the thickness of your hair. However, since you'll be working with a relatively small amount of hair, it's fine to use a smaller rubber band.
 This method is great because it is very flexible. How far you push it forward depends on the size of poof you want. For a taller poof with more volume, push it farther forward. For a smaller poof, push it further back.
 Carefully place enough bobby pins in your hair to keep it place. After you're satisfied with how it looks, add a spritz of hairspray for a bit more hold. Finally, run a sheet of tissue paper over the top to smooth any fly-aways.

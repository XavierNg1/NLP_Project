 Instead of focusing on what you don’t like about your body, focus on what you do like and what your body enables you to do. Focus on the idea that your body has enabled you to accomplish your goals, or even perform mundane activities like walking and singing.When you find yourself criticizing your body, stop yourself and reverse the dialogue, for example, “I am proud of my body. Because of my legs and hips I am able to dance and I love dancing!” Or, “I love my arms and hands because they are strong and enable me to hug and comfort my friends when they are feeling down.”;
, Limit your use of magazines, TV, and social media that glamorize the thin body ideal. Also, try to cut out media that constantly criticizes women and their appearance. Surrounding yourself with this kind of negativity can result in negative thoughts about your own body, as well as the bodies of others., Surround yourself with people who love their bodies no matter what shape or size it is. Find friends who support you and encourage you to find beauty in your own body. Eventually, their confidence and good habits will pass on to you the more you hang out with them, and vice versa.If you have a good friend who constantly criticizes and compares their body type to others, try to flip the conversation. Let them know that you think their body is beautiful. Also, try to steer the conversation toward things you both love about your bodies, instead of what you hate about them.
 Do this instead of avoiding the mirror because you do not like your curves, especially when you are naked. Do your makeup or hair in front of the mirror while you are nude at least once a week. By doing other activities while you are naked in front of the mirror, you may be able to become more comfortable with your curves and appreciate your body for what it is, not what it is not.This may be uncomfortable in the beginning, but the more you do it, the more comfortable you will become with your naked body and curves.

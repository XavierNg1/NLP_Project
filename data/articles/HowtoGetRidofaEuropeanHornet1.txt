 Certain gels and baits, when transported to the nest, serve to poison and kill European hornets. This can be an effective means of pest control.


Honeydew gel is an effective means to poison European hornets. It can be purchased from most hardware stores or greenhouses.You can leave honeydew gel on shrubs and trees where you see hornets gather. Once it is carried back into the hornet nest, it will cause hornets to get sick and die. Sometimes the whole nest dies and other times a few hornets die, signaling dangers and causing the hive to navigate elsewhere.Honeydew gel may take a few days to work properly. If you do not see a reduction in the infestation in a week, you might want to try other means.;
, Glueboards are sticky paper boards you can attach to the siding of your home in areas where hornets congregate. Try to leave the boards around light, as hornets are attracted to bright lights as it makes hunting easier. When hornets fly into glueboards, they become trapped and eventually die. This can be an effective means to get rid of a small infestation where the nest itself is not near or in your home., Hornets are attracted to light, especially at night. A light trap can attract hornets to a large glowing light or orb and then kill them via electrocution.


European hornets are stronger than moths and other nighttime pests so you'll need a strong light trap. Look for something of at least 110 voltage.
In order for the light trap to work, you'll need to turn off other nighttime lights in your yard so the hornets are solely attracted to your trap.

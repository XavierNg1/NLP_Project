 You can orient the paper horizontally or vertically. If you orient it vertically, however, you'll have more room to add rain.


If you can't find any blue construction paper, you can use blue cardstock or blue printer paper.
 Tap the paint on so that it comes out puffy. The puffier, the better. Do not brush it on, or it will turn out streaky.


Your cloud can be any shape you want it to be.
Leave room under your cloud for rain, if you want.
 Use blue or silver glitter glue to make water droplets under your cloud. If you can't find any glitter glue, draw the droplets on using glue first, then shake some loose blue or silver glitter onto it. Tap the excess glitter off downward so that it doesn't get on the cloud.


Shake some some white or iridescent glitter onto your cloud for extra sparkle., The paint will take at least a day to dry. Once it dries, it will be puffy and a little soft.

 Fill a saucepan with 4 cups (960 milliliters) of water, then turn the heat up to medium. Let the water come to a boil. For best results, use filtered water.
 Once the water comes to a boil, add 4 bags of organic black tea, Â¾ cup (150 grams) of granulated sugar, 2 anise stars, 1 smashed green cardamom pod and 2 whole cloves. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves, then let it boil for 3 minutes over medium heat.
 This sounds like it will give you a very strong tea, which is exactly what you want. Remember, you will be adding ice and milk to your tea, which will dilute it a lot.


The longer you steep your tea, the more flavorful it will become. For best flavor, allow the tea to steep for 2 hours., The tea will likely have cooled during the steeping time. If it didn't, transfer the saucepan to the fridge so that it can cool more quickly.


You won't be needing the spices any more, so you can discard them.
 Fill a tall glass with ice, then pour the tea until it is about three-quarters of the way full. Top the tea off with 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of half-and-half, coconut milk, whole milk, or sweetened condensed milk.You can store any leftover tea in the fridge.

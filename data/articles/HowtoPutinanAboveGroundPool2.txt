 This can be done a couple different ways, and it is very important to the structure of your pool.


Rent a transit to find a level area. Can be rented at most local equipment rental outlets.
Use a long, straight board with a carpenters level on top of it to measure the levelness of the area.
 This is where the middle of you pool will be. It is easiest to measure off an existing object. A fence or swing set work as your existing object.


Measure from the existing object and mark where you want the edge of your pool.
Using the tape measure, measure half of the width (the radius) of the pool from the marked edge. This is your center point.
Stake the tape measure at the center point of the pool.
 This measurement won’t be exactly the wall of your pool, but it gives you a guideline for building.


Pull the tape measure to the radius measure of your pool plus one foot.
Mark this on the ground all the way around your center point.
 Your pool cannot be installed on top of any grass. If you put it on grass, the bottom will be unstable and can shift or settle over time.


A sod remover can be rented from your equipment rental shop and make this part of the job much easier.
 Once you’ve dug up your sod, rake over the area to clean it.


This will remove the remaining sod.
Also the roots, rocks, or other debris that can be bad for your liner will be picked up by the rake.
 Once again, this is important to the base structure of your pool.


Dig down any high areas, rather than building up low areas. This will prevent the pool from settling over time.
Your entire area should be within 1 inch of being perfectly level.

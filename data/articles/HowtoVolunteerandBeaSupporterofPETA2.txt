 If you are in the financial position to do so, you can sign up to give a small amount of money to PETA each month.


You can decide how much money you would like to donate each month in the online form you will fill out before donating., If you have any real estate, personal property, or even a vehicle that you would like to donate to PETA, you can do so.


Things like artwork, jewelry, and even old fur can all be donated to PETA to help animals.Everything you donate to PETA is tax-deductible.
 One great way to support PETA is to help raise money for them, even if you can’t donate much on your own. By creating a fundraiser for PETA, you will be able to pool money from more people and donate more than you might be able to on your own.


You can create your own online fundraising page on PETA’s website, and all donations can be made and collected via the web.

 When you get your Labradoodle puppy from a breeder or other owner, you need to make sure he has had his first distemper vaccination, his first round of dewormer, and an initial physical examination. Once you adopt him, he will need at least two more deworming treatments as well as various other vaccinations. These include:


Distemper booster at nine and 12 weeks, then another one yearly
Lyme vaccine at nine weeks with a booster at 12 weeks
Rabies vaccine at 12 weeks and then once a year, Once your Labradoodle has had his first year of vaccines, he needs to be taken to the vet once a year for a physical and to get any shots he needs. Once he turns 10, he should be taken to the vet twice a year.


You should also make sure you get heartworm preventative medication from your vet during these visits. Ask your vet if your dog should take them all year or just during heartworm season., Around the time your Labradoodle is six months old, decide if you want him to be neutered (or spayed if a female). This can help prevent some cancers, deter aggressive behavior, stop unwanted heat behavior, and eliminate the chance for unwanted puppies., There are a few conditions that your Labradoodle will be more susceptible to. He won’t be as susceptible to the conditions that affect purebred Poodles and Labradors, but there are some common to the mixture breed. These health issues include:


Hip dysplasia, which affects the hip joints and may lead to arthritis.
Elbow dysplasia, which is caused by abnormal development of the elbow and may lead to lameness and arthritis
Progressive retinal atrophy, which is where the retina in the eye degenerates over time
von Willebrand’s disease, which is a blood clotting disease that can lead to uncontrollable blood loss from even small injuries.

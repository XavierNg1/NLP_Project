 It is against the law to discriminate against an applicant due to race, sex, religion, age, disability, pregnancy, national origin, and other factors.Do not ask the candidate any questions that are geared toward finding out information in one of these areas. Here are a few common questions interviewers ask, even though they shouldn't:


You may not ask a woman whether she is pregnant, or expecting to start a family in the next few years.
Don't ask someone if they go to church, or what religion they were raised practicing.
Do not ask someone their age.
Do not ask someone if their health issues will affect their ability to work.
 If you're going on about yourself or the company the whole time, your candidate won't be able to get a word in edgewise. You might feel like it was a great interview and then realize you didn't really gain new information. Ask leading questions and let the candidate speak for the majority of the interview.
 You'll get more information out of the person if you're friendly, warm and inviting. Taking a hard-nosed approach will cause some people to close up and answer questions guardedly. Encourage openness and honesty through your body language. Smile, nod, and don't flinch if the candidate stumbles or has difficulties answering a question.
 Remember that the candidate has a choice in the matter of whether he or she takes the job if it's offered. You might find people reluctant to take the job if the company doesn't seem like a great place to work, or if you seem like you'd be an unpleasant manager. The cards aren't all in your hands, so don't go on a power trip during the interview.Â 

, Note important information during the interview, so you can double check on it afterward if need be. If the candidate gives you details about a big project he or she completed for a previous company, there's no harm in calling the references again to double check that it really happened.

 Going to bed early may cause you more anxiety and restlessness. Studies suggest that going to bed at the same time every night can help your body stay on schedule, which can go a long way toward helping you remain well-rested and healthy., If your body is too hot or too cold, you might be adding physical stress to an already restless night. Sleep studies have found that a room temperature between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit (or 15.5-19.4 degrees Celsius) is the ideal range for restful REM sleep.Check that windows are open or closed as needed, to allow for appropriate cooling and heating. Do this before getting into bed.
Try using a fan. It will provide your room with white noise while also keeping you comfortably cool.
 If you've already got a lot on your mind, dwelling on everything you'll need to do in the morning will only make it worse. Take preventative action and finish any packing, cleaning, or laundry you'll need for the morning well before your head hits the pillow.
 Light reduces your body's production of melatonin, which helps you fall asleep. Avoid watching television and using computers, tablets, or smart phones before bed.

 Depending on the size of your blender, you may not be able to use all of the chunks at once. Fill you blender a little less than half way full with pineapple.
 Straight pineapple juice can be very enjoyable, but it is often a little tart. If you have ever had pineapple juice before and enjoyed it, it probably had some sugar in it. Add 2 to 3 tbsp of sugar or honey to give it a little sweetness.
 If you are looking for a chilled slushier drink, add 6 to 8 ice cubs. More ice will create a thicker drink.


If you want your drink chilled but not slushy, simply pour the blended juice over ice and enjoy.
 Add 1 cup of water. If you want very think juice, just add 1/4 or 1/2 cup. Adding water will dilute the taste of the juice slightly, making it smoother and less tart.


You don't actually have to add any water at all, although a little bit of water at the bottom of your blender will help it juice the pineapple chunks.
 At this point, you want to blend until smooth. The blending time may vary depending on your blender and the amount of water and ice you've added. Try blending for 1 minute and then stopping the blender and stir your mixture with a spoon.


After stirring, put the lid back on the blender and blend in 1-minute increments until smooth.
 If you tend to prefer juices without pulp, you may like to strain your pineapple juice before you drink it. Otherwise, it is perfectly fine to drink just the way it is.
 Pour your pineapple juice into a tall chilled glass and garnish with pineapple wedges. Pour your juice over ice and add a straw if you prefer.

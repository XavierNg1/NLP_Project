 You won't be able to concentrate well in school if you keep on having to mess with your bangs. Luckily, bobby pins and headbands come in many different colors and patternsâ€”try getting some that match your outfit or your school's colors.
 You can use a metal or plastic headband, or a cloth one that wraps around your entire head. Headbands work on just about any hair length.


For a chic, boho look, choose a flower crown or wrap a colorful scarf around your head, like a headband.
 You can purchase some simple clip-on bows and put then right above a ponytail, or you can tie a ribbon around the end of a braid. Keep up the school spirit by choosing your school colors.
 Putting a massive flower on your hair for school might be a bad idea because it might not only get you into trouble, but it might also earn you a few mean laughs. Consider using a small hair accessory or two instead.

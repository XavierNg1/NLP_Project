 Vegetables like carrots, peas and sweet potatoes offer a sweeter flavor than many of the vegetables children sometimes refuse to touch (like broccoli and brussels sprouts). As children are genetically driven to eat sweeter foods, it makes sense to start with the sweetest vegetables. You can even make them sweeter by adding a honey glaze for carrots, or maple syrup and brown sugar for sweet potatoes., Children are also genetically driven to avoid the veggies that look the most like leafy plants. Cutting, dicing, and blending can help disguise the leafiness, but starting with butternut squash or sweet peas may help get the ball rolling., Many people have a higher sensitivity to bitterness than others. This is especially true in children, and this sensitivity tends to decrease with age. So, by starting kids with kid-friendly vegetables, and slowly introducing the more difficult ones can get the child interested (especially if you make it a point to show them your enjoyment of the vegetables).

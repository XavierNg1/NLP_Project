 This bowl can be plastic, aluminum, or steel, but it should NOT be made of lead. Put this bowl on a sunny surface outside.
 The cup or bowl should be shorter than the edges of the large bowl.
 Fill the large bowl with water but do not go over the edge of the small bowel or cup.
 Cover the bowl very tightly with plastic wrap. Use tape or rubber bands to ensure a tight seal.
 This should be right over your cup or bowl and should angle the plastic down. Make sure the plastic does not touch the cup, though. A good weight to use would be a rock.
 The sun will evaporate the water in the large bowl, causing the water vapor to rise and condense on the plastic. Since the plastic is weighted and angled, the condensation will roll down into your cup. Mmmm! Clean water!

 If your doctor has prescribed pain medications for you, then taking your medication about 30 minutes before you go to bed may help to control your pain. Make sure that you follow your doctorâ€™s instructions for how to use your medication and ask your doctor as soon as possible if you have any questions or problems.Keep in mind that some pain medications may make it hard to stay asleep because they can cause sleep apnea. For example, opioid medications such as codeine and morphine can cause you to stop breathing and wake you up in the night., You can use over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen.If you do not have prescription pain medicine for your broken ribs, then you can take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Check with your physician for a specific recommendation of what or how much to take. Do not take more than the recommended dosage.If you have or have had heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, stomach ulcers or internal bleeding, ask your physician to see if you can safely take one of these medications.
 Ice will help to numb the pain a bit and it may also help to reduce the swelling. During the first two days after your injury, you may benefit from using a covered or wrapped ice pack for about 20 minutes every hour. After the first couple of days, you can use the ice pack for 10 to 20 minutes at least three times per day.Try applying an ice pack just before you go to bed to help with the pain.
Avoid using heat on broken ribs, especially if there is swelling. Heat increases blood flow to the area of application, which can make swelling worse.

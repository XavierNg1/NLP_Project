 Jade always has strong opinions, and is never afraid to voice them. She's quite vocal and sometimes rude, which you may want to avoid, but she stands up for what she believes in - even if it's just telling Tori to get out of her chair.;
, When Jade is in the picture, she's never totally polite to people. Even when it seems like she's going to say something nice, she always ends her statement with a line that earns her a weird look. Learn how to be witty, and don't be afraid to be a bit rude to get your point across.



Don't be too rude. Jade doesn't flat-out insult people, and being rude just to be like Jade is just going to get you to lose friends. Rather, she's quite coy about how she insults people, but you probably don't want to insult people, either!

, Jade is a rebel, and doesn't give people's opinions a second thought, or even give them a thought at all. Don't care about people's opinions of you, and if someone tries to say something rude about you, either don't respond or give them a snarky answer, such as, "I didn't know the trash in your head could come out of your mouth".
 Jade wears mostly dark-colored clothing, and is never seen without color in her hair. Try reading up on how to dress like her to get a better understanding of what to wear to look like Jade.
 As odd as it seems, Jade is on friendly terms with just about everyone. She's dating Beck, is friends with Cat and Andr√©, and while she's not really friends with Tori and Robbie, she's friendly (for her personality, anyway). The only person she's shown to legitimately dislike is Trina, due to her lack of talent and how snobby she can be. You don't have to dislike people just because they don't fit a certain image, but try to make friends with a diverse group of people.
 You don't need to have a boyfriend to be like Jade - she and Beck spent quite some time apart, after all - but it can certainly help your image. Be softer-spoken around your boyfriend and don't be rude to him.

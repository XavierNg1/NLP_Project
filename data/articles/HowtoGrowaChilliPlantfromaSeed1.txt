 Dampen two paper towels. Scatter your chilli seeds on one paper towel and layer the second paper towel on top of it. Place the seeds in a zip lock bag or plastic container and seal it shut., As a general rule, chilli seeds need a temperature of 23-30 degrees Celsius (73-86 degrees Fahrenheit) to germinate. Place your seeds in a spot with consistent warmth (e.g. on a heated mat) for a period of 2-5 days, until they swell or sprout. Make sure that the heat source isn't hot enough to melt the zip lock bag or plastic container that your seeds are stored in.Pre-germinating the chilli seeds this way before planting them in compost or soil will give them a better chance of sprouting successfully.
In warmer climates, the seeds can be left outdoors to germinate, provided that the temperature does not drop below 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit)., Fill a large planting tray or a multi cell seed tray to the brim with a light compost. Break up any large clumps. Push the compost down 1-2 millimeters and water it.The compost should be watered right before adding the seeds, and then very little until germination occurs.
 Drop individual chilli seeds on top of the compost, about 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Cover them lightly with more compost. Gently firm the compost and mist it lightly with a spray bottle., Place plastic wrap over the planting tray to lock in heat and moisture. Place the tray in the same warm spot you put your seeds initially. Alternatively, you can purchase an electric propagation mat or tray (available at garden centres) which will keep your seedlings at a warm, consistent temperature., Keep an eye on the planting tray to monitor growth and ensure the compost quality. The compost should be moist but not wet, and should not be watered unless it feels especially dry. Sprouting should begin after approximately two weeks.

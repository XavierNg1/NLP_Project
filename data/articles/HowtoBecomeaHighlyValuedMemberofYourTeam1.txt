 Nobody likes working with a team member who says they’ll do something and then has no follow-through other than an endless list of excuses. If you’re that person, then put some thought into your claims before committing them on paper or to a group.


Map out a plan that, when you look at it, makes you feel confident about delivering what you've promised. Include a backup plan and a check-in point, so if you’re not on track, you can let your team know.
If you’re not sure how to come up with a trustworthy plan-of-action, sit down with a boss or co-worker who can help you out.
Set aside perfectionism. Teamwork is not about being perfect—–change happens around the clock at work, everyone knows that. Of course, being reliable is also about staying focused and working towards a goal. Keep your eyes on the end result, follow through, deliver what you say you will and more people will see you as trustworthy.
If you have passive aggressive traits, such as saying you'll do something but either not bothering to do it or doing it badly, then teamwork will be hard for you (and your team members will not fail to notice your reticence). By making a choice to stop acting passive aggressively, you'll enjoy teamwork a whole lot more and may learn a thing or two about giving and receiving help.;

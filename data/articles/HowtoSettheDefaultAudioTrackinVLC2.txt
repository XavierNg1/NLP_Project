 From the Preferences window, choose All in the bottom left of the window. If the simple method does not work for your field, it is possible that the audio tracks are not properly tagged. In this case, you will have to set the default audio track through a bit of trial and error.
 From the left side of your Advanced Preferences window, select the Inputs/Codecs header. This should open up a new page with Inputs/Codecs as the header.
 If your file has multiple audio tracks, you may need to experiment to find the correct one. If there are only 2 audio tracks, either 0 or 1 will be the correct track. 0 is the automatic track if you have reset your preferences; 1 will be the extra track.
 If the simple method did not work, this step probably won't change anything, but it is still worth a try. Enter in your desired language code in the input field next to "Audio Language." Again, the list of codes is here: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php.
 If you also are having trouble with setting a default subtitle track, try experimenting with different subtitle track numbers.
 Click the save button in the bottom right of the window to confirm your changes.
 You may need to restart the program for the changes to actually take affect.

, The Nintendo 64 is a great system because of the wide variety of games that are made available to you.


If you like 3-D platforming games, you'll want to get Super Mario 64, Donkey Kong 64, Legend of Zelda (Ocarina of Time is best recommended, but "Majora's Mask" provides a very unique experience), Conker's Bad Fur Day, and the Banjo-Kazooie series.
If you like racing games, you should check out Mario Kart 64, Diddy Kong Racing, Mickey's Speedway USA, Cruisin' USA and Beetle Adventure Racing.
Like first person shooter games? 007 Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Turok The Dinosaur Hunter, and 007: The World Is Not Enough are all decent games, even by today's standards.
There is also a wide variety of sports games. It is easy to find Madden 2000 used for $1, and there are numerous other great sports games outside of the EA franchise (Acclaim makes some great ones, and for all you soccer fans, International Superstar Soccer is pretty awesome. You've also got the Tony Hawk skating games, which are great for two-player mayhem).
There are even some good space shooters as far as Star Wars games, Star Fox 64, and Pilot-wings 64. If you're looking for great multiplayer experiences, in addition to games already mentioned, the Mario Parties #1-3 are great games, as is Super Smash Bros.
There aren't many role-playing games available, but if you like RPGs, you'll want to check out Paper Mario and Quest 64.
 Bust out the chips and drinks and play countless rounds of Donkey Kong 64, Duke Nukem, Banjo-Tooie, or any other multiplayer games you might find at your local pawn shop for a great deal.
 It's hard to play when the TV is fogged up with dust, and makes it less fun. Clean your console every once in a while, too! Don't clean inside the console, or the games. This could damage the cartridge!

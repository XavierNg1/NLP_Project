 In order to be infected with Lyme disease, a tick will usually have to be attached to your body for 36 hours. This allows for plenty of time to safely remove a tick and prevent infection. Be sure to check yourself, your children, and your pets for ticks after spending time outdoors in areas where Lyme disease had been reported., It is especially hard to diagnose a case of Lyme disease. A clear “bull’s eye” rash is the only way to readily diagnose early Lyme disease, as this is the only symptom unique to this disease; however, not everyone develops the rash. Furthermore, many of the other symptoms associated with Lyme disease are very similar to the symptoms cause by other, more common illnesses.Further, you may not know you’ve been bitten — so you may not suspect Lyme disease yourself. Bites themselves are tiny, and often entirely painless.
You will need your blood tested by a doctor to diagnose Lyme disease without the presence of an EM rash. These antibodies may not be present in your blood until a few weeks after infection. You will likely have to go through multiple tests at various levels of specificity to establish an accurate diagnosis.
If you see any other tests advertised to test for late Lyme disease that do not involve a blood test, these tests are not legitimate.
 Your doctor will guide your through the treatment process of Lyme disease, which will likely include antibiotics. Depending on what stage your lyme disease is in when you are diagnosed, the length of time you will need to take antibiotics and which antibiotic you need to take may vary. In early disease (with EM rash), you would need to take for about two to three weeks every day.


Once you begin treatment, your EM rash may subside, and pain and neurological issues should stop worsening; however, muscular and joint aches may persist for some time, as well as trouble concentration and short-term memory.

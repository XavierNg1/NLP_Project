 On a male, the front of their heads will have a high, noticeable crown. It will likely look much more prominent and a bit larger than the female angelfish.This feature might be more prominent at maturity, but you may be able to notice it earlier on in the lifespan, as well.This isn’t a surefire way to tell the difference between the genders. In some strains of angelfish, this physical difference might not always be present.
 Female angelfish might have more rounded bodies than males. Female angelfish are also generally a little smaller than male angelfish. If you want to buy pairs to breed, try buying a few smaller angelfish and a few larger angelfish. Once they’re mature, you’ll more than likely find out you have a few males and a few females.On female angelfish, the line from their dorsal fin to their eyes also tends to be a bit straighter than that of the male’s.
 Sometimes with female angelfish, you might be able to notice a difference when they swim towards you. The shape of their bellies might be a bit bigger or wider than male angelfish. Try looking into the tank and waiting for each of the fish to swim towards the glass. Observe the shape of their bellies from that angle.

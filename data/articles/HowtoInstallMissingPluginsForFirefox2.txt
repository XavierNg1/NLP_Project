 Firefox may at times prevent a plug-in from installing without your verification. In this case, a GPS plugin has failed to install, and requires further action.
 Click Allow, and the plug-in will download and install. Note: If you are not sure of the manufacturer, or are not aware of installing any new software, do not allow installation until you are confident this file is not a problem.
 Restarting your browser will allow Firefox to complete its plug-in installation process.

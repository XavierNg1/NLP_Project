 Most bad-breath causing bacteria lives on your tongue. Take your toothbrush and gently brush from the back (as far as you can go without hurting yourself) to the front. You can also buy a tongue scraper designed to scrape off the bacteria like a squeegee. Bad breath can be offensive to others, so brush your teeth twice a day- once in the morning after breakfast and once before you go to bed and take some mint gum to chew after snacks and meals.

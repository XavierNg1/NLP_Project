 "Normal" refers to the mean, median, and mode of a normal, or Gaussian, distribution, or what most people do within a given population. Definition of "normal": relating to, involving, or being a normal curve or normal distribution.. For example, in a third-world country, the normal diet may be vegetarian (because meat is too expensive), whereas in an industrialized country, the "normal" diet may not be vegetarian (i.e. most people eat meat).
 You may have to ask many people in this population of interest to find out. Don't be discouraged. The more people you survey, the closer your sample mean will approximate the population mean, and the more confidence you will have in your determination of a normal diet for your population of interest. Seek out a dietician (one who specializes in diet as a career) to help you.
 Only buy, prepare, and eat food part of the normal diet you have discovered. Avoid food not part of the normal diet. Eat with people that endorse the normal diet.
 Enlist the help of everyone you know, from friends, relatives, and loved ones. Ask them to guide you and help you may maintain the normal diet.

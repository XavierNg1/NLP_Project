 Even if you’re used to dealing with nasty messes from your baby’s bottom with an ungloved hand, you are less likely to transmit germs this way. You’re also less likely to scrape their rectum with your fingernail — which would assuredly make the process even less pleasant all around., Roll the suppository around in your hands for a few moments; it will be more comfortable for your baby if it’s a bit softer and closer to body temperature. For additional comfort, rub a bit of lubricating jelly (or, in a pinch, lukewarm water) over the suppository.Don’t use petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline), which might begin to break down the suppository.
 Place them on a flat, steady, comfortable surface; their usual changing table / spot is a great choice. Lift their legs with one hand to expose and partially spread their buttocks., There is no exact science regarding how far to push it in, but the general rule of thumb is this: push it only far enough in that it won’t fall out.If you encounter an obstruction or unexpected resistance, stop and contact your doctor.
Suppositories usually have a flatter end and a more rounded end. The rounded end usually goes in first, but your doctor might recommend the opposite to help keep the suppository in place.
 Only gentle pressure is needed. In the meantime, comfort and/or distract your baby from the unusual sensation caused by the suppository.Make sure to put a diaper on your infant before too long, or you may end up with a giant mess!

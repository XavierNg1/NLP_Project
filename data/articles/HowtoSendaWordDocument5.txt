 If you’re a Dropbox user, you can use the service to share documents with anyone on the web. Using this method will send a message to the recipient that includes a link to the document. The recipient will be able to download the document by accessing that link (and they won’t need a Dropbox account).


You’ll need to have a Dropbox account to use this method.
You should also have the application installed on your device. If you’re using a computer, you can use the web version by signing in to http://www.dropbox.com.
 If you haven’t uploaded the Word document to your Dropbox, do so now.


Mobile app: Tap the “+” icon and then select “Upload files.” Navigate to the document you want to upload, and then tap “Upload File.”
Desktop app: If the folder where the file’s stored is not already synced with Dropbox, drag the file from its current location to the Dropbox folder.
Dropbox.com: Navigate to the folder where you’d like to store the file, then click the “Upload” icon to select your document.
 This step is a little different depending on your platform:Mobile: Tap the downward-pointing arrow next to your Document and select “Share.”
Desktop: Right-click (or Ctrl+Click) the document in the Dropbox application, then click “Share…”
Dropbox.com: Hover the mouse over the document file and select “Share” (when the menu appears).
 If you’re using a mobile device, you’ll see this option under “These People”., Enter this into the “To:” field. To add multiple recipients, separate each email address with a comma (,).
 The button name depends on your application.If you’re using the Dropbox.com site, the button will say “Share.” An email will now be sent to the email address(es) you provided.

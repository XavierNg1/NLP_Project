 Add 6 cups (450 g) of chopped romaine lettuce, 3 slices center-cut bacon that’s been cooked crisp and chopped, 1 chopped pear, 1 chopped apple, ¼ cup (30 g) of chopped peanuts, ¼ cup (30 g) of dried cranberries, and ¼ cup (38 g) of crumbled feta cheese in a very large bowl. Use salad tongs to mix the ingredients well.If you prefer a vegetarian salad, omit the bacon.
You can substitute raisins for the dried cranberries if you prefer.;
, When all of the salad ingredients are mixed, pour ¼ cup (60 ml) of poppy seed salad dressing and 2 tablespoon (30 ml) of balsamic vinegar over them. Use the tongs to toss the salad again to ensure that the dressing is evenly distributed throughout the salad.You can add more or less of both the poppy seed dressing and the balsamic vinegar depending on your preference.
 After you’ve tossed the salad well, place it in two large salad bowls. Serve the salad immediately.When you serve the salad, you may want to have the poppy seed dressing available so you can add more if necessary.
If you are making the salad ahead of time, mix all of the ingredients without adding the dressing and vinegar. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate it. Toss in the dressing and vinegar right before you plan to serve it.

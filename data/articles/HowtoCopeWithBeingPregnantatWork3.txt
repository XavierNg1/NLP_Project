 Fatigue may come as the result of anemia, or low iron, which is quite common during pregnancy. You can counter anemia and boost your energy levels by consuming plenty of iron-rich foods.Some iron-rich foods include: meat, poultry, spinach (and other leafy greens), broccoli, sweet potatoes, beans, and fortified cereals.
Supplementing iron is an option, but it can cause upset stomach, so this may not be a good choice for you.
 Taking short, frequent breaks can help keep your energy up while you're at work. Getting up and walking around or resting your eyes in a dark room for a few minutes can do wonders for your mood and help counter fatigue. Do this as often as you are able during your work day.Speak to your employer about working short breaks into your daily schedule.
 Fitness may be the furthest thing from your mind during pregnancy (especially if you are not feeling well). However, maintaining a modest fitness routine can help boost energy levels and keep you (and your baby) healthy.Try going for a walk after work each night (or on your lunch break).
Look for prenatal fitness classes (such as yoga, Zumba, or water aerobics) in your area.
Be careful not to overexert yourself.
 The best way to cope with pregnancy fatigue is to sleep as much as possible. Avoid staying up late to tackle tasks. Rest is more important to a healthy, comfortable pregnancy than crossing items off of your to-do list.

 If your bed sheets got stained, you may want to take a peek at your mattress and mattress protector as well. There is a chance that they got stained as well. You will need to treat them as well.
 If the stain is fresh, a bit of cold water may be all you need to get it out. If the stain has already dried, a good soaking (several hours to overnight) will help loosen the stain and make it easier to get out.


If the stain is on a mattress, lightly spray the stain with a bit of water. Do not soak the stain.
 Mix ½ cup (65 grams) of cornstarch, ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 tablespoon of salt. Spread the paste onto the stain, let it dry, then brush it off. Repeat the treatment if necessary., Do not dump the white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide onto the stain. Instead, soak a clean cloth with the white vinegar/hydrogen peroxide first. Squeeze out any excess liquid, then gently dab the stain. If the cloth gets dirty from the blood, use a cleaner part of the cloth. This way, you won't be transferring the stain back onto the mattress.
 Once you have the stain off, load them into the washing machine separately, and wash using cold water and mild detergent. Use a double rinse cycle, if you can.Toss a tennis ball or dryer ball into the dryer along with your comforter to help fluff it up again.

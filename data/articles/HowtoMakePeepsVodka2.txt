 For this method, you'll be making a half-bottle of Peeps vodka. This is because you'll be placing the Peeps directly into the vodka bottle, and their marshmallow goodness takes up a lot of room.


Make sure all of your Peeps are the same color — that way, your vodka will be one bright, beautiful color instead of a muddier mix!

, You could do half plain, half Peeps-infused. Or, use the other half for the refrigerator method (above).
 They don't have to be miniature, just small enough for you to get them into the vodka bottle.


For less mess, freeze the Peeps, then cut them into pieces with a slicing knife.
 You might need to use the end of a wooden spoon to push everything into the bottle.


Make sure the Peeps are covered. If you have any room leftover once they're all in, pour back some of the vodka you set aside in Step 2.
 Put the cap back on, making sure to twist it as tightly as possible.
 The hot water will melt the sugary Peeps and speed up the infusion process., When you take the vodka out of the dishwasher, shake it to make sure it's evenly mixed.
 You don't have to do this step — you could simply pour your drinks out of the vodka, and count any marshmallow globs as a garnish. If you would like to strain it, though, here's how:

Pour the vodka into a bowl. If there are some Peeps bits left behind, don't worry!
Rinse out the bottle.
Put a funnel in the bottle. Use a coffee filter or a paper towel for a filter.






Pour the vodka from the bowl into the funnel. Be aware that this process might require more than one filter.

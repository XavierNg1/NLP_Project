 This is great for creating awareness for your page. These updates will send like all other event invites. However, the information for the update will not be directly displayed on your page, but instead link to the event itself.
 As the page administrator, use your search bar to arrive at the fan page itself.
 It says "What's on your mind?" > Click "Event, Milestone +" > Select "Event".
 It will allow you to input the information for the event. Fill out the fields as desired.
 You will be carried to the event page as soon as you click "create". Select the "Share" button in the upper right corner of the page.
 Now the information is available on your timeline and the page's timeline also.

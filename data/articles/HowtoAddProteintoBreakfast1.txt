 While sausage is not traditionally thought of as a healthy food, low-fat sausage can be a great source of protein at breakfast when paired with other healthy choices. Instead of pork- or beef-based sausages, go for chicken and turkey sausages instead. Pair these with something like a bowl of oatmeal, yogurt and fruit, or whole wheat toast for a healthy, protein-rich breakfast., While traditional bacon does have more fat and calories than turkey bacon, it also contains good fat and has less sodium than poultry-based bacons. You can add a few slices of bacon to your morning eggs, toast, or cereal to add a boost of protein.You can also try Canadian bacon, which contains about 20 to 30 grams of protein per serving., Smoked salmon is sometimes served along with bread-based products for breakfast. Fish is a very healthy source of protein that also includes omega-3 fatty acids. Try having a piece of smoked salmon on top of a piece of whole wheat toast. Top it off with some avocado for a healthy, filling, protein-rich breakfast., While not thought of as a traditional breakfast food, there's no reason you can't have some chicken breast during your breakfast. Chicken is a healthy, lean meat that can add a boost of protein to the start of your day. You can try adding some shredded chicken to an omelet or having a slice of chicken on a breakfast sandwich.

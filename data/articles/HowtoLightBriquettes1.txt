 Visit the outdoor section of your local home improvement store or big-box store, like Walmart or Target. A charcoal chimney is essentially a metal cylinder with a handle on it. Look for a chimney with a sturdy cylinder, a comfortable handle, and slots around the bottom for easy lighting.

You may find a variety of sizes, so consider the size of your grill.;
, Grab a few pieces of newspaper or paper towels and crush them up into wads. Place them on the lower grate of your grill and set the chimney on top of them. Make sure you’ll be able to reach the slots on the bottom of the chimney.Lighter cubes are another option. They are more expensive than paper, but also tend to light more effectively. Find them at the store with the chimney and briquettes.
 Pour the bag of briquettes into the chimney, or load them by hand. Many chimneys will hold about 100 briquettes. If your grill is small, you may only need to fill the chimney half or three quarters full. Use your best judgment., Use a long reach lighter so your fingers aren’t too close to the flame. Stick the end of the lighter through one of the slots in the bottom of the chimney. Hold the flame against the paper and keep the lighter lit until you are sure the paper has caught fire., The chimney burns the charcoal from the bottom up. Wait about 10-15 minutes for the fire to work its way to the top layer of charcoal. When you see ash on the top charcoal, pour it into your grill. Chimney starters are not meant to be left on or in the grill while you cook.

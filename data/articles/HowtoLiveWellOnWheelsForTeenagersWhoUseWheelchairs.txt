 It's not always fun, but it is reality. Trying too hard to ignore it can make you seem more different than you are. Unique is good.;
, Living life 100% is a must. If you want to go to a rock concert, go to that rock concert! Yes, you will probably be different in some ways from every other person in the room. You also have things in common with every one of them!

, If you need help (especially if you've fallen or are in a health-threatening situation) don't be afraid to ask.
 If someone is leaning on your chair or saying something that makes you feel uncomfortable, speak up.
 Relish the things you enjoy in life. Have fun doing what you love to do. Investigate new ways to do things, and explore new things that you haven't tried before. You could discover the world of art, or play a sport. Even activities that seem impossible to do in a wheelchair can often be adapted.
 Find the balance between being comfortable and being well dressed. The extra effort may pay off with more confidence and a brighter mood.
 Be yourself. Sit tall, make eye contact, and engage people in conversation.
 Everyone feels down sometimes. Schedule a vent session with a friend or therapist, where you can rant all about what's bugging you. Try expressing your emotions through your artistic or creative side when it seems that life sucks. Write in a journal, paint, whatever.
 Not everyone knows how to act around you. Yeah, this is frustrating and stupid, but a little patience goes a long way. "F-- you!" has its place, but most people just need to understand that you're a normal person.
 Although there is no perfect wheelchair, when you're choosing your chair, get the best one you or your insurance can cover. It really does make a difference in your day to day living.
 eat right, exercise, and get a good night's sleep.

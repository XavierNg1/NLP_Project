 Get in front of a full length mirror. It's important that you see your whole body. Then, put on your most comfortable clothes (don't worry about what people would think if they saw you in them) and turn the music on. Pick a song that:


you like
you can dance to easily
is at least somewhat popular;
, Just move your body to the music, however it feels right. Don't worry if it looks absolutely ridiculous, which it very well might. Do what you want to the move your entire body to compliment the music. Your moves don't have to be coordinated, match, or make sense, just dance. Jump around to that cool song in your PJ's for hours if you have to. Just get comfortable with dancing.
 Try to have a pretty good idea of the beat and lyrics of the song so you know when it gets slower, faster or when to come in or fade out, or do something crazy. Listen to the song a few times and get familiar with it. Dance some more.
 You can have three or four or maybe just one move that's totally yours. They should go with the music and feel natural when you're dancing to them. For beginners, consider making your first few moves include snaps and/or claps. This can help you stay steady and on beat- it's an established fact. You can throw in these moves once in a while when they fit in and when you're stuck.
 Like one minute you've got your hands doing some cool thing above your head, then you swing them around and you're moving your hips. Use different levels of dancing and make it interesting.
 Watch dance shows or professional dancers. Do not copy their dance moves, but they should give you ideas on how to come up with your own and move to the music.
 Wherever you are and you're expected to dance, go back to Step 2 and remember: make it feel natural and with the music. Connect with the music. Connect with the crowd. Have confidence and just move your body.

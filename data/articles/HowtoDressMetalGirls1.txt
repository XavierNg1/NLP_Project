 Having a band's name on your shirt is the easiest way to tell the world you are a "metalhead." Choose a small-sized men's shirt for a loose "roadie" look, or a women's fitted shirt, babydoll or crop top for a more "girly" fashion statement.;
, You'll save money and get the coveted "worn out" look by shopping for jackets in a thrift store. An old army jacket is a good alternative if you're opposed to leather, or for warmer weather. Add pins and patches of metal bands.
 Regular blue jeans are the universally accepted uniform for every music genre, except classical. But for metal, black is your go-to color, and skinny is your go-to fit. Take them one step further by "destroying" them with holes and rips.
 Good choices are combat boots, Doc Martin's, biker boots, and heels that have an aggressive, "bad girl" look. You can also wear sneakers like Chucks or Vans when you're in the mood to straddle the line between metal and punk.
 On occasion, you'll want to wear something other than jeans and a leather jacket.


Wear black mini-skirts. Finish the look with fishnets, tights or leggings.
Buy a black leather vest. Vests can be worn over t-shirts and tank tops, or alone.
 Accessorizing is vital to achieving the full metal look. Try studded or bullet belts, pins, studded wrist cuffs, chains and metal jewelry, especially anything heavy or Germanic like the Iron Cross.

 Italian wedding tradition holds that the groom must approach the prospective bride's father privately in order to profess his love for the man's daughter and to get permission to request her hand in marriage.;
, After the proposal is accepted and before it is announced, it is customary for the groom-to-be to put a diamond ring on the bride-to-Be's ring finger.
 Also called a hope chest, a trousseau is a collection of household items, keepsakes and clothing that is to be used by the bride and groom after the ceremony. A bridal shower is the modern answer to the traditional trousseau.

 One-on-one time is important, and your child will feel loved and supported if they can spend time with you every day.


If you're too busy one day, try making up for it with extra time on the next day or the weekend.
 Compliment your child on their skill with soccer, swimming, or running. Try to expose them to pictures of overweight and obese kids having fun exercising. This will make them feel more positively about exercise, and want to do it more.
 Tell them that they have beautiful eyes, strong arms, or an adorable smile. Treat their body as a wonderful part of them, not a burden. If they love their body, this can motivate them to take good care of it.
 Obese children are likely to be bullied. Explain that bullying is wrong, and is the fault of the bully for choosing to be mean. Teach them the phrase "I'm okay, they're mean" to repeat to themselves if the bullies are getting into their heads.
 Watch for...


Secretiveness about eating
Calorie counting
Over-exercising
Fad dieting, especially for a "quick fix"

, Limit exposure to media, which only defines a very narrow percent of the population as "beautiful." Help them choose well-fitting clothes that they like to wear, so they can feel good about how they look when they leave the house.Tell them that people of all sizes can be attractive, and that your size and physique don't determine how awesome you are.
 Tell them things that they did well, related to their health, talents, personality, interests, et cetera. Make it clear how much you love them and are proud of the good choices they make every day.

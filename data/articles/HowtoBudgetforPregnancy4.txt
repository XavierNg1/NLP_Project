 You’ll be amazed at how quickly you begin to receive things once the word is out about your pregnancy. Once your doctor confirms your pregnancy, the information is passed on to your insurance company. Like magic, your mailbox will be full of freebies, such as free magazine subscriptions, diapers and baby care items, and coupons.
 Once your friends, family and coworkers find out your expecting, they will likely shower you with offers to borrow their old pregnancy stuff. It’s not a bad idea to borrow maternity clothing such as pants and shirts or dresses. You never know how quickly your baby bump will blossom, so with a stockpile of various maternity sizes, you may never have to purchase a pregnancy wardrobe.



Friends and family may offer to lend you baby clothes or toys; it’s smart to take them up on the offer. The more items you stock up on, the less you will need to buy.
Consider shopping at thrift stores or consignment shops, since most of these stores have a collection of nearly new baby clothes, toys, high chairs and strollers. Once your baby grows, you can pass the outgrown items on to a friend or bring them to the consignment shop and make a few dollars.

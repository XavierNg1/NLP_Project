 Show your enthusiasm for having her in your life by helping to form these connections. Say, "This is an old friend of mine and I am really excited for you two to meet. I think you'll hit it off."

It is also helpful to connect people through what they may have in common. For instance, say, "This is my friend, Joe, who loves soccer almost as much as you" or "I went to high school with Maya, she has three dogs, so you two can obsess over your love of animals."

, It's always a little uncomfortable for a girl to hang out with her boyfriend's friends (unless she knows them), so make sure that your friends are treating her right. They shouldn't be flirting with her, calling her names, or commenting on her body. This will make your girlfriend feel very uncomfortable in their presence. Do not let your friends use sexist language about other women, as this will make your girlfriend wonder if they speak that way about her behind her back.


If your friends do something to upset your girlfriend, confront them as soon as possible. Pull them aside and say, "I felt offended by the way you spoke to my girlfriend" or, if you need to be more direct, "I know you thought that was funny, but that wasn't cool." Be firm, but understanding, and keep the conversation focused on how you feel, rather than take an accusatory tone.
 She'll feel like you are disinterested in her if you spend more time with your other friends than her, and could even suspect that you're trying to cheat on her. Don't send off the wrong signals! Be sure to treat her like a queen so that she feels secure in the relationship., This will make her feel insecure about your relationship together, and will create an awkward feeling between her and her friend. She should never have to choose between you and her friends.

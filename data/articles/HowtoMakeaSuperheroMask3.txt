 If you’re making superhero masks as part of a superhero themed party, especially for kids, making them out of a cereal box is a cheap and easy option. Just ask each guest to bring an empty cereal box to the party., Before you trace a design onto your cardboard, you'll need to break the cereal boxes down so that they're flat. Simply tear each box open at the places where it's sealed with glue., If you’re using craft foam or cardboard, you can spray paint the mask to give it color. You can use one color or multiple colors, particularly if your mask has an intricate design). If you want to use multiple colors, tape off the edges of the area where you want to paint. This keeps the color in that area. If you are using multiple colors, let each color dry before you move on the next. Putting tape over wet paint will cause the paint to peel off.You should only use spray paint in a well-ventilated area or outside.
 Once your mask is finished, you'll need a way to wear it. Using crafting sticks to make a handle by hot gluing a stick to the bottom of the mask. This allows you to "wear" the mask by holding it in front of your face.

 You make yourself invisible using the "Invisibility potion." And fly above survival users, splashing them with your potions. They won't see you, and it really annoys them.
 Quick, easy, and very fun.
 Give them armour and everything, then step back, yell go, and annihilate them with your wooden sword.

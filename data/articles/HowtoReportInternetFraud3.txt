 If you believe your identity has been stolen, it's important to act as quickly as possible and pull together as much information as you can about the perpetrator.


Online identity theft often involves the use of spam emails in which the sender impersonates another person or a company in an attempt to gain identity information, or your bank account or credit card numbers.If you received spam emails, make copies of the emails along with any identifying information from the sender.
If the emails included any files or attachments, make note of the type of attachment and, if possible, the file name., As a precaution, change your passwords to any internet accounts, especially those that have saved identity or billing information.


You also might consider running anti-virus software or taking your computer to an expert to have it cleaned, particularly if you opened an email that had an attachment or may have infected your computer with a virus., If your credit card numbers or other banking information was taken, have the cards cancelled as soon as possible.If you entered your bank account number, talk to a representative at your bank as soon as possible to have your money moved to a different account., You should check your credit report and make sure no additional accounts have been opened using your information.Federal law entitles you to a free copy of your credit report each year, which you can request at annualcreditreport.com.If you find any errors on your credit report, make sure you follow up with the credit bureaus and the companies that supplied the information to get the entries removed promptly and have any fraudulent accounts closed., If you want to report the identity theft in person, you can visit the nearest FBI field office during business hours.

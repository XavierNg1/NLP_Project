 Make them in a variety of colors so people have many to choose from. Make different sizes, different shapes, different colors. Add beads for more decoration. Decide how many you think you will sell, and make extras just in case. Don't rush making them though - you want them in perfect condition for your customers.;
, You might want to sell them at home if you have a lot of company, but you might want to sell them at bake-sales, parks, lemonade stands, at school, and places like that. You could also find people to spread the word for you, and sell them at their work and whatnot, but only do this with trustworthy people.
 Do this by judging how long it took you, how much string you used, how much the floss costs, the little things like that. You always want to make more money than you used to make them - keep that in mind.
 What are you going to call your business? Figure that out so you can get your name out there to the public. Be creative.
 Something with the company name and your name, address and phone number. Nothing too fancy, since you're only selling something small.

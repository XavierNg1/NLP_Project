 Binge eating, as with any eating disorder, has its roots in strong and painful emotions.When you begin to change your eating habits, those emotions will surface and may feel overwhelming at first. To cope, find people who will support you in your endeavors to manage your emotions.


This can include your medical professional, a nutrition specialist, a counselor, peers who will not sabotage your goals, a support group of people dealing with the same issues, and trusted and safe family members.
 Visit a counselor or therapist who specializes in eating disorders. Follow his or her guidance in finding the right support group for your needs.
 If you are able to, remove yourself from circumstances or environments that are emotionally or physically damaging. Domestic violence, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and physical abuse are all triggers for binge eating. You may need law enforcement and social services to help you leave a dangerous situation.
 If you experience setbacks, don’t get discouraged. Even if you do binge eat, rest assured that you are beginning to cope with the disorder when you recognize that you are bingeing and when you step away from the food. If you immediately change your environment to clear your head and your emotions and allow your body time to recover, you are moving forward. You are not alone and there is help. Don’t get discouraged when you experience setbacks. This is part of coping and moving forward.

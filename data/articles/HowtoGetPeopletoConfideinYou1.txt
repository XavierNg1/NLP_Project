 Before someone can confide in you, you have to demonstrate that you are dependable. If you promise someone that will do something, make sure that you actually do it. Fulfilling your promises regularly will show that you can be trusted.


If you cannot keep a promise, let the other person know. Rather than just standing them up or falling through, you can give a call or text message telling them why you had to cancel. They will appreciate the gesture.;
, Trust is a two-way street. If you want someone to confide in you, you may have to confide in them first. If you find a person trustworthy, you can share with them some of your feelings, thoughts, or problems. Since you were willing to share with them, they may be more willing to share with you.


Another way to show vulnerability is to be silly in front of them. Do karaoke together. Tell bad jokes. Dance. These activities will strengthen your bond, and they will show that you trust the other person enough to be yourself in front of them., If someone shares something personal with you, donâ€™t tell others. People will judge your trustworthiness based on how well you respect their privacy. Even if you are gossiping about people they do not know, blabbing will only demonstrate that you cannot be trusted. They will worry that you are sharing their secrets with other people.
 Complaining, criticizing, or insulting other people can show that you are judgmental. People will be hesitant to confide in you since they will not want to be judged. Try to keep your negative opinions to yourself.
 Do not be nosy. Once you're friends with people, it won't be long until they tell you things. However, if you're always asking them to include you or butting into their conversations, they will not trust you. By being nosy, you are signaling that you are more interested in their story than their well-being.

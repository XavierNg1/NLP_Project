 In many cases, a short discussion can clear up the entire conflict. You may have misinterpreted your teacher’s behavior, or you could be unaware of something you’re doing that is irritating or frustrating to the teacher.


Ask your teacher if there’s a convenient time you could talk in private.
Always be polite and show respect. If you go into a meeting angry or upset, the conflict is less likely to be resolved.
Bring specific talking points with you, so you can be as clear as possible. It’s best to say something such as, “On Friday, you seemed frustrated that I didn’t understand the subject, so you called on me 3 times. That was embarrassing to me, and I still don’t feel I really understand the topic.” Rather than, “You always call on me when I don’t know the answers.”
Ask a friend or family member to practice the discussion with you beforehand.;
, Teachers have years of education and experience in the subjects they teach. Since learning more about this topic is the purpose of your relationship, reaching out to discuss the best ways to succeed in the classroom shows your teacher you care, and will likely give you the opportunity to see the instructor at their best., Sometimes, the reason you don’t like your teacher is the way they run the classroom. If you’re used to a very relaxed class, learning to thrive in a strict environment is difficult and vice versa. In most cases, giving yourself time to adjust to this new style of teaching is adequate. However, if you’re still struggling several weeks into the class, approach your teacher and ask for help., One way to change negative thought patterns is to make yourself explore the positive side of the situation. A great way to do this is keeping a journal where you enter one negative thing that happened in class and one positive each day. This shifts your thought process from fixating on the negative aspects of your student-teacher relationship to considering both positive and negative equally.

 If you want to custom cut a mirror, almost any piece will do – you can purchase uncut mirror glass from a hardware store or repurpose something you already have. Avoid cutting mirrors that are already severely chipped or cracked in multiple places. A mirror in bad condition may not be able to withstand the cutting process and shatter while you’re working with it.


If you’re looking for another source to buy uncut mirror, look for specialty shops that deal specifically in mirror and glass.
It may be helpful to purchase a few pieces of inexpensive mirror to practice on. Try single-strength window glass, since it is easier to cut and usually the least expensive.;
, Use glass cleaner or rubbing alcohol and a microfiber cloth to wipe down the mirror’s surface. Clean it thoroughly – you need it to be as spotless as possible, because even the slightest speck of dirt or dust can cause interruptions during the scoring process. This may result in the glass chipping or breaking.Use another microfiber cloth to wipe the surface down once more to ensure the mirror is completely dry before you begin.
 During the scoring and breaking process, tiny shards of glass will be discharged. These could potentially get into your eyes. It’s very important to wear some kind of eye protection or safety goggles when you’re working with glass. Don’t rub or touch your eye area while you’re working. Wear protective gloves, especially when handling freshly cut glass – the edges will be very sharp.Avoid wearing open-toed shoes or sandals.
If you end up with a glass splinter, try to remove it by placing a sticky piece of tape over it and then whipping it off quickly. If that doesn’t work, use tweezers.

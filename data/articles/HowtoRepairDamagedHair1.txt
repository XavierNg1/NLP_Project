 Be careful about this. Hair stylists are the cause of most hair damage. You must use hair scissors that are right for your hair. If your hair has a straw-like texture with split ends, the first thing way to restore its health is to get a trim. Cutting your hair will immediately make it look fresher and restore its body.


To check if your stylist is using extra sharp scissors, get them to cut into a wet tissue. Inspect the cut - if you see torn tissue fibers, find another stylist.
Cut off as much as you dare. Hair is more damaged toward the tips, since that part of the hair has had more time to be affected by heat, chlorine, and other sources of hair damage.
Ask the stylist not to blow dry your hair or use any styling products. These will further damage unhealthy hair.;
, Now that your hair is freshly cut, treat it very gently until its health is restored.You may only use heat if you use heat protective spray.That means blow dryers, curling irons, or straightening irons.


Air drying your hair is less damaging than using a blow dryer. Let your hair exist in its most natural state.
If you must straighten or curl your hair, use a more gentle method, like rollers or hair wrapping, to achieve the look you want.
 Bleaching the color from your hair, then adding chemicals to dye it another color is extremely damaging. Bleaching or dying hair can lead to hair breakage, hair loss, and bald patches.


Permanent curling or straightening are also damaging and should be avoided.
Deep conditioning treatments meant to restore your hair's moisture may actually contain chemicals that are bad for your hair.
Straighteners and Hairdryers infused with Keratin and Argon oils will help keep hair healthy. Remington have some hair styling tools that will help maintain healthy hair without compromising results.

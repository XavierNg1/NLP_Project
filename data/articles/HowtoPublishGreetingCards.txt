There are basically 3 types of print greeting cards: traditional, contemporary and alternative. Alternative cards are those that are unconventional, such as humorous or sarcastic cards. Greeting card companies need to cater to the audience that will buy these types of cards. The main target audience is women that are between the ages of 18 and 50, so they tend to focus on the issues that women care about such as relationships, money, health and religion.
You can come up with a traditional or contemporary card such as a birthday card or you can tune in to a certain issue. Alternative types of cards are becoming more popular and card companies are expanding their lines to this market.;

You can go to local stores and look through the existing greeting cards to see if your idea is already a card. If there is nothing similar to your idea, it may mean that the idea hasn't been addressed yet, or it may mean it has, but was never picked up. If you go ahead and suggest it to publishers, you will need to state your reasons for your suggestion.



Make a rough sketch for your card. This will be for your reference so using basic pen and paper is sufficient.



You will need to have your greeting card designed. Wondershare is a program that is available for purchase that will allow you to design greeting card templates or pick from the ones that are provided.



You can look online for contact information for major greeting card companies. Call and ask how you can submit your work to them to be considered for publication.



You will most likely send in a presentation to the publisher. This presentation should include your main idea, your target audience, what need is met by making this card and why you think the card is an important addition to the greeting card market.

 There is no need to heat the solution when adding the germicidal compounds. Place the mixture on a heat proof surface (e.g. a granite counter top or into a larger container of sand). Take care not to spill any of the soap solution.The soap solution will make be twenty percent of your total black phenyle solution.
 Creosote oil is a source of phenol derivatives, including carbolic acid. These compounds are necessary for the disinfecting properties of black phenyl. Thirteen percent of the black phenyle solution will be creosote oil.To make a 5 L batch of black phenyl, you will add 650 milliliters (22  fl oz) of creosote oil to 1 L of soap solution., Chloroxylenol will boost the germicidal properties of the a black phenyle solution. It should comprise 2.5% of the total solution. You can purchase chloroxylenol from lab and manufacturing retailers or online.For the same 5 L batch of black phenyl, you would add 125 milliliters (4.2  fl oz) of chloroxylenol to 650 milliliters (22  fl oz) of creosote oil and 1 L of soap solution., Water is the most abundant ingredient in black phenyle disinfectant. The solution contains 64.5% water. Pour the mixture into the water while slowly stirring.


For a 5 L batch of black phenyl, you will add 3.225 L of water to 125 milliliters (4.2  fl oz) of chloroxylenol, 650 mL of creosote oil, and 1 L soap solution.

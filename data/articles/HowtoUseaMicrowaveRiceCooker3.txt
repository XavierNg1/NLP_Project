 Some microwave rice cookers come with a steamer basket that fits inside the cooker. You add food to the basket and water to the bottom of the cooker. Because the food is not sitting directly in the water, it gets steamed instead of boiled.


Place the empty steamer basket directly inside the rice cooker.
 The steamer basket is ideal for pasta and vegetables, including potatoes, greens, corn, carrots, and more. Add the desired vegetables to the steamer basket and add ½ cup (118 ml) of water to the bottom of the cooker.


For pasta, it’s better to boil than steam. For every 12 ounces (340 g) of pasta you use, add about 7 cups (1.65 L) of hot water, or enough to cover the pasta.Do not fill the steamer basket more than three-quarters full to leave room for expansion.
 Insert the inner lid over the steamer basket. Add the outer lid and close the latches on the handles. Set 1,000-watt microwaves to 70 percent power. Cooking times will vary depending on the food. For a pound (454 g) of food, microwave for:4 minutes for pasta
4 to 7 minutes for spinach and peas
5 to 9 minutes for corn and Brussel sprouts
7 to 13 minutes for asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots
11 to 16 minutes for beans

, When the cooking time is up, remove the cooker from the microwave and set it on a heat-proof mat. Let the vegetables or pasta stand for two minutes. Then, remove the lids, pull out the steamer basket, and discard the excess water.


Transfer the veggies or pasta to bowls or plates and serve.
Spinach should not be left to stand after cooking. When the cooking time is up, remove it from the cooker immediately to prevent wilting and sogginess.

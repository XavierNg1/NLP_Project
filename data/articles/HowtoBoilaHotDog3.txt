 Plain boiled hot dogs taste great, but you might want to give yours a kick by adding some spices. Try adding half a teaspoon of salt if you like your hot dogs salty. In addition, pour in one or more of the following spices before you turn up the heat:


1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon Italian spice mix
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

, Beer imparts a delicious sausage flavor to the hot dogs. It's the perfect way to add flavor if you're cooking up a batch of dogs to eat while watching sports or serving a roomful of adults who like the flavor of beer. Just add an entire beer to the water to replace a cup and a half of water. Bring it to a boil and cook the dogs as normal.


If you're up for an experiment, try different types of beer. For example, a pale ale will impart a very different taste than a darker beer.
This method works for hot dogs of any kind, but tastes especially good with all-beef dogs.
 Tossing in a garlic clove or two while the water comes to a boil is a great way to add earthy flavor to your hot dogs. You don't even have to peel the garlic; just throw in a clove or two unpeeled.
 If you want crispy dogs, quickly sauteing them after you've boiled them is the way to go. Heat a skillet over medium high and add a dash of olive oil. Use a knife to split your dogs in half lengthwise. When the oil is hot, saut√© the dogs split-side down until they're brown and crispy.
 No matter how you cook your dogs, the best flavor comes afterward in the form of great condiments. Place your dogs in their buns and add your favorite toppings. Here are a few ideas:


Chili
Shredded cheese
Ketchup and mustard
Chopped onions, raw or sauteed
Sauteed mushrooms
Pickle relish

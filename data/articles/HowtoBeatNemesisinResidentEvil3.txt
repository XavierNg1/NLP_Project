, Freeze rounds will slow the Nemesis, however any form of grenade, and the magnum, will shorten the battle significantly (the shorter the battle, the less chance of you losing health). The shotgun is not recommended as it has a considerable amount of recoil, and can make dodging difficult. Filling your free slots beforehand with herbs is obviously recommended, however if it is not an option be ready to be forced to practice dodging via trial and error.
 It is strongly recommended that you take one or two shots, and, only run a little between shots. Avoid walls or dodge may not work, and remember- don't get greedy.
Note: the Nemesis uses his left hand for his attacks- swinging to his right has a better chance when not using the R1 dodge.


The first attack is a straightforward punch, a little practice with dodging(tap R1 directly after he throws the punch) can make this attack worthless.
The second attack is a "power" punch, in which the Nemesis reaches back before punching. The timing has a delay, and misinterpreting it as the quick punch often results in a hit. Only real way to get used to the switch up is trial and error.
The third attack is his grab- mash buttons to break the grip, but remember-low Caution or any form of Danger makes it a guaranteed kill. Keep your health in the green to guarantee survival if possible.
Should you attempt to place too much distance expect a charge, however don't bother learning the timing when you could simply keep close.
 Waiting for him to fire and simply moving left or right can be a much safer way to avoid rockets, but should you have the space to use the dodge be prepared to stop firing when he aims. When your already holding R1 the X button will dodge, should you press it too soon after firing, however, it will not count as a dodge.

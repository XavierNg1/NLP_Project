 The first thing to do when you are adjusting crutches is to measure where the handgrip is in relation to your height. Stand up straight, relax your shoulders, and let your arms hang down loosely at your sides. Ask someone to help you balance if necessary, and place one crutch at your side. Check to see where the handgrip is in relation to your arm. It should be level with your wrist.


Make sure you keep your arm hanging down at your side, fully extended.If the handgrip is not level with the crease of your wrist you will need to adjust it.;
, If, after checking the height, you discover that you need to adjust the height of the handgrip, you will need to locate the spring buttons on the leg extensions of your crutches. There will be a small button or protruding metal knob along a series of small holes on the side of each crutch.


To adjust the height you simply have to push in this button and shorten or lengthen the leg extension by pushing it up or pulling it down.If it doesn't move, the spring button is probably not completely pushed in.
 Once you think you have the crutches at the right height you can do a quick test to check. Stand normally and take hold of the handgrips as you would if you were using the crutches. Now look at the angle of your elbow. Your elbow should be bent somewhere between 15 and 30 degrees.You can look in a mirror or ask someone to judge the angle for you if you can't see it.
Be sure you check that both crutches are the same height., Once you have successfully adjusted the height of the crutches you need to fix them in place so they don't shift around. The first thing to do is ensure that the spring button is securely in place in the hole you have moved it to. It should be firm and you should not be able to move the leg extension up or down.


After checking this, tighten the ring you can find below all the adjustment holes.
This ring is called the collar, and you can tighten it like you would a screw or a jar lid.

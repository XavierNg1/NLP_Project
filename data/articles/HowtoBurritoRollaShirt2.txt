 Lay it on a bed, table, or couch. Make sure the front of the shirt is facing the ceiling and it is smooth and flat., Do this to both sleeves. Make sure just the sleeves are folded inwards and not the sides of the shirt., Fold the bottom half of your shirt up, but behind the shirt. In other words, the folded bottom half should be underneath the shirt, not on top., First fold the right or left side inwards toward the middle of the shirt. Then fold the other side on top of the first side. The second side should overlap the first side so that everything lines up.At this point, your shirt should look like a vertical rectangle.
 Starting at the top, roll the shirt downward toward the bottom. Make sure to roll it tightly so it is nice and compact., Once your shirt is rolled up, there should be two flaps on top of the roll. These flaps were formed when you folded the bottom half of the shirt up and behind in step three. Take the top flap and fold it back and over half of your shirt to form the burrito.

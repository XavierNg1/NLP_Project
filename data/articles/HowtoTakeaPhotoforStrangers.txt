 You don't have long and you don't want to make it into an inquisition, so here is what to ask the camera's owner if he or she understands English:


Where do I click?






How do I zoom?






How do I focus? (This answer might not be needed and can be left till you think you need to know it.)





;
, Most people will have digital nowadays but if it is an older camera or one of the common disposables, you will need to know if they've remembered to wind it on. Just ask "Has the film been wound on?".
 If it has a strap, wind it around your wrist if you are standing precariously or on uneven land, so that you don't accidentally drop someone else's precious photo gear into a chasm or on hard rocks. It tends to happen when we're trying hard to get things right!

, If the light is very bright or very dull, or you are indoors, using the flash will often offset any light problems. Ask quickly if the flash goes off automatically or if you will need to adjust it.



Ask if there is anything special about the features behind or around the people being photographed that they want included. Try to oblige.






Rely on your own judgment as to whether a portrait view or a landscape view would look better; consider quickly how the scene and the people in the photo come together.






Use your fingers and voice to count down quickly from 3. This helps everyone get ready, even if the people being photographed do not speak English. It also makes it clear when they can stop posing.






Take two shots for good luck if it is digital camera as they can always wipe it. Be more careful with film cameras.
 If not, offer to take another one.
 If you would like them to take a photo of you and your fellow traveller(s), now is a perfect time to ask.

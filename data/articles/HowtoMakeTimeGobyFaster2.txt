 Spend a few hours talking, laughing, or doing whatever it is you do to kill the time with your friends. Boredom loves company, so the more people you hang out with, the merrier. However, if you can only find one person to hang out with, then this will be much more fun than spending the time alone.

If you don't have a free friend nearby, use this opportunity to catch up with an old friend who you've been meaning to call forever.
Even if you only have five minutes to chat with a friend or coworker, this can help to break up your day and pass the time., Whether you are at home, school, or work, music can help your day to go faster and feel more enjoyable. Try listening to music throughout the day to help pass the time, or listen to a new or favorite song between classes or between tasks.For example, if you are studying, then you could listen to some upbeat electronic music to help pass the time.
Or, if you are at work, then you could play a song as a little reward after you finish each item on your to-do list for the day.
 If you are at home and trying to pass the time, pick a show and binge watch a whole season! This will help to pass the time more quickly by keeping you entertained.Go on YouTube or Netflix and check out some of your childhood favorites: The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Kenan and Kel, Blossom, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Step by Step, Charles in Charge, Small Wonder, "Full House"-- see how the shows you used to love have stood the test of time.
Or, watch a new release that you missed in the theater, such as the latest Marvel comic superhero movie, or an award winning film that all your friends have been talking about.
 Most phones come with at least one free game like Tetris or Pac-Man that can keep you distracted for more time than youâ€™ll probably care to admit. However, this is not recommended when you're at school or work.

If you are at home and you have video game console or games on your PC, then this is another great way to pass the time.

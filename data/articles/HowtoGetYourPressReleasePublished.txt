 All major press release and news websites have editorial and submission guidelines. The press release must be submitted according to each site's guidelines.;
, Many news and press release websites do not allow hyperlinks. So remove hyperlinks in your content when submitting on those sites.
 A list of top free press release websites is given here: http://www.avangate.com/articles/press-release-distribution_69.htm.


Submitting a press release can be a time consuming task, as you have to sign-up on many sites before submission and every website has different layout and guide lines for submissions. You can use a commercial submission service to submit your press release on those top free sites, or you can submit it manually. You can also use an automation software such as: iMacros, uBot Studio, AutoIt to write scripts for automated submission, or use a commercial software which is specifically designed to submit press release on all sites without manual effort. Please see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoit and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMacros

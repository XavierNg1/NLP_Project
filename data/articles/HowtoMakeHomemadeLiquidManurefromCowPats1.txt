 Place gloves on whenever handling manure from any livestock. Always create a barrier between your skin and the manure, to prevent the transfer of human pathogens. If you have immunity problems, you're pregnant, or unwell, do not handle at all and if you are concerned about inhaling pathogens, wear a mask as well.
 The smell will be unpleasant to passers-by and it should be put away somewhere inoffensive such as a back shed or the back of the garden. Ensure that pets and children cannot get access to it. Tell other family members what you're doing and which container you're using so they don't gross out or make mistakes touching it, etc!

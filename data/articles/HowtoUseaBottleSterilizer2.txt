 Most microwave sterilizers have a removable rack. This rack makes it possible for steam to rise from the bottom, but it should be removed prior to filling the unit.
 The sterilizer may have a "fill line" that lets you know where to stop. If not, consult the manufacturer's instructions. Most sterilizers require about 7 oz. (200 ml) to work.
 Some racks snap in place, while others are simple held in place by pressure.
 Every unit will have slightly different positions for each piece, but every unit should have a designated place for each piece.

Place the bottle nipples in the appropriate cavities and the screw rings over the nipples.






Place the caps in the cap slots. Many units actually have a stem or prong with slots for the caps.






Place the bottles in upside down. In some machines, you will need to place the bottles over the bottle nipples and rings. In other units, the bottles will have their own separate prongs.
 Make sure that it is locked before starting the process of sterilization.
 Each sterilizer will vary. In general, however, you will microwave the unit for 8 minutes in an 800 watt microwave, 6 minutes for a microwave between 850 and 1000 watts, and 4 minutes for 1100 watts.
 The sterilizer will need to cool for at least three minutes before it will be safe to handle.

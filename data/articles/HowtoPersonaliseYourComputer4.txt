 This can be found in the Control Panel, under Appearances and Personalization. Click on the “Change desktop icons” link in the left frame. This will open Desktop Icons Settings.
 First, use the checkboxes to indicate which icons you want to appear on your desktop. Typically only the Recycle Bin is selected, so you can choose to add the Computer, Control Panel, and more.
 To change the icons for each of the items in the menu, select the item you want to change and click the Change Icon… button. Windows will open the icon folder, where you can browse through the pre-installed icons.


To change to a custom icon, first download a new icon. Icons use the .ico file format. Click Change Icon... and then click Browse… to find the icons that you have downloaded. Select the one that you want to use.
 To change any shortcut’s icon, right-click on it and select Properties. From the Properties window, select the Shortcut tab. Click the Change Icon… button to browse for a replacement icon.


You can only change icons for program shortcuts, which are found in the Start menu and on the desktop. Icons for the actual programs themselves (usually located in Program Files) cannot be changed.

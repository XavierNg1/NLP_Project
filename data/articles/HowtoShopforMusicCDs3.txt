 You'll be able to find recently released material as well as CD's that were released 20 or more years ago. These CD's will all most likely be in mint condition and the fact that you can actually browse the stock means that you'll be able to spot any faults before you make a purchase. It may not however be an easier way of purchasing rarities.
 If you can, call the store in advance and ask if they have the CD that you want in stock, they may surprise you by saying that it is in stock and they may even tell you how many copies they have in stock too. However, they may also disappoint you by saying that it isn't in stock. You can simply ask them if they know when it will be back in stock and hope to purchase it then or simply look in other branches.
 Because it is a large business, there CD's should be arranged in alphabetical order as well as music genre and remember that larger stores means larger stock, which means that you'll have a greater chance of finding your CD. Start looking in the appropriate places for your music CD. If you've found the CD that you're looking for, purchase it. If not, ask someone who works there if they have the CD in stock. Remember, that just because you can't see it on display it doesn't means that it's not in stock (this theory best applies to large music stores), they may surprise you and tell you that they do have it in stock.

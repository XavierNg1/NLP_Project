 Measure out 2 cups (358 g) of uncooked red rice and put it into a large saucepan. Add 4 cups (1 liter) of water and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to medium-low and put the lid on the pot. Let the rice simmer for 45 minutes. It should be completely soft and the water should be absorbed.You can also make the red rice in a rice cooker. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.
 Get out a 3.5 to 4-quart (or 3.5 to 4 liter) slow cooker and spray it with cooking spray. This will prevent the red rice pudding from sticking. Set the slow cooker aside. Measure out 1 cup (160 g) of dried fruit and roughly chop or snip them with cooking shears to make small pieces. Set the fruit aside while you make the pudding. You can use dried:Apricots
Apples
Cranberries
Cherries
Raisins
Currants

, Place 4 cups of the cooked red rice into a large mixing bowl and add 2 3/4 cups (650 ml) of vanilla-flavor unsweetened almond milk. Stir the milky rice with the prepared dried fruit and:1/3 cup (83 g) of turbinado (raw) sugar or packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons of butter, softened
1 tablespoon of chia seeds (optional)
1 teaspoon of apple pie spice or 3/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon plus 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon of finely shredded orange peel

, Scoop the red rice pudding into the greased slow cooker and put the lid on it. Turn the slow cooker on to LOW and let the pudding cook for 2 to 3 hours. Take the lid off and stir the pudding before you dish it up to serve it.Consider serving the red rice pudding with extra almond milk, especially if you'd like a thinner pudding.

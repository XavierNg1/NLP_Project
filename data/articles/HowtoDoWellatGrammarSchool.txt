 Buy an expanding folder and label the compartments with the subjects you will be taking then put all work your teachers give you in there and any homework sheets. Alternatively you could always buy two folders and have one for homework and the other for sheets from teachers.;
, You will be getting more homework this year than you did in primary school as you are now getting closer to your GCSEs. You need to make sure you do all your smaller pieces of work as soon as you get home. For bigger pieces, like an essay, start planning it the first night then write the essay in small chunks, leaving a few days to proofread and then print. Whatever you do, don't ever do your homework in front of the TV, it will distract you. Do it at your desk which should be kept neat with equipment and books.
 You need to have a tidy desk. I suggest keeping all your books at home because it means you always have anything you need for homework. When you get home put your bag by your desk and your books away, any equipment or books you will need should be laid out on your desk ready for you so you don't have to search for anything and waste time.
 Don't muck around with your mates because you'll just end up getting in trouble and you won't have learnt anything.
 Make sure you start revising the unit at least a week before your assessment. Revise from your textbook, notes in your exercise book and if you have extra time, extra work from reliable internet sources or a revision guide.
 It is important to have good friendships to help you through hardships and to be there to have fun, don't spend your whole life hanging out with your friends but do try to find time for them.
 If there is a particular sport you enjoy or drama, maybe dance. Sign up and give it a try, you will make friends and it will be fun, not to mention schools love students who get involved.

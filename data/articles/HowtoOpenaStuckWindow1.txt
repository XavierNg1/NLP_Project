 Look at both sides of the window, interior and exterior.


Make sure it is a window that is meant to be opened. Some new office and home windows are not meant to be opened. If there are no hinges or the window is a single pane with nowhere to slide, it likely does not open.
Make sure that the window is not nailed or screwed shut for security or energy conservation reasons.
Make sure any locks are disengaged.
Look to see if the window frame has been recently painted.
Decide which direction the window is supposed to open: up, outward or sideways.;
, Removing dried paint that collected between the window and frame will free the window and allow it to be opened.Use a razor knife to cut along the edge of the window and the frame. Cut across all four sides of the window. You may need to check the exterior of the window in addition to the inside to make sure that it isnâ€™t painted shut on both sides.
 Wriggle the knife back and forth to loosen any dried paint between the window and the frame. Go around the entire edge of the window to loosen all sides., Use a wood block to cushion the blows from the hammer and prevent making dents in the wood of the window. Be careful to hit gently so as not to break the window. Hammer the wood portion of the window and not the glass.
 Try to loosen the window one side at a time.


Push each corner to see if there is any movement.
Press on the window gently to open it a little at a time.
 Place a small block of wood on the window frame to give your pry bar more leverage. Gently force the window up with the pry bar.


Reposition the pry bar along the bottom edge of the window to lift both sides of the window.
Using a pry bar may damage the wood of the window or window frame, use this method very carefully as a last resort.

 It needs to be during daytime so you can see, so you don't want to wear something too suspicious, and you don't want to be very invasive into the target area. A hat is good to cover your appearance, and sunglasses are even better. The advantage to sunglasses is that nobody will be able to tell what you're looking at. There are several things you need to find out about your target zone.;
, If you will need to get past a fence, you'll need to check for weak areas of the fence that you can climb over. You need a way to climb in, and a way to climb out.
,,, If it is a person's house, if there is a car missing at night that was there during the day, it means the people are probably out partying for the night and can come home at any time.
 You'll need to check for temporary hiding spots inside your target area in case someone comes outside while you're performing your mission, and check for better and more long-term hiding spots outside the target area.
 If it is too close to the target zone and the cops are called on you, you'll have cops swarming around your transportation and it will be pretty hard to get to it.

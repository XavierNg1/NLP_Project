 Most lyricists work with a composer and increasingly collaborate with additional lyricists. (The B52's hit, "Love Shack" was co-written by 4 people, for example.) Co-writers each bring their own strengths to a project; some may excel in vocabulary, while others have an ear for the rhythm of words. Collaborators can be found at songwriting workshops or by asking around at music clubs or the music department of a local college.


Usually, when a lyricist works with a composer, the composer creates the melody for the lyricist. Some composers prefer to write the melody first, others will compose a melody for lyrics you've already written. When looking for a composer make sure you can agree how you will work together. Find someone with the same goals as you. Make sure you are looking to create songs for the same genre. e.g. Pop, Heavy Metal, Hip Hop.
 Show your lyrics to other songwriters for their opinions. Also, get feedback from prospective listeners and music industry professionals.
 While songwriting software makes the composing of the music easier, it can also benefit lyricists by providing ready-made melodies and beats to write lyrics to.
 Getting your work out there is important in getting it published, recorded and performed. Modern technology makes a number of options available now that weren't available before.


The Internet makes it possible for you to post your lyrics on your own Web site or share them with other lyricists on a message board.
Computers and the Internet have also opened many more opportunities for performing artists, thus allowing a larger market to sell your songs to. There is also a larger number of non-traditional opportunities, such as providing background music for electronic slideshows.
 It will take some time to sell your first song, and once you do, you'll want to sell more, and others will look for more from you. It helps to see each step you master along the way as a personal success worth celebrating.

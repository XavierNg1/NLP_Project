 The symptoms that owners typically report in German shorthaired pointers with aortic stenosis include a variety of signs of fatigue. This is because the heart cannot pump blood well enough to supply the oxygen needed for normal or excessive exertion.Your dog may have a new intolerance for exercise. It may refuse to do activities that it once enjoyed.
Your dog may appear to be weak and lethargic. It may have trouble getting up and down or climbing inclines.
 Your dog may faint because of a serious case of aortic stenosis. This is more likely to happen when your dog is doing some sort of exercise that requires a lot of oxygen in its system. The fainting is due to a lack of oxygen circulating in its body.


If your dog faints you should have it seen by a veterinarian. Call your vet's office, explain the situation, and follow their advice of whether or not to bring the dog in immediately or not.
 It's important to pay attention to your dog's breathing, especially while it is exercising. Signs your dog is having difficulty breathing can include coughing, difficulty catching its breath, or heavy panting.If your German shorthaired pointer is having a hard time breathing from a very light amount of exercise, it could be caused by aortic stenosis.
 This is not a disease that only affects old dogs. Aortic stenosis can be found early in the life of a German shorthaired pointer, or it may develop around 1-2 years of life.One sign of this disease in puppies is that they have a failure to grow as rapidly as a puppy should.
However, the younger the dog is when the signs first appear, the more likely the condition is to be serious.
 In some cases, there are not warning signs that can be observed by a dog's owner. It will just suddenly die due to the aortic stenosis.If this happens to your dog, it is not due to you missing some warning signs you should have seen. It is just, unfortunately, how this disease functions in some cases.

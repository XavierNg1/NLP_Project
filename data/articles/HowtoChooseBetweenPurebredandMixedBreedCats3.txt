 If you want to help out a homeless animal, consider adopting a mixed-breed cat. Mixed-breed cats are readily available in rescue shelters. After filling out the adoption papers and passing a screening process, you wonâ€™t have to wait long before you can take your new companion home.Pet stores and rescue groups are also good sources for finding mixed-breed cats.
Make sure to buy from pet stores that have good reputations. Some pet stores work with local rescue groups, for instance.
 If possible, spend some time with the cat you are considering. You may visit shelters, adoption fairs, and the homes of people advertising litters of "free kittens." Pick a cat that seems friendly and healthy.Be aware that "free kittens" will come without shots or having been spayed, and you will have to take on this expense.
 Kittens are cute, but there's no way of knowing what kind of personality they'll eventually show. If you buy a mixed-breed cat, you can't predict traits such as whether or not it will be good with kids, playful, easygoing, social or solitary. Adopting older cat means you will be able to learn about the personality and habits of your cat before bringing it home.


Shelters provide notes summarizing the personalities of the animals they house.

 Liquids help flush out the substances that cause kidney stones to form. Water is your best choice. It helps prevent kidney stones by keeping the kidneys flushed out without adding any extra elements such as sugar, sodium or other ingredients found in other drinks. Drink at least ten 8 ounce glasses of water daily. Avoid caffeinated beverages, because they dry you out rather than hydrate you. You should aim to have two or more quarts of urine per day, and it should be a light, barely yellow color., One of the main causes of kidney stones is concentrated urine. Salt can dehydrate you, helping to create concentrated urine. If you do eat salt, you need to counteract its effects by drinking a big glass of water afterward., Animal proteins can cause concentrated urine, one of the risk factors for kidney stones. Waste from the proteins gets into the urine and can increase the possibility of forming kidney stones., Some research indicates that insoluble fiber combines with calcium in urine and is excreted in stools. This helps decrease the amount of calcium left in the urine. Good sources of fiber include:Whole grains like oatmeal, bran, or quinoa
Prunes and prune juice
Leafy greens like spinach, chard, or kale

, The best way to deal with your diet is to consume both calcium and oxalate at the same meal. This way the calcium and oxalate can bind together in your stomach, rather than waiting until your kidney begins to process it and possibly convert it into a kidney stone.Spinach, chocolate, beets, and rhubarb all are high in oxalate. Beans, green peppers, tea, and peanuts also contain oxalate.
Milk, cheese, calcium enriched orange juice, and yogurt are all good forms of calcium that you can combine with foods high in oxalate.

 It is possible to obtain a modified version that does sort of work on Windows XP. Here is how you can do it.
 Halo Custom Edition, or Halo CE, is a multiplayer-only version of Halo PC, with improved multiplayer and the ability to load custom-made maps. See the External Links for sites.
 You need a valid Halo PC CD key. Now you can play Halo Custom Edition online, but there are no Halo 2 maps.
 The default is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo Custom Edition\maps, so look there first.

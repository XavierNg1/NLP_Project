 Tubers are small pea-sized roots that look similar to a fingerling potato. Before you begin cooking the tubers, you should remove the tubers from the rest of the roots and rhizomes of the daylily plant. This can be done by clipping the tubers off of the root.Daylily tubers should be harvested between late fall and early spring.When you harvest daylily tubers, leave a few tubers attached to the roots. These can be replanted and will continue to grow., After you have removed the tubers from the root, wash and scrub them in warm water. This will clean off any soil and dirt that may remain on the tuber. You can also peel the tubers before cooking them, but this is not necessary., Place the tubers in a medium-sized pot over medium heat on the stove. Bring the water to a boil and cook the tubers for 15 minutes, or until they are tender.Once you have finished cooking them, toss the tubers with butter and add salt and pepper to taste.
 It is also possible to fry the tubers in butter. Cook them in a frying pan over medium heat on the stove top. They will likely take approximately 10-15 minutes to cook. You could also add some garlic and onion to give extra flavour to the dish.

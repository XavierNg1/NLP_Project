 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 1-quart baking dish with cooking spray or grease it with butter. This will keep the dip from sticking to the dish.Consider using a long shallow dish for the dip. This will give you a larger surface area for bubbly and cheesy dip.
 Pour 3/4 cup (180 ml) of water into a small saucepan and turn the heat on to high. When the water begins to boil, add 3 cups (525 g) of chopped broccoli florets and cover the pan with a lid. Cook the broccoli until it's just tender, about 5 to 6 minutes. Drain the broccoli and run cold water over it for 1 minute.Blanching the broccoli will make it soft enough to blend. Running the cold water over it stops it from cooking further and helps the broccoli keep its bright green color.
 Place the blanched broccoli and the rest of the dip ingredients (except for the cheese topping) into a blender or food processor. Cover and blend the dip until it's completely smooth. You'll need to add these remaining ingredients:8 ounces (225 g) of cream cheese
1/4 cup (58 g) of mayonnaise
1/4 cup (60 ml) of milk
3 cups (300 g) of shredded cheese of your choice
2 garlic cloves
Salt and fresh ground pepper, to taste

, Scoop the vegetable dip into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Sprinkle the dip with the additional 1/2 cup (50 g) of shredded mild cheddar cheese. Bake the dip for 25 to 30 minutes or until it looks hot and bubbly.Be careful when you remove the hot dip from the oven. Remember to use oven mitts.
 Let the dip stand for a few minutes once you take it out of the oven. It will continue to bubble and sputter. Set the hot dip on a trivet or pot holder and surround it with prepared vegetables. Serve the dip with:Cherry tomatoes
Strips of bell peppers
Sliced jicama
Celery sticks

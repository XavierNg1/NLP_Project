 These treatments are most effective in late summer through early winter. Spring applications are usually ineffective, but summer applications may bring about moderate levels of removal.Note that the privet must still retain green leaves for foliar treatment to be truly effective. The air temperature should be about 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) or higher.
Avoid spraying foliar treatments on windy days or near water sources.
 Look for foliar herbicides with glyphosate as an active ingredient.


More precisely, you should use a concentrated type with 41 percent glyphosate, if not more. "Ready to Use" formulas generally aren't concentrated enough to work.
Formulas containing a surfactant may also prove more effective than those without one.
 Combine 4 to 6 fluid ounces (125 to 185 ml) of herbicide for every 1 gallon (4 L) of water.


Follow the label instructions for more precise measurements.
If the product must be mixed with an additional surfactant, add 0.6 fluid ounces (18 ml) per 1 gallon (4 L) of water.
 Use a sprayer to apply the diluted herbicide directly over the privet patch, covering as much as possible.


Single nozzle backpack sprayers are recommended, but you can also use a hose or handgun style sprayer. High-volume handgun sprayers might be most effective when treating high-density patches.
Spray until the entire crown foliage is thoroughly wet, but stop before you create any product runoff.
Work carefully to avoid spraying other plants since the herbicide will kill non-selectively.
 For dense privet patches, you may need to repeat another application of herbicide one year after the first treatment.


If dense foliage grew back, you will need to apply more foliar herbicide.
If only one or two stems grow back, you can consider using an herbicide treatment that targets individual plants.

 This may seem obvious, but taking the time to talk with someone shows them you like them. The people we talk with most frequently are generally the people we consider ourselves to have the best relationships with.;
, According to Forbes Magazine, “being able to see a person’s body language, facial expressions, and gestures makes a world of difference in building a relationship.” This is because talking face-to-face communicates more information to us faster than words ever could.


By utilizing body language, tone-of-voice, and social context, the speaker’s true message can be sent more efficiently. In this way, communication is enhanced, misunderstandings are less frequent, and relationships become built on strong foundations.
 Some people consider it more important to be heard and contribute to a conversation. Others believe it is more important to listen than to speak. Simply put, they are both wrong.


Speaking and listening is equally important in any conversation. If you spend too much time talking, you won't ever hear what the other person in the relationship has to say. Similarly, by spending too much time listening, you won't have any of your opinions heard. Conversations are meant to be a two-sided discussion.

 The specific speakers/drivers you use will have their own requirements and recommended enclosure volumes. Determine the inside air volume necessary to produce an adequate amount of pressure.;
,


Sealed enclosures are best for tighter bass and driver response, but do not offer the same amount of bass resonance as other types.
Ported enclosures produce additional, deeper bass, but at the cost of of mid-range bass and tight responses.
Band-pass enclosures are a special design that provide exceptional response at a specific frequency range. They are not suitable for all drivers or all types of music.
 Use cardboard, tape, and glue to form the shape.
, The fiberglass box is now larger than the pattern.
 Lap joints 3/4" (all equal).
, Two coats of resin and mat will be extremely strong. Use an automotive body filler, such as Bondo, to further strengthen and seal the box.
 Start with a 40 or 60-grit sandpaper to even out uneven or rough areas. Move up to a 200-grit or higher sandpaper to finalize the finish.
, Polyfill will dampen the pressure inside the enclosure to simulate a greater overall air volume.

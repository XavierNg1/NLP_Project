 Using the extract-o blade, slit and cut open the front face of the box. Cut open the top to fit the fan, it should be just a bit smaller than the fan itself. Then slit the sides and back. Finally, cut open the bottom of the box, making the cut bigger than the plastic container.
,, This should resemble a 'window', making it easy to see when the tornado starts.

Ensure the nearby slot is open so air can flow through it.
 This is optional but it makes it easier to see the demonstration and tornado.,, The breeze should be blowing up. ,,,, The fan air forces out of the chamber. The air from outside the box is forced in through the slits on the sides, which creates a vortex or spiral of air because the air is taken out of the box. Real tornadoes form in a similar way by using and creating updrafts and wind-shear, when wind is from different directions.

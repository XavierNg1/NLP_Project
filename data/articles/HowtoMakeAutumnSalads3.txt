 Fit your food processor with the grater or shredder blade, and shred 18 brussels sprouts. Next, run 2 large, peeled carrots through the processor to shred them as well. Place the shredded vegetables in a large bowl.If you don’t have a food processor, you can chop the brussel sprouts by hand and shred the carrot with a handheld grater.
 To the shredded brussel sprouts and carrots, add 1 diced apple, 1 diced celery stalk, ½ cup (70 g) of sunflower seeds, and 4 to 6 tablespoons (38 g to 56 g) of raisins. Use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients well so they’re fully combined.Add as many or as few raisins as you’d like. You can also substitute dried cranberries if you prefer.
 When all of the vegetables, sunflower seeds, and raisins are mixed, add 2 to 4 (30 to 60 ml) tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to taste, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of fine grain sea salt, and 1 teaspoon (1 g) of fresh thyme leaves to the bowl. Mix the salad well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can add as much or as little lemon juice to the salad as you’d like, depending on how tart you’d like it to be.
Adding the thyme leaves is optional.
 After you’ve mixed the lemon juice, salt, and thyme into the salad, drizzle some pure maple syrup over it to taste. The maple syrup is meant to balance the tartness of the lemon juice, so taste the salad to determine how much you want to add., Once you’ve added enough maple syrup to the salad, transfer it to individual salad bowls. Serve it immediately.You can sprinkle a little cinnamon over the salad before serving if you like.

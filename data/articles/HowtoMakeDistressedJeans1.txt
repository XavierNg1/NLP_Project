 You can distress any type of jeans. Choose a pair of jeans you do not mind ripping or fraying. If you've never distressed jeans before, you may want to opt for old jeans you do not mind damaging.;
, The easiest way to see where to distress your jeans is to try them on. Jeans fit everyone differently, so there is no precise rule of thumb regarding where, say, your knees will fall in the jeans. Try your jeans on and mark the areas where you want holes using a pen, marker, or piece of chalk.








Jeans are commonly distressed at the knees, back pockets, upper thighs, or at the sides. Mark which area you want to distress. For example, if you're distressing your upper thigh, think about where you would want the rips to show when wearing your jeans.If you've never distressed jeans before, it is not advised that you distress the sides. Side seams are necessary to hold the jeans together so these areas can rip easily. If you do distress along the sides, only make a few tears.
If you plan on distressing your back pocket, it is probably not necessary to try the jeans on first.
 You should have a flat work station with good lighting. For example, distress your jeans at the kitchen counter. You should also lay something down, like a tarp, to catch any fabric scraps while you're distressing your jeans.
 Sanding the jeans will make cutting and tweezing easier, so sand jeans if your jeans are very thick. Also, sanding can create a faded look. If you want faded colors on your jeans, use sandpaper to lightly sand the areas you're distressing beforehand. Only sand the areas a bit, until the color is just faded and the fabric is worn down slightly.
 Take a piece of cardboard and cut it until it fits into the pant legs of your jeans. Insert the cardboard into your jeans. This ensures you do not accidentally cut through to the backs of the jeans.








When distressing your back pocket, you can put a deck of cards or block of wood in the back pocket to protect your jeans.

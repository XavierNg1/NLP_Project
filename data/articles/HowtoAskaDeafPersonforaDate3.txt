 If your crush agrees to the date, you should make plans about what you want to do! A great way to start making plans is to ask your crush what they would like to do. This takes the pressure off of you and it also ensures that your crush will have fun on the date!

, If your crush doesn’t have ideas for what they want to do, try to stay away from activities that involve using your hands or where the two of you will be constantly moving. You will want to be directly next to or across from your crush to communicate with them, so stay away from physical activities like biking or swimming where your hands are occupied., No matter how you and your crush communicate, you will need to be able to see each other clearly. Don’t go to a dark bar if you want to talk with your crush. Instead, go to somewhere well lit where the two of you can sit across from each other. A good place for this would be somewhere like a coffee shop., This is important for any date activity, but it is especially important for a date with a deaf and a hearing person. Don’t go to a comedy show where they will not be able to understand the jokes, or a party where they don’t know anyone. Try to do something that you both can enjoy equally.Even just getting dinner or coffee can be a good date activity.
 Find a space that is specifically welcoming to the deaf community. For example, go to a movie theater that shows movies with subtitles. Few public spaces specifically accommodate deaf folks, and choosing to go to one can be a good experience for both of you.

 Make sure it is the JAVA version. The others don't work at all. The download link is here: https://minecraft.net/download

, If you are on Windows, put the JAVA (the one that ends with .jar) file into a separate folder and open the file.
 A bunch of stuff will pop up. Wait until it is done and then scroll to where it says Network server hosted on (or something like that) and type that address into your direct connect in your minecraft application. Presto! You should be connected!

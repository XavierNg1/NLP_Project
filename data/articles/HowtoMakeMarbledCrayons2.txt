 Ensure that the oven is preheated before you put the crayons in.
 Each hole must be fully covered, without any tears or holes in the foil.


For neater shapes, try using silicone cupcake cups. They won't wrinkle like tin foil.



You could make multicoloured marbled crayons, where you put one of each colour each in.
On the other hand, you could stick to the same colour but add different shades of that same colour. For example, you could do a pink crayon but use rose, orchid, fuchsia, baby pink, coral, hot pink, etc.

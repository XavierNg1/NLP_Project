 If you use foundation, apply one that will hydrate rather than dry out your small pores.There are a variety of foundations that are designed for drier skin. At the least expensive end of the spectrum are products like CoverGirl & Olay Tone Rehab Foundation and Revlon Colorstay Whipped Foundation. Mid-range products include NARS Tinted Moisturizers, Koh Gen Do Maifanshi Moisturizing Foundation, and La Mer The Treatment Foundation. If you’re ready to spend more than $100, you can get high-tech hydrating formulas like Cle de Peau Beauté Refining Fluid Foundation.You should also be able to use foundation that’s made to be waterproof (such as MAC Pro Longwear Nourishing Waterproof Foundation) or provide all-day protection (like Stila’s Stay All Day Foundation) since these are generally oil-based formulas.
 The tools you use to apply makeup will build up with oil, dust, and debris over time. Keep these from introducing harmful impurities to your face by washing them with a mild shampoo at least once a month., Don’t go bed with makeup on since it can clog and enlarge your small pores if you sleep with it on. To avoid irritations or infections, remove makeup by following the same routine as you use for washing your face.

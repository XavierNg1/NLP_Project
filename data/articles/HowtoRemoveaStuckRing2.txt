 Plenty of skin-safe household items can be used as lubricants to get the ring off in one piece and with minimal damage to skin. Ammonia-based cleaners such as Windex often work best. If the skin is broken or cut, choose your lubricant wisely. Otherwise, try any of these, using a generous amount at least as far as the knuckle.









Vaseline
Windex or other window cleaners
(professional jewelers often use this and make sure its safe on skin, read the bottle first)
Hand lotion (works particularly well)
Butter - if possible
Hair conditioner/shampoo
Petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment
(the best choice if the skin is broken)
Cooking spray, soft butter, or cooking oil
Shortening (lard)
Peanut butter -smooth, not chunky!! (may be a little sticky but works to get the ring off)
Soap and water
Baby Oil
Ring Release

, Turn the ring around the finger a time or two, and spray or rub more lubricant on as well. Gently pull the ring off the finger, working it back and forth and turning it as you go, as necessary.

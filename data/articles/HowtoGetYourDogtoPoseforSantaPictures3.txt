 Before you place your dog in Santa’s lap or ask it to sit by his side, walk up to Santa and introduce yourself. Use a friendly, upbeat voice to demonstrate to your dog that Santa is not a threat. Your dog will see that you and Santa get along, which will help put your dog at ease. Your dog will be happy knowing that its owner is safe.Approach Santa and introduce yourself and your dog. “Hi there, my name is Sarah and this is my dog, Molly. How are you today?” Engage in a quick, friendly conversation so that your dog will know that you are not in a dangerous or scary situation.
 Before the camera rolls, ask the photographer if you can lead your dog around Santa’s chair so that your dog can become acquainted with the area and with Santa. Ask Santa to let your dog sniff his hand or his boots. In a new situation, your dog may want to check out the area and learn about this new environment.This will help make your dog feel safe, which is particularly important if your dog will be posing in Santa’s lap.


Talk to the photographer and let them know that you want your dog to feel comfortable. “Molly likes to be familiar with her surroundings. Do you mind if I walk her around so she can sniff and explore the set for a few moments?” The photographer will be happy that you are doing all that you can to create an easygoing, successful photo shoot.
 You’ll want your dog to look toward you and the photographer to get a perfect shot. Avoid calling your dog’s name; it may think you are asking it to come toward you.Ask the photographer if you can stand next to them, and get your dog to look in your direction by making noise. Imitate a dog bark or make a chirping sound to pique your dog’s interest.Hold up your dog’s favorite toy or a treat to make him look toward you and the photographer.

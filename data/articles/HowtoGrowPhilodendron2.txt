 Philodendrons are native to rainforests and grow wild under towering treetops, so you’ll want to choose a place in your home that provides shade and indirect sun (8-10 hours per day) to mimic these conditions.


If your plant is in a room without sun, you can create artificial light with a mixture of fluorescent and incandescent lighting.
 A light-weight, nutritious soil provides the best growing conditions for philodendrons. You can enrich cheap garden soil by adding compost, rotten leaves, coconut fibers, or flower soil., You want to keep the soil moist at all times, but never soaking wet. An ample water supply is key to growing large, uniform leaves.There is a common myth that philodendrons should be watered less in winter, but this is not true. Their native rainforests receive ample rainfall year around, so it’s important to mimic these conditions when you care for the plants., Philodendron roots will rot if they get too wet, so make sure that your soil doesn't get too compact and that your pots always contain drainage holes. To fix excessive compaction, gently knead and fluff the soil with your hands to add air and break up soil clumps., Philodendrons are native to temperate climates, which means they do best in warm, humid weather. The ideal temperature for a philodendron is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius) with 60% humidity.


The plants are adaptable to temperature fluctuation and can survive in temperatures as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius), but they cannot survive frost or freezes.You can buy temperature and humidity monitors at most garden centers.
 A well-cared for philodendron can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) in height. In order to reach that height, many types of philodendrons need to climb and creep up something sturdy for support, so make sure you place the plant within touching distance of a beam or pole.


You can also place tree branches or moss sticks right in the pot to facilitate climbing.

 A cloche fits over seedlings or grown plants to keep them warm as they mature or during colder weather. Cut around the jug one inch (two centimeters) up from the bottom. Cut jagged edges all the way around the jug so you can anchor it into the soil when you place it over your plant.Keep the cap on during colder nights, take it off when it’s sunny to avoid overheating the plants.
Instead of throwing away the cut bottom, you can use as a base for potted plants.
 Cut around the jug about a third up from the bottom. Poke at least five drainage holes in the jug’s bottom. Fill it halfway with soil, plant your seeds, then cover it with another half inch (one centimeter) of soil (or however much your seed package suggests).You can leave the top of the jug connected to the bottom on one side to create a mini-greenhouse for your seedlings., Cut your jug in half, but leave a section opposite the handle two or three inches wide (five to seven centimeters) uncut. Cut vertically on either side of this section and at the top where the jug starts to curve and form the stem. This will create a labeling strip that extends up from the bottom of the container.Poke drainage holes in the bottom and plant your seeds or seedling. Use a marker to write on the vertical strip. You can label the plant’s species, the date you planted your seeds, or care information.
 Cut your jug in half, keeping the handle intact, and cut the stem (where the cap attaches) off of the top section. Hold the top section upside down, so the end where the cap used to be faces down, and line it with a coffee filter to hold soil. Fill it with soil and plant your seeds or seedling, then place it into the bottom section.Water your seeds or plant, and keep a half inch (one centimeter) of water in the bottom section at all times.
The self-watering planter is great for seedlings and for moisture-loving herbs like mint.

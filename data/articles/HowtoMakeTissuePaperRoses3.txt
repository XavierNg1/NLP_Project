 Be sure not to leave jagged ends where you cut. Sharps ends can both prick you and tear the paper rose. A shorter green pipe cleaner may be used instead of heavy wire.
 Twist the wires together for a neater look. If you have trouble doing this by hand, use a pair of pliers. Wrap green florist tape around the wire to cover it completely. If you're using pipe cleaner, skip this step.
 Use green tissue paper. Cut out four ovals per flower in the shape of a leaf. The leaves should be as long as either the diameter of the petals for the open flower or the height of the quartered tissue paper for the closed rose.
 Bunch the leaves over the bottom end of a pen as described in Step 3 of Method 1. Curling them slightly gives them a more realistic look. Focus the curve towards one end of the leaves to mimic the main vein of a real leaf.
 Coil it tightly to keep the tissue paper from peaking through. Once the bottom of the rose is covered, start to twist the stem loosely instead. Keep twisting until the stem is about three centimeters long.
 Pinch one end of a leaf and twist the stem around it. Give the stem another few twists, and then add a second leaf. Continue this pattern for the remaining leaves. After all leaves have been added, continue making loose twists with the wire or pipe cleaner until you reach its end.

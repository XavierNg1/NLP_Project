 If your main goal is to keep the cat out of the house, try making a part of your garden attractive to cats. For instance, you could plant catnip or cat mint, both plants that cats love. Pick a corner that's out of the way. Be aware, though, that this method could draw more strays to your yard.Honeysuckle is also a cat-friendly option., Cats also like sleeping on sand, so you could make a bed of sand near the catnip. Cats will be drawn over to take a nap.Some cats may see this area as an opportunity to use the bathroom, so you may find yourself cleaning up after them.
 It's no secret that cats like to watch birds. Therefore, if you have your bird feeder up near the house, you're likely to have cats around. By moving the feeders out into the yard, you at least move them away from your door.

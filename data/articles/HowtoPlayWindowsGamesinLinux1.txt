 Win4Lin is purchased software that allows you to install Windows 2000 or XP inside a Linux system. Essentially, it lets you run a virtual Windows machine inside a Linux machine. Although this product is meant primarily as a business tool, if you already have it, then you should try using it to run games. Because this is a commercial tool with plenty of documentation, we can leave the details of installation instructions and starting Win4Lin to the manuals. On older machines under 1.5 GHz and less than a 1G RAM, don't even bother. The virtual Windows runs at a snail's pace. Playing anything except untimed games is basically impossible due to performance lag, but you only get this slowdown inside the Win4Lin session. You will likely need to copy files from the CD-ROM to the hard drive for games.;
, It runs very similarly but way better than W4L, but the cost will keep most people away. The documentation is far better than W4L's and online support is acceptable. But consider a test drive before you sink this kind of money into your game addiction, since it may not work on your machine as well as it does elsewhere.
 WoW and several other newer games run on this service.

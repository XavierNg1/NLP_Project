, When you first start shopping for new things, try small upgrades of the things you normally feel most comfortable wearing. For example, if you favor hoodies, try cardigans instead. As time goes by, continue adding pieces to fit the impression you hope to make.
 Instead of shopping only at the mall, try local boutiques; consignment stores such as Plato's Closet; discount stores such as TJ Maxx and Marshall's; outlet malls; and online auctions like eBay.
 Swap clothes with a friend, use your older sibling's hand-me-downs, or ask your female relatives if they kept their high school clothes.
 If you can't make something work for you, either via tailoring or handy tricks, like Stretch New Shoes or Fix Painful Shoes.
 Try to keep an open mind when shopping, as you never know what you might find.

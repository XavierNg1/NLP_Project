 The more in-control your child is over her nighttime environment, the less likely it is she will be afraid of monsters. Recognize and reward your child when she faces her fears, like when you investigate the closet together. Try doing this together every night and, as she becomes less anxious, have her search the closet on her own, but while you are still in the room. Practice building bravery slowly and gradually.

When your child successfully faces her fears, praise and encourage her bravery. For instance, you could say something like: "Whoa! You are so brave! You checked that closet all by yourself; I bet you could handle any scary situation!" or "I'm proud of you for spending the whole night in your own room!"It may be helpful to come up with a plan for what to do if you aren't there, such as when your child wakes from a nightmare. This plan might include teaching your child calming techniques, such as breathing deeply (ask her to imagine filling her lungs like a balloon, then let the balloon deflate), or visualization (she can imagine she is somewhere else that is calming and soothing, such as floating on a cloud., Your child can use a stuffed animal as a tangible reminder that he is safe. Tell your child to squeeze or stroke the animal when he is scared and focus on how soft, warm, and safe the stuffed animal is. This helps teach your child to self-soothe.


Assign the animal a job: to remind your child that monsters aren't real. Tell your child that, whenever he is scared, he can touch the animal to remind her of what is real. He can say, "This stuffed animal is real. Monsters are not real."
It may also be helpful to use visualization again. Your child could imagine that mom, dad, or an older sibling is right there in the room with her.
 Instead of focusing on the monsters, focus instead on what will make the child feel safe. A night light? Leaving the door open? Brainstorm with your child to find a solution that will not encourage her fear.

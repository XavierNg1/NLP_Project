 Place three unfolded kitchen towels on the countertop. Put your mozzarella on top of the towels. Place an additional three kitchen towels on top of the cheese. Use gentle pressure to press the moisture out of the mozzarella. Repeat until you have removed the desired amount of moisture., If you decide to use fresh mozzarella, you can remove some of the moisture by straining it. Slice or tear the mozzarella into pieces. Put the pieces of mozzarella into a strainer or sieve. Place the strainer over a sink or bowl that can catch the moisture. Strain for at least 30 minutes.
 You can remove moisture from mozzarella by freezing it. If you are freezing fresh mozzarella that is packaged with liquid, remove the original packaging and wrap it in plastic. Freeze the cheese for 10 days, and then thaw in a strainer or on towels to absorb the moisture.

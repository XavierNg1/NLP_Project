 Place the paper pattern down on the material and either pin or tape into place.


For wood, use a jigsaw, bandsaw or other suitable cutting tool to cut the shape out. If you're not good at doing this, ask someone who is to do it for you––it won't take them long to do this simple shape.
For cardboard, use paper-suitable scissors and simply cut around the pattern piece.
 Cover the work surface, as glitter will go everywhere! The application of the glitter will depend on the type of glitter you're using and the surface you've used for the base.


It is recommended that you use large glitter, the glitter that looks more like confetti. The effect needs to be very obvious and bright.
For a wooden surface: Apply wood glue and shake the glitter over the top.
For a cardboard surface: Apply paper glue and shake the glitter over the top.
 Spray a sealant or protective glue over the entire finished arrow. This will help keep the arrow' glittery surface intact and will allow the glitter to cope with light rain or dew. Spray several layers of sealant, allowing to dry between each spray (and follow the manufacturer's instructions for spraying it).

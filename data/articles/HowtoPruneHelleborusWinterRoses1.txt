 Use hand pruners that are good and sharp. Bypass pruners with a scissor action are best. You should also consider wearing working gloves as Helleborus have thorns that can do some damage.;
, Wait until mid-winter to prune your plant (the new flower buds should just be forming at this time). Cut the old foliage that is growing around the outside of the plant all the way off at the base. These old leaves are usually unsightly and can harbor bacteria and fungal spores that can infect winter rose plants. The new leaves that grow up from the center will open and spread out as they grow.


Always remove the old leaves from the garden after pruning.
 As the season progresses, some of the new leaves may begin to look tattered. These damaged leaves can be pruned off at any time during the season to make the plant look more neat and tidy.


Helleborus is very forgiving, and will allow you to prune it year round without any adverse side-effects.
 If you notice that a section of your plant has become diseased, cut away that section of the rose to stop the spread of the disease. After you have removed the diseased growth, burn it or put it in bags in the trash. Do not put diseased foliage in the compost container, as ding this may still allow the disease to spread.


Once you have cut away all of the diseased parts of the plant, wash your pruning shears with hot water and soap. This will keep your pruners from spreading the disease to other plants the next time you use them.

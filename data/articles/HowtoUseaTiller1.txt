 Most backyard tillers are front-tine tillers, and the depth to which these till is controlled by how far you push the tines into the ground and how fast you move forward.To keep track of your depth, move the depth adjustor up or down.


For the first pass with the tiller, the depth adjustor should be all the way up, as you don’t want to go too deep on your first till.
If the depth adjustor is up all the way, you don’t have to tip the tines down as far to get the pin off the ground, meaning your pass will be shallow.;
, Always wear safety glasses when tilling, as rocks, dirt, and debris can be thrown around by the tines. It’s also a good idea to wear long sleeves and pants to protect your arms and legs from projectiles. Heavy or steel toe boots are also recommended to protect your toes from the tines.


Never wear sandals or open-toed shoes when operating a tiller, lawn mower, or other machine with blades.
 Motorized tillers have an On and Off switch located on the engine. While you can't flip the switch and turn the tiller on, the machine does have to be on before you can start the motor.
 Tillers are motor-powered machines, and before you can start the engine, you have to open the throttle. This will allow fuel into the engine.


Many tillers will have a rabbit and turtle on the throttle to indicate the position. When you're starting your tiller, push the lever to the rabbit to open the throttle., The choke is a valve that controls air intake in the engine. In order to start your engine, you want to engage the choke and close the valve, as this will provide a richer fuel supply to the engine, making it easier to start.If the engine gets too much air when it’s trying to start up, it won’t have enough fuel to get going.
 Locate the recoil start on the engine. Grab the handle and pull back in one motion to start the engine. If it doesn’t work on the first try, let the cord pull back and try again.


As soon as the engine has started up, disengage the choke.

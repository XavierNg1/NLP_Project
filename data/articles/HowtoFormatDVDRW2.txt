 The majority of Mac computer disc drives have the ability to burn DVDs. If you have a Mac without a disc drive, you will instead have to connect an external optical drive.
 You can find this in "Utilities" under the Applications folder., Select your DVD-RW disc in Disk Utility. You can find it in the list on the left side of the window.
 You'll be asked to select either "Quickly" or "Completely" for the erasing process. Most of the time the "Quickly" option will be fine, but if you've been having problems with the disc select "Completely".


The "Completely" option takes, at least, several minutes, significantly longer than the "Quickly" option

, Once this process finalizes you will have a clean DVD-RW ready to write on.
 Double-click the disc on your desktop and drag files into the Finder window that opens. Once you're finished adding files, click the "Burn" button to burn them to the disc. This disc will be compatible with other operating systems.

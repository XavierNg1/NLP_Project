 Facebook has developed 1 of the most user-friendly ways to target your advertising. Purchasing a targeted ad on Facebook will help you get to know the capabilities of targeted advertising.


Click on the ads and pages application. This will give you the option to start a fan page for your business or to create pay-per-click/pay-per-view ads. Click on the pay-per-click ads tab.
Connect your ad to a website. This will be your hyperlink to drive traffic to your page and calculate the cost of the ad based on how many times people click. Create your ad by using keywords in a catchy headline. Upload a photograph and write a small paragraph of text.
Choose your categories according to people's profile preferences. Choose the region, state or city where you want the ad to be targeted. Then, choose relationship status, gender, age ranges and any other demographic options that characterize your ideal customers.
Type in 3 to 5 keywords that will make your ad appear on a profile page. When these words or word combinations arise on their profile, information or wall, your ad will be triggered.
 Monitor these ads weekly to determine if they are providing increased traffic. Gather information on how many people are purchasing your product to determine the ad's overall value.


Make sure to develop a baseline of website traffic and sales before starting an advertising campaign. Set up a tracking system to judge the usefulness of each targeted advertising campaign individually.

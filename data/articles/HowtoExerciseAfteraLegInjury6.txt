 Whatever type of exercise you choose, it is important to start off slowly and gradually work back up to your pre-injury activity level.


Choose walking an effective low-impact exercise. Because walking does not put pressure on your legs like jogging or other aerobic exercises, it often is recommended as a low impact exercise alternative after a leg injury. Begin walking slowly and gently, and gradually pick up the walking pace. Add distance to your walking exercise as your healing permits.
Select swimming as a low-impact exercise following a leg injury. Swimming and water aerobics are gentle exercises that strengthen the entire body.
Opt for stationary biking, often called exercycling. Biking helps strengthen muscles and improve hip mobility. As you become stronger and can pedal for at least 15 minutes, gradually increase the tension on the stationary bike.
Resume jogging only if you can walk 2 miles (3.2Â km) without pain. Rather than jogging long stretches, try incremental walking and jogging. Using an incremental walking and jogging technique, you walk briskly for several minutes, jog slowly for several minutes and then go back to walking. Continue the incremental walking and jogging to slowly build your strength, endurance and fitness level after a leg injury.

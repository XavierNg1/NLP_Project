 A good way to build a bond with an aloof dog is to play with them. Dogs love to run, chase, and chew. Incorporate these things into your interactions with your dog. You may have to coax them into playing because they’re aloof, but keep working at it until the dog comes around.Try going out into the backyard and running around with your dog. You can try playing fetch with them by throwing toys they enjoy.
Take a toy the dog enjoys and try to engage them in a game of tug-of-war.
Get Kong toys and hide cheese or treats inside them so they can work to get them out.;
, You can bond with your dog by taking them for walks every day. Keep the leash loose so they can explore while they are with you. This will stimulate them and provide them with entertainment, and they will connect this positive experience with you. By controlling the leash and leading the dog, you are helping show the dog you protect and care for them.Talk to your dog while you walk them. Pet them occasionally and interact on the walk.
Let your dog explore instead of forcing them to do what you want to do the entire time. If they want to stop and sniff something, let them. However, remember you are the leader and are protecting them. Make sure they don’t end up in something dangerous.
 You are not going to bond with your dog if you don’t spend time with them. You can do this by playing and exercising with your dog, taking them to obedience classes, training them, and being in the same room with them.Encourage your dog to lay or sleep in the room you are in. When you are in the living room, fix up a bed for them to lay on or place blankets near the couch or chair. Fix them a bed in the bedroom so they can sleep near you.
 Touching your dog can help you build a bond. Touch involves many different things. You can pet your dog, paying attention to places they like to be petted and places they don’t.Try grooming your dog. This touch can make your dog feel safe and start to build a bond between you.

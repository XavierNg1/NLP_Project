 The expected value of a lottery ticket represents the theoretical return from purchasing one lottery ticket. In other words, it is what you can theoretically expect to get back from buying one ticket. It can be calculated by multiplying the odds of a certain payout (jackpot, 4 numbers correct, 3 numbers correct, etc.) by the value of the payout and then adding them up. This number is obviously skewed by the massive jackpot, however.

Most of the time, your payout will be much less than the expected value.

For the standard choose 5+1 of 69 and 26 Powerball, the expected value of a ticket is about $1.78., You can determine the expected benefit of playing the lottery by comparing the expected value of a ticket to the cost of a ticket. Most of the time, it will be much less. In addition, the actual return expected differs greatly from the expected value, despite the name. Most people will only get a fraction of the ideal expected value, if anything at all.

However, some lottery games have better payouts than others.

For example, at one time, the New York lottery's $1 Take Five ticket had an expected value equal to its cost. This meant that by playing this lottery, players could expect to break even., Playing the lottery multiple times can increase your overall odds of winning, however slightly. It's easier to envision this increase as a decrease in your chance of losing. For example, if your overall chances of winning are 1 in 250,000,000, your chances of losing on one play are 249,999,999รท250,000,000{\displaystyle 249,999,999\div 250,000,000}, which is equal to a number very close to 1 (0.99999...). If you play twice, that number is squared ((249,999,999รท250,000,000)2{\displaystyle (249,999,999\div 250,000,000)^{2}}), representing a movement slightly away from 1 (and a better chance of winning)., Most lottery players are convinced that if they play often enough, they will significantly increase their chances of winning. It is true that playing more increases your odds of winning. However, the increase is not significant for a long time. For example, using the odds above (1 in 250 million on one play), it would take roughly 180 million plays to reach 50-50 odds of winning.At this rate, if you bought ten tickets a day for 49,300 years, you would have a 50 percent chance of winning. 

This does not mean, however, that buying two tickets on that day would guarantee a win. Instead, your overall odds of winning would remain at roughly 50 percent.

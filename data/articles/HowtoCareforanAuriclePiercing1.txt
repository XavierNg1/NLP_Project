 Never touch your piercing with dirty hands. Wash your hands thoroughly in soap and water before you need to handle your piercing for cleaning.In general, even when your hands are clean, avoid touching your piercing unless it's necessary for cleaning.;
, You do not need anything other than soap and water to clean your piercing. Use an oil-based soap and warm water to gently swab the piercing with cotton balls. If your piercer recommended a special cleaner, use that.Do not use rubbing alcohol or alcohol-based cleaners. These can dry out the piercing.
 If your piercing is causing you pain, get a slightly warmed tea bag. You can press this on your piercing for short intervals. This should ease some of the pain caused by a new piercing.The type of tea you use does not matter.

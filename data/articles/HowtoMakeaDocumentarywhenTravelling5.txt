 This can be a real challenge when abroad.


Crew. Not only does having a few trustworthy people helping you on your project make it easier they can also keep an eye out for your equipment

, Keep your equipment in sight and in a bag.
 Storing your equipment safely can be a real challenge, especially if you want to leave it somewhere while you go travelling. Your best options are to leave it at the airport, this is probably the safest option but it is expensive several quid a day and usually limited to a month. Expensive hotels are another option. The best and cheapest option is if you know someone over there leave it at there house.
 make your expensive equipment less obvious such as using old and decrepit bags and covering it with a cheap local plastic bag.

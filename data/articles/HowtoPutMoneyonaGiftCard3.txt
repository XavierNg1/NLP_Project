 Some merchants will allow you periodically reload your card automatically. This can be a great way to make sure that your gift card maintains a balance so you can keep using it.

Even though the reloads are automatic, you won't want to overlook them. Make sure that you keep sufficient funds in the account that the automatic reloads will be drawn from.
 Visit the gift card issuer’s website, and search for “gift card” to locate the form for setting up an option like “automatic reload,” “auto reload” or “auto-load” for your gift card. Create an account using an email address or user name and password., You will need to have money transferred from one of your payment accounts (a checking account, credit card, etc.) onto the gift card at regular intervals. Enter the relevant information for this account when the set-up prompts you to.
 Depending on the card issuer, you may have options to have money transferred onto your gift card on a specific day or week of each month, or when the gift card balance drops below a certain amount, etc., You should be able to confirm whenever your gift card is reloaded. Many merchants will send an email, text message, or similar alert each time money is withdrawn to reload your card. Typically, you can also check the balance on your gift card to confirm that it was reloaded, by checking your online account or calling the customer service number listed on the card.

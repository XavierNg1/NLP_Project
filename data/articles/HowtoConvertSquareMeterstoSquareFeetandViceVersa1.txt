 One square meter (m2) is about equal to 10.76 square feet (ft2). To convert from m2 to ft2, multiply the number of square meters by 10.76. For example:


5 square meters
= 5 m2 x 10.76 ft2/m2
= 5 x 10.76 ft2
= 53.8 ft2

Notice that the m2 units on top and bottom cancel out, leaving only ft2 in the final answer: 5 m2 x 10.76 ft2/m2
;
, One square foot is roughly equal to 0.093 square meters. To convert square feet to square meters, just multiply by 0.093:


400 square feet
= 400 ft2 x 0.093 m2/ft2
= 37.2 square meters.
 Square meters and square feet are two ways to measure the same thing: area. If you cut out a square of paper one meter long and one meter wide, it has an area of one square meter. Similarly, a square of paper one foot long and one foot wide has an area of one square foot. The conversion "1 square meter = 10.76 square feet" means that 10.76 of your paper "square feet" would fit over one paper square meter.


If you have trouble visualizing the decimal, picture 10 square feet fitting over one square meter, with a little space left over. The extra space has an area of 0.76 square feet.
 It's easy to accidentally use the wrong formula, especially if you have a lot of conversions to do. After you find your answer, compare it to your original measurement to see if you made a mistake:If you converted from square feet to square meters, your answer should be smaller than the original amount.
If you converted from square meters to square feet, your answer should be larger than the original amount.
 These aren't the easiest numbers to memorize, but you can easily look them up online if you forget. It might even be enough to enter something like "convert 8 square meters to square feet" into a search engine directly to get the answer.


This is also more accurate than multiplying by hand, since it uses more precise values. (For instance, 1 square foot = 0.092903 square meters, or 1 square meter = 10.7639 square feet.) Most of the time, though, multiplying by hand will give you a "close enough" answer.

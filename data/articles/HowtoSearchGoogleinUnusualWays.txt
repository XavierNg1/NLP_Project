UPDATE - All but code search appear to have been shut down;
, Most of the following codes are time savers:

"key word phrase" - using the quotation marks makes google search for the exact phrase. Without the quotation marks, every single word is searched for independently: Every page containing only one of "key" or "word" or "phrase" would be listed, too.







keyword site:domain-name - search for a word on a certain domain. For example you can find every page in Wikipedia, that mentions WikiHow with wikihow site:wikipedia.org.







+key +word - search for pages containing "key" AND "word".







+key -word - search for pages containing "key" BUT NOT "word".







+key +(any|of|these) - search for pages containing "key" and one of "any", "of" or "these".







vicky.21 - the dot replaces special characters between two terms. Results for this example can be: "Vicky (21) ", "Vicky, 21" oder "Vicky :: 21".
 These additional functions are extremely powerful, if you use them in a smart way. This kind of commands is often referred to as "google hacks":



intitle:keyword - search the page titles. This doesn't sound too powerful, but it becomes, if you search for the right terms.

intitle:"index of" mp3 - The apache web server creates an index page, if a directory does not contain a file like index.html or similar. Some people have their mp3-collection in such a folder, which gets the title "Index of <directory name>". You can add the name of the particular music piece or the name of the group. The industry and spammers already know, that this trick is being used, so they started to create fake Index-Of pages, which don't contain links to the mp3 files, but links to registration pages. Do not register, give them your email address or pay them. Most often these fake index pages offer illegal services or are there to collect email addresses for spammers.

link:domain name - search for pages, that link a certain domain.

inurl:key word - search result depends on URL contents. Can be used to find pages generated by certain web applications, like

inurl:"ViewerFrame?Mode=refresh" for web cams.

inanchor:key word - look for texts, that are used in links.

filetype:type of file - search for certain type of files. torrent, iso, ...

 Check for signs of leaking decks and cabin tops, such as streaks, stains and mildew inside the cabin. Watch for gobs of sealant around the port lights (windows), which is a sign that somebody has been chasing down leaks.
 Many fiberglass boats have decks with plywood or balsa wood core material. If water has leaked in around improperly sealed deck fittings, the plywood or balsa wood core of the deck may have de-laminated and rotted. If you find spots or areas of the deck that are mushy in the least, run away. This is a huge pain to fix.
 In some boats, the chain plates (attachments for the rigging that holds up the mast) are attached to plywood bulkheads inside the cabin. In some boats, the interior woodwork holds up a deck-stepped mast. If such structural woodwork is water damaged, rotted, or otherwise unsound, be alarmed.

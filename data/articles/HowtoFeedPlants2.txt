 Cow manure has long been one of the most popular ways to fertilize plants. You can also buy boxes of bat guano, which contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, at many nursery and farm supply stores. Poultry waste is also a popular choice among farmers and gardeners. Sprinkle the substance around the roots of the plants you want to feed.
 These substances, made from the ground bones and blood of animals, contain high amounts of nutritious nitrogen and phosphorus. They are available from farm supply stores and nurseries in bags or boxes. Sprinkle meal around the roots of your plants.You can fertilize plants as you're planting them by sprinkling meal into the holes you dig during planting time.
Try mixing meal into your vegetable planting bed before planting seeds or seedlings, then adding more to the topsoil after everything is in the ground.
Most farmers and gardeners find that using an animal-based substance provides the best nutrition for plants, but if you're squeamish about using bone or blood meal, you could also try cottonseed meal.
 Working compost into your garden bed or potting soil goes a long way toward keeping the plants fed and healthy over time. It's still a good idea to fertilize them from time to time, but the nutrients contained in compost provide a good foundation for healthy plants.


You can make your own compost by collecting vegetable peelings and other food scraps in a compost bin.
Compost is also available for sale at nurseries.

 The pipe cleaners can be any color you want, but make sure that they are the same color.


If you'd like to make a daisy, use white pipe cleaners. If you'd like to make a sunflower, use yellow.
 This will make your skinny petals, just like in a daisy or sunflower. Keep the pipe cleaner folded shut, and not spread open like a V.
 Make sure that all of the folded ends are on the same side. The cut ends will make the top of the bundle. The folded ends will make the bottom of the bundle.
 The bottom of the bundle should be facing towards the bottom of the green pipe cleaner.


The green pipe cleaner will make the stem. To make a stronger stem, fold a whole green pipe cleaner in half, and twist it to make a thick, half-sized pipe cleaner.
 This will make the center of your flower. It will also hold it together. Hook the end of the yellow/brown pipe cleaner around the bundle, about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the top. Start wrapping the yellow/brown pipe cleaner around the bundle, moving upwards.


Use a yellow pipe cleaner for a daisy, and a brown pipe cleaner for a sunflower.
Wrap the yellow/brown pipe cleaner as tightly as you can, or it won't hold the flower together very well.
 When you reach the top of your bundle, you will probably still have some yellow or brown pipe cleaner leftover. Fold this leftover pipe cleaner over the top of your bundle to help hide the cut ends.
 By now, you should have something that looks like a closed umbrella. You will need to push the petals outward, like an open umbrella. Be gentle, so that you don't accidentally pull the petals off.


To make your flower more unique, curve the tips of the petals upward or downward.
 Give it to someone you care about, or put it into a pretty vase.

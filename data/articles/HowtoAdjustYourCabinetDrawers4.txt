 Fixing a glide wheel that lifts of the rail when the drawer is closed requires a different solution than fixing a wheel that “jumps” the track.


This scenario is when the wheel lifts straight up off the track surface at either the front or back of the drawer.
This, too, is an easy adjustment.
 If the wheel lifts off the track at the back of the drawer, simply loosen the mounting screw on the rail or the mounting bracket.


Then, slightly raise the rail until the wheel rides properly on the track.
Be sure not to raise it too much, or the opposite wheel will lift off its track.
 If the drawer glide lifts from the support wheel on the rail at the face frame, this will require a small adjustment.


However, the adjustment will be made at the rear end of the rail and not at the face frame.



Raising the cabinet glide at the opposite corner will lower the drawer glide back onto the support wheel at the face frame.
Here is the “formula” to keep in mind: Raising right rear lowers left front; raising left rear lowers right front! Think in opposites!
When using washers or any other material for spacers, either run the mounting screws through the spacers or have two equal-size spacers “straddle” the mounting screws to avoid distorting the shape of the glide rail.
Distortion and twisting can cause binding—and that’s what we’re trying to adjust!

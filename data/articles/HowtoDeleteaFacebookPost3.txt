If you instead wish to delete a comment you left on someone else's post, type that person's name into the search bar at the top of the screen and then tap their name.
 It should be at the top of the menu. Tapping it will take you to your profile page.


Skip this step if you're navigating to someone else's post.
 You may need to scroll down to do so.
 On posts where there is just one comment, you can do this by tapping the comment beneath the post; otherwise, you'll tap the comments link below the post and then tap the comment.


On Android, you'll tap and hold the comment you wish to delete.
 It's near the bottom of the screen.


You cannot delete other people's comments if they weren't made on your content, but you can tap Hide to prevent yourself from seeing them.
 Doing so will remove the comment in question from the post.

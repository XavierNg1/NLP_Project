 Always ensure that you are sitting correctly when rowing. Coordinate your rowing motion and maintain a good posture to avoid back injury. For instance, you should be sitting tall on your seat, with your head up and your eyes ahead. Make sure that your navel is pulled into your spine. If you have a rowing coach, ask about your technique and whether it needs improving.;
, If you already have injuries to your back, knees or wrists, then you need to accommodate for them. Contact your doctor or physical therapist to find out the best ways to protect these areas while still rowing.
 Avoid rowing pains by incorporating aerobic training to build flexibility, strength and endurance, in addition to a weight training session. Include a warm up period in your regimen that incorporates sustained stretches. Make sure you provide enough cool down time also, again adding stretches to your routine.
 Just make sure that you don't exert your body by practicing too much or pushing your body before it's prepared. Start off slowly and in short spurts so that your body becomes familiar with the rowing motion.
 Do this by incorporating exercises designed to strengthen your back. Additionally, if you strengthen your stomach muscles, they can take pressure off the back. Make a habit of caring for your back on a regular basis. Take care when lifting heavy objects, and recognize your personal limits when rowing.
 Opt to wear layers of light clothing that cover your body and protect your skin. You can remove layers as your body temperature increases. You should also wear sunglasses to protect your eyes and a hat.

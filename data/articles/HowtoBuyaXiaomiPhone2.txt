 In early 2016, Xiaomi released a statement saying they would soon be importing their phones to Western countries. You can contact your service provider to see if they intend on distributing Xiaomi in the near future.This is the safest way to purchase a phone because it will be made compatible with the provider selling the phone.Keep in mind, if you buy a Xiaomi phone designed for the China market it will not be optimal for the U.S. users. It will not be able to use high speed LTE networks not available to China. Also, it may have difficulty accessing apps that use sites not used or restricted in China.
Make sure that you are getting a China Telecom/Unicom handset. These will be compatible with international 3G standards. Check to see if your areaÂ has CDMA2000/UMTS(WCDMA) coverage.
 If you live outside of Asia, you cannot directly order any Xiaomi products from their website. However, there are retailers like Newegg and DHGate that specialize in allowing foreign goods to penetrate the U.S. market. You will have to pay a small shipping fee that usually ranges from $20-25 USD. , A good way to get a Xiaomi phone is through individual resales on auction sites. This can be risky and you should choose a reputable auction site like eBay that offers buyer protection.


Make sure the phone comes unlocked and is able to be used on a network outside China.

 Use the finest soft nozzle and avoid pulling against the fabric.


Or, try using a very soft brush to remove dirt, fluff, etc. The brush bristles must have plenty of give and be extremely soft.

, Gossamer is very fine and is not meant to be washed. Never machine wash an item made with gossamer; that will be the end of it. You might get away with a gentle spot clean using a damp cloth but do not rub or scrub and don't expect this to workâ€“-the gossamer may fall apart instantly where it gets damp.


If the item made from gossamer has sentimental value and is stained, take it to a professional fabric cleaner for advice.
 Drape over a supportive structure to air dry. This way, any wrinkles should fall out.
 If wrinkles are present on clean gossamer, hang the item and let the wrinkles drape out.

 Break 1 egg into each egg cup. Fill each cup with 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) of water. Fill any unused cups all the way with water.
 Microwave temperatures will explode the yolk if it's not pierced.
 Close the lid and microwave on high in 30-second intervals until the whites have cooked and the yolks are soft.

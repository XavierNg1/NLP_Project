 Whenever they insult you, just ignore them, don't even look at them when they insult you.;
, Doing this will make them do it even more and not feel sorry for you because they will think it annoys you and makes you mad, but not enough to make you dislike them and not/never talk to them anymore.
 If they are one of those cousins who you always talk to a lot, start making your conversations shorter and shorter each time you see them, and make sure people notice so when you don't talk at all, people won't notice or think anything of it and they won't know that you are trying to make this person guilty. Having people notice you talking to someone less and less is better than having them notice seeing you ignore your cousin, right?

, If they stare at you, do not take any notice of them. If they try talking to you, act like you didn't hear them, keep saying "What? What? What? What did you say"? each time they repeat what they say to you, or you can simply act as if you forgot about them,or you can act as if you don't even know who they are when they talk to you.
 Never talk to them, look at them, text and/or call them. If anyone takes notice of this just say you forgot about them, and if the person that noticed acts mad, just act like you don't care at all or you can act confused, or you can act both ways and they will probably simply get over it seeing you not caring and acting as if it's nothing and not a big deal at all.
 This will show them you are better off without them.

 Depending on the molecule, certain atoms or groups of atoms will be removed and substituted with something else. Most commonly, a hydrogen is replaced with deuterium. This allows researchers pinpoint the location of a particular part of the molecule that is of interest.


It is possible that different isotopes (such as deuterium for hydrogen) can change the rate of reaction., One way to tell how fast a reaction is going is to track the amount of reactants and products versus time. The faster the reactants are depleted (or products created), the faster the rate of reaction. The rate of a reaction determines how quickly the kinetic products are formed.These ratios are not necessarily linear. For example, doubling a substrate could cause the reaction to speed up four fold rather than just double.
 Enzymes are molecules that facilitate a reaction. Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of the reaction and allowing it to proceed at a faster rate. An enzyme will not increase the yield of the reaction, nor does the enzyme itself react in any way. Studying how a particular enzyme functions in a reaction can help you understand the mechanism of the reaction. Two common theories about enzyme function are:An enzyme is naturally the perfect shape for a substrate to bind to it.
Enzymes and substrates alter their shape to bind well.

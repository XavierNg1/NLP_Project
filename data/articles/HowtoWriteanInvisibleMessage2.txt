 Add one cup of sugar to one cup of hot water. This will allow the sugar to dissolve into the water. Let the mixture sit until it is cool enough not to burn the skin.
 Dip the cotton into the sugar water and use it to write the message. You may need to dip several times depending on the length of your message. Try to avoid dripping or lingering with the cotton swab on the paper for too long. This will cause the paper to absorb more sugar water in that area and result in a large “spot” on the paper when you show your message., You can do this well with a toaster. Turn the toaster on and hold the paper overtop of the toaster. As the paper gets hot, the sugar will begin to caramelize and form long chains of sugar molecules. These chains absorb light differently than the smaller sugar molecules, and will have brownish color. This browning of the sugar reveals the message you wrote.Do not put the paper in the toaster. It will start a fire.
Children should have adult supervision when using this method.

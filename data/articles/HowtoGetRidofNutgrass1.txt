 Nutgrass generally grows taller and looks lighter than the rest of your grass. Since it is similar to other grass varieties, small patches can be difficult to notice unless you are specifically looking for them.;
, Kneel on the ground and look at the shape and thickness of the grass blades growing in out of place patches. Nutgrass has thick, stiff blades that shoot up from stems in sets of three. Most normal varieties of grass have two blades that shoot up from a single stem.
 Break a stem of potential nutgrass off and look at the broken end. Nutgrass has a triangular stem with a solid center, while most normal grasses have rounded stems. Many normal grasses are also more hollow inside than they are solid.
 If you suspect that you have nutgrass based on the appearance of the upper half of the plant, you can either proceed to remove the grass immediately or you can dig down to the root to confirm your suspicions before taking further action. Use a garden trowel to cautiously dig beside the patch of grass and look for any nut-shaped nodules at the root. You may need to dig as deep as 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 centimeters).

 The perfect types of plants will not grow higher than 30 centimeter (11.8Â in) or that are happy to be kept clipped to that height. If you have taller roses (for example, standard roses), these will be able to tolerate slightly higher under-plants, while shrub type roses will be better off with only groundcover under-planting. Good choices include:

Trailing plants



 


Spreading plants







Aleananthera dentata, known as the deep ruby-leaved alternanthera






Marigolds







Juniperus horizontalis, known as blue rug juniper







Lobularia maritima, known as white alyssum






Annual flowers that are hardy (don't need too much watering)





;
, The last thing that you need are plants that will compete for root space with the roses.
 The leaves of the rose bushes will filter the light during summertime, so avoid plant species that require full sun in summer but can tolerate winter sun.

The insides of your wrists are a good spot for cologne.
Behind the ears is another spot that many men like to utilize.
 This is a great place to apply cologne, since it scents your shirt and provides a nice burst of scent to whomever you might end up hugging.
 If you're relatively sure your date's head may be close to your neck at some point during the evening, be sure to dab some cologne on your neck for good measure. Cologne applied here mixes with your natural scent, creating a unique smell that is truly you.
 If you tend to get body odor, don't use cologne as a way to mask it. Less appealing smells don't mix well with cologne, so it's best not to layer it on in the wrong areas.

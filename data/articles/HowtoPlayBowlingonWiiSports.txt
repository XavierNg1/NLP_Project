 There are three bowling training games and one official bowling game. Select the number of players and choose any Mii.;
, Wait until everything loads and you can start bowling.
 Grip the controller and stretch your dominating arm back. Hold down the "B" button and swing your arm forward. When you want the ball to be released, let go of the "B" button.
 When making the forward swinging motion, curve your wrist to create a spin effect after letting the ball go tilt the remote to move the ball while it is going down the lane., Given 5 chances per game, you must knock down all pins given in each lane in a single throw. Each lane gives random pin locations, which can be viewed in the top right hand corner. Your score for this training game will be determined how many successful lanes you have completed in the 5 chances.
 With 10 chances, you are given the chance to knock down as many pins as you can. The first lane consists of 10 pins and adds an additional row on each chance, resulting in 91 pins on the last lane. Your score is determined by how many total pins you knock down; strikes double the score. For example, if you get a strike on the first lane, your total is 20 (10 pins times 2).
 Like "Picking Up Spares", you are given 5 chances. It's the same concept, but you only have to knock down one pin in each lane with barriers between you and the pins. This training game allows you to practice spinning balls and maintaining speed.

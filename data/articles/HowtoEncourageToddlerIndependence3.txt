 Blocks are a great way to help foster your child’s independence in a way that other toys do not. Most toys can only be used or played with in a certain way but blocks allow for greater autonomy and creative control. Purchase a set for your child and see what they create., It is healthy and normal for you to play with your child, but allow them to play without you most of the time. You might unknowingly take over the play more than you realized, thereby limiting their independence.Allow them to play alone while you are cooking or cleaning or having some personal time.
Childproof your home so that you don’t have to worry about them injuring themselves while playing alone. Check in on them every few minutes to be sure they’re okay.
 Encourage your child to play hide and seek with their playmates or siblings, or even with you. Doing so helps them to become comfortable with the unknown and to also be able to make decisions, such as where to hide and where to seek, for themselves.

 Singers cannot hit as many notes, as quickly, as guitarists. They also must pause to breathe. This has lead vocalists to develop innovative, melodic ways to put space into their vocals. You can even think of a good public speaker -- notice how they don't just talk and talk and talk -- they leave space before big points (or notes, riffs, solos, etc.) so that the audience has time to get ready for the dazzling next section.;
, Many guitarists use a repeated set of notes, often similar to the melody of the singers, to give their solos a a backbone or common set of notes. But you don't want to play the theme too frequently. Try your 3-5 note riff once, give a half-measure of space, then play it again, slightly changing the the last few notes to throw the audience off guard or launch into a different set of notes.
 This is common in many blues solos, such as the work of B.B. King. The first few riffs are only 2-3 notes, then silence. Then 4-5 notes, followed by a shorter silence, until the silences get smaller and the notes get longer. By the end, you've risen the energy and mood into a screaming, killer solo with no silences.
 Great guitarists do not play over the rest of the instruments, blocking them out, but with them. Leave space for a big bass lick or not, to let a drum fill sound out without being muffled, or give the backup singers a chance to shine. Furthermore, opening up these spaces lets your play off the other instruments when they're done, making you look extra professional.
 Even high-energy action movies don't go full-speed the whole time. Giving a chance for silence makes the fast parts more meaningful and easier for the listener to understand. These silences make the more exciting sections of your solo pop more in a listeners ear, just like calm moments in an action movie proceed the biggest explosions and fights.

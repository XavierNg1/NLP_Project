 These tests may find the location of the nerve damage and its severity. Your doctor may also prescribe a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) test.


Some of these tests, like an EMG can be done at your general practitioners. However, more invasive tests like an MRI may be conducted at a specialist or a hospital.
 Nerve root blocks are usually done by a trained anesthesiologist in pain therapy. Steroids can help your body heal more quickly from nerve damage., Some types of nerve damage occur from compression or pinching. Minor outpatient surgeries are often sufficient to repair this damage. Criteria for surgery include symptoms of radiculopathy, evidence of nerve root compression on an MRI, persistent nerve pain last longer than six weeks, and progressive motor weakness.


Minor surgery can be an arthroscopic surgery to unblock the pinched nerve or sew the damaged ends of the nerves together.Another minor surgery is a nerve release, which can help to fix nerve compression seen in nerve damage like carpal tunnel syndrome.These may create more room for the nerve by dividing tissue, or by moving the nerve to a new location., The nerves may need to be re-trained with this special type of physical therapy. This re-education therapy is generally completed in two stages: “early” and “late.” It is the process of “tuning” your nerves into feeling sensations normally.


The early stage of this therapy is making sure your nerves can feel a wide scope of sensations, while the late stage is fine tuning the sensations to manageable sensations.This type of therapy is generally done in outpatient physical therapy. The length of the sessions depends on the severity of the injury. Generally, this procedure does take some time, as it is essentially “retraining” the body to return to a normal range of function.

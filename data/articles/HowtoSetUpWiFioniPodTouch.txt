 Tap on the "Settings" button. It is a gray, gear-like icon., Once you tap "Wi-Fi," a new menu opens. On this menu you can see a list of available WiFi networks and, at the very top, a line that reads "Wi-Fi" with a slider switch beside it. Sweep the switch to the right to turn on your WiFi.The switch turns green when WiFi is enabled.
 Below the WiFi switch is a list called "Choose A Network..." This list shows all the visible WiFi networks within range of your iPod Touch. Select the network you wish to join by tapping on its name.Secure networks that require a passcode appear with a padlock icon next to the icon showing the strength of the connection.
 If the network requires a password, a new window pops up. Type in the password and press "Join."


If tapping "Join" doesn't work, then your password is too short.If you don't know the password, you must find the network administrator (the person who set up the network) and ask them for the password.
 If you have successfully joined a network, it will appear beneath the WiFi on/off switch. Look for a blue check mark to the left of the network's name.


You will also see the "WiFi" symbol appear in the upper left corner of your screen (it looks like a radar symbol).

 You might have a recipe already that you really like, but can't use it because you either don't have the ingredients or you are allergic to them. Fortunately, there are a few ways you can tweak an existing recipe to work for you. This section will show you how to do that.


You can also create your own custom smoothie using this section.
 If you don't have milk at home, you can omit the ice and use yogurt instead. If the recipe calls for frozen fruit, use non-frozen fruit instead, or your smoothie will be too thick.
 There are all sorts of milk available that can work in a smoothie, including: almond, coconut, rice, and soy. Some stores even sell lactose-free cow's milk., Not all smoothies have to be creamy. If you don't like the flavor of almond or coconut milk, you can always use another type of liquid instead. Here are some options:Coconut water (great with tropical fruit)
Fruit juice (such as orange juice and apple juice)
Green tea
Water or carbonated water

, By using frozen fruit instead of ice, you are flavoring your smoothie and thickening it. You can freeze fruit yourself at home, or buy it frozen from the freezer section of a supermarket. Here are some types of frozen fruit you can use:Bananas
Berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries)
Oranges
Peaches
Pears
Tropical fruit, such as mango, papaya, and pineapples

, Ice is mainly used to thicken smoothies. If you don't have any ice at home, or even a way to freeze fruit, you can use all sorts of stuff to thicken it, including:Ground oatmeal
Nuts
Peanut butter
Soft tofu
Yogurt

 Gather enough tiny treats to fill up the 24 muffin cups. You could buy individually wrapped candies and distribute them into the cups. Look for candies wrapped in holiday colors like red, green, white and silver. You could also buy bulk candy and then make your own individually wrapped treats using cellophane or tiny plastic baggies., As an alternative to sweets, gather other types of tiny gifts for each muffin cup. Buy tiny ornaments that can be used to decorate a tabletop Christmas tree, so that each day your child can add a new decoration to it. If you want to do something more religiously themed, write bible verses on 24 small pieces of paper. Roll them up like tiny scrolls, tie them with red or green ribbon and place one in each cup.

You could also put small trinkets (like inspirational pictures and symbols) or tiny toys (like individual Legos) in the cups, as well.
 It is standard for most muffin tins to have two punches holes on one or both ends of the pan. If you want to hang your calendar on the wall, thread a holiday-colored ribbon through the holes on one end, then knot the ends together to create a “hook.” Hang the calendar from a nail on the wall.

To display it on a flat surface, situate the muffin tin on a simple picture frame stand.
You may want to “fill” the cups with treats after you decide where and how you are going to display the calendar.

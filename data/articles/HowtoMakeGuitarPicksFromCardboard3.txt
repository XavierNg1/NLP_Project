 You can add some flair to etch your personality onto the guitar pick. You can add stickers, glitter, draw on it with a marker, or even just mark your initials on the front. Just remember, the texture and quality will obviously be different based on what materials you apply to the pick. Don't overdo it or the design may trump the pick's practical uses.
 Everyone has their own brand loyalty for a specific guitar company, whether it's Dunlop, Gibson, or Fender. Look up the logo of your favorite brand and carefully duplicate it onto your homemade pick to showcase your style., For those who are especially inventive, try making a guitar brand all of your own. Test out different fonts and lettering to formulate a specific look. Don't be afraid to be unique, but remember not to draw too much and risk compromising the utility of your pick.

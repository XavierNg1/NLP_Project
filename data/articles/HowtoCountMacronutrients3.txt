 If you want to lose weight, you should be getting 10-30% of your macro totals from carbs, 40-50% of your macros from protein, and 30-40% of your macros from fat. For instance, over the course of a day, you might have consumed 35 grams of fat, 15 grams of carbs, and 50 grams of protein.Good foods to eat for weight loss while staying within your macro totals include bananas, apples, grapes, carrots, celery, nuts, groats, and avocados.
 A low-fat, high-carb macro regimen will enable you to build muscle and power through an intense workout. Macro regimens for bodybuilding typically aim for 15-25% fat, 25-35% protein, and 40-60% carbs.When following this division of macros, you might eat 50 grams of fat, 50 grams of protein, and 100 grams of carbs by the dayâ€™s end.
Good foods to eat for bodybuilding while staying within your macro totals include potatoes, grapes, apples, avocados, seeds, whole wheat pasta, and brown rice.
 Because of individual variation, there is not a clear way to calculate what the optimal macronutrient balance is for an individual. On average, though, you will be able to maintain your weight by eating the same amount of calories you expend each day and by keeping your macronutrient ratios at about 30-50% carbs, 25-35% protein, and 25-35% fat.Other common macro balances include 45-65% carbs, 10-35% percent protein, and 20-35% fat.Some people believe that consuming each macro in equal amounts is best (for instance, consuming 35 grams of fat, 35 grams of protein, and 35 grams of carbs over the course of a day).

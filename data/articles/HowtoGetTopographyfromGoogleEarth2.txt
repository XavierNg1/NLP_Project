 Look for the Google Earth app on your mobile device and tap on it. The app icon has a blue sphere with white lines on it.


Once launched, you will see a beautiful 3-D rendition of our world.
 Use the search field on the upper right corner and enter the location of the land or area you want to view. Tap the “Search” button on your keypad, and just like in Google Maps, Google Earth will bring you to the location you’ve entered.
 Focus on the area whose topography you want to see.


To move, use a finger and touch any point on the map, then drag it until you’ve reached the view that you want.
To rotate, use two fingers and touch two points on the map, then rotate your fingers until you’ve reached the perspective that you want.
To zoom, use two fingers and touch two points on the map. Move them away from each other to zoom out and move them away towards each other to zoom in.
 Wait a few moments for the rendering to be completed for the location. Once it’s done, you can see the different surface features of the area. If it has mountains, hills or creeks, you will see them.


The quality of the view will depend on the size and capacity of your mobile device.

 Garden tools are desirable objects and leaving them lying around can tempt fate. Always put them away after use and keep the area secure.;
, Tools subjected to dampness or rain over a period of time can rust and stiffen. The paintwork will also weaken when wet. Always wipe down tools that have become damp during use, and don't leave them to sit in the rain.
 This keeps them in great shape during the months that you are not gardening. Periodic wiping down when in regular use should be sufficient.
 This makes them easy to find if you drop them as you are working. It can be easy to forget a dropped tool at the end of the day and leave it languishing in the garden.
 Tools with screw and other joints should be kept well oiled on a regular basis to prevent seizing up and rusting.
 If you don't, they'll get avoided and will never get mended. Always check to see that mending is the cheaper option; occasionally a tool might be on sale for less than what it costs to mend the old one (recycle the broken one if you do this!). Uncurl kinks, unfold bends, stretch squashed pieces etc. Do this in a timely fashion so that the tool does not weaken. Equally, replace missing pieces, such as missing prongs in a rake etc.
 Label the storage place for tools so that you know where everything goes back. Use container baskets, hooks, shelves etc. for storage, as shown in the image.

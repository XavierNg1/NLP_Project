 Use a pastry brush or clean toothbrush to clean out the wires on the interior of your toaster. Use this to wipe away any crumbs stuck inside the wires. Flick away the crumbs in the same direction the wires run.








It's usually a good idea to turn your toaster upside down and shake it again after removing interior crumbs.
 Dampen your toothbrush slightly with vinegar. Place the toothbrush back into the toaster. Use it to rub down the wire bars to get them clean, removing any stuck on crumbs, dirt, and debris.








Only get your toothbrush damp with vinegar. A sopping wet toothbrush may cause puddles of messy water to form on the bottom of your toaster.
 Get a cloth damp with vinegar. Use this to wipe down the sides of the toaster.For really tough stuck-on stains, use a bit of bicarbonate of soda/baking soda to scrub off gently. Use a non-scratching sponge or wiping cloth on the toaster to prevent scratches.

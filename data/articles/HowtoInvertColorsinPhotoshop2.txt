 Inverting colors in Photoshop is as simple as the command Ctrl+I or Cmd+I, but there are a few things to check about your file and layers before you can get the color inversion exactly where you want it. To invert the entire image, simple open the image in Photoshop, and press Crtl+I or Cmd+I.
 If you want to invert colors in a specific layer in your Photoshop file: select that layer, and make sure it is rasterised. If not, right-click on the Layer label (under the Layers list) and select "Rasterise Layer". Once you ensure the layer is rasterised, you can press Ctrl+I to invert all visible colors in the layer.


You can only perform this on one layer at a time. It will not work if you have selected multiple layers.
You should perform this step after you re-size the layer or image to the size that you want. Enlarging an image after rasterising could lead to pixelation and a loss in resolution.
 If you want to invert specific parts of a layer, you can select the layer, and select the portion you want to invert using different selection tools available in Photoshop: try the Rectangle tool, Lasso tool, or Magic Wand. Add or subtract portions to your selection, as needed. When you are satisfied with the selection area you have created, press Ctrl+I to invert.


You can also select different portions one at a time and invert. However, if you select a previously inverted portion a second time by mistake, that set of pixels will be reverted to original color. Thus, it is better to invert for complete selection in one go.

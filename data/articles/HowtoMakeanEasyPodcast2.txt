 The Finder can be found in the far left side of your dock-the smiling blue and white square.
 Applications is located on the side of the finder window with an ‘A’ icon.
 This will be located in your applications window with a QuickTime Player Icon. Double click on the icon to open it.
 With QuickTime Player open, you can click on ‘File’ to reveal the ‘New Audio Recording’ option.
 This will be the red circle icon and will record sound from the default microphone source as soon as you click it.


Most computers have a built-in microphone; if not, make sure you have a microphone or other recording device plugged in and set as default.
 Once you are done recording, click the icon again to stop recording and then the audio file will be ready.
 On the top menu bar under 'File', you’ll see a 'Save As' option. Click there to bring up a new window and then name your file and choose a location.
 This completes your save and will store your file for later use.

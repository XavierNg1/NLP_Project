 Press near the stem tip; if the avocado gives slightly, it's ripe. Avocados are rich in vitamins A and E and monounsaturated fat, which will provide moisture and shine. The oils in avocado are very close to the natural oils in human skin and hair, which makes this mask ideal for dry or frizzy hair.Because of its very high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, avocado is particularly good for natural hair, which can require extra moisturizing. This mask is also great for very thick, coarse, or curly hair. However, it may be too bulky for people with very fine or thin hair.
 Using a fork, mash the avocado into a paste in a medium bowl. A jar will not work as well for this mask because you have to have room to fully mash the avocado.
 Mix until thoroughly combined. The color should turn a light green and the texture should be as smooth as possible.


You can get a more thoroughly emulsified mask if you have a food processor, blender, or hand-mixer. Whip until smooth and airy.
 Focus on the ends, where damage is usually greatest. If you have oily roots, avoid putting the mask on them. You can use your fingers or a basting/paint brush to spread the mask onto your hair.
 If you have long hair, put it into a ponytail or loose bun, or secure with a clip before wrapping. Wrap your hair with plastic wrap, a shower cap, or a grocery bag.
 This mask does best if heated, but you don't want the plastic to melt onto your hair! Use a hairdryer on its low setting for 15-20 minutes, or find a sunny, warm spot and sit out for 30-45 minutes.
 You may need to massage the water through your hair as you rinse, as this mask is very thick. Follow with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.

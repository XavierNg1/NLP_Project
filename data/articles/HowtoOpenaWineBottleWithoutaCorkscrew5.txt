 Get a cheap wire coat hanger and bend the hook part out straight.
 Use pliers to make a little hook by bending the last half inch (10 mm) back until it makes an angle of about 30 degrees (a bit like a fish hook).
 The wire should be straight against the edge of the bottle (the hook shouldn’t face in yet). Push the wire down beside the cork until the little hook is below the cork. You will need to push it down at least 2” to accomplish this.
 This will allow the hook to grab the bottom of the cork so that you can easily pull it out. Simply twist the hanger so that the little hook moves towards the center of the bottle., Pull on the hanger slowly, wobbling it back and forth a bit to ease out the cork. You might want to wear gloves, as the wire can hurt your fingers. The hook should enter into the cork while pulling up so that the cork moves with the hanger.
 An alternate method with a coat hanger is to use the hanger in place of a corkscrew. After straightening the hook, simply insert it into the center of the cork. Twist the hanger while pulling on it gently. This will gradually remove the cork.

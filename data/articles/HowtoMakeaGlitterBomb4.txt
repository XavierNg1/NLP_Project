 Sparkle balloons are great decorations for adult or children’s birthday parties. Once you are finished using them as decorations, you can pop them with a pin to release the glitter inside. You will need:Balloons (different colors)
Glitter (different colors)
A plastic funnel
Helium tank with helium (optional)

, Insert the long portion of the funnel through the neck of the balloon. Pour the desired amount of glitter through the funnel.


You can use this same technique to fill a balloon with paper confetti. Simply cut tissue paper into small circles. Grab a small handful of the tissue paper circles, fold them in half, and then fold them in half again. Use the bottom of the funnel to poke the ball of tissue paper into and through the neck of the balloon., You can either blow the balloon up with your mouth, or inflate it with helium if you want it to float. Tie off the neck of the balloon. You can also tie a string or ribbon the balloon for decoration.


Inflate balloons at least one hour before your party. This allow enough time for the static electricity inside the balloon to pull the confetti and/or glitter up and along the sides., Tap the side of the balloon with a pin or needle until it bursts. This will cause glitter to fly out in every direction.


Attach balloons inflated with air and not helium to a length of garland. Either tape the balloons directly to the garland or tie them on with string. String banners with glitter and/or garland filled balloons along the wall or ceiling. Give you guests pins and tell them to pop the balloons – coating everyone (and everything) in a sparkly layer of glitter.

 Possible themes include a tea party, craft night, picnic, wine and cheese tasting, bowling event, dance class, cooking or canning party, a hike, spa day, in-home yoga class or tiki party. You can also theme your party around the type of gift the bride needs to receive. For example a kitchen, bar or entertainment shower.
 For most weddings, the traditional home or hotel restaurant reception may not fit the bride's preferences. Fun locations include the park, the beach, the library, a backyard barbecue, a gallery, a garden, mini-golf course, pool, museum, boat or sporting activity.

 Transom-mounted trolling motors have 1 or 2 clamps built into the mounting bracket to hold the motor in place. Turning the clamps counterclockwise (to the left) will open them.;
, The trolling motor should be placed as close to the center of the stern as possible without interfering with the operation of the main motor, if there is one. The top of the mounting bracket should be flush with the top of the stern.
 Turn the clamps clockwise (to the right) as far as they will go, so that the motor won't vibrate loose while in operation.


Transom-mounted trolling motors should be positioned so that the center of the motor section is at least 9 inches (22.5 cm) under water while the motor is running to keep the propeller from breaking the water's surface. This produces noise that can spook fish.

 You want one that has a fairly high speed burst capability of at least 3.3. However, higher is better. This ability will probably not be present in lower end cameras. There are things that you may be able to do to increase its speed.They are:


Locking up your mirror






Eliminating any post processing that you might have set up, in camera





;
, This will allow you the flexibility of taking images fairly close up as well as at a distance.


Get as fast a lens as you can afford.
 You will want extra sturdy ones because you will be out in the field and faster so that it can potentially improve your frames per second.
 Ideally, having both the monopod and tripod, as well as handholding will work the best.
 As with the rest of photography, the 'golden hour' at the beginning and end of the day is the best time. Be ready to get up early and stay out late to get the best shots.
 Are you looking for some great falls or maybe you want to get some shots of surfers angling.Maybe you want to get a shot of someone riding in the big wave. Knowing this will get you more likely in the right place at the right time.
 Don't have all of your photos come from the same place. That can get really boring, really quickly.
 If the two clash, the time to know it is before you take the pictures. There are no 'mulligans' (second chances) in surfing. Maybe they want you to document the day as well as the surfing. Know ahead of time.
 If you need images fast, you can shoot both raw and JPEG, but being out on the water is going to pretty much insure you will get blowouts. If you are using raw images, you will be able to extract at least some of the detail out of that.
 See what others are doing and add to it. Put your own spin on things.
 As stated before, there are no mulligans. While you may want to get 'artsy', don't get carried away.
 If you don't love it, why do it!?

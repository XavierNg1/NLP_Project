 Frequent hiccup attacks may be a sign of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or acid reflux. This is a common condition in which babies painfully regurgitate the contents of their stomach into their esophagus.Look out for the following symptoms:


Colicky behavior (frequent, intense crying fits)
Stomach pain
Frequent, painful vomiting
Persistent coughing or wheezing
Hiccuping at night, unconnected to feeding

, Your baby may be experiencing chronic stomach pain if she cries often and inconsolably, long after she has been changed, fed, and cared for. She may begin to cry suddenly, for no apparent reason.
 If you suspect that your baby suffers from acid reflux, take her to see your family pediatrician. A licensed physician will be able to help you understand what's going on with your baby, and may be able to advise treatment.


In babies, GERD is usually caused by an immature digestive system.
Most babies grow out of GERD by their first birthday. Your doctor may advise you to wait it out. Be aware that older children may be at a greater risk for acid reflux if they experienced the disease as an infant.

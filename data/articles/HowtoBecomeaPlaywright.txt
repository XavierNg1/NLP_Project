 That is a good way to gain a plethora of knowledge about format and style. Once you have an idea of how to format it, you're ready to begin. A good place to start would be to write what you know. Take a story from your life, or someone you know. That will help you develop your characters more.;
, This will help to keep you on track. Remember that a typical play is right around 60 pages and mostly all dialogue. Don't concern yourself with thoughts too much, your entire story must be told through your characters' discussion.
 So, sit with family, friends or both and do a read through. You can gain valuable feedback on what is understood and what is missed. Take that feedback and use it.
 If you don't, think about attending a local open mic night. Take a scene or a good long monologue and perform it. Take business cards with you and hand them out. You can scope out local talent and get an idea of any people who would be good as certain characters. If you have a group of friends that can act, assemble a cast yourself and perform your play. There are usually exhibitions/contests where new artists and writers are featured.

 You could stroke your child’s hands with your own hand, or with an object you want them to become familiar with and grasp. For instance, if you want to encourage motor skills that could help your child grip a rattle, you might stroke the back of their hands gently with a rattle. When they open their fingers, place it in their palm.Your baby might be able to grasp the rattle already, but they probably won’t be able to hold it for long.;
, With your baby on their tummy, they will have to work their neck muscles more actively to look up and side-to-side.Other muscle groups that will be more active than they would be if your baby was simply placed on their back include the shoulders, arms, and hand muscles. Your baby will also be better prepared to start crawling.Always supervise your baby when they are on their tummy. Do not leave them for any reason. You should never put the baby on their tummy while they sleep, even for a nap.
 Young babies cannot move their limbs well, but you can help them stretch their arms. Lay the baby on their back. Gently grasp their hands, and stretch their arms above their head before bringing them back down. You can repeat this motion a few times.

Try singing or talking to your baby as you do this.
Be gentle. Do not pull on their arms or stretch them too quickly., A baby gym is a contraption with many baby-friendly shapes – animals, stars, and everyday objects – arranged in a low arc or set of interlocking arcs. Sliding the baby beneath this arc on their back lets them see and interact with a variety of objects. In this way, baby gyms can improve hand-eye coordination.

 Rabbits tend to sit on their hind legs with their nose and ears in the air when they are alert. Domesticated rabbits often assume this position when they are trying to get their owner’s attention and get fed., If your bunny shakes its ears and then starts scratching at them, it is trying to get something out of its ear. Often, this is just harmless hair. However, if your bunny has been doing it frequently, it might be because it has ear mites., If your rabbits’ ears are resting against its head, but they are not touching, this can be a sign that it is frightened, rather than resting. If your bunny is frightened, it is also likely to have bulging eyes and will bare its teeth. It will often thump its feet when it is frightened.

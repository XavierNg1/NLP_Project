 Use a half-gallon (2 L) mixing container and combine both of the liquid ingredients together. Stir vigorously, but don't create air bubbles.


If you need more glycerin solution, use a ratio of 1:2 glycerin to warm water and adjust the rest of the ingredients accordingly., These ingredients will make up your dye mixture and will be added to the glycerin and water mixture after. Pour 1/2 cup (4 oz.) of hot water, 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of floral dye, and 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of citric acid in a separate bowl. Stir continuously until the mixture is dissolved. Once you've mixed them together, combine them to your half-gallon (2 L) mixing container and continue to both liquid solutions together until they are well incorporated.The dye will help the plant to retain its natural color.
If you don't use dye your boxwood cuttings will turn a golden hue.
 You can pack as many boxwood cuttings into a single container that you want, as long as you have enough glycerin solution. For every ounce (28 g) of cuttings add 1 fluid ounce (0.125 cup) of glycerin solution in the container. Weigh your boxwood cuttings on a scale so that you know how much of the solution has to go into each container.


Using the correct amount of solution will ensure that the cuttings will be flexible and won't run out of solution to absorb.
 Get the container that you set aside previously for your boxwood cuttings and pour the glycerin solution into the container. Use a measuring cup to make sure that you're pouring the right amount of solution into the container.


For instance, if you had 10 ounces (280 g) of boxwood cuttings, you'd need 10 fluid ounces (1.25 cups) of the solution.

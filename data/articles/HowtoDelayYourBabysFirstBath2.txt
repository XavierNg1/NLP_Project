 The vernix caseosa can be massaged into the baby’s skin as a form of moisturizer. This substance is one of the best moisturizers for your baby’s skin and cannot be compared to any store-bought products. You can do this immediately following the delivery when the baby is placed on the mother’s chest for skin-to-skin bonding. Gently massage the baby in order to absorb the vernix caseosa.If you bathe your baby too soon following delivery, the baby will not receive the added benefits of the vernix caseosa and an artificial moisturizer will likely be applied to the baby’s skin following a bath., Following delivery, the baby can be gently wiped off using a soft and damp cloth. This will help to remove any blood, amniotic fluid, or vaginal secretions without removing the vernix caseosa. In order to wash off the vernix caseosa you need to scrub the skin and it does not come off easily in water. As a result, gently wiping the baby with a damp cloth will not remove the vernix caseosa and will allow you to clean off some of the other substances that can be found on the baby’s skin following delivery., Instead of giving your child a full bath with water and soap, you can help the baby regulate their temperature by washing the face, head, and hair with a damp cloth. This should be done while the infant is fully wrapped or swaddled in blankets in order to keep them warm.Do not use any soap, moisturizer, or other products on a newborn baby. Instead, gently wipe the face, head, and hair with a damp cloth.
 Taking a damp cloth, gently wipe the baby’s eyes from the inside corner to the outside corner. This will help to remove any sticky film that may develop around an infant’s eye.

 Before you disassemble your humidifier unit, make sure it’s turned off and disconnected from the wall outlet. You’re going to be handling a lot of wet parts, so this will help you prevent any accidents or damage.Choose a flat, water-resistant surface as your work area. A countertop near the sink is optimal.;
, You can usually access the tank by opening the top compartment of the humidifier. Most water tanks will lift straight off the base. Drain the old water out of the tank and set it aside.It may be a good idea to lay the water tank in the sink or on a folded towel in case it continues draining after you’ve emptied it.
You can clean and rinse the tank separately later if needed.
 Removable air filters can most often be located inside the humidifier’s motor housing. Remove the outer casing of the unit and slide out the old filter. Look over the filter to see what level of cleaning it will require.Filters that are mildly dusty can be rinsed clean. If there’s mold or an excessive amount of mineral buildup present, you may need to use a vinegar or bleach-based cleaning solution instead.Disposable paper filters can simply be thrown away and replaced.
 Rotate the filter under the stream to dislodge any traces of dust or dirt. Lightly brush away stuck-on debris with a soft-bristled brush or fingertip, but be careful not to apply too much pressure to the mesh. Once the filter looks clean, shake off the excess water.You should only ever use fresh water to rinse your humidifier filter.
 When it comes to drying a clean filter, air drying is the safest option. Attempting to speed the drying process along using another tool, such as a hair dryer, may cause permanent damage. Set the filter on an absorbent towel and check back in 1-2 hours.Mold needs moisture to thrive. Reloading your humidifier with clean water and a dry filter will prevent mold from returning.
Once the filter is dry, you can reassemble and start using the humidifier again.

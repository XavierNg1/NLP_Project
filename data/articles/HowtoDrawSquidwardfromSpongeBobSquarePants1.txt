 This will serve as Squidward's head, although it should look more like a mushroom at this point.;
, Followed this with a larger rectangle and a semicircle below that, for his torso.
 Each consists of one square and two rectangles with two triangles at each end. Squidward's arms in this picture are resting squarely on his hips, so try to imitate that position as effectively as possible

, Divide it into three (since the fourth leg is hidden behind him). Create pairs of triangles at the end of each leg for the feet.
 Draw an oval for each eye and between those draw an egg shape for the nose. Add two small ovals inside the eyes for irises.
 Draw a line across for the mouth. The eyes depend on what kind of expression you want, so be creative!

, Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. Also erase any remaining sketch lines.
 Use light greenish-grey for the majority of his body and a sort of mustard color for his shirt. Finish up with his light yellow eyes and bluish suction cups, and there you go! Squidward Tentacles!

 Pour nails or screws into a sock, and hit the wood until it reaches your desired level of distress.
 Soft strikes with a hammer will create small divots in the wood, while a mallet will make wider impressions.
 This will remove areas of stain and give the wood a rough texture, as is likely to occur in a natural setting over time.
 If you want to give your wood the appearance of having been eaten by worms over many decades, you can try to give it wormholes yourself. Hammer or screw the drywall nails into the 2x4 completely so that their ends stick through the bottom of your makeshift hammer. Next, strike the piece of wood with your wormhole hammer repeatedly, creating small puncture marks.









To create a more interesting wormhole pattern, be sure to hammer your drywall screws into the 2x4 in an irregular pattern. Turn the wormhole hammer around and strike your wood at different angles to create a more natural looking effect.

 Use the internet to follow new styles and ideas. Create accounts on social media and sharing sites like Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and the like. Search keywords (like “backpack” plus “new,” or “notebooks” plus “stylish”) to find images of what’s new and hot. Sign up for groups, alerts, and RSS feeds to keep up-to-date with new products and do-it-yourself ideas as soon as they come out.On the other hand, if your overall style is more of a retro-look, use the internet to find images of students from that era. Love to dress the way teens did in the 1950’s or any other decade? Research the sort of school supplies they used back then with key terms like “1950’s lunch boxes” so you can complete your look.;
, Sneak a peek at what your classmates are using. Use their choices as inspiration for your own. If you really like something they have, think of a way it could be tweaked to set it apart from theirs.


Say you really like the protective case that someone bought for their tablet or some other device. It’s plaid with broad stripes and earth colors. You don’t want to copy them by buying the exact same one, so ask yourself what you like most about it. Is it the colors? The pattern? Would you be happy with the same color scheme, only with much thinner stripes? Or would you rather have the same exact pattern in totally different colors?

, Don’t wait until the last week of summer to buy all of your supplies for the upcoming year. Avoid the risk of having to settle for stuff you don’t like. Buy your supplies before they sell out, and before everyone else at school buys the same thing!


Back-to-school sales will offer discounts on a lot of stuff you need all at once, but stores and websites have sales throughout the year. Use back-to-school sales to buy essentials that you need immediately and/or don’t care too much about, and do some comparison-shopping throughout the rest of the year to find the hot-ticket items you want most when they’re at their cheapest.

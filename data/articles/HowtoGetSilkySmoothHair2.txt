 You can buy these types of products at your local pharmacy and they will keep your hair looking shiny and beautiful. This is the type of product that many celebrities use to keep their hair looking so shimmering. The downside is that you have to use this everyday, but it isn’t too expensive.
 If you don’t have time for all the lifestyle changes before a big date or an interview, this might be the way to go. Buy a shine spray online or at a local hairdresser, but be sure not to use too much. Spray it on a brush and then comb lightly through your hair. Be careful not to overdo it or your hair might end up looking greasy rather than shiny.
 Shampoos that contain natural oils in them will do the most to help your hair look silky and smooth. Avoid shampoos containing alcohol at all costs, as this will cause your hair to become dry and break. Moisturizing shampoos can also help to keep the moisture locked in and have your hair looking the way you want it. You can find shampoo and conditioner like this at your local grocery store or pharmacy, so you won’t have to look far.

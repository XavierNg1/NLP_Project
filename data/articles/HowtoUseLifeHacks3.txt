Buy some craft wire
Twist it using pliers
Attach Christmas lights to it

 Stir it around and start painting. For every half a liter of paint, add one teaspoon of vanilla essence or extract and mix with a paint mixer. In the end, the room won't smell like that terrible paint odor, but instead smell like pure vanilla.

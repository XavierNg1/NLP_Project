 You can buy a suede dye at a craft store or online. Choose a black dye that matches your boots. You will need a black dye to touch up your boots if there is any fading due to cleaning., Dye can get messy. You do not want to get any dye on your floor or carpeting. Lay down newspaper or tart over the area where you're going to dye your boots.If possible, dye your boots on a flat surface outside.
 This will keep the boots standing upright as you work. Ball up some old newspaper and stuff them in the boots so they stand tall and stiff.If you do not have newspaper, you can use any type of old paper. Rip pages out of magazines or ball up printer paper.
 Dye can stain your fingers and hands. Put on a pair of rubber gloves, or another type of protective gloves, when working with dye.You may want to wear old clothes as well, to prevent your clothing from becoming stained.
 Your dye kit should come with a brush. If it does not, buy a small paint brush from a hardware store. Pour your dye into a ceramic or glass bowl. Dab the brush in the bowl and apply dye liberally to faded areas.Use gentle, swiping motions to apply the dye.
Blend the dye out slightly into the surrounding areas of the boot so the contrast does not look dramatic.
 If there are still stains and lightened portions peeking through the dye, apply a second coat. You may also find, after the dye dries, a second coat is necessary. Dye may get lighter as it dries., Set the boots in a safe place where they will not be disturbed. Keep them out of reach of children and animals. You should leave them to dry overnight. Do not handle your boots or wear them out until the dye dries completely.

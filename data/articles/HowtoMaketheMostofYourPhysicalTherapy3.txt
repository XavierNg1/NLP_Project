 Do not leave it up to chance whether you have the time or not. They are as important as doctor-prescribed medicine and should be treated as a priority during your day.
 Keep a corner of your home ready with a yoga mat or exercise ball, so that you can do a few repetitions when you have some free time. This will help you get into the mentality of exercise as a lifestyle choice.
 If you are advised to do them once per day, do them every day, and if you are asked to do them 3 times per day, do them 3 times per day. Frequent exercises are usually prescribed when there is a limited time for you to regain your mobility during the healing process, and they should be treated with gravity.
 Many physical therapists will tell you to add 5 repetitions or 1 more set when the exercise becomes easy. You may also be asked to add more weight to your exercises.
 They should be able to adjust an exercise regime according to your particular health problems. Establish goals that you should reach 3 months, 6 months and a year into the future.

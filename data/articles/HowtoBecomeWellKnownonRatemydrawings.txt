 It is simple and will allow you to leave comments on artwork, participate in draw-chat and reply to forums located within Rate My Drawings.;
, Make a new topic that contains a bit about yourself. Be sure to show your personality. The more "in-yourface" you are the better.
 The first few drawings you make will help you get accustomed to the operation of the RMD drawing tool. These drawings are your first stepping stones into digital artwork.
 There's steps to that on the site.
 Leave comments on several of the drawings. You can literally copy/paste a "Good Job 5 hearts!" Speaking of hearts - Don't forget to rate.
 Every once in a while you'll get a profile comment, be sure to reply.
 An even bigger compliment is to add them to your friends. When they're your friend you get their updates right on your profile page.
 Even if the entry isn't that great the contest's host has to check it out.

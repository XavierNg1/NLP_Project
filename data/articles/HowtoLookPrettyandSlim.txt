 Eating healthy is a very important thing. Eat good proportions though. Don't eat too much of that food because it can be bad for you even though you may be eating healthy foods. Start eating whole grain toast or more veggies. Eat less sugary things and cut down on fatty foods. Start drinking more water. You won't be so dehydrated and won't have as many headaches. Eating healthy can help cut down the amount of pimples on you without using makeup to cover it which just gives it a reaction and helps you get skinnier. Eating healthy will make you less tired and more energetic which is usually appealing to people. It can also help you concentrate just like if you sleep more.;
, Exercise is an important thing to do. If we don't exercise we get fat and lazy. Start doing push-ups and sit-ups. Less watching TV and playing video games. Just don't over due the exercising. Anything you do too much is bad for you.
 Too much can make you look like a clown or somebody who doesn't know proportions. Wear some lip gloss and maybe some blush. Go for light colors in the eyeshadow like peach color or maybe light green. If you are a kid not in the teens yet, try not to wear any makeup at all. It will make you look like you are trying to grow-up too fast. Or at the most, minimize the amount you put on.
 Colors like brown, grey, and black make you look skinnier and more mature. Colors like dark red can make you look dangerous which if you like that appeal go for it.
 You have to believe that you are beautiful in order to be beautiful. Remember, nobody is perfect or ugly. Everyone is unique and special in some way.

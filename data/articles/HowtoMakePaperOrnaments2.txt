 Use a pair of wire cutters to cut the wire. Pinch the end of your wire with a pair of round-nose pliers, then twist it until it forms a small loop. Pull the pliers out and set them aside. The loop will keep the bead from sliding off., You can also use a glass or crystal bead for a fancier ornament instead. Set the wire with the bead on it aside when you are done.
 Cut your paper down to 4½ by 10½ inches (11.43 by 26.67 centimeters) first, then use a ruler and pencil to draw vertical lines, spaced ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters) apart. Cut your paper along the lines that you drew. You will need 6 strips.You can also use scrapbooking paper or construction paper.
 A good way to do this would be to set the entire stack down on a piece of foam, then pierce the center and both of the narrow ends with a yarn needle or thumbtack.


If you don't have a yarn needle, you can use your wire instead. You will need to pierce the strips individually, however.
 Fan the strips out evenly, then place a drop of glue on top of the stack, right where the wire is., Take the strip that is on the bottom of the stack, closest to the best. Thread the left end onto the wire, and then the right end. Secure the paper with a drop of glue., Take the second strip of paper, and thread the left end and then the right end onto the wire. Work your way to the top, then seal the last strip with glue., You can squish your papers down as much as you'd like. The more you squish them, the more oval your ornament will be. Use your round-nose pliers to make the loop, and your wire cutters to trim off any excess wire., Tie the ends of the ribbon or twine to make a loop big enough to fit over a branch on your Christmas tree. When you are done, hang your ornament.


Alternatively, you can skip the ribbon/twine, and slip an ornament hook through the wire loop instead.

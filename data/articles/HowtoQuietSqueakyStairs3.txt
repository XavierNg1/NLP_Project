 If each step to your stair is made of more than one wooden board, the squeak may be caused by those two pieces rubbing against each other. In this case, pour lubricant in between them. With a clean cloth, use your foot or hand to rub the lube further in.Suitable lubricants for this method include: powdered graphite, powdered soapstone, and talcum powder.
 Place a heavy object on either side of the area that squeaks so the tread makes contact with the stringer or riser below. Use two 8- or 10-penny finish nails to secure the tread in place. To ensure that it remains flush with the stringer or riser over time, hammer the nails in at 45 degrees, with the sharp end of each one pointed toward the other.First, mark two spots on the tread, along the stringer or riser underneath, to drill starter-holes for your nails.
Make sure these spots are separated by a wide enough margin so that the nails don’t intersect.
Using a drill-bit with a smaller diameter than your nails, use a drill to create a shallow starter-hole for the tip of each nail.
Hammer the nails in until their heads are slightly lower the tread’s surface.
Use wood putty to cover the nail heads and fill in the dents.
 Ideally, time your house projects so that you can repair squeaky stairs while replacing carpet. If this isn’t possible, find a kit for screwing through carpeting. Such kits come with screws, drill bits, and a tripod device specially designed for this task.Set the tripod on the tread where it needs to be screwed to the stringer or riser underneath.Place one of the scored screws into the hole at the tripod’s center.
Drill the screw through the center of the hole, through the carpet and tread, into the stringer or riser.
Pick the tripod up and find the screw head sticking out of the carpet.
Use the tripod’s screw gripper to break off the specially designed screw head, in the same manner you’d remove a bottle cap with a bottle opener.

 Most tobacco products that you buy in the store are processed in some way. Tobacco that is "homegrown" may be processed as well. If you are looking for an unprocessed product, you should seek out whole, unprocessed tobacco leaves, which you can buy from an individual who grows the plant at home or from a company.


It is illegal to sell processed tobacco products without a license in the United States, but whole, unprocessed tobacco leaves are not subject to these same regulations.;
, If you are looking for a more natural, higher quality tobacco product, homegrown, unprocessed tobacco might be right for you.


Homegrown, unprocessed tobacco may contain fewer chemicals and additives than commercial tobacco.
Homegrown, unprocessed tobacco may come from heirloom plants, which can produce a higher quality product with a better taste., While there may be certain benefits to using unprocessed tobacco products, you should understand that purchasing homegrown tobacco will not prevent you from developing any of the various diseases that have been linked to smoking. Large tobacco companies do add many chemicals to their products, but tobacco naturally contains compounds that are known carcinogens as well. If you want to be healthy, the best thing you can do is to stop smoking.Unless you buy unprocessed, whole-leaf tobacco, or you buy processed tobacco illegally, which is strongly discouraged, you will have to pay taxes. For this reason, purchasing homegrown tobacco from a legitimate source may not save you any money over purchasing conventional tobacco products from a store.

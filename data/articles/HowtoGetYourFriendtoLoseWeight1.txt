 A heavy person might play sports and eat a balanced diet, while a thin person might thrive upon junk food and late-night internet browsing. People of any size may have a disability affecting their ability to exercise or eat certain food groups. You can't see someone's habits just by looking at their weight.;
, Look beyond "fat is bad:" what is the real reasoning you want to push someone to make such drastic changes? Why do the particulars of their body matter so much to you?


You want to take on the role of saving them from themselves
You are physically disgusted by their weight, or by fat people in general
You are embarrassed to be seen with someone fat
You don't care about their weight; you just want them to be happy and treat themselves well

, If your friend is on the bigger side, they know. In fact, people probably won't stop telling them. Heavy people are at greater risk for mental health issues and low self-esteem, and reminding them how fat they are is not going to make it any better.


You are their friend, not a critic or a personal trainer.
Criticizing their body won't help them. It's hard to take good care of something you hate, so don't encourage them to hate their body.
 A good friend likes their friend for whom they already are, not for whom they might someday become. Focus on accepting the whole package, including their weight. What is good about your friend: their sense of humor, their compassion, their skill at theater?

 Every vector can be numerically represented in the Cartesian coordinate system with a horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) component.It is written as an ordered pair v=<x,y>{\displaystyle v=<x,y>}. If you are given a vector that is placed away from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system, you must define the components of both points of the vector.

 For example, the vector AB has an ordered pair for point A and point B. 

 Point A has a horizontal component of 5 and a vertical component of 1, so the ordered pair is <5, 1>. 

 Point B has a horizontal component of 1 and a vertical component of 2, so the ordered pair is <1, 2>. 


, Because you now have two points you are dealing with, you must subtract the x and y components of each point before you solve using the equation v = √((x2-x1)2 +(y2-y1)2).Point A is ordered pair 1 <x1, y1> and point B is ordered pair 2 <x2, y2>


, Plug in the numbers of your ordered pairs and calculate the magnitude. Using our above example the calculation looks like this:

 v = √((x2-x1)2 +(y2-y1)2)

 v = √((1-5)2 +(2-1)2)

 v = √((-4)2 +(1)2)

 v = √(16+1) = √(17) = 4.12

Don't worry if your answer is not a whole number. Vector magnitudes can be decimals.

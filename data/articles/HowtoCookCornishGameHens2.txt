 Do this by cutting through the breast with kitchen shears. Turn them over and cut down the backbone, flattening them with your hands.
 When you're done, use a paper towel to dry them and absorb the excess moisture. When they're dried, place them on a pan large enough to hold them when they're flattened out.
 Reserve 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of the marinade for basting, and spread the rest over the hens in the pan. Cover them with plastic wrap, and refrigerate them for 2 hours.
, Let the excess marinade drip off the hens and arrange them on the grill, skin side up. Brush reserved marinade on hens and grill for 20 minutes.
 Brush on the reserved marinade occasionally as you do this. Use a meat thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 180 °F (82.2°C). Place the hens on a cutting board when you're done.

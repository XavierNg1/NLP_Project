 To ensure your dog stays warm, you should set up a padded sleeping space for the in an area that is free of drafts or cold air. You may get a firm, orthopedic bed for them that is dome shaped to help distribute their weight evenly and put less pressure on their joints. Set up their bed in a warm place in your home that is not near a window or a drafty area so they stay warm. Cold can irritate their arthritis.You may also make sure there are a lot of soft, padded spots for your dog to lounge and rest on in your home. Couches, ottomans, and soft carpet are all great for dogs with arthritis, as they help to support and cushion their joints.
 You do not want your pup to have to strain themselves to reach their food and water. Place their food and water bowls at a spot they can reach, such as on the ground by the door or on the lowest step of a set of stairs.If you live in a multi-level home, make sure there is a water bowl for your pet on every floor. This will reduce the amount of time they have to spend going up and down the stairs to get a drink.
You should also make sure their food and water dishes are on a non-slip surface, such as a rubber mat. This will ensure your dog is not at risk of slipping or tripping when they eat.
 You should do your best to ensure your dog can move around easily in your home, even with their arthritis. Consider installing ramps in your home so your dog can go up stairs or access other areas of your home with ease. Make your own ramps from plywood covered in carpeting or buy ramps at your local pet store.Make sure the ramps are not too steep and that both ends are secure so your pet is not at risk of injury.
You can also set up barriers in your home to prevent your dog from using the stairs. Sometimes, dogs do not know they are putting too much stress on their joints. Putting up barriers makes it clear they need to stay on one floor of the home and avoid climbing up and down stairwells to avoid irritating their arthritis.

 Advertise using flyers laminated to prevent soggy pages when it rains. Volunteer to assist with an orchestra, and make friends with the school orchestra teacher. Even check out local string stores to see if they're hiring or if they'll let you advertise.;
, Knowledge of music theory is extremely important and often overlooked. Teach them the basics of conducting. Sing with your student(s). Be patient: don't assume they know anything unless they've proven it. Only move on when they can reteach you what they've learned.
 Make proper bowhold and straight, full bowing a priority.
 Be pickier than you want to be; it's easy to let approximation go but it's hard to retrain the ear once that's gone on for years and they want to move to a higher level. Use the process of tuning the violin to test your student's ear; have them do it themselves as soon as it's possible, and have them tune in 5ths to their other strings.
 Teach them to count everything. Insist on a consistent tempo in Ã©tudes and scales.
 If they don't, or if their goals are unacceptable, have them fill out practice records.

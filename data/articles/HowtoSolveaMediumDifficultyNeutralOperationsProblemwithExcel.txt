, The Goal Seeking Preferences will be important. Open Preferences in the Excel menu. Recommended Settings: Set General to R1C1 Off and Show the 10 Most Recent Documents; Edit - set all the Top options to checked except Automatically Convert Date System. Display number of decimal places = blank (for integers preferred), Preserve display of dates and set 30 for 21st century cutoff; View - show Formula Bar and Status Bar, hover for comments and all of Objects, Show gridlines and all boxes below that auto or checked; Chart - show chart names and data markers on hover. Leave rest unchecked for now; Calculation -- Automatically and calculate before save, Limit iteration checked, max iterations 100, max change .000 000 000 000 01 w/o spaces as this problem involves precise goal seeking; save external link values and use 1904 date system; Error checking - check all; Save - save preview picture with new files and Save Autorecover after 5 minutes; Ribbon -- all checked except Hide group titles and Developer.
 Taking then a+b-b=ab-b and simplifying the left while factoring b out on the right, leaves a =  b(a-1). Dividing both sides by (a-1) and simplifying leaves a/(a-1) =b, Since ab = c, it's also true that a^2/(a-1) = c. Because a could have been subtracted first instead of b, and because addition and multiplication are both commutative, it's also true that b/(b-1) = a and b^2/(b-1) = c as well. Neither a nor b then may equal 1 lest division by 0 result in the denominator.
 Do Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 15 OK and Format Cells Font Size  9 or 10 or whatever you're comfortable viewing. Select columns B:G and set column width to 20.17. Select column A and set column width to 4.
 B1: a; C1: b:z; D1: Result c; E1: Goal; F1: 0 (which would appear with many trailing zeroes).
 B2: 5; D2: (w/o quotes) "=B2^2/(B2-1)"; E2: "=2*PI()"; F2: "=E2-D2" w/o quotes.
 Select cell F2 and go to menuitem Tools Goal Seek, Accept F2, hit tab twice and enter To value: 0, then enter By changing cell: and click on cell B2, OK. After a moment, B2's value should change to 5.03537698500395 and F2 should equal 0. Now the a value for arriving at 2π via Neutral Operations is known, and b remains to be determined. But b = a/(a-1) whereas c = a^2/(a-1).
 Do Edit Go To cell range F3: F51 and do Edit Fill Down.
 D4: "=B4^2/(B4-1)"; E4: " "=D4".
 w/o quotes: A5: c; B5: "=B4"; C5: "=B5/(B5-1)"; D5: "=B5+C5" E5: "=B5*C5".
 Copy cell range B4:E5 and Paste it to the following alternate cells:  B6, B8, B10. B12, B14, B16, B18, B20, B22. Select cell range B4:E23 and copy it and paste it to cell B24. Select cell range B48:E49 and copy it to cell B50.
, Go to cell A55 and paste it and do menuitem Data Sort Sort by Columns: Column A; Sort on: Values; Order: A to Z; Color/Icon is blank, OK. Select row 56 and do Insert Row and type b and delete b from the a,b found in cell A55.
,,, Done.

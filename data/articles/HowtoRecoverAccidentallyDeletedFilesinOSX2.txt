 If you have used the Time Machine function to create backups of your files, you may be able to restore an older version of the file that you deleted. Open the window that contained the file originally. For example, if you deleted something from your Documents folder, open the Documents folder.
 If your Time Machine backups are located on an external or network drive, ensure that the drive is connected before proceeding.
 This is located in the menu bar. Select Enter Time Machine. Your computer may take a moment to connect to the Time Machine drive.
 Use the arrows to move back and forth between snapshots of that folder, or use the timeline on the right side of the screen to jump directly to specific backups. If the entry on the timeline is dimmed, it means the backup disk that contains the snapshot is not connected.


You can use the search bar to find specific files in the snapshot.
 Double-click a file to open it. This will let you see what version of the file is contained in the snapshot. Use the preview to find the version of the file that is closest to the one you want.
 Once you've found the file you need, select it and click Restore. The item will be restored to its original location. You can select multiple items to restore them all at once.If the item was in multiple folders that were since deleted, you may be asked to recreate the folders so that the file can be restored.

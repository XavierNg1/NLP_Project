 Sprinkle the chocolate evenly across the surface of the toffee and let it sit for 2-3 minutes as it heats up. Once it's lightened in color, use a plastic spatula to spread the chocolate evenly across the surface of the toffee, making a two-layered chocolate-toffee treat. Freeze as usual.
 Toffee has long been served with nuts, particularly almonds and pecans. Put a cup of nuts on the baking tray before you pour the toffee out. Then use a food processor to finely chop another 1/2 cup of nuts and pour them on top of the toffee when it is still hot (or the chocolate, if you chose to add it on top). Freeze as usual.
 Put 8 ounces of white chocolate chips and 2 ounces of finely ground coffee in a small saucepot. Heat up 1-2 inches of water in a larger pan, then place the chocolate pot in the water pan to warm the chocolate indirectly. This is called a double boiler, as the hot water surrounding the pot melts the chocolate, not the direct heat of the stovetop. Stir the coffee and chocolate until fully melted, then pour and spread on the partially cooled toffee., Brown sugar has a darker, molasses-like quality that will make an especially distinct treat. You can treat the rest of the recipe the same as normal toffee.
 This decadent but simply candy is such a perfect combination you may not cook it any other way. The caramelized sugars go perfectly with a pinch of salt, sprinkled right over the top of the toffee right after pouring onto the baking sheet., Sweet, salty, and savory, bacon toffee is hard to resist. To make it, simply fry, dry, and finely chop 1lb of bacon. Then lay the small pieces on your baking pan and pour the toffee over them., Crunch your toffee up and use them alongside chocolate chips in chocolate chip cookies. Toffee goes great on double chocolate cookies or crumbled on the top of a cake before serving.

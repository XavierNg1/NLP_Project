Check your vehicle's owner's manual to see if there are any specific instructions for the type of brake fluid you should use. Also, the cap usually states what kind of brake fluid is required. For the vast majority of vehicles, a standard glycol-based DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid should be used.
Some brake systems may require DOT 5 fluid, which, because it's silicone-based, has a different chemical composition than DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids. Conventional vehicle maintenance wisdom dictates that DOT 5 should never be mixed with DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluid or used in systems intended for these types of fluids or it may damage the brakes.










Give the top of the reservoir a quick wipe with a lint-free cloth to remove any dirt or debris. This ensures that no loose particles are able to fall into the reservoir and also prevents the brake fluid from dripping onto you or other parts of the engine.
If at any point you get brake fluid on your hands, wash them. Brake fluid is corrosive enough to strip paint from metal, so it's dangerous to leave on your skin for very long.When you're done, re-seal the cap and close the hood. Congratulations! You're done.










The actual act of adding extra brake fluid to your vehicle's reservoir is quite easy â€” simply pour it through the reservoir hole carefully. Use the minimum and maximum fill lines as a guide, if present. If your reservoir doesn't have these markings, fill it about 2/3 to 3/4 full.
You may want to consider using a clean funnel to help prevent spillage. If you do this, however, be sure to clean it using soap and water after use, as brake fluid can be highly caustic.

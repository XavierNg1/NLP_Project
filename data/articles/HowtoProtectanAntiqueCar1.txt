 Using sheepskin or cotton washing mitts, wash the car with a car wash soap formulated for antique cars. Rinse the car and dry with a soft cloth. Apply wax according to product directions., You will need to change the oil in a classic car about every 2,000 miles. If you have a car that was manufactured before oil filters were common, make sure you change the oil every thousand miles. This will prevent sludge from building up in the pan and oil galleries., When you change the oil in an antique car, you should also inspect the car’s belts and hoses. Replace belts and hoses that show signs of leakage or swelling. You should also replace belts and hoses with cracks in them., Make sure you flush an antique car’s coolant once a year. Changing the coolant annually will prevent corrosion in the car’s cooling system. A 50/50 mixture of antifreeze and distilled water will work for most cars., Many classic cars have driveline components that need to be lubricated regularly. If your car has driveline components, lubricate them every 2-3 months.

 Notifications always pop up, and always tempt you to go through a certain application on site for hours on end. The best idea would be to delete, ignore, or turn them off all together.
 Getting rid of the problem is honestly the best solution. Once it’s gone, it’s gone forever (with an exception of some sites). You can even block the site/app on your browser or phone. And no, this doesn’t mean you should recreate another account or redownload the app.

 Find what interests you. Find a new hobby. Whether it’s art, reading, writing, making music, sports, photography, etc. Start a better lifestyle. Try joining a gym or changing up eating habits. Help out the local community by volunteering. There is an endless list of options when it comes to finding something you like to do.

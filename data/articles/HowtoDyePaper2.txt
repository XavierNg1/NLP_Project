 Brew coffee in a coffee maker or tea in a large mug. You can also brew loose-leaf tea or tea bags for 10 minutes. If you are using loose-leaf tea, be sure to strain it through a fine, mesh sieve lined with muslin cloth.Black tea is the most common, but you can experiment with different types of tea as well, such as hibiscus.
The coffee can be hot or cold.
 The tray needs to be big enough to fit your paper. You can also use a baking dish or a rimmed baking sheet instead.
 Press it down under the liquid with your hands. Tap it gently to get rid of air bubbles., The longer you let the paper soak, the darker the color will be.
 Hold it over the tray so that the excess liquid can drip back. Do not wring the paper. You can crumple it later to create an aged effect.
 Set the paper down on a stack of paper towels. Place another paper towel on top of it, and pat it gently to soak up any excess liquid. Keep patting the paper with clean paper towels until most of the liquid had been absorbed and the paper is damp.
 You can dry the paper with a heat gun, a hair dryer, or an oven. The heat gun/hair dryer will give you a smoother finish. Begin by setting the paper down onto a baking sheet, then do one of the following:Blow dry the paper with a heat gun or hair dryer. Alternate between blotting the paper with a paper towel and flipping it over. Wipe the baking sheet down if it gets wet.
Dry the paper in the oven at 200°F (94°C) for 5 to 10 minutes.
Create an aged effect by crumpling the paper halfway through the drying process. Flatten the paper out, then dry it the rest of the way.

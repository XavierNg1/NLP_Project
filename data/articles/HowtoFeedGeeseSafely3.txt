 Large bits of popcorn or whole wheat bread which will float can be thrown into water. The brief submersion will help break the foods down and make them more digestible.Most food, though, should be tossed a meter or so in front of the geese on land.


Do not distribute more food than the geese will eat. If you see their consumption slowing, stop feeding.
 Place several small accumulations of cracked corn, oats, or green veggies in the area of the flock. Space each pile about 10-15 feet apart. Ensure there is enough feed, and enough space between each pile of feed, to allow all the geese to eat some in peace.Concentrating food in one location might cause a feed frenzy as all the birds scramble to get their portion.
 Wild geese may become dependent on humans feeding them if they continue to receive food from you or others on a daily basis. Check the area in which youâ€™re feeding for notices prohibiting feeding.
 Plus, if geese become accustomed to being fed in these areas, they will learn to congregate there, waiting for food. This will bother people who do not have anything for the geese. Always feed geese at least fifty meters from any roads, trains, and cars.
 Otherwise, the food may attract rats and leads to the accumulation of poisonous blue-green algae in the water. Moldy food might be eaten by geese later and infect them with a deadly lung fungus.

 If you have kids, you will need to consider where they sleep before you choose a spot for your dog. For example, if your kids are light sleepers or you have a baby, you might not want to place the dog’s bed or crate near their rooms. Instead, choose a place for your dog to sleep that is far away from your sleeping children so the dog does not wake them with its vocalizations.For example, a family with a baby might choose to have its dog sleep crated in a room far away from the child, such as the kitchen, to prevent the pet from waking the baby.
 When deciding on a place for your dog to sleep, you should consider whether or not you want your dog to watch over and protect your home at night. For example, placing your dog’s bed near the front door might add an extra layer of protection should a stranger show up in the middle of the night.


A family who wants the dog to watch over the house might allow the dog to sleep outside of its crate to guard the home.
 While many pet owners decide to share their bed with their dog, it is important to consider the risks of doing so. Sleeping with your dog can increase the risk of transmitting disease, and puppies with aggression issues can more fully develop these behaviors if allowed to share a bed with humans. Dogs can also transmit bacteria, fleas, and other parasites to humans if allowed to sleep in their owners’ beds.Despite the risks, it can be appropriate for a dog to sleep with its human. For example, a person who lives and sleeps alone may choose to sleep with their dog for companionship.

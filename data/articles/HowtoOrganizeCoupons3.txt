 You'll be sifting through piles and piles of ads if you don't routinely clean out your binder/filing system. As the coupons expire, throw out the ones you haven't used -- you'll be carrying around fewer and notice which products you aren't buying.


Set aside a time each week to coupon and throw out. Getting into a routine will help you stay organized. Saturday and Sunday mornings make the most sense, as ads are greater on those two days.
Send the expired ones to the troops. They can use coupons up to 6 months past the expiration date., As you get into this, it'll benefit you to know what the base prices are. A coupon for a product at one store may be the retail price at another. You'll be able to toss out coupons that really don't save you any money.


Take a spreadsheet (or grab a grocery price book) when you go on your shopping quest. Write down the prices of the products you buy most often. Soon enough, getting the best deals will become a breeze.
 So your coupons are organized in the manner of your choosing, but what about stacking? If you find manufacturer's and store coupons, sometimes they both can be used, doubling your savings.


If it appeals to you, deem a section just for this purpose. It should be the first section you go to if you're trying to see how much money you can save.

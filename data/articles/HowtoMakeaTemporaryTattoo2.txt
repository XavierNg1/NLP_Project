 You can create professional-looking temporary tattoos by making a stencil, which helps you control the tattoo design rather than relying on your drawing skills to do the job. Decide what shape you want your tattoo to be, draw it on an index card, and cut out the shape using a cutting knife or a pair of small scissors.

Simple, bold shapes are the easiest ones to create with this method. Try diamonds, circles, and other geometric shapes.
For a more detailed tattoo, you can create a stencil based on an existing image. Check out How to Make a Graffiti Stencil for more information on this method.
 Choose one or more marker colors to use with your stencil. Black is a classic option, and may be the most likely to help your tattoo pass as a real one. Using another color can be just as fun.


Permanent markers contain chemicals that aren't meant to be used on skin. Look for markers that are labeled as safe for this type of use.
If you'd rather not use permanent markers, washable markers are also fine. The tattoo just won't last quite as long.
Another good ink choice is stamping ink, which comes on wet stamping pads. To use this type of ink for your tattoo, press a cotton ball onto the ink pad and use it to wipe the ink over the stencil and onto your skin.
 Place the stencil against the part of your body where you want the tattoo to be. Use one hand to hold it firmly against the skin, so that the cut out shapes are lying flat. Use the other hand to color in the shapes with the markers you chose. When you're finished, lift the stencil away and allow the marker ink to dry.

Make sure you apply the tattoo to clean, dry skin. Shave the hair in the area for a more even application.
If you have trouble holding the stencil in place, try using tape to affix it to the area. You could also try applying the tattoo to a part of your body with a flatter surface.
 When you're finished sporting your temporary tattoo, it can be washed off with warm, soapy water, or you dab a cotton pad in oil and 'scrub' your tattoo off.

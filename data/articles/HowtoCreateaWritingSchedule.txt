 This place could be a workstation in the corner of the dining room, a spare room you can commandeer as an office or a card table in the basement.;
, If Thursday and Friday evening and Saturday afternoon are filled, write in Sunday morning and Monday and Wednesday evening as your writing times. Treat scheduled writing time the same as an important business conference call or doctor's appointment, and don't skip it.
 If you have family or roommates who object, then move to another room to write. While the rest of the household is in front of the TV, it's prime time for writing without interruptions.
 Some writers find that a production goal works better than a time goal. Give yourself a deadline, whether it's an article a week or 3 pages a day, and stick to it.
 It's easy to get distracted and find yourself at the end of your writing time with little or nothing to show for it. Set the timer for 15 minutes (or 10 or 20 if that works better) and focus on nothing but getting words down.
 Carry your laptop wherever you go or keep a notebook and pen with you. If you're sitting in a doctor's waiting room or in your car waiting for the kids' soccer practice to let out, take that time to jot down notes and ideas. Even small entries add up, such as an outline for an article, a single paragraph or a character description.
 Instead of thinking about writing an entire book, think about writing a chapter or even a single scene. Outline your article first and focus on writing each part before putting it all together.
 Work on more than one project at a time. Once you reach a stopping point on one project, or if your creative energy is flagging, start working on another. When you go back to the first project, it'll be with fresh eyes.

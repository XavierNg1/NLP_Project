 These are the "leads." You can then attach a piece of builder's line at the top of each brick as you lay up the remaining brick in this wall, keeping them aligned and level.


As you work, your wall will look like a shallow "U," moving up 2-3 courses on either side before filling in the middle with bricks. This ensures that you keep each course level., If you are turning the corner you began at, you will set each course half a brick back from the previous course, so that each course is staggered half a brick. If you are turning the corner where you began, put the first brick in the first course so that it is square, and lay a few brick in this direction also.









You don't want the joints of your wall to be even or the wall will be weak. You can either break a brick in half and start with a half brick, or turn a brick sideways (if you're structure is two bricks thick) and start with that., The standard bed and head joints are 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm), but this can be adjusted to your preference, up to 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) or even more.
 The jointer is a piece of tubing whose diameter is the same or slightly larger than your joint spacing, bent in an "S" shape. Hold the tool on one end, and rub it along the mortar joint between your brick with the curved portion of the tool to smooth out the mortar joint.
 It takes a lot of practice to be able to tell when the mortar is set properly to strike and brush the joints, but basically, when it is hard enough to touch with your finger and not leave an impression, it is ready.
 Once you have this rhythm down, you should be able to move quickly, no matter what structure or shape you're making. The same basic pattern is used the entire time.









Move the guidelines.
Set the mortar.
Stagger your first brick.
Wipe away excess mortar.
Build up the outsides, or leads, of the wall before filling in the middle.

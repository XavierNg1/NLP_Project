 The easiest method is to use square pliers with sufficiently wide jaws.
 Most likely the wire will have a slight curve at the 90 degree angle.,, To prevent the wire from developing marks from the pliers, wrap a piece of cloth around the wire or grip the wire with 2 small glimpse of wood on either side of the wire.

Another option would be to grip the wire with pliers made of a softer material than the wire but finding pliers like that can be difficult as strength and durability are important aspects of pliers.
, Use a block of wood to ensure even bending.
,

The simplest method to make one of these is to drill 2 crossing holes through a piece of wood. By cutting the wood at 90 degrees through the centers of the holes, you will end up with 2 pieces of wood with crossing grooves.
You could make the grooves by hand if you're confident in your abilities of cutting precise grooves.
A third option would be to use some sort of saw to make the grooves. For example a bandsaw or table saw.

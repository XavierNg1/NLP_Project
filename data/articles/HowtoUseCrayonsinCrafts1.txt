 You can use a milk carton, a lined muffin tin, or a small Pyrex bowl.;
, Tie one end to a wooden skewer or toothpick and rest the skewer across the top of the open mold to keep the wick upright.
 Remove the paper cover first; break them by hand, or you can put them into a plastic bag and step on them.
 You can choose one of three methods given below to melt the crayons.


Fill the mold with broken pieces of crayon, placing pieces around the wick, and place the mold in an oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit (just hot enough to melt the crayons), until the crayons melt together (keep watching it!)






Place the crayon pieces in a small metal bowl, or a clean, opened tin, and place the tin into a pot of boiling water until the crayons melt, then pour the melted crayons into the mold.






Put the crayon pieces into an oven roasting bag, place bag into a heated oven or boiling water until crayons are melted. Then pour the crayon wax into the mold.
 Wait about 30 minutes.
 If you are using a muffin tin, turn it upside-down and tap the bottom gently.

 Either you or another player (whoever has the most money in the bank) teleport from the bus station immediately to the town. Open the bank and withdraw as many points necessary. This player will then proceed to open as many doors as possible and turn on the power.
 When zombies start to swarm, keep them in wide open areas for easy elimination. Make trains with them, and don't barge into another player's zone while they're under attack (unless they need help).
 Make sure everyone has a mic and is talking. Share all information.
 You want to make sure everyone on your team is ready to defend themselves.
 If they are down halfway across the map, don't go for it unless you have a teleporter. If they are right there, make sure you can get them up without downing yourself.

 Ask your friends if they have anything planned for Saturday afternoon (or Friday night, or a day in the holidays, or whenever your sleepover is). If they do, consider adjusting your sleepover time to suit them - after all, there's no point hosting a sleepover with no guests! About four o'clock is a good time, since then your guests can come for tea.;
, Food is incredibly important. Junk food works best, so make sure you have a good selection. You don't have time to go round specialist shops, so head down to your nearest supermarket to stock up. Take-outs work too!

, They are the thing that will make your sleepover work! Have crisps, strawberries, chocolate, marshmallows, etc., in the room your sleepover is being hosted in, and make sure all guests get some.
 You may not have time to plan a list of amazing jolly-hockey-sticks adventures, so go for the classics - Would You Rather, Truth or Dare, Paranoia...the type that don't need much planning, but always go down well.
 Get some facial recipes and makeup, and dress each other up.
, If you don't have a big room, clear huge furniture into another room for the night (or at least push it back) so there will be enough room for your guests to sleep.

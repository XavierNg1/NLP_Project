 Choosing the right type allows Couchsurfing administrators to isolate the case and take the right action based on your report. There three types of abuse you can report:


Dating Spam—Some profiles use Couchsurfing as a dating site. For example, “Single and ready to mingle! Hit me up!” is indeed very telling of intentions not at all travel accommodation–related.
Commercial Spam—Choose this to report profiles or posts that are only advertisements and have no relevance to Couchsurfing, hosting, or events fall under this category.
Fake Profile—Use this option to report impostors who pose as someone else on their profile to scam or trick other Couchsurfing users.
 The site will ask you if you’re sure about sending the report. Click on the orange “Report” button to proceed to sending it.
 Couchsurfing will review the report, and act on it the soonest time possible.


Once you report a profile, you can no longer report it again. Clicking on the “Report!” button again will only display the type of abuse you already selected.

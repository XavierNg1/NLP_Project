 The only way to permanently change the color of your background is to create a separate background layer. If you simply change the background color, the color will disappear when you print your artwork. To create a background layer:


Select the “Rectangle Tool” in the left tool bar. (Right column, fourth item from the top).
Place your cursor in the upper left corner of the artboard.
Click and drag your cursor to create a rectangle that is the exact size of your artboard.;
, Locate the “Fill Tool” (fourth column up from the bottom of the tool bar). Double-click on the tool to make a “Color Palette” dialogue box appear. Select your color from the color palette. Click “Ok” to set the background color., As you create your artwork, you will want the background to remain static. This is achieved by locking the layer in place.


Locate the “Layer” panel to the right of your screen. If it is not visible, click on “Window” and select “Layers” from the drop down menu.
The rectangle should be listed as “Layer 1.” As you add more layers, “Layer 1” needs to remain at the bottom of the list.
Click on the blank box next to the “Eye” icon to lock the layer in place.

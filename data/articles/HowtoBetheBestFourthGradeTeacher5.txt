 Students thrive when they are given routines to follow. Knowing what they will do each day at a certain time allows them a sense of stability that helps them to feel more comfortable in your classroom.
 Planning too much of one activity can mean drastically decreased productivity. It is often helpful to schedule a short snack break or recess to break up longer periods of required concentration. If you keep these things in mind, you'll be better prepared to structure effective lessons that work to balance active participation with periods of sitting and listening.
 Students need to be able to move around throughout the day. Getting their blood circulating with active movement can greatly increase their ability to concentrate and to stay energized as they work.


Try building movement into your lessons. For example, structure your math lesson so that students must move from table to table to solve the problems.

 Bingo cards are different in the United States versus in the UK and Australia.



If you are playing American Bingo: Your goal is to cover five squares in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row. Cards in the US are 5 rows by 5 rows with a letter from the word BINGO written above each vertical row. The numbers on each square are generated at random. There are 75 balls with either a B, I, N, G, or O on them as well as a number. These letter-number combinations should occasionally coordinate with a square on your card.If you are playing British or Australian Bingo: Your goal is to fill one, two, or all three of the lines on your card. These cards are 3 squares by 9 squares. Each square has a number in it and are generated randomly. There are 90 balls with numbers on each that can be selected by the caller. The amount of money or prizes you win varies by how many of the horizontal rows you can fill. These cards are sold in “books” or “flyers”. Each book contains 10 bingo cards. Each card has its own unique color.
 If you are playing in a hall, a caller will have already been chosen. The caller is the person who selects balls that have numbers and letters written on them. He or she calls the number-letter combination out to the players.
 Each player should have at least one card. You can also play with multiple cards at a time. While this is harder than just playing with one card, it increases the chances that you will win. Making sure everyone has the same amount of chips is not necessary because you can always take more chips.
 This is your easiest placement as it is free and does not require a number to be called for you to cover it. For US players, the free space is generally located in the center of the card.
 You can purchase a spinner from a toy or game store. To save money, you can also place all of the balls in a bucket and mix them around. The caller should select a ball without looking at the bucket.

 For the poppy chow, you’ll need 8 cups (64 g) of plain, popped popcorn. Pour it into a large bowl, making sure to pick out any unpopped or burnt kernels.You can prepare the popcorn yourself or use a bag of microwave popcorn as long as it’s not buttered.
 To make it easier to coat the popcorn, place 1 ½ cups (188 g) of powdered sugar into a large plastic bag with a zipper. Set the bag aside until you’re ready to add the popcorn.Use a gallon (3.7 l) plastic bag or larger to be sure that there’s enough room to add the popcorn later.
 Add 1 cup (250 g) of peanut butter and ½ cup (90 g) of chocolate chips to medium size microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture in the microwave in 30 second intervals until it is melted completely. It typically takes between 1 to 2 minutes.Smooth peanut butter works best for the poppy chow.
You can use whatever type of chocolate chips that you prefer, such as milk, semisweet, or bittersweet.
Make sure to stir the peanut butter and chocolate chips after each 30 second interval so the mixture melts evenly.
 When the peanut butter and chocolate are completely melted, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl. Stir well to ensure that it’s fully combined.Adding the vanilla is an optional step. You can omit it if you prefer.
 When the peanut butter and chocolate mixture is fully blended, add it to the bowl with the popcorn. Stir the mixture with a spatula or wooden spoon to ensure that the popcorn is fully coated., After the popcorn is covered with the chocolate mixture, add it to the bag with powdered sugar. Seal the bag, and shake the popcorn well to coat it with the sugar. Pour it into a bowl and serve immediately.Store any leftover poppy chow in an airtight container. It should keep for up to 2 days.

 This is important, as to sew this cloak correctly, you'll need how to do basic sewing.;
, Double this and add 1/2" to the height for sewing seams and the width of the cat's back. Write down the outcome as "length" on a piece of paper.
 Double this and add 1/2" (1.27cm) to the length for sewing seams. Write down the new measurement on the same sheet of paper as "width".
 Add 2" (5cm) to the measurement. Whatever the measurement outcome is, that's how much elastic you'll need. You'll also need to write the measurement down to avoid forgetting it. You'll also need to allow enough additional elastic to make ties for the elastic, so it's better to get too much than too little. If you have a piece exactly that size, stitch non-elastic grosgrain ribbon or seam binding ties to the ends.
 Double check the list before you leave the store to ensure all of the supplies.

If you use a zigzag stitch, you can go right to the edge and the width of the stitch inwards - this is very secure and prevents unraveling.
, Enjoy!

 Make sure they don’t have brown leaves and that they look healthy and green.;
, Although you can buy special strawberry pots that have multiple openings, it is not necessary. Strawberries can grow and produce fruit in any container that has good soil and gets enough sunlight.
 Your strawberry pot should have at least an 18” diameter. Even though strawberries have shallow roots, they do produce runners that need some space to extend.
 Then make 5 or 6 mounds of soil about 1” (25.4 mm) tall. Space the mounds at least 6” (152.4 mm) apart so the runners will have room to roam. The mounds themselves shouldn’t be more than 3” (76.2 mm) wide.
 If necessary, cut the pot with scissors if the plant is wedged in too tightly. Carefully shake off the extra soil while separating the delicate roots with your fingers.
 Soak the strawberry roots for an hour, so they can absorb enough to keep them hydrated.
 Arrange the roots so they extend down the sides of the mounds.
 The stems emerge from the crown, so don’t bury it under the soil.
 Use a sprinkler can so you do not erode the soil. Continue to water gently until the pot begins to drain. (Add more soil if necessary—the thorough watering will often collapse air pockets and reduce the soil level.)

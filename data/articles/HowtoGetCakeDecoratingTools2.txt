 Instead of looking for tools piecemeal, many websites, such as Overstock, Amazon and BirthdayDirect sell kits that include tips, disposable pastry bags, couplers, food coloring and instructions.
 This website offers an online store where you can buy basic or ornate cake decorating supplies. You can also find a Wilton app, recipe ideas, decorating ideas and more.
 These stores are regularly supplied with good quality bakeware, spatulas, kitchen utensils and seasonal baking items. You may need to return at regular intervals as they get new stock.
 You may find the lowest prices on individual items because of the large number of sellers. Look for items that have low shipping costs, to reap the most benefit.
 If your local store does not have this section, go online to find a wide variety of regular and novelty baking items.
 Visit DHgate, theBakersKitchen, CKProducts and AvalonDeco to compare prices on large quantities of tools.
 While you will not find all the essential products, you may be able to find spatulas, frosting, food coloring and piping bags for a last minute decoration. Supermarkets also sell cake decorating products intended for ease of use, such as spray frosting with decorative tips.

 There's nothing more annoying than losing an argument because you simply can't find any holes in your opponent's case. Adopting tactics meant only to be annoying will simply help, but backing those up with a solid argument will add that much force to your side of the discussion and help you achieve your victory.;
, If you don't notice even the smallest of details, you're not going to be able to provide a good counterargument. You'll be outrun with your opponent's arguments, and you'll fall short. Instead, observe everything. Pay attention and challenge their claims. Make sure to take note of slip ups, false information, and downright lies. Another common thing to look out for is the changing of subject, whether subtle or ludicrously obvious. This is always a great thing to fuel you while you rip into your opposition. If it's via internet (rather than face-to-face) you may find note taking on paper will help.
 Using incorrect information or made-up facts puts holes in your reasoning and hinders the strength of your argument. It's particularly bad if you're calling out your opponent for the very same things. Before entering an argument, make sure you've done your research and have a ready arsenal of facts and citations to fall back upon.
 Don't fall into the trap of being hypocritical. Make sure you stick to your own rules. Ask yourself: Is this argument related? Does it make sense? Does it matter at all? But most importantly, ask yourself: Will this bring the argument forward, and do I want this to happen at the current stage? Remember: There's an art to arguing well, and it needs to be learnt.
 Persistence is key, so you should come out on top, but don't leave it with a sloppy, rubbish ending. Make sure you get your point across. You want to rub your win into their face.

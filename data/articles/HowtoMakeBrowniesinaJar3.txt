 Alternate between a light/white ingredient and a dark ingredient for the best appearance. The gift will look more appealing with alternate ingredient layers showing through.


Place the chocolate chips and nuts toward the top of the jar for a more decorative appearance.
 Finish up by adding garnishments (ribbon, tag, etc.). Tie the recipe onto the label using ribbon or string, perhaps around the lid or neck of the jar.
 You can either wrap the gift or slip it inside a gift bag for giving.

If you want to make the drive, there is a parking garage for you to leave your car., The USPTO maintains branch locations of its Public Search Facility with CD-ROM databases of registered trademarks and marks pending registration. They do not include design elements, however. Call 800-786-9199 to find out the closest location., The TSDR database will have information on whether the mark is currently registered or its registration has lapsed. You'll need the registration or serial number of the mark in question to search TARR. This is more useful if you already know of a name that is undergoing the application process. You will be able to track whether it is accepted or rejected.

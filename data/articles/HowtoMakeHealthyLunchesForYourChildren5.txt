 Examples of healthy proteins you can serve your children are eggs, peanut butter, fish, nuts, dry beans, and chicken. Children under the age of 6 should eat a minimum of 2 servings of protein, and children between the ages of 6 and 11 should eat between 5 and 6 servings of protein.


Spread peanut butter or hummus on whole grain bread, or serve it to your children to use as a dip for their favorite fruits and vegetables.

 As a general rule, the more colorful your vegetables, the better. The important part is not which colors — but the variety of multiple vegetables with every meal. Aside from nutritional benefits, a diet that prominently features veggies can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which is an important component of reducing painful arthritis symptoms.


Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage include compounds that may be especially helpful in reducing pain in your joints.
 Spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and bok choy can also help protect your cells from damage that is otherwise accelerated by arthritis. They also contain nutrients like calcium, and also help reduce inflammation.


Onions, garlic, leeks, and shallots can also provide healthy antioxidants and potentially relieve inflammation.
 These hues actually indicate the presence of natural chemical components that can help your body fight the symptoms of arthritis. Sweet potatoes, carrots, and squash are all great. Peppers (of any color) are especially helpful in protecting your bone and cartilage health.


Work at least a ½ cup of red peppers into your diet every day.
 The way you cook your vegetables is important, as it can affect the nutrients you derive. Steaming veggies with a small amount of water is the best method to preserve nutrients. Sautéing is okay, but definitely avoid deep frying your veggies., Tart cherries are one of the wonder foods when it comes to minimizing your arthritis symptoms. They have both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and may even offer pain-relief comparable to that provided by popular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDs).Mix some with almonds and carry them around to snack on during the day.


Strawberries, red raspberries, and dark grapes can also help diminish arthritis symptoms. These are all best consumed fresh, perhaps mixed with Greek yogurt and whole grains or nuts.

 One technique that sometimes works to soothe a colicky baby is using white noise to distract the baby. This can be the noise of a vacuum cleaner or a dryer.


It is important to note that the baby should not be placed on the dryer in their carrier seat as this is not safe.
 Try playing some soothing music for the baby, like classical or lullabies.


The crying baby is also likely to respond to quiet singing in the background or a lullaby that has melodic strains. Other babies may also enjoy listening to the sound of nature.
It is advisable to experiment with different music and sounds in order to find out what helps to calm the baby and what they like.
 Try to create a calm and a quiet environment for the baby. Some babies experience colic as a result of a noisy, stressful environment. A lot of activity in the house can over-stimulate the baby causing her to cry., Bright lights can also over-stimulate the baby, as they may be unable to stop gazing at them. Any bright lights in the house should be dimmed, as this will help the baby to relax and settle down.
 It is advisable to avoid smoking near the baby or in the house. Studies have shown that second hand smoke can cause health issues in babies, including colic. In cases where one of the parents is smoker, it is advisable to smoke outside the house.

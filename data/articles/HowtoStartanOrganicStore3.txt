 To run a store, you will need to hire employees—everyone from sales associates to cashiers to bookkeepers. You can run most of the official “behind the scenes” business yourself if you so desire, but you will need at least minimal help attending to your customers.
 Given the high cost of organic goods, it is only natural that you would expect the price of goods in your store to cost more than the price of goods in a non-organic store. That said, money talks, and if the amount of money you demand for your goods is too grating on your customers’ ears, they will buy from someone else. Gauge what your prices should be by looking at the prices set by other nearby organic stores. If no other organic stores exist nearby, then gauge how much profit a non-organic store makes on each item it sells and roughly base your pricing on that, erring on the low side when in doubt.
 Advertise online or in print. Place an ad in the newspaper, distribute flyers around town, or place signs up advertising an opening sale. If possible, consider passing around a limited number of coupons to draw potential customers into the store. Focus your efforts in areas you expect your client base to gather, including farmer's markets or other organic shops that specialize in a different type of product.
 Industry trade shows allow you to network with others in the business. These other organic entrepreneurs can give you advice, put you in contact with good suppliers, or give you an avenue to showcase your product. These trade shows also offer classes and workshops that can give you more of the knowledge you need to make your business thrive.

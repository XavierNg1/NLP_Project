 The front of your paper (the side you want to show in the end) corresponds to the blue side of the paper in the photo. The hidden back of the paper is white in the photo.






;
, Be sure to crease your folds crisply.
, Turn the paper over and fold in half into a triangle. You should see the back of your paper. Unfold and repeat along the other diagonal.
 You should see the diagonal creases create "valleys" and the perpendicular creases create "mountains".
 Allow the valley creases to meet in the middle. By flattening two opposite sides, you should find yourself with a square that is open on the bottom. Make sure your square is rotated so that the opening is on the bottom, as shown in the picture. (Now you've made the square base.)








,,,, In doing so, you return to having a square with an opening facing down.
 As you fold, note the four diagonal creases on the inside that you made earlier. You will need to reverse the two creases on the upper flap. To reverse a crease, fold it in the opposite direction that it naturally folds. Bring the outer edges to the middle and flatten, so that you have a diamond.
 Now you've finished your bird base! Perhaps try making a crane now.

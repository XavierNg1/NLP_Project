 Using a microfiber cloth is a great way to clean your Ugg slippers on a regular basis. Simply run the microfiber cloth across the surface of the slippers, being careful not to press too hard to fray the suede or sheepskin material.Depending on how often you wear your Ugg slippers, you should do this approximately once every two weeks.;
, Use a suede brush to gently brush the Ugg slippers about once every week or so. Brushing your slippers regularly will help clean off any existing dust and dirt, while also preventing them from getting dirtier over time.Gently stroke the suede all over the entire slippers. Try to move in the same direction all the way around to avoid making any irregularities in the fabric.
 Spray a small amount of cleaning solution on a sponge. You can purchase one directly from UGG – like the UGG Sheepskin Cleaner and Conditioner – or use another product that works for suede or sheepskin material. Use the sponge to gently dab at the surface of the slippers and clean away and dirt or other residue.After cleaning, be sure to let the slippers dry completely before wearing them again. You should let them dry for at least 24 hours in a cool place out of direct sunlight.

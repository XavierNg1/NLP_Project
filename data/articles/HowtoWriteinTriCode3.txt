 Writing and reading use different parts of your brain. Just because you can write Tri Code well doesn't mean you can read it well., You'll already know the meaning of messages you write yourself, so a practice partner is necessary to improve your Tri Code reading. This way, you'll have no idea what the message is and will have to decode it completely to find out.


You might be able to find practice partners at a local or school cryptography club, or online through cryptography websites.
If you have difficulty finding a practice partner, you might be able to find Tri Code messages from amateur cryptologists online.
 A page completely full of Tri Code can be overwhelming and lead to you getting discouraged. Start with short messages and, as reading becomes easier, increase the length of your messages little by little.Eventually, you should be able to read even large portions of Tri Code without difficulty.


You can be more consistent with your practice by setting clear daily and weekly goals. For example, an early goal might be writing three short sentences daily in Tri Code. A more advanced goal might be something like writing a full journal entry in code.
 When you brain has to do something new or challenging, it takes a lot of mental energy. Practicing Tri Code too often can lead you to feel fatigued or mentally exhausted. If you start feeling worn out, give your brain a rest day to recharge.Doing enjoyable activities, like playing games and reading books, can also help your brain to relax.

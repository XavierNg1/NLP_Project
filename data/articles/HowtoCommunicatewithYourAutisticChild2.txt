 Say their name so they know you're talking to them (and not to someone else).Wait for them to look at you or in your direction.


Autistic people "zone out" sometimes. Say their name again if you need to, or walk into their field of vision and try again. If they are reading a book or watching a show, ask them to pause first.
If you aren't sure, it's okay to ask "Are you listening?" If they say yes, then keep talking.
 Parents have found it helpful to speak to their autistic child the same way they would speak to the child's non-autistic siblings or classmates. Use full sentences and explain things as needed (for example, explaining that something is upsetting you).


Some therapists recommend speaking in simplified sentences such as "want ball." However, this can be vague and confusing to the child.
 Questions like "How was your day?" may be confusingly broad, and your child may not know where to start. "How did science class go?" allows them to narrow in and figure out how to answer you., Sarcasm, idioms, and rhetorical questions may be confusing to autistic children, who tend to take things literally. Introduce these when your child is ready, and be aware of the possibility of misinterpretation.
 The right to express boundaries is important (especially for disabled children, whose desires may be walked over by well-meaning adults). It can also help prevent frustration buildup or aggression.


Some autistic children hit because they don't know how to say no, or because people do not listen to them when they say no.

 Your dog may be licking to act out or because of stress caused by changes.Is there a new dog in the house, or even a new pet or baby? Is the dog not getting its usual amount of daily attention? It may be as simple as restoring a routine or spending more time with your dog. Give the dog extra attention until normalcy is restored.
 Sucking and licking blankets and furniture can be a sign that the dog was weaned too early. It is a common feature in bottle-raised puppies.Early intervention is necessary to prevent it from becoming a life-long habit. You can try:


Giving the puppy a variety of other toys to chew and play with.
Designating a blanket for them to suck on. Praise them when they use this blanket and only this blanket.
Physically moving them away from the object.
 If your pet is licking furniture while you are out, it could be separation anxiety. Leave a TV or radio on while you leave. Make sure they have plenty of toys to play with while you are gone.Before you leave, give them a toy filled with treats or peanut butter. They will spend time trying to lick out the peanut butter and may forget that you left them at all., Compulsive behaviors can be difficult to break without the proper training. Try to find a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a board-certified veterinary behaviorist, or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT). They will be able to find the root of your dog's behaviors while practicing safe methods to treat the habit., If all else fails, talk to the expert. Your dogâ€™s licking could be the result of allergies, fleas, or obsessive compulsive disorder.While it is possible to medicate a dog for such behavior, this should be treated as a last resort and it's much better to find some behavioral changing methods first.

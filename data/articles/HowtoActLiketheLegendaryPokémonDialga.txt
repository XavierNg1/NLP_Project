, To do this, maybe take up singing as a hobby, or going to a private singing lesson. Also, go in plays and get a role in the play where you yell a lot. It's a good excuse for practicing on yelling really loudly, ferociously, and furiously, especially when you get to practice your lines at home (but don't yell too loud or you may get in trouble and anger or annoy people).
 This way, you can save your loud stomp for when you're really angry, and avoid getting in trouble until you unleash your rage by stomping really loud!

, Then unleash your furious rage. Also, be calm but slightly impatient and demanding.
 Take a martial arts class and be very strong (see Step 1).
, Enjoy life to the fullest.
 Wear lots of jewelry, if you are a girl. For guys, wear only a bit of jewelry if you want to.

 Bring your hair back into a comfortable ponytail. Secure with a hairband.
 Point the ponytail at the ceiling and twist it into a tidy coil, starting from the base.
 Bring the ponytail tip back down and tuck it under the base of the twist.









If you have long hair, you may need to fold and tuck your hair several times as you twist., Secure the whole thing in a jaw clip.

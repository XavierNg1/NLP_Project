 Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (220 C). Move the racks of the oven, so one rack is in the center. Put a 10-inch (25 cm) cast-iron skillet in the center rack of the oven as it heats.Heating the pan will give the cornbread a crisp crust.
 Get out a large mixing bowl and place 1 cup (120 g) of yellow cornmeal and 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour in it. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and whisk them completely. You'll need to add:1/2 cup (100 g) sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

, Get out a medium-sized mixing bowl and melt 3 tablespoons of butter in it. Add 3/4 cup (172 g) of sour cream, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of buttermilk, 2 large eggs, and 2 tablespoons canola oil. Whisk the wet ingredients until they're combined., Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula to stir them together. Stir until the dry ingredients are totally mixed in and you can't see any flour.Avoid over mixing the batter or the cornbread could become coarse and tough.
 Wear hot pads and take the hot skillet out of the oven. Put the remaining tablespoon of butter in the skillet and tilt the pan, so the butter melts and greases the pan. Spread the batter in the pan., Return the skillet to the oven and bake the cornbread for 20 minutes. A tester or toothpick should come out clean once the cornbread is finished. Remove the skillet from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes in the skillet. You can serve the cornbread from the skillet.If you'd like to put the cornbread on a serving plate, just flip it out onto a large plate and flip it back over. Slice the cornbread and serve it from the plate.

This is an American Crow
This is a Common Raven;
, The Common Raven is approximately 25 inches (63.5 cm) long, with a wingspan of 40 to 59 inches (101.6 to 149.9 cm). That is about twice the size of the average American Crow, or about the size of a red tailed hawk.
 Both crows and ravens have iridescent feathers, however crows may have a slight greenish tint to theirs, and a raven's will be more of a bluish shine.
 A crow's tail feathers are all the same length, so when the crow is in flight the tail will look squared off. A raven's tail has a longer middle feather, and it is more in the shape of a wedge.
 These are especially prominent when they are vocalizing.
 Where a crow's beak is fairly short and slightly curved along its entire length, a raven's beak is longer and straight until the tip where it curves downward.
 The American Crow makes the well known "caw" noise, which is repetitive. A raven's most commonly used vocalization is deeper and is more of a croaking sound.
 Crows are found in large colonies, while ravens are more solitary. You will probably only find one or two ravens together at any one point in time.

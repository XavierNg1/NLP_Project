 This is another classic. Wait until your brother is sound asleep. This works best if he's on his back, with both of his arms out. Then, carefully squeeze a bunch of whipped cream in one of the palms of his hands. (If you really have no mercy, then you can use shaving cream, instead!) Then, use a feather or something small and light to gently brush against his face. He'll reach the hand with the whipped cream out, quickly getting the stuff all over his face!


If you want to make sure this works every time, you can put whipped cream in both his hands!

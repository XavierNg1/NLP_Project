 Add the 1/4 cup of milk.
 Continue blending until you can see that the banana slices have been cut into small pieces.
 Add more liquid, if needed, to make a creamy texture.
 If wished, add another tablespoon of peanut butter while pouring; it will create a swirl in the glass.
 Add a straw and serve immediately.

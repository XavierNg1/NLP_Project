 A pilonidal cyst is a bump that pops up at the top of the cleft of the buttocks. The pilonidal cyst can get infected and turn into an abscess, which means it will fill with pus and need to be drained.A pilonidal cyst usually occurs due to ingrown hairs or other debris trapped beneath the skin.
 Pilonidal cysts occur most commonly in men in their twenties and thirties. They also can occur in people who have to sit a lot and have sedentary jobs, such as truck driving and office work.Pilonidal cysts also occur more commonly in people with a lot of body hair or with coarse, stiff hair. These types of hair can puncture a cyst more easily.
Other risk factors include being overweight or obese, if you have recently experienced local trauma or irritation, a deep natal cleft (the groove between the buttock), or if there is a family history of such disease.
 If a pilonidal cyst is not infected, there are usually no significant symptoms; however, if an imbedded hair punctures the cyst, either because you are sitting too much, wearing tight clothing, or some other unknown factor, the cyst can become infected. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should see a physician as soon as possible. When the cyst becomes infected, you may experience:Swelling
Pain
Redness
Drainage with a nasty odor
Fever
Formation of a cavity which may contain granulation tissue, hair, and debris

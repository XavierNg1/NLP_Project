 Once a vehicle is reported stolen, a LoJack systems transmit an inaudible radio signal from the installed LoJack unit to the local police to track the vehicle's position. This signal is powerful enough to transmit through parking garage and tunnel walls, dense foliage, and ship containers, but police cars, airplanes, and helicopters must be equipped with special computer equipment to track the signal. If you work or frequently travel in covered areas, buying a LoJack system will benefit you.

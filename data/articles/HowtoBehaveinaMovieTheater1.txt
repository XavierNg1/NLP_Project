 Make sure to get to the movie theater with enough time to park your car, buy snacks, use the bathroom, find your screen, choose seats, and get settled. Adjust your arrival time if you are seeing a recently released movie or if you’re attending at peak hours. This means longer lines and a crowded theater. , Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the movie is disruptive. Make sure to locate the bathroom closest to your movie theater before entering. Even if you use the bathroom beforehand, you may need to go again during the movie. Knowing the quickest route will get you in, out, and back in your seat quickly.
 Notifying your friends and family that your phone will be turned off for the next few hours shows respect and maturity. It also helps to avoid disruptions during the movie., Place any last-minute calls and end unfinished text message conversations outside of the movie theater. Talking or texting on your mobile phone during the movie is irritating and rude. This is especially true in 3D movies that require the use of special glasses that react to certain bright lights. , If you’re seeing a movie with a group of friends or family members, offer to stand in the concession line. This shows your generosity and helps keep the group organized. While you stand in line, your companions can use the bathroom, save seats in the theater, and get settled. It also makes their experience more enjoyable and they will be more likely to invite you for another movie.


Make sure to take the group order and ask for money before getting in line. Trying to organize while in the concession line will slow down other movie goers who already know what they want.

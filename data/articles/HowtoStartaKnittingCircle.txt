 Make a list! Write down who you would like to join the group. Then cross off anyone you know that can't and call around to see who else is willing. If you're starting a group to make new friends, decide on who you'll be accepting. Will you take first timers or pros only? Will you give lessons?;
, This should be a place where everyone can go. Make sure your friends all have rides, and if not, consider carpooling. A place like a local library or a rentable room would be great. If you're starting the group to make friends, find a public place, and make sure that space is available.
 Here's what needs to be decided on: Where will you meet? Will you have to have fundraisers to pay rent? Will you serve food and drink? Will you give lessons? Who will you accept? Whoa! That's way too much to think about, right? Just answer one question at a time as you go along.
 If you're starting the group for new friends, you will need to advertise to let people know where and when your group is meeting.
 Once you've let your member know that you're meeting (preferably by e-mail) and the place you're meeting, you're ready to meet. Welcome them and start knitting and serving food if you've decided to do so.

 First decide if you want to go somewhere inside your country or outside your country. Decide if you want to stay in a hotel (alone or with your wife; etc) or stay at a family member who lives in that particular destination (city/country).;
, Sometimes, you will just have thoughts coming up. There may be thoughts like the 'it is too expensive' or your mum is telling you to stay with a particular family member who you don't like (the family member is too talkative or you don't get on with him/her). These are problems which will cause you to rethink your trip. Think about these things before you do the booking.

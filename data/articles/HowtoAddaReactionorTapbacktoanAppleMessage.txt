 If you're using a mobile device, you'll need iOS 10 at least, but the newer, the better. If you have an Apple Watch, you'll need at least the watchOS update 3.0 that was released in September 2016! On a computer, you'll need to update to macOS Sierra.;

Be careful. You can't react to messages from the Quick Post push notification bar set-up.

, You'll see a range of icons next to and above the message you clicked on: a heart, a thumbs up hand, a thumbs-down hand, a "ha ha" (for funny), two exclamation marks (for excitement or critical) and a question mark for (for wondering or questioning).



If you're in a group message and aren't sure who sent what reaction, just click on the icon (heart, thumbs up, question mark, etc). This will open a strip at the top of the screen that shows you who sent each reaction.
 Once you see the message present you with a blue bubble in the top right corner, your reaction was recorded. They'll instantly see a little grey bubble appear on the upper corner of the message showing the icon you picked. Your verification of the reaction being recorded however, will appear to be blue instead.

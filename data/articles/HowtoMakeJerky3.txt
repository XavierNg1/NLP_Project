 Place the salmon on freezer-safe trays or plates and freeze for 45 to 60 minutes.


This step is not essential, but partially freezing the fish will make it easier to cut. You do not want the fish to be completely frozen, however.
If working with frozen salmon, let the salmon thaw in the refrigerator for a few hours and start working with it once it becomes soft enough to cut into.
 Combine the soy sauce, molasses, lemon juice, pepper, and liquid smoke in a 1 gallon (4 L) resealable plastic bag.


Seal the bag closed and give it a gentle shake to mix the ingredients well.
 Remove the salmon from the freezer and use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the salmon into thin strips.


Make each strip roughly 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3.175 to 6.35 mm) thick. The thinner the strip, the quicker it will dehydrate into jerky.
 Transfer the strips of salmon to your bag of marinate and let sit for 2 to 3 hours, giving the fish plenty of time to absorb the flavor.


Seal the bag and toss gently to coat all of the salmon.
Leave the salmon in the refrigerator as it sits in the marinade.
 Set the dehydrator to a medium setting roughly 10 minutes before you intend to use it.
 Drain any excess marinade from the salmon using a colander.


Pat the fish dry using clean paper towels.
 Place the strips of salmon onto dehydrator trays in a single layer.


Once done, return the dehydrator trays to the dehydrator.
 Let the salmon dry for 6 hours checking it. It will be done once it feels completely dry to the touch.


If the salmon jerky is not quite done at 6 hours, continue dehydrating it up to another 6 hours, checking every 30 to 60 minutes.

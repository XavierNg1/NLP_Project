 Most servers will kick you for having a certain negative score, sometimes it's when you reach -20, sometimes -30, or -40. If you know the breaking point, you can go kill some enemy for a while, then come back to TK your team without being kicked.;
, Best kit for aircraft T-King is anti-tank. Generally, one AT missile will destroy a waiting aircraft. If you can, destroy the aircraft when your teammate is running towards it, but not close enough to be killed by the explosion, so you won't get as many negative points. The annoyance factor to him is, of course, the same, perhaps better if he can see that Su-34 blow up before his eyes.
 Give them a little time to get away, then hit the detonator for that "WTF??" factor.
 Ask your teammate how they feel about not getting the jet or being about to take the enemy base when you let the C4 off. After all, this is all for the fun of it, right?

, Ideally, find a map location where it is hard for them to reach you (for Gulf of Oman, use the helicopter to get atop the oil tank for MEC base, or get in the superstructure for the carrier). The same strategy, of course, is useful when you are camping the enemy base.
 But you need to die eventually, or you'll run out of missiles, right? (Using a tank or APC to continue your reign of chaos is OK, but you become an easier target for both team mates and the enemy).
 Make sure to fire off the UAV in the middle of the ocean for additional annoyance.
 Once you annoy your team sufficiently, switch teams and give the other guys a little headache time. They won't see it coming, and it balances out the game.

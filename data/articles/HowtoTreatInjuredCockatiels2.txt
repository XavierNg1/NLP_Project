 No matter what the injury is, you want to get the cockatiel to the vet as soon as possible. However, you need to stabilize the bird first to make sure it doesn’t go into shock or bleed out. While you treat your bird, stay calm. Your bird can sense if you are panicking or upset, which can add more stress to them.Don’t allow other family members or pets around the bird. Keeping others away helps keep the bird calm.
 If your bird has gotten injured or you spotted blood, examine the bird’s entire body. Be careful as you look for the wound or the source of the bleeding., For wounds on the skin, use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution or a solution made of Betadine and sterile water. Gently wipe around the bleeding wound using a cotton ball, gauze, or cotton swab covered with the solution.If it is a surface scratch that isn’t bleeding, just put some antibiotic ointment on it and let it heal.
 If your bird is bleeding, press gauze or a paper towel against the wound. The pressure should help stop the bleeding. You apply pressure for skin, nail, or beak bleeding., If pressure doesn’t stop the bleeding, you can use a substance to help stop it. Try cornstarch or flour on a moist cotton swab to help stop the bleeding.You can also use styptic powder or a styptic stick.
If you use any of these substances to stop bleeding on the bird’s face, make sure you don’t get it in their eyes, nose, or mouth.
 If the bleeding does not stop, then you must take your bird to the vet. Once you've put the powder on, check to make sure the bleeding stopped and put the bird's cage in a quiet, calm spot so that it can relax and heal. Again, speak to it calmly and quietly with affection and care.

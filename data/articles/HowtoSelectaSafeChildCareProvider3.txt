 Ask the prospective care provider:


Do you have children? If so, how many and what are their ages?
Are you married? (This is particularly important if a home-based provider.) For how long? Does your spouse help out with the children? (This is important even in a commercial care provider business.)
Have you or your spouse, or children, ever been arrested for any reason, ever? Has anyone living in your home ever spent time in prison?
How many children do you care for? How many are related to you?
Do you allow other children's parents to help care for the children you watch? What are their names?

, Whether a private residential care provider or a commercial business, and whether or not the provider ever intends to transport your child anywhere, the vehicles you see on the premises should be in excellent condition, with no spare parts lying around. Should a situation cause an evacuation of the provider's location, you'll want to know that vehicles which may be used to transport your child are in working order and equipped with the necessary equipment before you sign your child up.


Examine the exterior and interior of the vehicles you see as if you planned to purchase the vehicle.
Look for signs of dangerous wear on the tires, broken or missing mirrors, broken or missing seats or seatbelts, and oil leaks on the ground under vehicles.
While you're looking, check for children's toys under or around the vehicles. (Children are attracted to toys and are likely to go under and around cars in order to grab up a discarded toy. You want a provider who keeps all debris away from vehicles at all times.)
Ask the carer what he or she does to ensure that no child is in the driveway when vehicles are in use.

At this point you can turn off the vacuum.When placing down-pillows or down-comforters into the bag, don't empty all of the air from the bag. Only compress the air in the bag to fifty percent its original size, as further compression will damage the down feathers.
 Once you have finished vacuum sealing the bag, remove the vacuum hose from the valve and close the lid on the bag. This will prevent any air from escaping the bag., You can store space saver vacuum bags on a smooth and flat surface, such as a closet, cupboard, or under a bed.

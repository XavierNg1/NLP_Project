 If you're a newbie to the Spider Solitaire scene, you'll want to start off with one suit. It's not shameful -- two-suit and four-suit are hard. Once you get accustomed to one-suit, you can move onto the harder versions.


A large part of this game is luck. If you get thrown bad sequences from the stock, you could be outta luck. Play a handful of games before you write off your skill.
 Pressing "H" tells Windows you could go for a little assistance. It'll then light up the next card you should move. Don't hit it freely though -- try to take a look as to why that was the best next move.


Try to limit yourself to a few hints each game. Relying on it too much prevents you from having to figure out patterns and strategy.
 Especially if you're doing four-suit solitaire, the undo button will be your best friend. Consider it "peeking." If you're not sure whether you should move a card or not, move it, see what's under it, and if it's not worth it, put it back!


Same goes for this button as the hint button. You don't want to depend on it, but it's good to have if you really, really need it!

, In the Windows version, you start out with 500 points. With every move you make, it subtracts a point. Then, if you win, it multiplies that score by 100. See if you can beat your own personal record next time!

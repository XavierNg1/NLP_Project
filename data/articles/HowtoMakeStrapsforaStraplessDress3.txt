 You may want thin spaghetti straps, or you may want straps that are a little thicker. Decide in inches how thin you want your straps. Keep in mind that a slightly thicker strap could give you more comfort and security if you are worried about your dress slipping down. If it’s a formal or elegant dress, you may want to sew thinner spaghetti straps.
If it’s a casual dress, you could go either way.
 This will be the measurement for the width of your fabric when you cut it. You need to multiply the number because you will be folding the fabric in half width-wise and sewing it to create your strap. For instance, if you want your straps to be half an inch thick, multiply this number by two and add ¼ of an inch so that your width will be 1¼ inches.
 According to your measurements for the width and length of your fabric, cut the fabric. You may want to cut along a ruler to make sure that you are cutting straight. For instance, say you calculated that you needed 20 inches (50.8 cm) of length for your strap and 1¼ inches of thickness. If you got a yard of fabric, cut a 20x1¼ inches rectangle. This will be the material you will use to make your strap.
 Since you are making two straps for your dress, cut another rectangle the same measurements as the first rectangle. You can lay the first rectangle you made over the fabric and cut around it if that makes it easier.

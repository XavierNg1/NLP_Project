 This is great when you're out shopping, at a party or anywhere else that music is playing. For example, SoundHound or Shazam.
 The app must installed on your smartphone and you'll need to be near the song so that the app can "listen" in with you and then identify the song for you. Once recorded, let the app do the detective work for you. With luck, you'll get a correct match and a link to download your own copy from iTunes or other music sites.

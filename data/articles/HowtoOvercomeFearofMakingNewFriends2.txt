 One way to start overcoming your fear of making new friends is to smile at people. This may seem simple, but making eye contact and smiling is a low-stakes form of interaction. You will probably find that most people smile back and even speak.You can add a “Hello” or “How are you?” to your smile to increase your social interaction.
 The more you talk to other people, the more you will feel comfortable interacting and making friends. Speak to people or compliment them on something. Ask someone a question when you are standing around, or start a conversation with someone at work, a cashier, or a classmate.For example, you may tell someone, “I like your jacket” or ask someone, “Have you eaten here before? What do you suggest?”
If the interaction isn’t a success, shake it off. This is low-stakes and doesn’t matter.
 Part of the fear of making new friends comes from being inside your head and dwelling on fears and unhealthy thoughts. Instead of obsessing over your thoughts, put your focus on the environment around you. Focus on the other people instead of yourself.This helps you not obsess about what you want to say, what you may have done wrong, or how you are acting. Focusing on the other person helps reduce your feelings of self-consciousness.
 If you have a bad social interaction or someone doesn’t seem like they want to be your friend, try not to let it bother you. There are many reasons a person may not respond positively. No matter what the reason, remember that it’s not the end of the world. You’ll just try again next time.A person may be having a bad day or be distracted, so their reaction to you may have nothing to do with you.

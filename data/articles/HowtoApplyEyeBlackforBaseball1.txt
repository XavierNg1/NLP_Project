, A lid to eye black is removed much in the same way you remove a lid from a stick of lip balm.



Place the stick on the outside of either eye. The starting point for your eye black should be on the cheek bone, right below the outside edge of your eye cavity.
Draw a horizontal line under your eye. From your starting point, draw a line approximately 1.25 inches (31.75 mm) across the base of your eye and end near the bridge of your nose.
Repeat the process of applying the eye black to your other eye.
 Make sure the eye black is uniform. Ensure that are no areas that need to be filled in with additional eye black.

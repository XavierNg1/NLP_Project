 If you have never used Graph Search before, activate this feature using this link: www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch. Once the page opens up, click on the “Try Graph Search” link.
 You may search for people, your friends, places, things, photos, pages, groups, apps, events, restaurants, and different kinds of entertainment such as music, movies or games.
 To be more specific and precise in your search method, which makes Graph Search perfect for this end, scroll down and select “Find all pages named ‘comedy’” or “Find all places named ‘comedy’” from the retrieved suggestions.
 The next screen after you click on either “Find all pages named ‘comedy’” or “Find all places named ‘comedy’” will enable you to do a more advanced graph search. On the right side of the page, you should see an advanced search box.


Click on the “SEE MORE FILTERS” link to customize your graph search using the filtering options there.
Select your preferences from the drop-down menu for each of those filtering options. Remember, your preferences will update the retrieved results automatically. If you do not select any option, you will see default results which are more general than if you had specified a preference.

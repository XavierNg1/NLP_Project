 The 800m start line is a curved line on the track. A good place to be is wherever you feel comfortable, often being next to someone you know is around the same ability can be helpful. Also remember to stay in your lane or you could be disqualified.;
, When the race begins you will feel like everyone is running too fast for you. Do not give up; everyone is feeling the same way, stick with the pack, and keep the strides long.
 After 200m the pace will have slowed, but not by much. Look good for the crowd on the 400m straight, and keep your eyes on the leader; when the bell rings, he will dart.
 It is long and hard, but do not give up. Pace yourself and take deep breaths.
 Begin to speed up the frequency of your step, while keeping the same stride length. In the last 100, always catch the person in front, pump the arms and know it will be over very soon.


During the last 200m it may seem as if you're moving your feet faster but not moving any faster while you accelerate, but in reality you are running faster but you are too tired to notice it.
 You want to stay tall and run in good for to preserve energy.
 You will have a greater chance of being a faster runner.

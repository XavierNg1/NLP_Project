 Flax seeds produce a gel that works wonderfully on curly, coarse or frizzy hair.It adds shine and tames flyaways. Flax seeds are available at most grocery stores and health food stores. Make sure you get raw, unflavored flax seeds that have not been toasted or flavored with spices.;
, Place both items in a small saucepan and heat them on the stove over medium high heat until the water comes to a rolling boil.
 Once the water and seeds have come to a boil, turn down the heat until the water slows to a simmer. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon and let it cook for 10 minutes. The seeds will start producing a gel.
 Continue cooking and stirring the liquid until the water has cooked down and reached the consistency of a gel. Keep cooking until it has the same consistency as aloe or a store-bought hair gel.


If your hair is extremely curly, you may find it easier to apply a looser gel. Take the gel off of the heat while it's still a little runny, so it will be easier to smooth through your hair.
If your hair is not curly, let the gel thicken as much as you want. It will provide a stiffer hold if you let it get thick.
 Pour the gel through cheesecloth into a bowl, or straight into the container you want to use to store it. If the gel is thick, you may have to squeeze it a bit to help it through the cloth. Continue straining until you've gotten as much of the gel through the cloth as you can, then throw away the cloth and the seeds.


Use a new pair of pantyhose if you don't have cheesecloth on hand.
 You can customize the gel to your preferences by adding a few drops of essential oil, aloe, or a moisturizing ingredient like liquid vitamin E. Stir the extra ingredients well so that they're distributed throughout the gel.
 Place the gel in a glass container with a lid and keep it in the refrigerator. It will keep for several weeks. Use on dry hair or smooth it through wet hair after a shower.

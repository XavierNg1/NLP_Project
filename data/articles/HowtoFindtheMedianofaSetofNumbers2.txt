 Again, use the same first step as the first method. An even set of numbers is going to have two numbers exactly in the middle.
 2 and 3 are both in the middle, so you need to add 2 and 3, then divide the sum by 2. The formula for finding the average of two numbers is (the sum of the two middle numbers) รท 2.
 The median of a sequence with even amount of numbers doesn't have to be a number in the sequence itself.

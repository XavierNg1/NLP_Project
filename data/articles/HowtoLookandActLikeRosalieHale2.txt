 Walk with elegance, and act like you know it all. And very importantly, walk gracefully - like a MODEL. Models walk with their chin up, back straight, and one foot lands in front of the other (not baby steps). That's how you should walk. To walk gracefully, sort of roll up from your heel to the bottom of your foot. Glance in mirrors at least 20 times a day. And when you do, stare at your self in the mirror, and occasionally smile at yourself, and tell yourself how beautiful you are. Even speak it out loud, Rosalie never held anything back. Be shallow, but not too shallow that you end up without any friends. But make people want to be like you. Wave at people you don't even know. Flirt with guys, and soon they will be following you like puppies.
 But don't talk too much or be loud or annoying, because that's not like Rosalie.
 You can be popular in some peoples eyes. And be an idol: don't cuss and don't bag on people behind their backs. Be nice, but mean if they mess with your family., And if people ask you why you have circles underneath your eyes say "none of your business." and walk away.
 But don't be too stuck-up and talk in a rich-kid voice. When your best friend gets hurt or they are going through a crisis, hold them tight, while acting like you're holding your breath, and cry with her.
, Every time you run or something, do it with all of your strength. Look hot at the same time.
 If someone upsets you, pretend you don't care. If you are mad about someone, act like you are a little bit interested. Be believable. Don't complain and mutter about it.
 And when somebody talks to you, act like they broke your train of thought. Also, when you're talking, talk with dignity and as if everything you say is a fact. Be sure to never say something that's not true, because then you'll look like an idiot, and Rose isn't an idiot.

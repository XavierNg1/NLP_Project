Many great games are exclusive to the Wii U, such as Mario Kart 8 and Bayonetta 2.
This system is aimed at "core" gamers rather than the family.  Many games such as Nintendo Land have the same family feeling as the ones on the Old Wii.
Many have initially said that the console is a flop.  This is up to you to decide, and whether you do still want the console.  Wii Us are actually really fun and bring the DS kind of gameplay onto the big screen, so you are in for the time of your life!
Wii stuff (Wii Remotes and Nunchuk, Balance Board, etc.) are perfectly compatible with the Wii U, and it is encouraged to have such. GameCube and 3DS don't have backwards compatibility or linking features, however, even if you use the built in Wii emulator.;
,  This could be Walmart, gaming stores, anywhere that would likely sell Wii U consoles.  If they sell PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, 99% of the time they will also sell Wii U consoles.,  Make sure that the Wii U you buy is brand new, and only to buy pre-owned consoles if you are ready to take risks such as broken and/or missing compartments.  There is a Standard and Deluxe set.  The Deluxe set will contain a black Wii U with Nintendo Land packaged in with some Wii Remote accessories, whereas the Standard only contains the white Wii U, the absolute necessities of accessories and nothing else.,  There should be heaps!  Unlike the 3DS, the Wii U is boring without games, so consider buying at least 2.  Also buy some Nintendo eShop gift cards to add credit to the online shop.,  Mario Kart 8 and/or Need for Speed players should consider buying a Wii Wheel accessory.

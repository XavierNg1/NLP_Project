 Spending time with your brother doing the things that he likes means he's less likely to bug you for attention when your friends are over or you're trying to do homework.


Try to schedule regular time together to play, go to the park, or just color pictures together.
 If you have multiple younger siblings, set them up to play a game with each other. That way, they will be preoccupied with each other instead of you. If they start arguing, politely step in and remind them that they are siblings, not enemies. Play with them for a few minutes until they seem like they are friends again, then go do whatever you were going to do.


You might set up a game of veterinarian with the stuffed animals, or set up a simple board game like Hi Ho Cherry-O or Shoots and Ladders.
 If you are trying to do something and he won't stop bothering you, ask him to draw you a picture or color a page for you in a coloring book. Make a big deal out of how much you want him to make you something, and he'll feel special while he makes it.


Be sure to thank him and hang the picture up on the wall in your room, so he knows you really do appreciate it.
 Make sure you tell him you love him regularly. It might seem cheesy, but he needs to know that you are there for him and care about him.


Try saying "Love you!" in the morning when your brother leaves for school or at night when you go into your rooms to sleep.

 You will probably have to do a monologue or a cold reading at your audition.


Prepare for a cold reading. A cold reading is when you receive an excerpt of the script at our audition and are asked to read for a specific role, either with the director or another person auditioning.
A monologue is a long line (almost like a paragraph) said by one character. You may have to choose a monologue from another show or you may be given a specific monologue to perform.
 During the cold reading, you may be given a bit of time to prepare. If this is the case, make sure to focus on long words or words that are hard to pronounce. When you perform the cold reading, remember to project and to face out. Use expression in your voice and feel free to use gestures and to move around the stage. Even though you probably won't have the chance to memorize any of the lines, try to look up from the script frequently so that the director can see your face. The cold reading is a good chance to try out a character voice or an accent, as long as it seems to fit the character. You might, however, want to ask the director first.
 If you are asked to perform a monologue, you will probably have the chance to practice it at home. If you have to choose one, choose one said by a character similar to the one you are hoping to get, but don't choose a monologue from the show you're auditioning for. Make sure you project and face out during your monologue!


Practice and practice again. Practice the monologue over and over again until it's memorized. This shows professionalism.
Use color. Color code your monologue according to the character's different emotions.
Including any movement. Add blocking and business (movement and gestures) to your performance.

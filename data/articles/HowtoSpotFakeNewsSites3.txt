 Fake news is often “recycled”; a popular fake-news story from five years ago may be resurrected by an unscrupulous site. Click through the links and sources in a potentially fake news article, and check the publication dates of every article. If a current article cites sources from a decade ago, the news is likely fake.Fake news can also circulate internationally. For example, a fake story could originate in the United States, die out over time, and be presented as “breaking news” in the UK three years later.
 Especially during national elections, fake news sites will publish information that plays directly into the hands of one political party. Fake news sites often accomplish this by playing into the fears of a specific group or political party, and relying on individuals in that party to believe the fake news that confirms their fears without evaluating the source for authenticity.This phenomenon is known as “confirmation bias”: individuals with strong beliefs are eager to read news that affirms those beliefs, and hesitant to believe sources that they disagree with.
 When something groundbreaking or surprising happens, multiple news outlets will report on it. If only one website is reporting on a newsworthy event, then it is unlikely that it is real., Websites such as Snopes and FactCheck.org will fact-check bogus news stories and report on their authenticity. Before you believe a suspicious-looking news article, check a “debunking” site. These sites have the time and resources to investigate news articles and their sources, and provide unbiased evaluations of news authenticity.When evaluating news, it can help to be a skeptical reader. Doubt claims that seem engineered to anger or shock you, and turn to sites like Snopes when in doubt.
Fake news is often engineered to appeal to irrational readers, so by methodically evaluating the news site and article, you can prevent yourself from believing falsities.

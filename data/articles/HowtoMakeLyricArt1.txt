 Select your favorite computer font and print out the letters you need for your project. Make sure you print the letters in size 72 or above. Once you have your letters, cut around them to create a box shape. Glue the letter onto a piece of cardstock. Wait for the glue to dry, then use an Xacto knife to remove the white border from your letter so only the letter remains.Fonts with straight lines work better than fonts with lots of intricate details.
Use your letter stencils to trace letters onto a piece of canvas and paint the letters different colors for a cool piece of lyric art.;
, To do this, you will need a pencil, an eraser, a ruler and some black markers of varying thicknesses. Using your ruler, draw three lines on your paper: a baseline, an x-height and a cap height. The base line is where you’d like your letters to sit. The x-height is how tall you’d like your lower case letters to be and your cap height is how tall you’d like your capital letters to be.Once your guidelines are drawn, make a rough sketch of all your letters. Do multiple drafts until you like the way one of them looks.
When you land on a draft you like, use your pencil to flesh out all the letters. Make sure you make each letter the same thickness.
Go over your letters with your black markers. Use your eraser to wipe away any remaining pencil lines.
 Start by finding an alphabet template online. Print out the letters and cut each letter with scissors or an Xacto knife. Trace each letter onto a piece of fabric. Cut the fabric letters out using fabric scissors or pinking shears.Pin your fabric to a piece of cardboard to keep it from moving while you trace and cut.
If you make your letters big enough, you can use the letters to create a banner.

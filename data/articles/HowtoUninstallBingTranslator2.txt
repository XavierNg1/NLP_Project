,, On this list, you will see Bing Translator. Click on it to select it. An “Uninstall” button will appear at the top center of the window.
 While Bing Translator is selected, click the “Uninstall” button at the top to start the process of uninstalling the program. A pop-up message will appear seeking your permission to continue with the process of uninstalling. Click “Yes” to confirm.
 When the process has finished, a pop-up dialog box will appear. In this box is a message informing you that the process has been completed successfully. It will also ask you to reboot your computer so that all files stored in the computer that were used by the program will be deleted. Click “Now” to reboot your computer. If, however, you do not want to reboot your computer now, you can click “Later” to postpone the rebooting.

 Do a quick, basic cleaning of the pipe by knocking out any loose resin and using a cotton swab to wipe or dislodge any large pieces of gunk. Rinse the pipe out with warm water. Do not use cold water, as the transition from cold to boiling water may break your pipe.
 Place it on the stove and bring to a boil. Reduce water to a simmer. Make sure there is enough water to cover the entire pipe, preferably by 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm) at least, to be safe.


A simmer is when there is a constant, but not extreme, cascade of bubbles breaking the surface of the water., Make sure that the pipe is fully submerged in water. As it boils, the water will evaporate, so keep your eye on it so ensure your pipe doesn't end up alone in a hot pan, which may crack it.
 Remove pot from heat, drain out the water, and inspect the pipe to check for any excess residue. The pipe will be extremely hot, so use an oven mitt and extreme care to check it. Never douse the hot glass in cold water -- this will cause it to shatter.


You may need to repeat this process with a fresh pot of clean water until the pipe is thoroughly cleaned.
 Take a cotton swab or pipe cleaner and wipe away any lingering residue. If there are water stains, soak your pipe for a few minutes in a mixture of lemon juice and 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of clean water and then let it air dry.

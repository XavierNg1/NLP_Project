 These are often applied to goods for sale that aren't able to take a sticky price tag. If you don't want to spend much, look for an item in a dollar store.

Try to keep a supply of these tag threads in a small container inside your craft box. That way, you can make as many of these as you like in the future.;
, When removing it from the item, cut it carefully. The aim is to cut the thread as close to the little fastener bump as you can, to make as much thread available for the project as possible.
 Hold one end of the plastic thread in the naked flame of a candle to create a ball.

Place the plastic in the area indicated in the image, the lower end of the flame closest to the candle. This is the area of highest temperature and will result in a lot less smoke than if you were to place the plastic thread higher up the flame.
Place a bowl of water near you in case you need to quickly extinguish any burning plastic (see Warnings below).
, The first bead will rest on the ball end you've just created, allowing you to keep threading on the rest of the seed beads.

About halfway, cross the plastic thread over and through a larger bead to keep the crossing in place (see the image for instruction).






Continue threading on the remaining beads until you get to the end of the plastic thread. (If you've used plastic instead of glass seed beads, the final bead should be made of glass, to prevent burning when melting the final ball.)
Hold the last beads in place by pinching with your fingers or using a pair of metallic tweezers.
 Use the method as described above for the first ball. Try to align the final length of this piece evenly, so that it fairly matches the other length. Done; it's now ready to place on your finger whenever you need to remember something!

 Clean and dress the fish as soon as it has been caught, then proceed to readying it for smoking. While preparing the smokehouse, etc., keep the fish on ice.
 Steaks are used for large fish, while keeping a fish whole with its collarbone intact can make it easier to hang in the smoke chamber. Cut accordingly.


If doing more than one salmon, consider selecting fish of an equal/similar size for best results.

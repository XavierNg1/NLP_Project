 Take the pan off the stove and move the mixture you've cooked into a bowl. Let it cool for at least 5-10 minutes, until the mixture is cool enough to be touched but still a bit warm.
 Use your hands or a knife to shape the mixture into bite-sized candies. You can make a circular shape, a cylinder, a cube, or whatever shape you want. You should make about 80 pieces.
 Use your hands to make sure each piece is lightly but evenly covered in sugar.
 Place each piece of candy in the center of a cellophane square and roll it into a cylinder or whatever shape you like, and tuck the ends of the cellophane into the roll.
 Enjoy this tasty candy during any time of day.

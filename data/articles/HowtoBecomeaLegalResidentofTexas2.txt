 Those wishing to become Texas residents in order to vote must first be citizens of the U.S.This can be done through natural birth within U.S. borders, birth abroad to U.S. parents, or naturalization. Naturalization is a process in which a citizen of another country becomes a citizen of the U.S. Whatever your path to citizenship, you will need documentation of your citizenship, whether that be a birth certificate or a certificate of naturalization.


Becoming a U.S. citizen can take some time. Naturalization requires 5 years of legal residence in the U.S., followed by an application process and a naturalization test. The test consists of questions on English, U.S. history, and civics.However, there is a strict limit on the number of people who can be permanent residents (those with green cards) and who can become citizens each year, so just because you want to apply and take the test does not mean you will be allowed to.
 While you do not need to show your ID to anyone to register to vote, the registration form asks for an driver's license or ID number and you will be required to show a form of ID when you actually go to vote. The forms of identification that are accepted at voting locations include:Texas driver license
Texas election identification certificate
Texas identification card
Texas license to carry permit
United States military identification card
United States citizenship certificate
US passport

, Pick up a voter registration application from any polling place or state office. Fill out the form and mail it in 30 days before a scheduled election.


On the application you will be asked your name, address, driver's license or ID number, if you are a U.S. Citizen, and various other identifying information, such as your date of birth.While voting is voluntary and not required to be a resident of Texas, it is something that only a resident can do.

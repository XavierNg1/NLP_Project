 It's your prerogative not to use Facebook but be aware that sometimes this may leave you out of the loop. You may feel the need to explain why you don't use Facebook (work privacy reasons, dislike of the site, bad past experience, etc.). However, you will still miss an element of social interaction.


You might be late to learn about your friends' vacation photographs, exciting news, and life changes. Remember to ask about many topics when you do get in touch.
 Tell your friends to contact you in whatever way you prefer. It is important to tell your friends how to reach you so that you're aware of anything they'd like you to know.


Depending on your age and friend group, calling, texting, or using other forms of social may be the best way to ask your friends to stay in touch. Consult your friends about a method of contact that works for them too.
Remember that people can be forgetful. Be prepared to remind forgetful friends that you're not able to read their updates on Facebook.
 Often people assume that everyone uses social media. When you meet someone new, they may want to add you on Facebook. Prepare to give out a phone number, email, or some other form of contact that you feel comfortable sharing.

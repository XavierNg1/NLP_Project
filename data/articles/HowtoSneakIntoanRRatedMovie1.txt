 Dress like you would if you were the right age to see the movie. (Girls, don't overdo it.) Don't wear high school logos on clothes (college and university logos are great, though - if you look like a college student, people automatically assume you're at least 17 or older). Guys - if you can grow a little facial hair, don't shave two days before the movie so you look older. Also, try to lower your voice to an older-sounding tone.
 Figure out what you're doing ahead of time. Practice your lines at home so you're comfortable saying them. For example, if you look over 17, pick a fake birthday ahead of time. The easiest way to catch someone lying about their age is by asking them about their birthday. If you stutter trying to think of a valid birthday, they won't let you in. If you look like you're 18, say your birthday was today and you left your ID at home.
 If you can, go with friends that are over 17. It makes it less obvious that you're under 17. Going with a friend might make it a bit less nerve racking if it is your first time sneaking in, and if you do get caught you're not alone.
 If you get caught sneaking in, don't panic! Make an excuse such as, "Oh, my parents are in there, I just had to go to the bathroom". Sound realistic when you do. If you get caught doing the movie switching method, a good excuse is "Oh, sorry! I guess I got the wrong entrance." You might want to look around while saying it to make it more realistic. Never run away if you get caught. That will not only anger whoever it is that chases you down, but also draws even more attention...possibly an ill-mannered manager. While making an excuse can save you from being caught, running immediately makes you look guilty and will have you kicked out of the theater.

 It's common to want the white, rubbery sole on Vans to look crisp and new, so it might take a little extra effort and extra supplies to return that fresh out-of-the-box look to your old Vans. This works for other canvas-style shoes, as well, like Toms or Keds.To clean the whites of your Vans, you can use a variety of household ingredients, like:


Bleach
Liquid nail polish remover (acetone)
Rubbing alcohol
Window cleaner
Magic eraser
Hydrogen peroxide
Baking soda and water
Lemon juice;
, Set out your shoes and cleaning product on a clean towel and use an old toothbrush or a shoe brush to apply the cleaner. If you're going to work inside with bleach, or some other cleaning product with the potential for staining, make sure you've got plenty of cover down.


Acetone and bleach need to be applied outside, probably, or in well-ventilated area.
 Using one of the serious above-described cleaners on the canvas of colored Vans will leave stains, which means you need to use some masking tape to cover the canvas, at least where it meets the sole.


Alternatively, some people think it looks cool to have bleach-spattered Vans. Your choice.
 Put a small amount of cleaner on your brush or old toothbrush and firmly buff the rubber sole of each Van, working in circles and loading the brush as needed. Work around the outside of the shoes, and the bottoms if you want.
 When you have done both shoes, wipe them over with either a paper towel or kitchen towel, slightly dampened with fresh water. Your shoes should be bright white on the rubber strips now.

 Deaf dogs can wander off or get into dangerous situations because they cannot hear. Likewise, if the environment is loud and busy, then even a dog with perfect hearing might get distracted and wander off. To keep your dog safe when you go out with him, make sure that you always keep him on a leash or inside of an enclosed area.You may still need to use a leash at some enclosed spaces, such as at a dog park. Otherwise, you may find it hard to communicate with your dog when there are so many distractions around.
 Within your home, you can take advantage of vibrations to get your dog’s attention. By knocking on a wall, stomping on the floor, or thumping on a table, you can get your dog’s attention from a different room in the house.If you want your dog to come when you create vibrations, then make sure that you praise and reward him for coming when you do these things.
You can also purchase vibration collars to get your dog’s attention. These collars vibrate gently when you push a remote control button.They are available in pet stores.
 Giving your dog a gentle touch on the back is also a good way to avoid startling him when you are nearby. Make sure that you touch your dog gently, such as by patting him softly on the head or softly stroking his back.For example, you might use gentle touch to alert your dog that you are in the room with him or that you are about to pass him in the hallway.
 If you are struggling to communicate with your dog, then you may want to schedule a session with a professional dog trainer. A professional dog trainer can help you to identify your dog’s challenges and find ways to help you communicate more effectively with your dog.

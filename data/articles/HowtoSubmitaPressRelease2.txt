 Make sure that your headline and the first paragraph, in particular, communicate that your content is newsworthy.



Generally, your contacts will prefer to receive news releases either by fax, mail or e-mail. Send your release the way that the publication wants it sent.
Don't worry too much about finding out which exact individual you should send your release to if you don't have a lot of time. Get the person's title right, and that should be sufficient.



Your release may need to coincide with an event or product launch. Otherwise, submit the release early in the week and early in the day.
Choose an atypical time, such as 9:08 a.m. instead of 9:00 a.m. Doing this will keep your release from getting lost at the top of the hour.



Type or paste your content directly into the body of an e-mailed press release. Many journalists delete e-mails with attachments because they take too much time to download and may contain viruses.
Send your press release to 1 publication at a time or blind carbon copy (BCC) the recipients to make the news release submission seem more personal.
Some outlets may prefer that you upload the press release directly to their website over a secure submission platform.



Avoid sending media files over e-mail. Large files will clog an inbox and may end up in the junk mail folder.
Send your contact person a link to your media through a service like Box or Dropbox. Alternatively, state that photos and videos are available upon request.
 Ask if the recipient has received the release and offer assistance or further information as needed.

 Whenever you feel like you should stop doing something, write it down in the book. By the end of the year, you could have collected many 'wrongdoings' to fix. Choose three of these most prevalent wrongdoings to fix for the next year as your resolutions.;
, Your family will always have something to say about you, whether you need to change your behavior or eating/drinking habits. Take their ideas into account. It is great to see things from another person's perspective.
 If you automatically feel like you want to start on your resolutions later or leave them for next year, that is not a good choice. The definition of resolutions are firm decisions to do something. Is giving up, very firm? Don't choose the same resolutions twice in a year. If you did not manage to complete them last year, you probably won't be able to do that this year.
 This not only inspires you and keeps the determination going, butÂ it also gives you a reason to get up in the morning! It is all about having achievable goals, but without a suitable attitude, goals can never be achieved.
 Consider how you achieved them and decide how you plan to achieve your resolutions of the following year. Award yourself with a prize for each resolution you achieve. After all, without goals in life, where would we be?

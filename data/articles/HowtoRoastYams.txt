, Depending on your preferences and the size of the yam, cut the yam into fourths, sixths, or eighths., Cayenne, cinnamon, paprika, brown sugar, and white pepper all go great with yams. Lightly and evenly drizzle with olive oil or, if you're feeling zesty, balsamic vinegar., Wait until the yams are tender and start to wrinkle at the edges. This will take about thirty minutes., If you want a crispy finish, turn on the broiler for about a minute. If you don't have a broiler, place the yams in a pan without oil and run on high heat for about a minute. For both methods, if the edges start to blacken remove the yams from the oven/stove top. If you see smoke, remove from heat immediately., If you don't finish all of the heavenly yams, they can be put in a box or plastic bag and put in the refrigerator.

 Dill is very easily grown from seed sown in later spring to early summer. Bear in mind that dill does not transplant well, and is best being sown direct where it will continue to grow.

Select an area where permanent regrowth of dill won't bother you; dill will easily self-sow after you've first planted it.;
, Dill favors poor soil provided it is well-drained. Moreover, the best growth occurs in direct sunlight â€“ feathery leaves and umbels of yellow flowers.
 Water well but do not soak the soil.
 Do this when they reach approximately 5cm (2") in height.
 This is especially important during hot weather.
 Use rotted organic matter (compost, old manure, etc.).
, If the dill appears scraggly and wind is buffeting it, use a stick or bamboo stake to provide adequate support for it to grow against.
 Choose the cooler part of the day to harvest. When removing leaves, cut close to the stem.


The flower heads can also be picked several weeks following flowering, in order to collect the seeds. Place them in a paper bag stored in a cool, dry place until the seeds ripen, then hang upside down until the seeds fall.

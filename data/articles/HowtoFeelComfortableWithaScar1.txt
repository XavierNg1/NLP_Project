 Some people believe that concealing the scar is an indicator of shame or discomfort. However, you can become comfortable with your scar without feeling obligated to expose it. Wait until you are ready to expose your scar. Don’t expose your scars just because someone else -- a friend, family member, or mentor -- pressures you to do so.;
, If someone takes an interest in your scar, keep in mind that they are the exception, not the rule. In other words, every time you catch someone gazing at your scars, think about all the people who have passed you by or interacted with you and did not show visible curiosity or throw a look of judgment your way. While some people will gaze intently at your scar, most won’t care. Don’t focus on the people who look at you funny.
 While having flawless skin is widely considered an indicator of ideal beauty, inner beauty is more important. Inner beauty -- the quality of your personality -- defines who you are in a way that your physical form does not. By staying conscious of the fact that your external appearance is not as important as the real, inner you, you will become more comfortable with your scar.


Make a "soul collage” -- a visual representation of who you are on the inside. Include images of your hopes, aspirations, talents, and dreams. For instance, if you long to travel the world, include images of far-away places in your collage. If you consider yourself a loving person, include images of tender scenes like a mother bear feeding her cubs.
 Look for a meaningful connection to the scar tissue.


If your scars are self-induced, you might use the scar to remind yourself that you have moved beyond the pain that drove you to cut yourself.
If your scars are from a surgery or a painful accident, remember that you made it through even though it was difficult. As the old saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

 Get ones reusable bags that fold up easily into a pouch so you can throw it in your purse or backpack and always have one with you.;
, Use that mug as much as you can. Fast food places like McDonald’s might not be as open but Subway usually is fine with it. They’re usually open to it if it’s a place where you fill your own drink. Know how many ounces your cup holds and make the effort. People usually don’t care. It costs them less to not give you a cup, lid and straw.
 It takes a lot of energy and resources to get the water from the treatment plant all the way to your faucet. Be conscious of how much water you’re using and try to shut it off when you don’t need it.
 This will mean that your toilet is using less water to do its work.
,, Let your money be your voice. Do some research on companies that you are buying from. Find out what their environmental policies are. Are they taking steps to help the earth? Where do they get their materials from? Where is the product you’re buying manufactured? This can be really time-consuming and overwhelming but you can save yourself some time by finding a couple good store or online retailers that try to carry eco-conscious goods.
 Read the labels. Go for perfume and dye free laundry soap and skip the dryer sheets.
 Don’t try to do everything at once. It’s great to want to be an eco superhero but you have to be sure to keep things in perspective and not to beat yourself up too badly when you accidentally throw that glass bottle away. Every little bit helps and it takes a while to replace the old habits with new ones.

 Choose the straightest you can find. Don't worry if it has a slight bend.


When shooting, compensate for the bend by angling the blowgun upwards and gravity will do the rest.;
, If the blowgun is for children or short distance shooting, cut 2-3 feet. Otherwise, use 4 feet. Shorter, and the gun will be less accurate. Longer, and it will be quite unwieldy.
 This will make it far easier to aim.
 Make sure it is at least 8x8 inches. The bigger it is, the easier the target is to hit. A good width is 3/4 inches


If you need to cut the Styrofoam, you can use a heated knife. This prevents the flakes from going everywhere. Make sure there is good ventilation as the fumes can be harmful.
 Include a bulls-eye, and optionally a few other rings for aiming.


Another simpler possibility is to print out a cover and tape it on. Put a weight or attach the target to a surface for practice.
 Put the dart into the gun and push it about half-an inch in. Aim by putting your lips to the blowgun and focusing your eyes on the target.
 Making a "phhh" noise can help.


Don't blow with all your strength as this will not be effective.
If the dart is stuck, you may need a smaller one.
 Otherwise it can damage both the target and the dart.


Wood targets will be harder to remove. Use a two handed grip and pull slowly and steadily.

 One way to have your friends meet is to invite both of them to something that you know that they will like. If both of your friends are into basketball, set up a pickup game and invite both of them. If they like music, go to a show and invite them both.


If you organize something ahead of time, it is harder for your friends to bail.
 An easy way to get your friends to meet is by hosting a party and inviting both of them. If they both show up, introduce them to each other. This takes the pressure off the introduction and, if your friends do not get along, there are other people around for them to talk with. This way you are not stuck awkwardly doing some activity with two people who do not like each other.


As a rule of thumb, be sure to invite people to the party that both friends know. If one friend does not know many people, this can be an opportunity for them to expand their social circle.
 Although you would normally want to be around to facilitate a friendship, it may be easier to arrange for your friends to meet each other without you. Make a time for them to meet at a public place like a bar or coffee shop. Tell them what the other one looks like so that they will be able to identify each other.You could also give your friends each otherâ€™s contact information and let them set up a friend date.
In general, try to introduce your friends in person. This will keep the situation from getting too awkward.

, Meanwhile, pour your heavy cream into another heat-proof bowl. In a pot, heat some water to just under boiling point. When the water is hot enough, place the bowl of cream on top. Make sure that the bowl is not touching the water.
 Let it simmer there for a few minutes before bringing off the heat. Set it down and pour the chocolate into the cream. The cream will melt the chocolate due to the heat. Leave the cream-chocolate mixture for about 5 minutes.
 Try to stir it together as best as you can.



The butter is optional, therefore you do not need to use it. You should add the butter if you are planning to whip the ganache to make it a thicker, more spreadable frosting-like consistency. Of course it will thicken up in the fridge (if you choose to put it in), but this entirely up to you.
If you want to put your ganache in the fridge, do this now. Let it chill for about 4 hours. Then, let it come to room temperature and use for whatever you need it for.
 If you want to go that extra step to make your ganache silky smooth and a perfect frosting consistency, follow through! You will need to use either a hand mixer or some kind of mixer to do this step. Whip it for a few minutes, and you're good to go!

 To avoid wasting time looking for things, have all your books, papers, writing utensils, and other materials readily available and easy to get to. Clean out your backpack and binder(s) weekly or monthly to stay organized.


Consider consolidating your multiple different subject folders and notebooks into one big binder separated by tab dividers. This way, all of your schoolwork will be in one place., Instead of just grabbing the first book in your backpack and starting the work, plan ahead. There are several ways that you can plan out how to do your homework for the evening, including:


Decide how much time you want to spend on your homework collectively.
Make a list of all the different tasks you need to finish.
Estimate how much time you’ll be able to spend on each task to finish your homework when you want to.
Work straight through your list and cross tasks off as you go., Waiting too long in the evening to start may result in working late into the night, which isn’t good because it’s much harder to work quickly when you’re tired. Similarly, waiting until the next morning to do your homework will probably result in a rushed or incomplete end result., As you write assignments down in your planner throughout the week, make sure to write an “A” next to high priority tasks, a “C” next to lower priority tasks, and a “B” next to tasks that fall somewhere in between. An assignment that has to be completed by the next day would probably take priority over one that’s due next Tuesday. Also prioritize bigger assignments over smaller ones.


A ten page essay that’s due in a week that you haven’t started should be labeled an “A” or “B” while a short five question worksheet due in three days may be labeled a “C”.Make sure you don't wait until the last second to get assignments done.

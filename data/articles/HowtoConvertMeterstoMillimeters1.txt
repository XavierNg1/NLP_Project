 If this measurement is not given to you, you will need to measure using a meter stick or tape measure.

The length of one meter stick is equal to 1 meter.

A meter stick is NOT the same as a yardstick. There are 3 feet in a yard, but there are about 3.28 feet in one meter. You will know a measurement is in meters because it will be labeled m{\displaystyle m}.

For example, if the length of a floor is 4 meter sticks long, it is 4m{\displaystyle 4m} long.
;
, Often you will see meters stated in decimals. These means you have a partial meter to convert. If you are measuring, use the centimeter (cm{\displaystyle cm}) or millimeter (mm{\displaystyle mm}) units on the meter stick or tape measure.

For example, if you measure something that is 4 meters long, plus 30 centimeters, it is 4.3 meters long, because there are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. If you measure something that is 4 meters long, plus 30 millimeters, it is 4.03 meters long, because there are 1000 millimeters in a meter., To convert meters to millimeters you need to multiply. Since the metric system is based on multiples of ten, the easiest way to do this is by moving the decimal point to the right.For example, if you are converting 4.3m{\displaystyle 4.3m}, write 4.3{\displaystyle 4.3} and place your pencil on the decimal point.
 Since there are 1,000 millimeters per meter, you need to multiply by 1,000 to convert from meters to millimeters.For example, if your floor is 4.3m{\displaystyle 4.3m} long, you would move your pencil three decimal places to the right, adding two zeros to the number. This gives you 4,300mm{\displaystyle 4,300mm}.

You could also use a calculator or use the standard multiplication algorithm to calculate 4.3Ã—1,000{\displaystyle 4.3\times 1,000}.

 A dual phase eye makeup remover works for most eye makeup. It combines the dissolving power of an oil-based remover with the gentle, soothing qualities of cleansing water. This is a good choice for heavy eye makeup--just make sure you shake the bottle thoroughly before use, as the formula tends to separate.If you use waterproof mascara and liner or very stubborn eye makeup, use an oil-based cleanser. It will dissolve the waterproof makeup so you don't have to scrub or pull on your skin or lashes.Cleansing water works well for extra sensitive skin and should easily remove lighter makeup and liquid liner.;
, Don't scrub your eye at all, just hold the pad in place and allow the make up remover to dissolve your makeup. This will allow you to wipe your makeup off with ease and as little rubbing as possible., Use multiple strokes with light pressure.









Place the fingertips of your free hand against your eyebrow and pull up slightly as your other hand sweeps down. This will prevent you from pulling too hard on the skin around your eye.
 This will allow you to clean underneath your lashes, too.If you still have some stubborn mascara on your lashes, try using a clean mascara wand to brush your lashes.

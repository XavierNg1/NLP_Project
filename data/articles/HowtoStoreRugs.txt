 If any part of the rug is soiled, it needs to be cleaned. Whatever is left on a rug can attract vermin, insects, or simply cause deterioration on its own account. If you are not sure how to clean the rug, read its label or seek professional advice.


Always vacuum a rug before storing; this will remove dander, flea eggs, dust mites, etc., prior to storage. Use an appropriate setting on the vacuum so as not to damage it. If it cannot be vacuumed, at least beat the rug outdoors and leave it to air in sunshine for a day before storing.

 Humidity can cause a rug to curl at the edges, especially when humidity levels are constantly changing. Try to keep the storage space as dry and cool as possible. Keeping the storage temperature as even as possible is also very important.


If the rug has curled, try pinning it down to the floor with double-sided tape for a way (heavy-duty). If not, then try steaming it back into shape.
 If you fold the rug, it will gain permanent crease lines that are very hard, if not impossible, to remove and the fibers will be weakened at all bend points. Tie into a roll gently using twine or similar item.
 Do not use plastic if temperature changes will impact the storage space, as this will cause condensation. A canvas cloth or sheet will do an excellent job of keeping off dust, cobwebs, and the like.

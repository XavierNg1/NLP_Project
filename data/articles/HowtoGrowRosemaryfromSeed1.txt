 Rosemary seeds take a long time to germinate, and many seeds do not germinate at all. By starting your seeds well before the last frost, you can improve your chances of having a decent rosemary seedling to transplant by spring.;
, Allow them to soak for several hours. Doing so lets the seeds absorb water, making them more likely to germinate.
 A commercial base designed for seeds will often work, or you can use garden sand or vermiculite., Since rosemary has a low germination rate, you should plant several seeds into one slot to improve your chances of a seedling growing in each slot. Sprinkle the seeds onto the top of the potting mix before sprinkling a little more potting mix over the seeds.
 Spray the seeds with a gentle mist from a spray bottle. The soil should be moist, but not damp.
 Put plastic wrap over the tray, tightly wrapping it across the top.
 The seeds require warmth to germinate. You can also sit the tray in a warm spot if you do not have a heat mat, but the ideal temperature should be between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 30 degrees Celsius)., Within six to eight weeks, you will likely see small seedlings begin to peak through the soil. At this point, you can remove the plastic wrap.
 After germination, rosemary needs plenty of warmth and light to continue growing. You should also keep the plants lightly watered during this time.
 The rosemary will be ready for transplanting once the sprouts are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall.

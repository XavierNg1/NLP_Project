 When you start the game, go to the level There She Goes Again, and make sure it is in free play, or this WILL NOT WORK. Once that is done, go and beat up all the guys, then get Robin or Nightwing's magnet suit on and go up the magnet thing on the left side of the screen. Punch all the windows and the trash cans and build the grapple thing. Go up there and beat up the guys. NOTE: It is better to have two people playing for the next part.;
, Use your Batarang and hit it. Have the other person playing be someone with one gun (ex. Harley Quinn, The Penguin, Mad Hatter). You will see these penguin things rise up. If there are more than one, hit the others, until you have just one. If there are no penguins, go to another purple thing. If there are no penguins at all, retry the whole thing.
 Go up to the middle part of it, and have player one punch player two once. Then start changing characters. If it works, the penguin should jump up onto the window and start changing into characters.
 Just remember, the guy chasing you WILL blow up if you touch it. So be careful!

 Remove hanging pieces of wood, flaky paint, and other debris around the screw hole. Use medium grit sandpaper (less than 100 grit) to sand away rough patches. Clear away any remaining residue using a shop vac or moistened cloth.If you use a moistened cloth, make sure the area is dry before applying wood filler.
Your screws should be slightly counterbored, or screwed just below the surface of the wood.;
, Scoop a golf ball-sized amount of filler and a tiny dab (no larger than a pea) of hardener onto a hand palette, small piece of scrap wood, or other small work surface. Use a putty knife to mix them together thoroughly.Two part fillers include a small separate container with hardener, which you mix in with the fuller. They’re preferable because they set faster and have a nice, workable texture.Use a smaller amount of filler if you’re only hiding a couple screws. Don’t increase the amount much larger than a golf ball-sized scoop, or you’ll have to work faster to use the full amount before it sets. Make smaller batches instead if necessary., Choose a blade no longer than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in width to maximize your control. Spread a small amount of filler over the screw and hole. Take care not to apply too much filler, but to spread only enough so the hole becomes flush with the surface.Spreading as little filler as possible will make the sanding process easier.
 When you’ve finished filling over the screws, let the filler set according to its instructions, which is typically about 15 to 20 minutes after mixing the filler. Use a medium grit sandpaper (around 100 grit or higher) to smooth over your work surface. Wipe or vacuum away any residue, and you’re ready to stain or paint.

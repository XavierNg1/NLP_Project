 A good method for this is to use the portal and then go to the opposite team. Also look at the Summoning familiars. The next winning team will have the most powerful monsters such as "Steel Titan" in the waiting box.;
, Without helping out you can get kicked out. Do things like kill pyre fiends or Jellies. when killing these, they drop soul shards, which you ca use on the soul obelisk if your team is in control.You can also kill other players, or the boss if your slayer level is above the bosses level.
 if your bosses level is low then bury bones in your graveyard. Many people die so there will be a ton of bones around. Note this doesn't raise your prayer level.

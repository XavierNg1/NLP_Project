 Place your thumb just beneath the bolster of the handle. Wrap your index finger around the handle from the other side of the knife. Bend both fingers closer together until they meet.


Note that the bolster is the blunt piece of metal in between the sharp portion of the blade and the handle of the knife.
The handle grip is the option most beginner cooks naturally gravitate toward and it typically feels more natural than the blade grip. It also works well for cooks with unusually small hands. On the other hand, this grip style causes the wrist to fall out of alignment with the palm and fingers, thereby limiting the amount of control you have with the knife.;
, Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky finger all the way around the handle, keeping them aligned with your index finger.









Hold your fingers close together to provide the greatest amount of grip and force. Ideally, there should be no visible space in between your fingers while they are gripping the knife.
 Cut food while keeping a firm grip around the handle. No finger should move beyond the bolster as you cut.









Many beginning cooks have the habit of extending the index finger over the blunt top edge of the knife while cutting. Doing so is ill-advised, however. The index finger alone does not provide enough force to help control the blade, and this finger can actually become sore while you chop if you hold it in this manner.

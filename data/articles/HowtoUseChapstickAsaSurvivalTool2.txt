 Uncap the container and rub the lip balm onto something flammable: cotton balls, Q-tips, cloth, gauze, lint, or even dry organic materials like leaves and bark.Then, light the material on fire. The oil in the lip balm will give your flame an extra kick of intensity, and it should help it burn for longer while you get a larger fire going.You can also use petroleum jelly like Vaseline for this purpose.Consider keeping cotton balls or gauze in your survival kit for precisely this purpose. Together, cotton and lip balm form a potent fire-starting combination., Add a short wick, and the waxy, oily lip balm will perform much like a standard candle. For the wick, you can use a string, a match, or half of a Q-tip â€“ anything that will not burn too quickly. Coat the wick in Chapstick wax, then stick it into the end of the balm. Light it on fire, and you have a candle that you can use to make more fire.Make sure to plant the wick slightly off-center from the plastic screw in the center of the Chapstick.
Keep the wick very short. Otherwise, it might burn too quickly. Either way, there's a good chance that the fire will melt away the plastic rim of the container., Try cutting a Q-tip in half, then coating the fuzzy end of the Q-tip in lip balm. Stick the sharp end of the half-Q-tip into the Chapstick, then light the fuzz. It should burn well and last at least a few minutes.

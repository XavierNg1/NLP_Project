Domain names are not available on the day they expire. Registrars will often wait 40 days before ejecting the previous owner and then hold the name for another 30 days or so in hopes the owner will renew. The actual release date, then, can be quite difficult to track and requires extreme diligence.
Once the domain name is actually dropped, the registry releases the names for only a few unscheduled hours.;

Search the database for expiring names and select one you would like to register for yourself. Usually this involves entering keywords for domain names, but you can also enter the exact domain name for which you are looking. For example, if you are interested in acquiring a domain name with the word "raisin" in it, type "raisin" into the search box. A list of all expiring domain names that contain the word "raisin" will appear.
Find out when the domain name is scheduled to drop by frequently checking the database for changes in the domain's status.



There are websites that allow users to back-order domain names. The domain name you want to register may or may not be on one of these sites. You should check just in case. Customers can back-order domain names before they expire. This situates them on a list and the domain name is offered upon expiration.

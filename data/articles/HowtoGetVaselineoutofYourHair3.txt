 It may seem strange, but to dissolve oil, you need more oil. Massage a good amount of oil into your hair, wring out as much as you can (make sure you do this in a bathtub).Wash your hair twice with clarifying shampoo and warm water.
Added bonus: the oil will moisturize your skin!, You may be able to track down make-up remover that is made specifically to remove grease paint makeup (like what clowns or people in theatre wear). You may also want to try products (like Swarfega) that are used by mechanics, printers, or engineers to remove grease from their skin. These products are designed to dilute and lift grease, and may be able to break down the oil in the petroleum and release it from your hair.Carefully apply the product to the affected area. Wait a few minutes before rinsing, allowing the product to work on the Vaseline.
Rinse your hair and repeat as necessary.
Only use products approved for use on skin, and even then be very careful with the application. Make sure you don't let any drip into your eyes.
 This method will not be great for your hair and can dry out your skin, too, but it has worked for many people. Use the the dish soap like a shampoo, working it through your hair and then rinsing with warm water.Repeat twice and pat your hair dry with a towel. You will definitely want to condition your hair afterwards, as it will be stripped of all its natural oils.Be careful not to get any detergent in your eyes. A detachable shower head may be helpful when rinsing your hair--you can hold it right up to your scalp and use your free hand to shield your eyes.

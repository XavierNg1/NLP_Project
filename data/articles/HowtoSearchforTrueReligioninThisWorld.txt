 Before you go on your endless search for the "true" religion, ask, "What does religion mean to you?"
, This means, be culturally literate. Know your culture and other cultures. Understand yourself and others. Learn how to be impartial in judgment. Study history and learn form it. Most of the human's misdeeds are deeply rooted in their world view and religious dogma., Even the seemingly most irreverent voice has some goodness in its thought., See how people make use of their religions for all their supposed intent and purposes. But don't be fooled! Don't just look at people's interpretation of their religious doctrine. People are corruptible beings and are given to temporal expediencies. Look instead at the doctrinal content of religion. What is its essence and what does it teach., Look inward to yourself. See if there is something missing. Feel if there is longing for some higher purpose. Use what you've gained and learned from the steps above to find your "peace". If you're at peace, you've find your religion.

 If you suspect that your rabbit has a dental problem, then you will need to take him to see a veterinarian. A veterinarian can perform a thorough exam of your rabbit and determine the best course of treatment. Other methods that your rabbit’s veterinarian may use include:


X-rays. If your rabbit’s dental disease is severe, then your veterinarian may need to take x-rays of your rabbit’s skull to determine how much damage has been done.
Blood tests. Your rabbit’s veterinarian may also need to do a blood test to determine if there is an underlying condition that may have caused your rabbit’s dental problems., Make sure that you give your veterinarian a full account of all of the symptoms that you have noticed. Mentioning the symptoms and behaviors that you have noticed will help your veterinarian to determine what is wrong with your rabbit.
 If you noticed that your rabbit’s incisors are too long, then a trim may be necessary to prevent further damage. Do to attempt to trim your rabbit’s teeth on your own. Trimming a rabbit’s teeth requires special tools and technique or the rabbit may suffer intense pain from the procedure.

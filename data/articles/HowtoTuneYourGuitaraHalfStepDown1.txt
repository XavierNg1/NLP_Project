 It is not necessary to go out and spend $60+ on a chromatic tuning pedal. If you have a smartphone, there are plenty of applications that cost anywhere from $0 to $3. Invest in a chromatic tuning pedal if you plan to perform live a fair amount., Tune your low E string down until the screen reads Eb or D#.
 Tune down your A string until the screen either reads Ab or G#. Don’t tune too fast or else you could pass Ab and become lost.
 Tune your D string down until the screen of the tuner says Db or C#. Use a relaxed pace when tuning down your string.
 Tune your G string down until the tuner says Gb or F#.
 Lower the B string’s note until the tuner says Bb or A#.
 Detune the E string at slow pace until the screen reads Eb or D#.
 Usually after detuning all your strings your guitar will not hold the new tuning at first. Go through each string and make sure they are all in tune to EbAbDbGbBbEb or D#G#C#F#A#D#.You might need to check the tune of each string a few times.
Test the tuning by playing a chord. Pluck each string in the chord and make sure each string sounds in tune.

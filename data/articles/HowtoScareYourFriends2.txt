, If you’re planning to prank someone who comes over often, screw the hook above where they normally sit., Be sure the fishing line is securely around the spider and that you've tied a strong knot. You don’t want the spider falling off the line!, To make sure you have enough line, cut it after you know where you’ll be standing when you pull it.

You may want to leave the line near a light or the TV instead of where you’re sitting on the couch if you think that your friend might sit close enough to you on the couch that he/she can see you pulling the fishing line.
The best setup is to be able to control the spider from behind the couch or curtain, when your friend isn’t even aware you’re in the room.
 Once your friend is sitting down on the couch, find a way to drop the spider on to him/her without him/her noticing you pulling on the fishing line.

Exactly how you do this will depend on the layout of your room. You may need to get creative!
If you live with other people, ask them to tell your friend you’ll be there in a minute, and to have a seat. Then, once they’ve sat down, you can drop the spider on them from your hiding place.

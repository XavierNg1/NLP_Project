, You will need the sealant, a crack filler, a push broom and a trowel. These items can be found at hardware and home improvement stores.


Depending on the depth of the cracks in your driveway, you may need to purchase joint filler. If the cracks in your driveway are less than 1/2 inch (12.7 mm), the rubberized crack filler found in small tubes will work perfectly. If your cracks are deeper, you will need a patch filler.
 Squeeze the crack filler into the crack to make it level with the rest of the driveway. When using patch filler for deeper cracks, use a trowel to spread the filler and ensure a level surface.

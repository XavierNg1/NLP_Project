 This is one of the easiest ways of labeling hard surfaced objects. Label makers and label tape can be found at most general retailers and office supply stores. In all, you'll need:


Batteries (for label maker; optional)
Label maker
Label tape
Scissors (optional), Your label maker may be a plug-in model, but if not you'll need to insert batteries into it first. After that, release the spool for the label tape, insert the tape, and fasten the spool back in place.Depending on your label maker, there may be many different spool configurations. Generally, this involves releasing a tab or removing the spool from a slot.
If you have bought your label maker brand new, it may already come equipped with label tape, in which case you won't need to insert your own.
 The way you input your label text into the label maker will also depend on your model of label maker. In most cases, this involves using a small keypad on the maker to input and confirm your label message.


Oftentimes, after you input and confirm your label message, the label will print directly. In some cases, however, you might need to select a "Print" option.
Some label makers might also ask you to select a label size from a list of options. Choose the size that best suits the item you are labeling., Many label makers come equipped with sharp teeth where the label emerges. This makes it easy to tear your labels free. If your label maker lacks this feature, you may need to cut the label free with scissors. After that:


Take your label and hold it close to the item you are labeling. Peel the backing off the label to expose the adhesive beneath.
Smooth the label onto the item's surface to prevent labels from pulling free and becoming a choking hazard. Use your nails or a hard edge to chase bubbles to the label's edges and remove them.
If a label does not stick cleanly to the surface you are trying to put it on, you may need to make a new label and try again.

 GuideStar is an organization which maintains a list of nonprofits and presents information their efficacy, legitimacy, and programming.Their list can be accessed online at https://www.guideStar.org/NonprofitDirectory.aspx.
 At the top of the directory page, there’s a search bar. Entering a keyword search, for instance, “Asian-American” will summon a list of all the nonprofits with the term “Asian-American” in their names. You can refine your search by clicking the words “Refine Your Search” to the left of the search bar. There you can filter nonprofits by location or GuideStar profile participation level.
 Instead of a direct search, you can choose which category the list of nonprofits you’re looking for falls under. This is useful if you’re searching for all the nonprofits which pertain to a subject but the nonprofit's name doesn't necessarily reflect their purpose.


GuideStar recognizes nine categories of nonprofit types, each with several subcategories.
Try searching for the list of nonprofits you desire under multiple headings. For instance, if you’re looking for nonprofits which celebrate Asian-American history and contributions, you might look under Public, Societal Benefit > Civil Rights and Liberties for a nonprofit which meets your criteria, but you could also look under Arts, Culture and Humanities > Humanities and Historical Societies for a relevant nonprofit.
 Great Nonprofits (http://greatnonprofits.org) and Nonprofit List (NonProfitList.org) are two online databases with similar search options and accessibility. Since each site collects and updates different information, it’s good to check a number of online nonprofit databases when assembling a list of nonprofits.

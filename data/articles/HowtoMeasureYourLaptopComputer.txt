 Screens are typically measured in inches, though different regions will choose metric over Imperial. If you need to, you can convert your measurement after the fact.;
, Screens are measured diagonally, so your starting point will be either the bottom-left or bottom-right corner of the screen. The measurement only accounts for the actual screen, not the enclosure, so start your measurement at the very corner where the visible part of the screen starts.
 Remember that you are measuring just the visible portion of the screen, not any of the enclosure.


Screens were originally measured diagonally to make the size sound more impressive.
 Most retailers advertise screens in tenths of inches (15.3", 17.1", etc.), but most tape measures are marked in 16ths of an inch. If you want to know the retail number that your screen would be labeled, refer to this chart of common sizes.
 If you need to know the size of the screen in centimeters but only have the inches measurement, multiply the inches by 2.54 to find the measurement in centimeters.


For example, a 13.3 inch screen is 33.8 centimeters (13.3 x 2.54 = 33.782).
 The laptop's height is measured with a closed screen.
 If your laptop slopes when closed, measure the thickest part.

 If you need to know the height in centimeters but only have the inches measurement, multiply the inches by 2.54 to find the measurement in centimeters.


For example, a 1.5 inch tall laptop is 3.8 centimeters (1.5 x 2.54 = 3.81).
 Measuring the front is easiest because there are no protruding ports.
 Make sure to measure all the way to the end of any rounded edges.
 If you need to know the width in centimeters but only have the inches measurement, multiply the inches by 2.54 to find the measurement in centimeters.


For example, a 14 inch wide laptop is 35.6 centimeters (14 x 2.54 = 35.56).
, Make sure to measure all the way to the end of any rounded edges.
 If you need to know the depth in centimeters but only have the inches measurement, multiply the inches by 2.54 to find the measurement in centimeters.


For example, a 12 inch deep laptop is 30.5 centimeters (12 x 2.54 = 30.48).

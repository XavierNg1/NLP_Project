 The purpose of premarital counseling is to increase your odds of having a healthy and satisfying marriage. Therefore, you’ll want to better your odds by working with a counselor who has experience.


While anyone with a background in relationship dynamics may be able to help you, you will get the most help from a professional who has been trained as a marriage and family therapist or who has a certification in premarital counseling.
Also, ask how many couples your prospective counselor has worked with. You’ll want someone who has a wealth of knowledge and experience rather than someone who has only worked with a handful of couples., Once you’ve narrowed down a few candidates (maybe one or two), arrange to have an initial session with them. Come prepared with a list of questions, such as the therapist’s theoretical orientation, their belief system, and their approach to working with couples. Ideally, you should feel as comfortable with this professional as you do your family physician., After you’ve scheduled one session, sit down with your partner and discuss your comfort level with the professional. It’s very important that you both feel safe and capable of sharing sensitive or intimate information with this person. So, only move forward with the sessions if you both feel comfortable with this person.


Feeling like therapy is a safe place is quite significant as many couples may see a therapist for premarital counseling and continue to see them throughout the life of the marriage as new issues arise., Premarital counseling isn’t necessarily a walk in the park. For most couples, these sessions will bring up difficult issues that must be resolved for the benefit of the marriage. Both partners should begin therapy with the understanding that it will be challenging and uncomfortable at times. Both must be willing to work during and after the sessions to enjoy lasting results.

 People don’t like waiting for replies, especially with so many available products for sale online and through the classifieds. If you don’t answer them, they’ll likely spend their money elsewhere. Check your email and phone messages regularly, and provide a reply as soon as it is convenient for you.
 Even with the clearest, most well-written ad, people will invariably have questions for you. Do your best to provide any additional information.
 If you’re willing to accept someone’s best offer, then keep a dialogue open with that customer until you come to an agreement or decide that neither one of you is willing to go any further.

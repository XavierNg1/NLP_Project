 A floating aid with a line attached is ideal because the line can help you pull the victim in. A ring buoy, life jacket, and floating cushions are often found at lifeguard stations at pools and outdoor swimming areas. Boats are also equipped with ring buoys, so use this rescue if the incident occurs while you're out in the middle of a body of water., Toss the float so that it lands within reach of the victim, but do not strike the victim directly. Take the wind and the current of the water into consideration before you throw. Let the victim know that you are about to throw the aid, and that he or she needs to grab the aid.A good goal is to throw the ring just past the victim, then pull it to him or her with the rope.
If you miss the victim or he or she is unable to grab the aid, pull the line back or try throwing another device.
If repeated attempts are unsuccessful, you may need to try another method or swim to push the device closer to the victim., An unweighted rope can also be used to rescue a victim. Loosely coil the rope or line in your non-throwing hand by tying a small loop on one end and placing your wrist in the loop. Use an underhand motion to throw the ring, and allow the rope to uncoil freely from your non-throwing hand. Step on the end of the rope so that you do not accidentally throw the ring away.Aim for the victim's shoulder when throwing a line.
Once the victim grabs the line, drop the coil, and begin to slowly pull the line until the victim has reached the side or is able to stand in shallow water.

 You can use a spatula and scrape the surface to remove chunks, or use a cloth or thick paper towel to remove pieces.;
, Press on an absorbent cloth or paper towel just hard enough to absorb liquid, but not so hard that you force the vomit further into the underlying surface.
 This will help absorb the odor of the vomit. Leave the baking soda for about 30 minutes, then vacuum it.
 Be sure to create a solution that will work on the type of material you need to clean, whether it is leather, upholstery, plastic, or carpeting. While you can purchase a commercial cleaner made for the appropriate material, you can also make your own:


For leather upholstery: Make a paste of baking soda and water by mixing three parts baking soda to one part warm water.
For vinyl, cloth, plastic, or carpeting: Mix eight parts warm water with one part white vinegar. Add about a half teaspoon (5 mL) dishwashing liquid and stir thoroughly.
 Apply the liquid cleaning solution to the vomit stain, using a lint-free cloth to thoroughly scrub the area. If the stain has penetrated your car's carpeting, you may need to use a hard-bristle brush., Use a wet or damp lint-free cloth to remove as much of the cleaning solution as possible.


Use a damp, not wet, cloth to clean leather upholstery.
Rinse vinyl or cloth upholstery, plastic or carpeting with a wet cloth. If you've used a great deal of cleaning solution, you may find it more efficient to use a squirt bottle for rinsing.
 If you have them, use white cotton cloths so that you can see that the stain is being lifted every time you blot. Continue blotting until no stain is visible on the upholstery or on your blotting cloth.
 Depending on the weather and your car's location, you may wish to set up a fan or use a hair dryer to speed the drying process.

 A bulb holder is a device made to hold a light bulb. It also has two terminals. One is for a positive lead and the other is for a negative lead. This allows you to pass a current through the light bulb in the holder. Be sure to use a low powered light bulb (e.g. something in the range of 1-10 volts)., You should use two different colored copper wires. This will help you differentiate between the positive and negative lead. Use a knife or wire strippers to cut an inch of the wire insulation (the colored part) off of each end of both wires. This exposes the copper wire underneath., Generally, red wire is used to connect the positive end. One side of the red wire will connect to one side of the bulb holder. The other side of the red wire should touch the positive lead on the battery., Black wire is usually used to connect the negative end. Again, one end of the wire should touch the terminal on the bulb holder (not the same terminal as the positive wire). The other end of the wire can be left unattached until you are ready to light the bulb., Touch the unattached end of the negative (black) wire to the negative terminal on the battery. This completes the circuit and allows electricity to flow. The electricity is forced to flow through the light bulb, which causes the bulb to light up.

 As a general rule, you should drink six to eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water each day. Dehydration can actually cause your creatinine levels to increase, so staying hydrated is important.


When you do not have enough fluid in your body, you produce less urine. Creatinine is washed out of your system through urine, so producing less urine will make it more difficult to flush out this toxin.
On the other hand, consuming too much fluid could also have a negative effect on your kidney functions. Too much fluid could cause an increase in blood pressure, and high blood pressure can put stress on your kidneys.
Unless otherwise instructed by a doctor, it is best to keep yourself hydrated but to avoid abnormal amounts of fluid intake.
 The body converts food into energy faster when it undergoes vigorous exercise. As a result, more creatinine is formed, causing the amount of creatinine build-up in your blood to increase.


Exercise can still offer important health benefits overall, so you may not want to exclude it from your routine completely. You should swap out high intensity exercises for low intensity ones, however. Instead of running, weight lifting, or playing basketball, try walking or practicing yoga.
 When you sleep, most of your bodily functions decrease. This includes the body's metabolism. As a result, the conversion of creatine to creatinine goes at a slower rate, allowing more of the creatinine already in your blood to filter out before additional toxins can build up.


Aim for six to nine hours of sleep per night, with seven or eight being an ideal amount.
Additionally, sleep deprivation can put physical stress on your entire body and force all of its parts to work harder to perform normal tasks. As a result, your kidneys can become stressed, which will decrease their ability to filter out creatinine.

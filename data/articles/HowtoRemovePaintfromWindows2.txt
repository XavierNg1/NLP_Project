 If you are just trying to remove small drips or splatters of paint, a chemical solvent will work nicely. You will also need to use a chemical solvent if you are trying to remove paint from textured glass.


Rubbing alcohol works well for acrylic paint, while acetone-based solvents (such as nail polish remover) work for enamel paint. You can also use specialized paint strippers or thinners, which are available at most hardware stores.
Simply dip a clean cloth into the solution and use it to gently rub off the paint.

 Large cooking pots with tall sides work best, especially if you’re cooking lots of crab. Add water so that the pot is about two-thirds full., For every gallon (3.7 L) of water, add 1 ½ cup (350 mL) of salt. The salt is a simple but effective starting seasoning and will also cause the water to boil faster. You may also add other seasonings, such as Old Bay crab seasoning, bay leaves, or lemon.


Claw meat has a stronger flavor than meat from other parts of the crab, so don’t feel obligated to add extra seasoning.
 Turn the heat up on the stove. Bring the water to a boil, then move the pot off the heat. While leaving the pot on the heat is useful for boiling whole crabs, Jonah claws are small and will cook quicker. By moving the pot off the heat, you can better control the cooking process., Carefully add about two pounds (.45 g) of Jonah crab claws to the water. Make sure that the crab is covered by the water. Fish out any claws that can’t get into the water. Let the claws boil until they look bright red., Remove the claws from the water. Use tongs to transfer them to a place they can drain, such as a mesh strainer or dry towel. Because the claws are so small and easy to overcook, it is helpful to then rinse the claws with cool water in the sink.

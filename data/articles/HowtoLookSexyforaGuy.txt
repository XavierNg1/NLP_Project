 Shower everyday and brush your teeth. Get some body wash that smells good and wash your body twice with it and make sure you wash your hair really well, especially if it's long. It's gross when hair is greasy at the roots and no one wants to see that.;
, (Of course, a mustache is not sexy.)

, Do whatever you want: go get them waxed, pluck them but don't shave it! Keep them under control and not overly bushy.
 If body acne is a problem, get a body-wash to help with it. Use a spot treatment on your whole face everyday for acne.
 Girls love a nice, tight, buff body, and they find it really sexy when you are capable of protecting them. When a girl sees you working out, and you're all sweaty, it reminds her of something else you can do.
 Nothing makes someone more ugly than a bad personality. So if you ignore her or think it's cool to grab her in front of your friends, you're probably making her uncomfortable. Girls like guys who do nice things for them, like go getting them something to drink, just like guys like girls to do the same. Don't be soapy sweet, or she'll start to think of you as a friend. Compliment her frequently, but not too much lest you come off as insincere. Be honest about it, like if she looks abnormally good you can tell her that you really like her hair, makeup, clothes, etc.
 Don't wear a wrinkled up shirt that's too short. Don't wear dirty, muddy shoes. Wear nice clean shoes, jeans with or without a design on the back pockets. Wear a fresh, white t-shirt under your regular shirt. Pull your pants up. Buy all your clothes in the same color, like red, so that everything matches. Get a hat that matches your shoes, not a fitted cap. If your ear is pierced, put something decent there.

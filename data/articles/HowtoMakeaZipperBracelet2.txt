 All you need to make a simple zipper bracelet is one 9" zipper, a pair of fabric scissors, some embroidery floss, and an embroidery needle.You may want to keep some clear nail polish on hand in case your zipper starts to fray as you're working with it.You should be able to find everything you need at a craft store.
 Use your fabric scissors to cut away any excess cloth from the zipper. Cut as close to the teeth as you can. If your zipper starts to fray, use a little clear nail polish to seal the ends., Measure and cut the zipper strand to the desired length. This bracelet does not have a clasp, so make sure you have enough so that you can fit the bracelet over your wrist.Thread your needle with embroidery floss. Insert the needle between the zipper teeth on one end of the strand. Pull the other end of the bracelet around, and join the two sides together by sticking the needle through the other end.Make sure there is some overlap between each end. Wind the embroidery floss around both sides. Keep it tight and make sure the ends are secure.To finish tying the ends together, thread the needle back through the zipper ends and tie a knot. Cut off any excess zipper.,

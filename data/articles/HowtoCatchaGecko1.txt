 Most geckos are active at night.This makes it easier for them to hunt for insects and avoid the extreme temperatures of the desert during peak sunlight hours.However, some geckos, notably from the genus Phelsuma, are diurnal, or active during the day. These geckos are called day geckos.Knowing whether the gecko you are trying to catch is active during the day or during the night will determine when and how you approach these lizards.


Geckos from the genus Phelsuma are indigenous to Madagascar and several islands in the Indian Ocean, but have been introduced to Hawaii and Florida in the United States by humans.Geckos from the genus Lygodactylus are native to parts of Africa, including Madagascar, and parts of South America.Geckos from the genus Gonatodes are native to the Caribbean Islands and parts of Central and South America.Geckos from the genus Eurydactylodes are native to the Southwest Pacific region, located in New Caledonia and Koumac.The Moorish gecko, from the genus Tarentola, is indigenous to South Europe and North Africa, but has been introduced by humans to Florida and California in the United States.Tokay and leopard geckos are naturally nocturnal, but have been observed in captivity to adjust to diurnal cycles.If you have a pet tokay or leopard gecko, it may have adapted to your diurnal schedule, and you may need to search for your gecko during the day.;
, If you decide to look for a nocturnal gecko during the day (or a diurnal gecko during the night), knowing where the gecko sleeps may be helpful. Many geckos seek out sheltered places to sleep. In the wild, geckos may sleep hidden under tree bark, in natural crevices, or underneath larger objects.If you're looking for a wild gecko in your yard, try peeling back loose tree bark or lifting fallen tree branches. If you're searching in or around your home, look for small cracks in the foundation, gaps in the siding or floor boards of your home, or anywhere else a small lizard might fit.
 Geckos are cold-blooded, which is important to keep in mind as you search for a gecko. If you are trying to find a gecko that is loose in your house, and you keep your home air conditioned, the gecko may seek out a warmer location within your house, such as underneath heat-emitting appliances like refrigerators., Laws that govern the catching and keeping wild animals, including geckos, can vary widely from one state to another, and from one country to another. Check with your local Department of Agriculture or your country's office of disease control, or contact your local government on regional regulations regarding the keeping of wild geckos as pets.

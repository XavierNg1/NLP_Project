 One of the most effective ways to grow as a person is to face the things that scare you most. Look for ways to get out of your comfort zone every day, whether that means talking to someone new, learning to drive, or taking on new responsibilities at work.If your fear is too big to tackle all at once, do it a little at a time. Set a small, manageable goal to start with. After you achieve it, set another one that’s slightly more challenging.
For instance, if you’re afraid to travel alone, take a short day trip to a nearby town. Then take an overnight trip a little farther away.
 This may sound counterintuitive, but one effective way to conquer fear is by thinking of the worst. Contrary to what you might believe, this won't make you crawl up in a ball. In fact, you'll feel capable once you realize the worst is either unlikely or totally manageable.Try this: when you have a fear, think about the worst possible scenario. For instance, you worry about not getting a promotion at work. What's the worst that can happen? You'll get passed up and be considered next time. Or, you finally decide to move on from your current job that doesn't recognize your talent. Whatever it is, it likely won't kill you.
 Banish your jitters by preparing for things ahead of time. Whether you’re giving a speech, interviewing for a new job, or taking an exam, you’ll do better and feel calmer if you practice beforehand.Ask a friend to help. Say, “I really want to knock this interview out of the park. Will you help me practice my questions?”

, Independence doesn't mean you don't need anyone. In fact, it's impossible to go through life without assistance from others. When you get overwhelmed by fear, have the courage to ask for help from those you trust.You might seek the experience of a mental health therapist to help you cope with major fears.
Or, you might simply ask a friend or family member to help you role-play anxiety-causing scenarios or accompany you to stressful events.

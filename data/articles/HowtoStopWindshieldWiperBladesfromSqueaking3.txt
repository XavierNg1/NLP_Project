 If the non-rubber blade and arm parts are still in good condition, it goes without saying you won’t need to replace them. But sometimes the rubber breaks down faster than non-rubber parts (especially in sunny areas).Remove and replace the rubber blade inserts., Pull the metal arm away from the windshield. Where the blade attaches to the arm, you should see a joint. On this you’ll find a release for the arm. Open the release, take out the old blade, insert a new one, and reset the release.On some cars, there may be a push-tab or tension hook attaching the blades to the arm assembly. Release these kinds of fasteners with your hands and slide off the blade.
Depending on who you ask, you might hear that you should change your blades every six months or once a year, but it’s always a good idea to before the rainy season., Follow the wiper blade down the arm to its base. You should see a nut sticking up from this point. Remove the nut with a wrench. Now you can pull the arm off. Fit a replacement arm into place and fasten the nut and your new assembly is good to go.With time and use, the assemblies holding your wiper blades in place can become misshapen or inflexible, contributing to squeaking.

 If you have a linear function that’s not in the standard form, you’ll need to rewrite it before you can make a graph.


Say you have the function 6x – 2y = 4. Move everything but y to the left, as follows.






Then divide both sides by -2.
You now have the standard form of a linear function: y = 3x – 2.
 You know your graph will be a straight line because you have a linear function; therefore, you really need only two points. In general, though, you should find three points instead, to check for accuracy.


In the rewritten example above, you might choose to use -1, 0, and 1 as your x values. Solve as follows.
 Plot your points on the coordinate system, using the values you got from solving your three equations.


In the example above, your points would look like this.
 For any two points, there is only one way to connect them with a straight line. Use a ruler to join them with a straight line. Note that if you graph three points, and they don’t all lie on the same line, then you’ve made a mistake somewhere. Go back and calculate again.


In the example above, your graph would look like this.

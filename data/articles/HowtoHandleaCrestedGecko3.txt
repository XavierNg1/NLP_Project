 Position your free hand a short distance away from the other hand. Since he will be jumping, you want to prevent any potential injuries. If your gecko does fall, check him over for injuries such as bruising or broken limbs. If your gecko is not walking normally after a fall, take him to see a vet.


Do not be alarmed if his tail falls off. This is normal in crested geckos. Tail loss is a natural response to stress or fear. In the wild, they lose their tails to get away from predators. Your gecko will be fine after dropping his tail, although it will not grow back. There may be a stump left afterwards., Make sure your free hand is slightly higher with a short distance between them. You will know if your gecko will jump because of his body language. His toes will move in front of his head as his body pushes back and up. His eyes will also be locked on the other hand as he aims for it. , Your gecko may not be comfortable with jumping between hands at first. As you handle him, you can give him room to jump, and over time, he will become more comfortable with your handling. He may also jump straight over your hand. Catch him if he does, and place him back on your arm.

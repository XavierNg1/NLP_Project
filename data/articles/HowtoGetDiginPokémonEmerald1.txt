 This town can be found in northwest part of Hoenn. It’s a small farming community with a Contest Hall. To the west of this town, you'll find Route 114.Go there and find the Fossil Maniac's house, which will be located on that route., Inside the Fossil Maniac's house you'll find a character awaiting you. This is the Fossil Maniac's brother, and simply by talking to him you will receive TM28 (Dig).


Be sure you get this item as soon as it is available to you. You can miss out on it, in which case you'll have to find and raise a Pokémon that naturally learns Dig if you want to get the ability., You might want to choose one of your commonly used Pokémon to have this ability. This way, when you're training or traveling through dangerous areas, like caves, tall grass, and dungeons, you can escape to the entrance of the area with Dig if necessary. You might also give this ability to a Pokémon you don't plan on using much so you don't have to sacrifice valuable ability slots, as each Pokémon can only have a maximum of five abilities at any time.


TM's are one-time use items. This means if you trade the Pokémon you teach TM28 to, you won't be able to teach the ability to another Pokemon. In this situation, you'll have to raise a Pokémon that learns Dig naturally.

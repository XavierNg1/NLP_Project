 If you have two friends who are fighting, you might find that both of them will try to convince you to be on their ‘side.’ In the majority of situations, your best bet is to remain neutral and not take sides. Instead, help both friends think through what they’re fighting about and provide support for a possible reconciliation.There are always exceptions to this ‘rule,’ but it’s up to you to decide when to make such an exception based on your own personal beliefs and moral judgement.
 Before you decide to support your friends during their fight, possibly as a mediator, set yourself some boundaries. For example, make sure your friends understand that you aren’t a postman and that you will not be the one to carry a message from one friend to the other. If you’re friends want to pass a message to each other, they have to do it themselvesAnother boundary might be to tell your friends you will not help them if they simply start to rant and spew nasty comments about each other. Your goal is to help them get to a resolution, not help them be nasty to each other.
 It may seem counter-intuitive, but you may want to avoid offering either friend specific advice. It’s not because you’re being unhelpful, it’s because they need to figure out a solution on their own. You should be there to support them, but you can’t provide a solution for them.Instead of offering advice, ask more questions. For example, if you realize one of your friends isn’t able to see a specific point-of-view of your other friend, ask questions that lead your friend to realize and understand that point-of-view.
Beware that if you do offer advice that doesn’t end up working, you could end up being blamed by one or both friends for the bad situation they’re in.
If you feel the need to offer some sort of advice, ask first. Don’t provide unsolicited advice. Your friend may already know what they’re going to do about the situation and may just be looking for a shoulder to lean on, not advice.

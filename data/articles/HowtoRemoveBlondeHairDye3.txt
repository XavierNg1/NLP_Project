 Bleaching is a very powerful method of removing hair color. However, because bleach is harsh on hair, only bleach if you've tried other methods. You should also get bleaching done at a salon by a professional. Usually, you will have to add hair dye over the bleach to return to your natural hair color., Some methods of hair removal can be harsh on your hair, leaving it dry. If you've removed the dye yourself, but your hair feels brittle, get a hot oil treatment at your local salon. This can help revitalize your hair., If all else fails, see a stylist. They can remove the hair dye in a professional setting. However, this is often costly. It makes sense to attempt to remove the dye yourself first before going to a salon for help.

 Place a paper towel on top of the bowl and microwave the mixture for 45 to 60 seconds. The butter and preserves should start combining.
 Stir until all of the ingredients are well combined.
 You will use this at the end of the cooking time to baste your salmon fillet throughout the cooking process. Keep the reserved glaze in the refrigerator.
 Pour the remaining glaze into it and add the salmon to the bag. Using a pair of tongs, turn the salmon until it is coated.
 While it's marinating, set your oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Cover a metal baking pan with aluminum foil, and then cover the foil with nonstick cooking spray.
 Place the salmon on the baking pan with the skin side facing down.
 Do this by dipping a basting brush into the cup (240 milliliters) of glaze that you set aside earlier. Brush the glaze onto the top side of the salmon.


Check to see if the pink flesh of the salmon is flaky. If you like your salmon less well done, then simply shorten the cooking time.
 Divide the salmon into 6 to 8 portions and serve it.

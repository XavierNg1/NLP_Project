 You will first need a grid on which to draw your graph. You can either purchase grid paper or you can draw it yourself using a ruler. Make sure that the lines are straight and evenly spaced. They should be a distance apart as is appropriate for the graph you intend to produce.


You can have an L-shaped graph or a t-shaped graph. It will depend on whether or not you need to show negative values. The L or t base will be your main axis, or the baseline for your values. The horizontal line is called the x-axis and the vertical line is called the y-axis.;
, You will need to determine what will go on the x and y axes. This will depend on the type of data you are trying to show. The two should be correlated and accurately present the data you are trying to show. Assign the label to the axes and then label the intervals of change in evenly spaced increments along the axes.


One common example would be for the x-axis to represent time and the y-axis to represent a value that changes over time.
 You will want to carefully determine the increments by looking closely at the data you need to represent. Be sure that you have enough space to clearly show all of your data. Both axes should go beyond the last datapoint you need to show.

 Though not as efficient or glamorous as using a cheese grater, a vegetable peeler will still get the job done.









Hold a medium sized block of cheese over a regular sized plate. Rub the peeler against the cheese in a continuous forward motion.
For higher quality slices, refrigerate the cheese first or opt for a hard type of cheese (such as Parmesan)., Though this is more time consuming, a knife is a nice substitute for a vegetable peeler.









Hold a small chunk of cheese against the surface of a plate. Gently slice off thin shreds onto the plate.
Opt for a plain edge rather than a serrated edge. Plain edge knives are better at shaving and skinning.Avoid holding large blocks of cheese. Since knife work is more dangerous than other grating options, you want to have a steady and firm grip on the cheese.
 For quick and easy shredded cheese, a food processor is the optimal choice.


Refrigerate your cheese until it is firm but not too hard. Chop it into smaller blocks and place it in your food processor.Be cautious about overloading your processor. Some food processor blades have seized up or become unbalanced when grating cheese.Turn the food processor on and monitor the shape of the cheese shreds. Once you have shredded the cheese to your liking, turn off the processor and empty it onto a plate.
If your processor has a shredding disk, select this blade as it will provide better quality slices.
Avoid processing softer cheeses such as Mozzarella. This will result in smeared, not shredded, cheese.,

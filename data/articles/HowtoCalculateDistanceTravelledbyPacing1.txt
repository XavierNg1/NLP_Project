 To find out what your pacing is, you will need some way to measure the distance you are going to cover. Some parks and cycling tracks have distances marked on the ground. A running track could also serve the purpose. Locate such a measuring resource so that you can work out your pacing using the following steps.;
, Double steps has the advantage of being half the number of steps to count!

, Choose a suitable length to check yourself against â€“ 200 meters or 200 yards is a good distance to calculate your pacing fairly accurately.
 When you reach the end, take note of the number and divide it by 2. You will then get the number of steps you take to cover 100 meters or 109 yards.


Somewhere between 55 to 70 double pacing steps is normal for most people. If you are using yards, 60 to 76 double paces is the normal range.
 Calculate your pacing for 100 meters or 109 yards and check to see if it is the same. If it is not the same, average the number to find your usual level of pacing. If needed, you could pace another distance to confirm your pacing.

 Maybe try to have a large permanent exhibition, and have a couple small temporary ones, so guests have something new to see each time. Try too choose theme which interests you or is relevant to subject of you objects. For ancient artifacts maybe archaeology, For taxidermy maybe the diversity of life. For rocks and minerals, maybe the Earth. For fossils, maybe prehistoric life or geology.

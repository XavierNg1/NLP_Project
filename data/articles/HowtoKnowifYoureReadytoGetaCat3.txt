 Cats do well in smaller spaces, so they’re great pets if you live in an apartment. However, you should check with your landlord before getting a cat and, if necessary, check or amend your lease to verify that your apartment is pet-friendly.You might be responsible for a one-time or recurring pet fee, so make sure to fit any applicable fees into your budget.
 Before you get a cat, you need to make sure you can cat-proof your home. Cover electrical outlets, make sure furniture won’t tip over, remove knick knacks that your climbing cat might knock over, and keep small choking hazards (like thumbtacks, rubber bands, and paperclips) inaccessible., Check all of your home’s windows and make sure their parts are in solid order. Make sure screens are secure for windows that you open, and that the window won’t slam shut and injure your cat. Make sure all of your HVAC ducts are sealed tightly so your cat won’t be able to hide or get lost in your duct system., Avoid leaving medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen out and take care not to drop any pills, as these drugs are deadly for cats. Store cleaning products and other chemicals in tightly closing cupboards, and consider using a baby guard so your cat can’t open the cupboard door.If you intend to let your cat out of the house, take special care to clean up antifreeze puddles under your car. Antifreeze is particularly harmful to cats.

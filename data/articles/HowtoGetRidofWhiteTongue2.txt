 Dehydration and dry mouth can cause white tongue. By staying hydrated, you can guard against it.


The amount of water you need per day will vary with your body weight, activity levels, and the climate you live it. Be sure to drink regularly. Once you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated.
Monitor yourself for other signs of dehydration such as infrequent urination, dark urine, exhaustion, or headaches.
 Smoking can contribute to the inflammation of the bumps on your tongue, making it easier for debris and dead cells to get trapped between them. This creates an excellent environment for bacteria to grow in.


The smoke also contains chemicals which are unhealthy for the tissues in your mouth.
 Excessive drinking can also cause the bumps on your tongue to become inflamed.


Drinking alcohol also makes you prone to dehydration, another cause of white tongue.
 This will help reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth.


Brush your teeth and tongue promptly after every meal.
Brush your teeth and tongue before going to bed.
Use an antiseptic mouthwash daily.

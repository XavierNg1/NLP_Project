,, We are interested to know the angle x formed where the the two side c's meet. Thinking about it, the original triangle was made of 180 degrees with the angle on the right at the far end of b, called theta, and the other angle at the top of a, being 90 degrees minus theta, as all the angles total 180 degrees and we already have one 90 degree angle.
 At the bottom, we haveÂ  theta, at the top left we have 90 degrees, and the top right we have 90 degrees minus theta.


The mystery angle x is 180 degrees. So theta + 90 degrees-theta + x = 180 degrees. Adding theta and negative theta gives us zero on the left, and subtracting 90 degrees from both sides leaves x equal to 90 degrees. So we have established that the mystery angle x = 90 degrees.
 First, the formula for a trapezoid is A= the Height x (Base1 + Base 2)/2. The height is a+b and (Base1 + Base 2)/2 = 1/2(a + b). So that all equals 1/2 (a+b)^2.
 We have the two smaller triangles at bottom and left, and those together equal 2*1/2(a*b), which just equals (a*b). Then we also have 1/2 c*c, or 1/2 c^2. So together we have the other formula for the area of the trapezoid equaling (a*b)+ 1/2 c^2.
 1/2(a+b)^2=(a*b)+1/2 c^2. Now multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the 1/2's
2(1/2 (a+b)^2) = 2((a*b)+ 1/2 c^2.) which simplifies as (a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2.
 to obtain a^2 + b^2 = c^2, The Pythagorean Theorem!

 You have two options for preparing the cucumbers, which will be used instead of the bread for this tuna sandwich. If you are making appetizer sandwiches, you should simply peel and then slice the cucumber horizontally, into quarter inch slices. This option will give you a greater number of smaller tuna sandwiches. Alternately, if you want to make a sub style tuna sandwich, you can halve the cucumbers lengthwise. Then, scoop out the seeds and flesh to make little boats, where you will put the tuna mix. Poke the inside a bit with a fork, so that the cucumber absorbs more of the flavor., In a medium sized bowl, whisk the mustard, vinegar, salt and black pepper. Then, slowly whisk in the olive oil. Finally, pour the vinaigrette onto the cucumber., Start by draining the tuna fish. Rinse it well with cold water, and then put it aside. In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, yogurt, dill, celery leaves, scallions, celery, lemon zest, quarter teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper. Throw the tuna into the bowl and then mix to combine all ingredients., If you are making the appetizer version, place a dollop of tuna mix and then a few sprouts on top of each slice of cucumber. Then, add another slice on top for a cute little sandwich. If you are making the sub style tuna sandwich, fill the cucumber boats with the tuna mixture and then add the sprouts. Add the other half of the cucumber on top. Eat and enjoy!

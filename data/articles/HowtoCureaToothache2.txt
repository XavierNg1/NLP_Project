 If the toothache is caused by a major infection or tooth decay, it won't go away on its own. You should see a doctor or dentist if you experience the following symptoms along with the toothache:









A fever and chills. This could be a sign that the infection is serious and the symptoms will get worse.Discharge. Again, you don't want to risk letting a bad infection get worse.Pain that grows worse and won't go away, even after taking medication. You could have a cavity that gets worse after every meal.
The pain is in a wisdom tooth. Many people have to get their wisdom teeth removed if the teeth grow in at an angle that crowds the mouth.
You have trouble swallowing or breathing, which may be caused by an abscess.
 If you have a cavity that is exposing the nerves of your teeth, leading to pain, the dentist may decide to put in a filling to protect the nerves in the pulp from getting overstimulated.
 If you have a dental abscess, which happens when the pulp of the tooth gets infected, a root canal will be performed. The dentist cleans the inside of the tooth to get rid of the infection. Since this procedure may be painful, the mouth is numbed with local anesthesia beforehand, especially if the dentist performs a surgical drainage of the abscess through the gum.
 In some cases the tooth is beyond repair, and the best course is to get it taken out. In the case of baby teeth, an extraction is almost always performed, since the teeth are going to fall out eventually anyway.








Adults who get an extraction often get bridges or dental implants to make up for the lost tooth.
In the case of wisdom teeth, tooth extraction is almost always performed because the functional advantage is not always one of the best and the position of the tooth does not allow for a proper root canal treatment. In some cases, when patients are scared or the wisdom tooth is severely impacted, patients can be put under general anesthesia. Recovery takes a week or so.

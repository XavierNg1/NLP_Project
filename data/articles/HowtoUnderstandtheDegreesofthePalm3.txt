 If the life line is clearly marked and encircles a firm Venus in a wide arc, reaching well across the hand, the person will have plenty of energy and staying power. Conversely, if the life line is weak and hugs close to the thumb, the person will have little energy.
 If the Mount of Venus is full, but flabby, the person will have great ideas but will never get around to doing any of them. When things go wrong, this individual will always blame others rather than him or herself.

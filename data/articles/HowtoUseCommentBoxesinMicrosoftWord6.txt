 See the step in "Displaying Your Comments" about choosing the correct display view for instructions on doing this.
 Again, see "Displaying Your Comments" for instructions for your version of Word.
 You can choose to display and print the comments made by all reviewers of the document or only comments made by a single reviewer. The method varies slightly according to your version of Microsoft Word.


In Word 2003, select Show on the Reviewing toolbar, then select Reviewers and select either Show All Reviewers to display the comments of every reviewer or select the identifier for a specific reviewer to display only that reviewer's comments.
In Word 2007 and 2010, select Show Markup from the Tracking group in the Review menu ribbon and select either All Reviewers from the Reviewers submenu to display the comments of every reviewer or select the identifier for a specific reviewer to display only that reviewer's comments.
 Display the Print dialog box in your version of Word and select "Document showing markup" to print the selected comments along with the document.


To access the Print dialog box in Word 2003, select Print from the File menu.
To access the Print dialog box in Word 2007, click the Microsoft Office button in the upper left and select "Print" from the menu.
To access the Print dialog box in Word 2010, click the File tab and select "Print" from the File menu at the left edge of the page.
To print the document without the comments, select "Document" from the Print dialog box.

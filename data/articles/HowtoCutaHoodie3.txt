 For this method, you will want to use a hoodie that is already fitted and has a zipper. This method will create a womenâ€™s slung back tank top hoodie.
, Use a fabric pen and a straight edge to make several guide marks.
, You will excise both arms. You can discard them now, or save them for future projects.


If you want a hoodie vest, you can stop at this point.
 Smooth it onto your table.
 Make a straight cut across the back of the sweatshirt from 1 mark to the other mark.


This cut will create an open back look. It will sling low along the waistband.
Make sure you only cut through the back layer of fabric.
 It will extend at the back of the arm cut you just made across the back and to the other side. Discard the back panel of the sweatshirt.
 Unzip it, place your arms through the back and zip it up. You can wear it to reveal your back or over another layer of clothing.

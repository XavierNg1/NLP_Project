 You can throw the pillows in a dryer with something like a tennis ball. Even just running the pillow through the dryer should fluff it up. You could put your pillows in the dryer once a month.Put the tennis ball in a sock, tie the sock at the end, and throw them both in a dryer for a few minutes. The pillow will be fluffed and perfect for a good night’s sleep. Try this method only if you haven’t been able to fluff the pillow by hand.For cotton fill pillows, put the pillow in a dryer on low for 20 minutes, as this will take the place of you hitting your pillow repeatedly. The pillows should be completely dry when you remove them, and you can fluff them more by doing the fist blows. Use a low heat or air setting., Usually pillows lose their volume because of moisture, so the sun can help dry them and increase fluffiness.


When fluffing pillows by hand (patting and molding the pillow) doesn’t do the trick, you should leave your pillow out in the sun for a couple of hours. You could hang the pillows outside on a clothes line, if you have one.
About three to four hours should be enough time to make sure the sun absorbs the moisture. By the way, it’s also possible to wash your pillows, depending on the type of pillow.

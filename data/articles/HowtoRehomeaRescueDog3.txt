 Don't give your dog too much excitement at first. Let your dog get used to its new surroundings before you start having it spend time with the whole family at once. Also, keep in mind that some objects may be triggering to your dog if it was in an abusive home, including newspapers, leashes, and collars. You'll need to be patient., You shouldn't try to socialize your dog in the first couple of days. However, having your close friends and family come over several times in the first couple of weeks gives your new dog a chance to get to know them before settling into a routine of "friend" and "stranger."Keep the visits low-key. Don't force interaction. Rather, let your dog approach each person as they come in.
 Start by encouraging positive behaviors. For instance, when the dog asks to go outside to the bathroom, give it a treat. If you notice it lays down in the backroom for some quiet time, give it a treat. Treats will let the dog know that you like those behaviors.After a time, you can start working on commands, such as sit.
Stick to the same commands. That is, make a list of the commands you will use for each action, and then post that list on the fridge or somewhere everyone can see. You don't want to confuse your dog by switching commands all the time., If you are having problems with your new dog, don't just give up. Instead, talk with the rescue. They may be able to provide you with the support you need, such as helping you learn what to do about behavioral problems. Try to work through a solution before returning the dog to the rescue.

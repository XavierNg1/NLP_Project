 While this may result in discounts over the years, you can also suggest that the newspaper or magazine contact you if they have last-minute ad space that they want to fill for a discount. A large ad may be marked down by 75 percent.


The ad will have to be ready at all times, so it should be a general ad. Getting a $700 back page ad for $100 might be 1 of the lowest and best investments you can make in print advertising.
 Many people pay extra to have publications design their ads. You can buy a "do it yourself" graphic design program, take classes or strike a deal with a graphic designer that you trust. Any of these options will likely save you money in the long run, and you have better control over your business' image.
 Purchasing a smaller ad and rerouting people to social media or website advertising allows you to save money on print ads and ramp up your online advertising. Offer a link to a contest on your website or a limited-time coupon offer to encourage people to visit.


Online advertising is often thought of as being less expensive than print advertising. In the case of social media, many businesses already put hours into creating attractive accounts, so funneling potential customers there may increase your following and reduce print costs.
 Gather a list of advertising managers at local publications. Bring a business proposal to them, where they would receive a percentage of sales for everyone who calls because of their ad.


Pay-per-call advertising is not used by every publication. It often requires a high percentage of sales, such as 50 percent, so be ready to negotiate.
 There are often pre-arranged discounts for these options, so negotiate a better price for the ad you want.


A pre-designed ad is often referred to as a "camera-ready ad."

 Wash 2 avocados and slice them in half lengthwise. Pop out the pits and discard them. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado halves out of the peels. Place the avocado flesh on a cutting board and dice them into small bites. Set the avocado aside.Keep the empty avocado halves on your work space. You'll fill these with the caprese salad.
 Wash about 1/2 cup (74 g) of cherry tomatoes and use a sharp knife to cut them in half. Place the halved tomatoes in a mixing bowl. You should also get out 1/2 cup (56 g) of mini marinated mozzarella balls and slice each ball in half. Put the mozzarella in the bowl with the cherry tomatoes.You may want to use a small serrated knife to cut the cherry tomatoes. This will keep the tomatoes from getting squished.
 Add the diced avocado to the mixing bowl and drizzle a little balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil over the salad. Toss the salad and sprinkle it with a little salt and pepper.Since caprese salads aren't cooked, try to use high-quality balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. You'll really be able to taste the quality since the ingredients are simply prepared.
 Divide the caprese salad among the four avocado halves. Take several fresh basil leaves and use a sharp knife to carefully cut them into thin strips. Scatter the thin strips of basil over the stuffed avocados.Consider serving the caprese stuffed avocados with toasted flatbread.

, What you just drew is the coastline.
 It is almost a triangle (but not quite one) with one point facing west. Draw the Dead Sea about 2 inches (5 cm) south of Lake Galilee. The Dead Sea is an elongated oval, and on the lower eastern shore, there is a curve coming inward.
 The Jordan River is a line that isn't completely straight, between Lake Galilee and the Dead Sea. Draw the part of the Jordan River that is north of Lake Galilee by drawing a straight line about 3/4 of an inch.
 Slightly south-west of the Dead Sea is where you will find the southern part of the coastline. Where the coastline ends in the south, draw one straight line to the south-east. The straight line should be about 4 1/2 inches long. Where it ends, draw a line that goes about 1/2 of a centimeter to the east.
,, Then it will turn north-east. Draw a straight line moving south-east.
 Then draw a line that is attached to the line that you just drew, that hits the end of Lake Galilee. You just drew the Golan Heights. The shape of Israel is now complete.
 Draw a line coming out of the southern part of the coastline one inch, and draw a line moving south-west from there until it hits the Israel's border.
 It will be very difficult to explain how to draw that, so just follow the picture. This step is optional.
 This step is optional.

 A healthy cat may urinate two to three times a day. Straining to urinate because of a bladder infection, bladder stones or a blockage are serious problems and very different than constipation. Check your cat’s litter box to see how much he is urinating every day.;
, If your cat is spending a lot of time in the litter box, he may be constipated, but he may instead have diarrhea. Cats will spend a long time squatting in the litter box if they have diarrhea. They may produce only a small amount of feces, which could be misinterpreted as constipation.


A healthy cat will defecate about once a day. The cat’s stool should be firm and hold its shape.Many times, it may appear that your cat is constipated, but there are other conditions that look similar at first. You will need to watch your cat closely to make sure there is not a different problem present.
 Your cat may have one or more of the following symptoms; if so, contact your vet to consult about possible constipation in your cat.Straining when trying to defecate
Small, hard, or dry stool
Stool covered in mucous or blood
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Lethargy
Vomiting
Signs of abdominal discomfort

, If you are noticing your cat is spending a long time in the litter box or if you suspect constipation, take him in for an examination with your veterinarian right away. Your vet will be able to determine if your cat needs medication or a diet change, such as a switch to special high-fiber cat food.


Do not leave a constipated cat too long before seeing the vet - it could be a sign of something far more serious than just a passing bout of constipation. The cat can develop many problems from retaining and staining to eliminate stool, including blocked colon and megacolon (an enlarged colon).

 Heat 4 tablespoons (55 g) of butter in a large pot over medium heat. Carefully dice one small onion and mince one garlic clove with a sharp knife. Add these to the pot of melted butter. Saute the onion and garlic for 3 to 5 minutes.The onion should be tender and almost translucent. The garlic should be fragrant.
 Stir in 1/4 cup (20 g) of flour to the sauteed onion and garlic. Continue to stir and cook the roux for 3 to 4 minutes. It should thicken up and turn pale in color. Slowly whisk in 1 cup (240 ml) of half-and-half until the mixture is smooth.You'll need to stir or whisk the roux constantly to avoid lumps. If you do end up with a few lumps, don't worry since you'll be pureeing the soup.
 Whisk in 4 cups (1 liter) of vegetable or chicken broth along with 1 bay leaf, salt, and pepper (to taste). Once the soup begins to bubble, reduce the heat to medium-low so that it's simmering. Simmer the soup for about 10 minutes.Keep the soup uncovered as it cooks and stir it occasionally to keep the soup from sticking to the pot.
 Chop 1 1/4 pounds of broccoli florets and stems. You should end up with about 4 cups of diced broccoli. You'll also need to peel and dice 1 large carrot or two carrots, if they're small. Add the chopped vegetables to the soup and simmer the soup for 15 to 20 minutes.Taste the soup at this point and add salt and pepper. You can also take out the bay leaf.
 Puree the soup using a blender or handheld immersion blender. Make the soup as smooth as you like. Pour the soup back into the pot on the stove and add 8 ounces (about 2 1/2 cups) of coarsely grated sharp cheddar cheese. Whisk the cheese in till it melts.Since the broccoli should be completely tender, you can leave some chunks for a more textured soup.

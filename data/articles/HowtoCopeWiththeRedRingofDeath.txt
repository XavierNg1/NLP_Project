 As simple as this sounds, it's not that easy. Just do something else, such as an alternative hobby. This will occupy your time.;
, If you had an original Xbox or any other console, try playing those. If you have a good PC then that is your best alternative, because you can download game demos.
 If your friend has a system that you would like to play on, than ask to go to their place.
 Often the Xbox 360 (as well as any other console) has become the relationship strainer. If you have a wife or girlfriend, than why not use your spare time to do something special for them?

, If you're going to mope, it makes minutes turn into hours, stay positive.

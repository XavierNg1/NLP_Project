 The best sources for scrap aluminum are old machine parts. Car cylinder heads, transmission cases, water pump housings and pistons are all great examples. More common sources are things like beer and pop cans, furniture frames, home siding, window frames, and turkey and pie pans. However, these sources tend to be weaker alloys that have lots of impurities, which means that they create more slag and oxidize quickly.An easy way to melt aluminum cans and prevent oxidizing is to add them to a pool of already molten aluminum.
 When you are working around extremely high temperatures, it is important to wear proper safety gear. When handling molten metal you should wear a thick shirt, pants, an apron, a face shield or glasses, and leather gloves. These things will prevent molten metal from burning your skin. Because molten aluminum can give off noxious gasses, you should also wear a mask., When working with molten aluminum, some alloys will give off noxious fumes. Because of this you will want to work in a well-ventilated space or outdoors. This will also help keep you cool while working around extreme heat and avoid dehydration or heat stroke.If you begin feeling sick, have a headache, or are dizzy, turn down the foundry and take a break. Go to a cool place and drink some water.
 Before you begin melting aluminum, make sure that you have the necessary tools for handing molten metal. You will need a pair of metal tongs, a metal strainer or stirring rod, a crucible, and a foundry. Things like the foundry and crucible can be made at home or bought at a store or online., Because of the relatively low temperature necessary to melt aluminum, it can be melted in a variety of unsafe methods outside of a foundry. Avoid melting aluminum in large bonfires or on BBQ grills. These methods are less controlled and can lead to a fire or injury.








If you are new to working with molten metals, be sure to work with a more experienced person before attempting to melt aluminum.

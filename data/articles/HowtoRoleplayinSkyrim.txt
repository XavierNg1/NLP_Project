 Before you actually create your character, you should have an idea of what you want to do. Do you want to play a mage who came to Skyrim for the College of Winterhold, or an easygoing hunter who lives off the land? Think of what you enjoy doing in the game, and try to combine that with things you haven't done before.;
, What views does your character have on events in the game, such as the main quest or the civil war? Are they kind or cruel? What race are they? What do they do for a living? Why are they in Skyrim? Depending on your race, take into consideration their views on other races, cultures, and environments. For example, if you are a dark elf (dunmer) think about how your character views the cold, compared to his homeland of fire and ash.
 Give them a motivation, a reason for everything they do. Make up their past, their family, their childhood - things that will affect their actions in the present. Add little details like phobias or odd things they do. This is one of the most important steps. Come up with a reason for why they are where/how they are when the game starts.
 In Skyrim, design your character's physical appearance as you see fit. Give them a name - you may want to choose a name that makes sense for their race, but any name you like will do - and start playing.
 Don't just take every quest or make decisions you would make if you were in the same situation - this is not you, this is your character. Try to see the world from their perspective and do things the way they would. Also, when you do take quests, try to complete the quest the way your character would. Maybe, instead of slaying every living thing in a dungeon, your character will sneak past and loot all the items while they aren't looking. Skyrim is a huge game and there are many ways to play.

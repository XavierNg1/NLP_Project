 Visit the toilet as soon as you feel the need for a bowel movement. Delaying the visit worsens constipation., Straining on the toilet can lead to painful complications such as hemorrhoids or anal fissures. Go easy on your digestive system by giving it time to move on its own.


Try visiting the toilet 15â€“45 minutes after breakfast each day.You may not pass a bowel movement daily (even when healthy), but this is a good time to encourage it.
 One study shows that squatting makes bowel movements easier and faster.For people who cannot feasibly squat over their toilet, try the following:Lean forward with your hands on your thighs.
Put your feet on a step stool to bring your knees above your hips.
Instead of straining, take a deep breath with your mouth open. Let your stomach expand, then tighten muscles slightly to hold it in place. Relax your sphincter.
Repeat this breathing exercise no more than three times. If there's still no bowel movement, get off the toilet or pick up some reading material.
 Exercise can stimulate your bowels, even if it's just a 10 minute walk several times a day. Aerobic exercise such as running or swimming is particularly effective.


Wait one hour following a big meal before strenuous exercise (enough to increase your heart rate), or you could slow your digestion., This is another form of light exercise that can aid digestion. Some people find yoga particularly effective, perhaps because it stretches the abdomen.

 Follow the instructions as they pop up on the software interface, if you haven’t enabled debugging mode before, then enable it now as per the instructions.
 Rooting has its own share of advantages but things may go wrong, leading to certain undesirable consequences. Therefore, make sure you know what you are doing so that you don't end up experiencing any unwanted troubles.
 Once you are done, click on Root. It won’t take longer than 3 to 5 minutes. Once the process is on, do not touch or unplug the USB cable, or perform any type of function on your device.

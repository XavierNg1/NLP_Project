 Take your sweater and place it on a flat surface. Make sure there are no bumps or wrinkles.
 Take one of the sweaters arms and bring it over to the opposite arm. Make your fold as clean and sharp as you can.









Fold directly down the center of the sweater.
 Use a wooden or plastic hangar as these are more gentle on clothes. Place your hanger on top of your sweater, with the hanger hook facing down from the armpit.Use only flat hangers.
 Take the bottom hem of the sweater and fold it down over the hanger arm. Take the arms of the sweater and do the same.








Make sure the sweater is tightly folded over the hanger.
Starting with the arms or the body of the sweater will make no difference.
 Hanging your sweater with the folds you made will prevent wrinkles or hanger marks from appearing. Save your sweater from stretching out by using this method.









Hang your sweater to save space and avoid wrinkles.

 You will be brought to Gameloft’s support page for all its games and the related issues.
 This will filter out only issues related to the game.
 A list of known issues will be displayed on your screen. Check if your issue is already listed; if so, there is no need to bother with reporting a hacker or cheater. If you don’t see your issue listed, proceed to the next step.
 Scroll through the bottom of the page until you see a box titled “Was this information helpful?” Click on the “No” button then the “Contact form” button. You will be brought to the form for reporting issues to Gameloft. Populate each field properly, and provide as much detail as possible to aid Gameloft in their investigation and resolution.


Your name, email address, and country will be required; type them in.
Tap on the drop-down list to select your issue. Choose “Report Abuse” for reporting a hacker or cheater.
Under the Game field, select “Spider-Man Unlimited” from Gameloft’s list of games.
Type the username of the hacker or cheater you’re reporting under the Reported User field. You can get the username from the leaderboards.
The last field in the form is for “Description.” Type in all the relevant details of your suspected hacker or cheater here. Share the Event name or Daily Leaderboard, dates, and other details.
 You can upload up to three screenshots related to your reported user’s activities. It will be good if you’ve captured the Event or Daily Leaderboard scores he got and his user profile to show abnormal statistics.


Choose the files from your computer and upload them with the form. These screenshots will help Gameloft in investigating the suspected activities.
 Your report will be sent to Gameloft’s customer care for investigation.

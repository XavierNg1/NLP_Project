In the first week, you choose only one exercise which you will perform 4-5 sets of (all to be followed with 45 seconds of rest between sets)
In the second week, you choose another exercise which you will perform 4-5 sets of(all to be followed with 45 seconds of rest between sets)
In the third week, you choose another exercise which you will perform 4-5 sets of(all to be followed with 45 seconds of rest between sets)
In the fourth week, you choose another exercise which you will perform 4-5 sets of(all to be followed with 45 seconds of rest between sets)
After the first 4 weeks, your program will change; now you pick three exercises, one exercise for each workout. Now you raise it to 5 sets, to failure, and 1 minute of rest in between sets. Every week you mix your program so it's never the same.
After the first 8 weeks, your program will once again change; now you will do all of the four exercises in every workout, but in every workout you do the exercises in a different order to keep the diversity in the training.
Take 3 days of rest and do another test, taking as many push-ups as possible' the progress you've made will be obvious. If you still haven't reached 100 push-ups (which most people won't have after the first time they finished the program), then repeat the cycle.

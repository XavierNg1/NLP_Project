 If the table comes from another source (meaning you didn’t create it) you need to create a source line below the figure. You’ll place the word “Sources:” first, then make a regular Chicago reference.


That is, the author’s name (inverted), the title in italics (period), the city and state of publication (colon), the publisher (comma), and the year (period).
For example: “Red, Jay. Art for Art’s Sake. Alabama, Georgia: Art Publishers, 2004.”
Also include this information on your reference page.
 Number your tables from the beginning of the paper to the end in order; figures should have their own series of consecutive numbers. .
 Create a descriptive title for the table. Write the description in the paragraph before introducing the table. Refer to the table by its number, such as “table 1.”

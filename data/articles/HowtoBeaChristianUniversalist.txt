 For example, Evangelical Universalism emphasizes the Bible very strongly, Charismatic Universalism does so with God's will, and Liberal Universalists believe that reason and conscience are important in one's spiritual life. And many people combine different aspects from these traditions.;
, Most believe that Hell is for reconciliation, and emphasize that it isn't eternal. But a few are 'Ultra-Universalists', or believe that Hell isn't a literal place after death. Instead, they see that reconciliation with God occurs during this life on Earth.
 The latter is non-creedal, while most Christian Universalist groups have some sort of creed or doctrine to go by. But Christian Universalism is welcomed in Unitarian Universalist congregations, however.
 Even if you don't put a lot of emphasis on it, it's still a good idea to read it. This will help you not only strengthen your beliefs, but also help you defend them if you must. Even the most liberal Christians appreciate a good biblical argument. Plus, it might inspire you.
 Doing so will strengthen your beliefs further, and help you find inspiration.

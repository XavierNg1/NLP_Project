 The most common side effects in cats that are given Gabapentin are mild sedation and ataxia (i.e. loss of control of bodily movements). Call your veterinarian if you are concerned that your cat’s symptoms may be too severe or dangerous (e.g. putting your cat at risk for injury). Your cat’s cancer, cancer treatments, or other medications may also be causing side effects, which your veterinarian will best be able to assess., Monitor your cat while it is on Gabapentin to assess the drug’s effectiveness in treating pain. If your pet is experiencing intense pain as a result of its cancer or cancer treatment, it may require a more intense pain reliever (e.g. a strong opioid drug like morphine). Call your vet if your cat’s discomfort does not seem to improve after several days on Gabapentin., If you choose to stop giving your cat Gabapentin, discontinue it gradually over a period of two to three weeks. Stopping the medication abruptly can cause rebound pain or seizures, in some cases. If your cat is on a higher dosage of Gabapentin, ask your veterinarian about switching to a lower dose temporarily to taper off the medication, or administer it less frequently (e.g. once a day instead of every 12 hours).

 Even if you do your best to avoid mono, you still may catch it. Recognizing symptoms early can help curb how long the illness lingers. Some common symptoms of mono include:


fatigue
sore throat
fever
swollen lymph nodes
swollen tonsils.
 If you have symptoms of mono, the only way to find out for sure is to get tested and confirm the presence of the virus in your blood stream. There are two main tests for mono:Mono spot test (heterophile antibody test). This is a test that screens for antibodies that form during certain infections. A blood sample is looked at under a microscope and if heterophile antibodies are in the sample, the blood will clump. This usually indicates mono.
EBV antibody test. This too, is a blood test that will show antibodies present against EBV. They can use a variety of methods to look at the specific types of antibodies to determine whether you were infected recently or a while ago.
Mono tests may not be accurate in the first days or week of infection. Your body needs time to build up the antibodies to the infection. By two weeks, they are usually accurate.
 If you get back a test showing you have mono, your doctor may have medications for you to begin taking. Antibiotics are not effective, but in some cases, steroids can be used to help fight tertiary symptoms. But it may also help to take your own precautions.Get plenty of rest, maybe even bed rest if the illness is bad enough.
Gargle with salt water or use throat lozenges for a sore throat.
Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and relieve a sore throat and headaches.
Avoid contact sports and heavy lifting.
Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.

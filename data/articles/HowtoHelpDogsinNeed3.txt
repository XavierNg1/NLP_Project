 Use your social media accounts (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr) to bring awareness to dogs in need by sharing fundraising events and adoption profiles for local rescue organizations. Set your privacy settings for these posts to public so that they can be shared again and viewed by as many people as possible. Posts with cute pictures or videos are especially likely to be viewed, circulated, and shared widely., Signing or circulating petitions is a good way to help protect animal rights by proposing specific changes (e.g. legislature to outlaw puppy mills). Make sure that the petition is aimed towards the appropriate decision-makers, details its cause and goal articulately, and emphasizes the importance of getting signatures. Start and share online petitions on a website like Change.org, or circulate a printed petition throughout your community.Visit the Human Society of the U.S.' website at http://www.humanesociety.org/about/departments/legislation/ for more information about state and federal legislation that may support or inspire a petition.
 Be on the lookout for stray dogs, or dogs that you suspect might be abused or neglected. Contact local no kill rescue organizations if you see a stray that needs care and shelter. Call the police or an animal advocacy group if you witness a dog being harmed or mistreated.Visit the Animal Legal & Historical Center of Michigan University's website at https://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-reporting-animal-cruelty-united-states to see a comprehensive table detailing where to report animal abuse, state-by-state.

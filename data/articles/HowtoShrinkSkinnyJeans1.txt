 Change the settings on your washing machine to put it on the hottest water setting. Put the jeans in the washing machine by themselves and allow them to wash like normal.You can add a small amount of laundry detergent, but itâ€™s not necessary.


The hot water will make the fibers in the jeans contract, therefore shrinking them.
This method works best on jeans that are 100% cotton, rather than cotton mixed with a polyester blend or spandex.;
, After washing the jeans, place the jeans in the dryer. Change the dryer settings so the jeans dry on the highest heat setting possible, and allow the jeans to dry for a complete cycle., After drying the jeans, try them on to see if they have shrunk to your satisfaction. If they have not shrunk enough, wash and dry the jeans again to make them shrink even more.


It is very common to wash and dry the jeans multiple times until they shrink down to a satisfactory size. The continuous hot water and hot heat will contract the jean fibers with every wash and every drying cycle.

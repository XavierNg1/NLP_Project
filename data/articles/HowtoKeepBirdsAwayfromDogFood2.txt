 In addition to keeping birds from stealing the food in your dog’s dish, you must keep birds from getting into your dog food supply. A great way to do this is to invest in an animal-proof dog food storage container.One option is the Vittles Vault.
Such storage containers are available at pet stores and online.
 The bag that dog food comes in helps protect the food from oxygen and humidity. Rather than dumping the contents of the bag into a pet food storage container, place the entire bag inside. This will further protect your dog’s food from birds and other animals while helping to keep the food fresh., If birds (or other wildlife) getting into your dog’s food is a serious problem for you, you might consider keeping your dog’s food inside your home. It might also be helpful to feed your dog inside, at least for a period of time, to allow the birds to move on.

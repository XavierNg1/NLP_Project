 Know the game, know your rules and know your deck. If you don't know what you are doing you won't get very far in the tournament and it will be a frustrating experience.Â ;
, Know when the tournament is and how to get there. Some tournaments are small local events, some are larger regional or national events with thousands of players. Also consider the format and make sure the deck you are using fits that format.
 Using a backpack can help you carry all your items. Keep it where you can see it at all times.


A 40 to 60 card deck
Something to keep track of your life points (calculator or pen and paper)
Tokens, dice or coins if your deck requires them.
Trade binder (optional)

, These will help you keep your focus for the entire tournament especially if it is a large event.


Cell phone (In case of an emergency or need to call someone for any reason)
Snacks and water (keep these away from people's cards)
A book or something to entertain you between matches
Tylenol and Pepto (or any other medicine you may need) are good to keep on hand. Most the time you won't need them but if you do you will be very happy to have them.
Luggage locks are great for keeping your stuff safe in your bag.
 Try to go to sleep when you normally would. Forcing yourself to go to sleep usually won't help. Basically don't stay up all night.
 No one wants to hang around someone that smells like a locker room.
 If you don't normally eat breakfast or a large breakfast go with something small. Eating a huge breakfast when your body isn't used to it will just give you a huge stomachache.
 Latecomers are sometimes turned away, especially at regional and pre-release events.

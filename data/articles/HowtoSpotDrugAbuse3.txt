They may fail to show up for significant family, work, or school events again and again.You may have to speak to others to notice repeated absences.

 The worldview of a person abusing drugs closes dramatically. For instance, a typically outgoing, friendly teen may suddenly spend most of their time alone. If you notice your loved one withdrawing from friends or loved ones with no explanation, you may need to watch them more closely., If your friend or family member is abusing drugs, you might find that they have an entirely new social circle. They no longer have time for positive friends and activities. Instead, they may be spending more time with shady figures and hanging out in questionable areas where drugs are frequently sold or used.

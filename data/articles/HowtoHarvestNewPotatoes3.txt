 If you haven't already, you should do so now. Green potatoes can't be eaten or they will make you sick. They turn green when they have had too much light exposure.
 They must be placed in a dark room away from the rain and sun. This gets rid of any dirt and hardens the potatoes up. Keep them here for up to a week.


You can keep them like this for up to a week or only for a couple of days. Make sure they are protected from rain and sunlight.
 You can put them in a simple cardboard box, basket or a hessian sack for storage. The stabbed potatoes should be kept separately so you know to use them first.
 Most people tend to store their potatoes in the garage or shed where no light seeps through. Light will cause the potatoes to turn green or sprout. The area you store the potatoes shouldn't be humid or too hot either.
 This includes refrigerators and freezers. When potatoes are cold they sugar which gives them an unpleasant sweet taste. You don't want to cook with sugared potatoes.
 This is to ensure that none of them are rotting or going green. Once one potato rots it will cause the whole container of potatoes to rot. If the potatoes are going green make sure that sunlight cannot reach them.
 After this time the potatoes may turn bad and no longer edible towards you. 7 months is a good time so be sure to use them up by then. Many recipes can involve potatoes, get creative!

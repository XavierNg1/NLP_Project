 Once iTunes or the App Store is open, if you haven't already, click Sign in and enter your Apple ID username and password.


Contrary to what you might think, you cannot simply change the country or region of your account by switching the flag at the bottom of the featured or home page. Doing so will allow you to browse that country’s iTunes or App Store selection (see Method 3), but it will sign you out of your account. You will not be able to make purchases.
 You may be prompted to enter your Apple ID again.
, Remember, you may only switch to a country for which you have a local billing address on a valid credit card, or for which you have a local gift card. You cannot switch countries if you don't have either a local credit card or gift certificate.Click Change after your country is selected.
, Select the checkbox that says “I have read and agree to these terms and conditions." Click Agree.
 If you have a credit card, enter it now. A valid local gift card should also be acceptable.
 Click Continue.

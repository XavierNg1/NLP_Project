 A table at hip height is ideal. Stand over the can so you can access it easily.;
, Hold the knife so that is vertical, rather than at an angle. Grip the handle such that your fingers won't be in the way of the blade if it slips. The back of your hand should be facing up.


This method is more effective than attempting to saw the lid off using the blade of your knife. That will ruin your knife and potentially leave metal shavings in your food.
Make sure the knife is completely extended and locked into place, so it won't slip.
This method can also be done with a chisel or another sturdy, thin object similar to a pocket knife.
 Use your second hand to lightly smack the back of the hand that's gripping the knife handle. This gentle smacking motion will cause the tip of the knife to puncture the lid of the can.


Do not smack too hard. You don't want to lose control of the knife.
Smack with your hand open, and connect with your palm. This will help you maintain control.
 Position the tip of the knife a few centimeters over and repeat the technique to puncture the can again.
 Circle the entire lid, as you would with a can opener. The lid should now be loose.
 Slip the tip of the knife into one of the holes. Use it to pry the lid off. Gently pull the lid from the can.


If necessary, use a smaller knife to saw through remaining connected parts of the lid.
Cover your hand with a towel or your sleeve before prying off the lid. This will protect your hand from getting scratched by the lid.

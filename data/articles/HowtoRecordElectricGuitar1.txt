 Recording the sound of your electric guitar by miking your amp is a great way to simulate studio quality sound. However, this will require expensive equipment, like a quality amp, microphone, and potentially sound dampening equipment or material. On the other hand, you can plug your guitar right into a DI to record your guitar.A limitation of using a DI is the somewhat sterile nature of the recording it produces. A DI will only record the sound of your guitar, without any effects or normal speaker distortion.;
, You'll need a program or machine that can interpret the recording you make and convert it into a suitable format. This kind of technology usually has the added benefit of allowing you to edit the sound you will record.DAWs and sound production software cover a range of features. Some are free, and some can be over $800 in cost.The most suitable DAW/software depends entirely on your purposes and situation.
 Even with the best equipment adjusted to optimal settings, if you forget to tune your guitar, your recording probably won't turn out like you want. You may also want to replace your strings, as new strings create a brighter tone and have better sustain.Finger sliding can make unwanted squeaks while recording. Apply fretboard lubricant to your guitar beforehand to help prevent these from occurring.

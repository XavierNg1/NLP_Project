 Find a clean, one-liter plastic container like a Tupperware. The container should be able to withstand the heat of boiling water. Add one teaspoon of sea salt to the container. Fill the rest of the container with boiling water. Allow the mixture to cool until it is very warm., Once the water has cooled to a temperature that is still very warm, place the container on a table. Sit in a chair next to the table and lean over the container. Submerge your ear entirely in the water. Keep it submerged for 5 minutes. Repeat twice daily.
 If you donâ€™t want to fully submerge your ear, you can clean the piercing with a cotton makeup pad instead. Soak the cotton pad in the sea salt solution and apply the pad to your ear for five minutes. Repeat twice daily.
 After you have soaked your piercing in the sea salt solution, you will need to allow it to dry. Let the piercing completely air dry after the soak. Do not touch the piercing between cleanings.

 Stores stock up on holiday themed items throughout the holiday season. These, however, are less salable after Christmas has passed. Stores often sell decorations after the holidays on clearance.


This technique requires a little bit of foreknowledge. But if you suspect next year might require a stricter budget, wait until this year's holidays are over, and buy some ornaments on the cheap.
 Garage and rummage sales are generally a spring or summertime affair, but many families use these sales to offload old or unwanted decorations. These are often priced incredibly low, and are a great place to get traditional ornaments at a reduced cost.
 Many holiday decorations find their way to secondhand or thrift stores and are sold for a fraction of the original cost. Especially during the holiday season, it's likely that these stores will put out Christmas decorations, which you can hunt through to find suitable pieces for your tree.


Another popular location for inexpensive decorations is your local dollar store. You may want to visit a few different stores, since they'll likely carry different items in stock. This way, you'll have a wide selection to choose from.
 Natural trees can add a considerable expense to your holidays. Add to that the fact that you'll have to buy a new natural tree every year, and natural trees can really strain your budget. Artificial trees can be found at most general retailers.


When choosing an artificial tree, choose a bold color, like white, red, magenta, or turquoise. These colors will add pop to your holiday decor.
Bold colored artificial trees will make a big impact. This means you can buy a smaller artificial tree, which are generally less expensive than larger ones.

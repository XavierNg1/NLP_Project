 This is a sophisticated night, so be on your best behavior. Show up on time and alert the restaurant if your party is running late. Pull out your date’s chair if you can. Be mindful of your table manners and tip generously before leaving.If you’re going with a large group, ask everyone to bring cash. It will accelerate the payment process enormously.
Pay for your date’s dinner. It’s the considerate thing to do. If she refuses, split the bill.
 You finally made it. Now, all that’s left to do is enjoy yourself. Dance with your friends, dance with your date, take pictures and video of the evening - whatever it takes to have a good time, do that.Take plenty of pictures, but don't spend the whole evening on your phone or you'll miss out.
Be attentive to your date. Don’t abandon her to run off with your friends the whole evening.
 Prom is a dance, so it goes without saying that you'll be doing some dancing. Don’t worry about how you look – the only thing that matters is cutting loose and making the most of your evening.Expect to dance most of the fast dances in a large group.
For slow dances, hold your date however feels comfortable (and appropriate).
If someone asks you to dance and you're not interested, a simple "No thank you" will suffice.
 Some schools offer after-prom parties, but if yours doesn’t, you’ll need to find an alternative means of entertaining yourself. Stay away from drugs and alcohol – there’s a strong chance that the choices you make on prom night can end up on social media and come back to haunt you. Feel free to lean in for a kiss, but do not pressure your date for sex. Be a respectful gentleman at all times.
For a fun after-prom activity, build a bonfire in someone’s backyard (safely). Or stay up all night and make breakfast the next morning.

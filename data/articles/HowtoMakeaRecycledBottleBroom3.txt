 Be sure the bottle tops are aligned and check that the fit is snug.
 The nail must penetrate through the third bottle plastic and also pierce the other two bottles.









Tap the nail backing off to the side (to avoid having it stick out).
 Space the nails evenly, leaving enough room in the middle to slide the stick or broom handle through the bottle opening.
 The handle mustn't go all the way through, as only the “broom” area should show.
 If any excess nail comes through the other end, tap the end sideways with the hammer to secure the back.

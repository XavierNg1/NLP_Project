 Removing any excess water from the toys on a consistent basis will cut down on the amount of bacteria and dirt that remains on the toys.
 Place the toys on a dry towel or in the sun to ensure they get good ventilation and dry out completely as the moist environment creates an ideal breeding ground for mold and bacteria.
 Boxes for bath toys should be placed outside the bathroom, where there is natural light and good ventilation. A box made with perforated material or mesh is ideal as it allows for good air circulation., As the interior of the toys is the hardest area to clean and to dry, it may be a good idea to seal or close up these holes. You can do this using super glue or a glue gun.If you use a glue gun to seal the holes, be sure not to leave it in the vicinity of children to prevent the risk of burns.
If the toy is wet before you seal it and you do not dry it out, this can lead to the development of bacteria and mold inside the sealed toy. If the toy then breaks or the glue does not stick, your child may be exposed to the infected water. So before you seal the holes, be sure to disinfect and thoroughly dry the toys.Check the sealed holes on the toys periodically to make sure they are glued well, as any loose glue can become a choking hazard.

 Ambrotypes are old photos that often consist of two plates of glass. One plate contains the image while the other, the viewing glass, covers the image. Only clean the viewing glass and only do so if you know which is the viewing glass. The viewing glass should be cleaned with cotton swabs dipped in alcohol. Only do a light wipe down, to rub away any unwanted dirt and grime. Stay away from the corners and sides when cleaning, as you do not want any liquid to seep into the picture and harm the image.If you purchased the image somewhere, the paperwork may inform you which side is the viewing glass. You can sometimes tell by examining the photo carefully. Photographers often used a black lacquer on one side of the glass to darken it. The image is found on the glass opposite the black lacquer.
If you do not know for sure which side is the viewing glass, take your ambrotype to a professional. You can severely damage ambrotype pictures by cleaning the glass that contains the image.
 Daguerreotypes are another antique form of photography from the 19th Century. Due to their extremely delicate nature, daguerrotypes should not be cleaned by amateur collectors. Always take daguerreotypes to a professional for cleaning.You can find a professional in your area by searching online. If you can't find one close by, see if you can find a professional you can work with long distance. Someone may be willing to mail your photos back and forth.
 Vintage cartes and cabinet cards should never be cleaned with liquid. Blow a can of compressed air above these types of photos to remove dirt and debris. If dirt is not removed with compressed air, use a very soft brush to wipe it away using extremely delicate motions.Very dirty cartes and cabinet cards may not come clean with compressed air alone. In this case, seek professional cleaning services.

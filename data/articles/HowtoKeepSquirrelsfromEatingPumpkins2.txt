A thick coat is better than a thin coat. As the theory goes, squirrels do not like the sticky texture of petroleum jelly, so the stickier you make the surface, the better.
You could also use a medicinal, petroleum jelly based vapor rub. These rubs usually have a potent odor, which can serve as a further deterrent for squirrels and other critters.
Petroleum jelly will usually stick to the pumpkin even after the rain, and it may even last for the duration of the season. Check the pumpkin periodically, however, just to make sure that it is not in need of another coat.
 Coat all sides of your pumpkin with lacquer spray. Let dry until hard.


The spray will create a crunchy texture on the surface of the pumpkin. This might be unpleasant for some squirrels, but not for all.
In order to work at all, the spray needs to be applied to all parts of the pumpkin, especially any exposed portions. If the squirrels sense any soft areas, they will still chew the pumpkin up.
A lacquer spray with a potent odor may be more effective than one that dries odorless.
 Thoroughly coat all sides of the pumpkin with hair spray, focusing on areas of exposed flesh.


A thicker coat is better than a thin coat because it will be stickier. The sticky texture of the hair spray is what turns away many squirrels.
Note that you will need to reapply hair spray every day or two, especially after the rain. It can get worn off easily, and once it wears away, there will be nothing left to protect your pumpkin from furry menaces.

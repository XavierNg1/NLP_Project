 Simply aim the nozzle in the direction of the hornet and suck the hornet up.


Be aware that swatting or squashing hornets releases a chemical signal that encourages other hornets to turn up and sting in defense. While this might not be an issue indoors, be careful. And never squash a hornet outdoors!

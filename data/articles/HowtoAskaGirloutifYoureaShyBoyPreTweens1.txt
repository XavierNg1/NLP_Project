 Making eye contact with the girl is a form of talking to her without actually speaking. If you can get her attention and look her in the eye, it'll let her know that you notice her.Follow it up with a smile so that she knows that you like her. Pay attention to how she reacts to you making eye contact and smiling. If she smiles back, it's a good sign that she might be interested in you too.


When you smile, it makes you feel good and can be contagious.Don't stare at her and creep her out. If she makes eye contact with you, hold it for two or three seconds before looking away.Smile as you pass her in the halls or during recess or lunch.;
, Once she notices you and you've made eye contact and smiled at one another a couple of times, you should go out of your way to say hi to her when you see her. Saying hello will make you feel more comfortable talking to her before you have a real conversation.


Don't stay in this phase for too long without introducing yourself or she may just think you're a friendly guy.
Even if she seems confused the first time, keep saying hi in a friendly way, and she will become used to it.
 After you feel good saying hello, you can start talking to her. She will probably already know your name if you're in the same class, so it should make talking to her easier. Figure out what you share in common, like a musician or a TV show. Find the right time to talk, such as during lunch, recess, or when class is over.


You can say something like, "Hey Sandy, my name's Garrett. We are in the same class. How's your day going so far?" or "Hey Joceline, my name's Tony. I noticed you have the new Drake album. Is it good?"
If you get assigned to the same group to do a project, talk to her when you aren't working on the assignment.

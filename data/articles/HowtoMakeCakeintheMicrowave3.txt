 You can use store bought, or make your own frosting. Try chocolate, vanilla, lemon, or any flavor that you like the most. Experiment with different flavors to find your favorite.









Cool the cake fully before trying to put on icing, or the icing will melt.
Make sufficient frosting. It would be better to end up with leftover frosting than to run out before you are done decorating.
 Have the frosting at room temperature. Use a long rubber spatula or spoon to spread frosting over the surface of your cake.
 Slice fresh strawberries thinly and place them on top of the frosting in a pattern or randomly. Brush with seedless jam.You can substitute the strawberries for fresh mango, banana, or any softer fruit you desire.
If you're using fresh fruit, add it at the last minute. If the fruit is wet, it could cause the frosting to move or melt slightly., Sprinkles are a fun way to make a colorful confetti cake. You can also add a pinch of sprinkles to your cake batter before baking.
 Sprinkle a handful of mini marshmallows on top of the cake for a super sweet addition. Dust the marshmallows with a pinch of powdered sugar.
 If you want a chocolate cake with some crunch, break your favorite candy bar into small pieces and drop some on top of the cake. You could sprinkle chocolate chips instead.
 Coconut can be baked in a cake or used to decorate it too. It's a healthier version than sugar sprinkles or sweets and looks great on a cake. Cover the cake in a light frosting and then press coconut into it.


Coconut is so light it can be added to many cakes, from lighter flavors like vanilla and lemon to richer cakes like chocolate and carrot cake.
 You can cover the whole cake, top to bottom or you can sprinkle some on top of the cake.


If you're making a chocolate cake, sweet pecans be a good match.

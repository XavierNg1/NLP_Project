 Spend some time thinking about your contributions to the company over the past year or so (or since your last raise, if you’ve had one). Write down anything that you think is significant. For example, consider whether you have:Successfully completed any important projects.
Saved the company money or helped increase revenue.
Performed above and beyond what was expected of you.
Gotten positive feedback from clients, customers, or supervisors.
 Find out about the typical salary range of other people in similar positions, with similar levels of experience, to yours. Ask around among colleagues to get an idea of how much they are making. You can also consult with your company’s Human Resources department, or check out websites like http://www.payscale.com/ or https://www.glassdoor.com/., Once you have done your research, decide on a reasonable amount to ask for. Make your target salary as specific as possible.Managers are more receptive to specific numbers than ballpark figures. For example, rather than giving a range from $40,000-$45,000, ask for $43,500.
Keep in mind that the average raise is between 1% and 5% of an employee’s current salary. Factor this in when deciding on your target salary.

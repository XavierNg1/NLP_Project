 It's important for the meat and equipment to stay very cold during the entire process of making sausage. If the meat and fat get warm, they will not properly blend, and the resulting sausage will suffer in taste and texture. Clear out your freezer and place the following ingredients and equipment inside:


The pork butt and fat
The meat grinder
The sausage stuffer
Several metal bowls;
, When you begin working with the meat, you have to keep it cold while it's outside the freezer. Set a large metal bowl on your work surface, and fill it halfway with ice. Place a smaller metal bowl on top of the ice and let it get thoroughly cold.
 The pork and fat must be cut into pieces small enough to fit into the meat grinder before you begin. Remove them from the freezer. Use a sharp knife to slice one to two-inch pieces from the bone, and then cut the fat into similar-sized cubes. Place the meat and fat pieces in the iced bowl.
 In a separate bowl, mix the kosher salt, curing salt, pepper, marjoram, sugar, and minced garlic. Add the mixture to the meat and work it in with your hands until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for 30 minutes.

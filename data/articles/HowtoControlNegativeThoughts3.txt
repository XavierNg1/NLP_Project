 If you feel overwhelmed by your negative experiences, you may benefit greatly from speaking to a counselor, in addition to practicing positive thinking exercises. Look for a therapist trained in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. He or she will be able to help you train your mind to think positively.To find a therapist you trust, ask a friend who has sought counsel or therapy before. You can also get a referral from your doctor.
 Think of it as a check-up for your state of mind. You are under no obligation to stay if you feel too uncomfortable and there's no rule saying you must regularly see this therapist.


Make the appointment with an open mind. Hope that the counselor can help you. If not, you can always find a counselor that you feel more comfortable with.
 Remember that therapy is confidential and safe, so you can be totally honest. The more honest you are with your counselor, the better he or she will be able to help.


Be sure to describe how these negative thoughts make you feel. Explain how often you experience them and what you usually do to deal with them.
 If you felt comfortable with your therapist, make another appointment or two. Remember that it will take more than a single session to work through your negative thoughts.


Don't get discouraged if you feel your time with a particular counselor was unproductive. You can seek out a different therapist until you find one that makes you feel comfortable.

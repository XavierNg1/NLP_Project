 Shades of rose gold tend to look flattering on most skin tones, since they contain both warm and cool tones. However, some rose gold shades will be warmer and more golden, whereas others will be cooler, with emphasis on the frosty pink side of things. For best results, find the shade on the rose gold spectrum that best compliments your skin tone.


If you have cooler undertones, opt for shades of rose gold that feature more pink than gold.
If you have warmer skin tones, choose shades that have more gold in them than pink. Peach and warm shimmery hues also fall into this category.
 If you want to start out slow or get an idea of what rose gold lip color may look on you, add a few drops of rose gold or gold liquid highlighter to your index finger and then gently massage it into your Cupidâ€™s bow (essentially, the center of your upper lip).Highlighters provide a luminous sheen wherever you apply them.









Typically, highlighters are applied to the cheekbones, but they are safe to apply anywhere.
These products are subtle, flattering and provide a glow that looks healthy rather than metallic.
 Keep in mind that extremely metallic lip colors can draw attention to cracks and imperfections. To prevent dryness and cracking from showing through, always apply a lip balm before working with metallic lip products. Avoid metallic formulas when you have chapped lips.









If you plan to be outside on a particularly cold winter day, you may want to forgo metallic or rose gold lips altogether. The dryness in the air could end up creating cracks in the appearance of your lips, which the metallic sheen would highlight.

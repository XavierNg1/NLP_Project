 It needs to be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timed. For example, "By 30th May, I will be able to solve my Rubik's cube in under five minutes".;
, Within the larger goal, there will be smaller targets.
 Achieving your goals can often take a long time and can be very frustrating. If you stumble, don't worry. Failure is a natural part of learning to do something and should not discourage you.
 If possible, seek out an independent tutor or course which will help you achieve your goal. The earlier the better: this will prevent you from getting into bad habits from an early stage (particularly important in the case of musical instruments or sports) and will teach you the fundamentals. Once you begin to get the hang of things, you can branch off by yourself. If you want to get better at art, a tutor can teach you the basics. Only you can show your personality and become great.
 Anything that is worth doing is never easy. If there was no challenge involved you wouldn't be doing it in the first place. Show your moxie, too. If you keep at it, this something you want to get better at, you'll become great.

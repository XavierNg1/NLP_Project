 Shrimp can be grilled either in a basket or when they are threaded on skewers. If you choose to use wooden skewers, make sure that you soak them in water for a few hours before you start grilling--they can catch on fire if they aren’t soaked. A grilling basket needs no preparation. Whichever method you use, make sure that the device is placed three or four inches from moderately high heat.








Metal skewers don’t need to be soaked and work the same as wooden skewers.
 Keep your shrimp on the grill for five to seven minutes. You will need to turn the shrimp over halfway through the cooking process so that both sides of the shrimp get cooked evenly. Keep an on your shrimp while they cook--the outside of the shrimp should turn a nice pink color when it is cooked while the meat inside should turn white and opaque.








Be careful not to overcook the shrimp or else it might become tough and chewy (which is never a good texture for shrimp).
 Place it on a fresh, clean plate. According to the Food and Drug Administration, placing cooked seafood on a platter that once held raw seafood can cause contamination of the food. Eat the shrimp right away because it will taste best fresh off the grill.

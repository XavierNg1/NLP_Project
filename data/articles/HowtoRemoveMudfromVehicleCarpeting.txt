 By allowing it to dry completely, some of the mud may flake off without having to treat it with any kind of solution. Avoid contact with it and try not to rub the mud deeper into the carpet. The deeper the stain is rubbed in, the more difficult it is to remove it.;
, As you scrape it off, deposit the mud flakes into a wastebasket or vacuum them up. Keep scraping until the mud is no longer flaking off the carpet.
 Repeat the scraping process, if necessary. The vacuum may loosen the mud, making the scraping effective again. Use various nozzles on your vacuum (if available) to get the best effect.
 (5 ml) dish washing detergent with 1 c. (240 mL) water. The water can be warm or cold, but it shouldn't be hot. Hot water may set the stain and make it nearly impossible to remove from the vehicle's carpet. Put the mixture in a small bucket or a large cup to take to the vehicle.
 Wiping the mixture into the carpet may only rub the stain in deeper. Using a clean sponge or rag, blot and pull at the stain to remove the mud from the carpet fibers.
 Carefully rinse the area with a clean sponge. Avoid rubbing in any remaining stain.
 Get a flashlight to look closely or wait until daylight to examine the cleaning job.

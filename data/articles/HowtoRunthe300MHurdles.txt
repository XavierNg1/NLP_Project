 100 meter and 300 meter hurdling usually takes place during the outdoor track season, while 55 meter hurdling takes place indoor. In 300 m. races, the hurdles are much farther apart, making it less necessary to count steps in between the hurdles. Most hurdlers gradually learn to stutter the steps up to each hurdle so that they have their dominant leg leading, so there is no reason to hesitate going over each hurdle.;
, 300 meter hurdles are called intermediates, as they have a lower height than 100 meter or 55 meter hurdles. It's easier to get over them so that you can keep sprinting steadily. What you will mostly work on is decreasing airtime and having endurance to finish the race.
 You want to put it up and over getting as low to the hurdle as you can, then with your trail leg snap it so you can spend less time in air, do not drag it along.
, Concentrate on the finish line and carry on running.

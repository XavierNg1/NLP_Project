 The sections should be relatively even, although you can make the two side sections slightly smaller than the middle section.
 The base of the ponytail should rest near the middle of the back of your head. You shouldn’t pull it totally tight against your head, but it should be close so that it’s easy to twist your hair over it. Secure the ponytail with a clear elastic.
 Starting on the right side, separate a small section of your loose hair near the front of your face. Twist it back toward your ponytail. Lay it over your ponytail toward the left side. Then wrap it under the existing ponytail and tuck the end into the elastic.
 Repeat the same process on the left side, twisting a piece of hair, laying it over your existing ponytail toward the right side, and securing the end under the existing ponytail elastic. Repeat this process until you’ve twisted back both sections of loose hair.
 As you twist more and more of your hair, you’ll need to secure the ends of the twists with another elastic. Keep the new elastic close to the original elastic so that your hair will look loose in the ponytail once you’re done.
 Once you’ve twisted all of your loose hair over your existing ponytail, add a final elastic over all of it. This makes sure that all of the twists are secure.

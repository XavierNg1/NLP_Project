 There are a lot of ways to steam your peppers, and you can choose whatever works best for you. But don't neglect the steaming -- it is essential for removing the tough, charred skin from the peppers. The two most common methods of steaming are:


Cover on a cutting board with a glass bowl
Place in a paper bag and roll it tightly shut.
 Don't try and speed this process up by chilling the peppers. Let them naturally steam and you'll have a much easier time removing the skins.
 Just start peeling. Don't worry about getting everything, as bits and pieces of charred skin will leave a nice, subtle smokey flavor to the peppers. Get as much off as you can or desire.


Rinsing the peppers off in cold water can help remove the skins, but some cooks feel it subtracts some of the flavor., Cut the pepper in half and unfold it as if it was a book. Using a spoon or simply shaking it out, remove the seeds and cut out the stem. Your peppers are now ready to eat!, You can always store the peppers as bigger chunks, but strips are far easier to eat and use. Strips also allow flavors or seasonings to better coat the peppers.
 If you want something a little simpler, a little olive oil and salt will perfectly enhance the flavors of your peppers without overpowering their natural flavor.
 The peppers can stay like this without going bad for 3-5 days, but any longer than this and you should consider canning them.

 The dividend is the number you are dividing, the divisor is the number you are dividing by.In this instance, the odd number will be the dividend, and the divisor will be 2.

For example, if you are calculating 17÷2{\displaystyle 17\div 2}, the dividend is 17, and the divisor is 2.
;
, A long division symbol looks like the left and top side of a box. Place the divisor on the outside of the long division symbol, to the left of the box.

For example: 2)17¯{\displaystyle 2{\overline {)17}}}.
 Since you can’t divide an odd number by 2, you need to find the greatest number of times 2 will divide evenly into the dividend. Use the multiples of 2 to help you determine what this number is. Place this number on top of the division symbol.

For example, the greatest number of times 2 can divide evenly into 17 is 8, since 2×8=16{\displaystyle 2\times 8=16}. So you should place 8 on top of the long division symbol.
 Place this number below the dividend and subtract. The difference is your remainder. When you divide an odd number by 2, you will always have a remainder of 1.For example, 2×8=16{\displaystyle 2\times 8=16} and 17−16=1{\displaystyle 17-16=1}, So 17÷2=8r1{\displaystyle 17\div 2=8r1}.
 To do this, change the remainder into the numerator of a fraction. The denominator of the fraction will be the divisor, in this case, 2.You can change this fraction to a decimal as well. The fraction 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} always converts to 0.5{\displaystyle 0.5}.

For example, 17÷2=8r1{\displaystyle 17\div 2=8r1}.By turning the remainder into a fraction, you get 17÷2=812{\displaystyle 17\div 2=8{\frac {1}{2}}}.By turning the fraction into a decimal, you get 17÷2=8.5{\displaystyle 17\div 2=8.5}

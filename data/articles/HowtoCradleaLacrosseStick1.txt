 For the one-handed cradling technique the use of proper grip technique is critical. Start by practicing with your dominant hand, using it to grip the stick just under the head. Avoid gripping the stick any lower or higher than this spot in order to get maximum control over the cradling movement., Once you've gripped the lacrosse stick properly you can move your arm into position. Bring your hand up so that your stick is vertical, with the head of your stick at about the same level as your own head. Your elbow should be bent at a ninety degree angle for the proper position., The single-handed cradling movement will primarily use your shoulder and wrist. The goal is to move the stick in a crescent motion, rotating the head and net with the movement to keep the ball in the cradle.Move the stick towards your chest, rotating from the elbow. Curl your wrist inward at the same time.
Move the stick away from your chest, rotating your arm outwards at the elbow. Turn your wrist out and away from your body as you move your arm.

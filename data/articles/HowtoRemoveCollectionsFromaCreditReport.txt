 You are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each credit agency: Equifax, Experian, and Transunion. Visit the website of each agency to receive a free copy of your credit report, or you can visit AnnualCreditReport.com to receive one free copy from each agency.You can also request a three in one credit report, but for a fee of $40.
You can still request your credit report if you have already used up your free reports for the year; however, you will have to pay a fee.;
, Errors on your credit report are information that should not be there. Common account-related errors are late payments that are more than seven years old (and therefore should no longer be on your report), a listed credit card or loan account that doesn’t belong to you, or an account that was closed by you but it is listed as closed by the provider.According to federal law, collection accounts can be reported for up to seven and a half years from the date you first fell behind, regardless if they are paid or unpaid.Collection accounts that are paid may still appear on your credit report for up to seven and a half years., Some common derogatory mark errors are paid collection accounts that are showing as unpaid, a paid tax lien that is more than seven years past your date of payment, creditor lawsuits, and an account that was discharged in bankruptcy but is mistakenly still showing up as active and with a balance., Common personal information errors include your name being listed wrong on the account, addresses listed that you never lived at or used as a mailing address, and inaccurate employer information.There are disputes that creditors do not have to investigate. These disputes are information that identifies you (name, date of birth, Social Security number, telephone number, or address); the identity of past or present employers; requests for a consumer report; information originating from public records (judgments, bankruptcies, liens); information related to active duty or fraud alerts; and information another creditor institution gave to the credit reporting agency., If the negative mark on your report was caused by unusual circumstances or temporary hardship, you may want to try writing a letter of goodwill, asking them to remove the mark. The letter should outline the personal hardship (for instance, if your spouse was seriously injured and you had to quit your job to care for them and fell behind in your payments). This letter should be polite (since you were, in fact, late on your payments) and concisely describe the issue and reason for missing your payment. Be honest and take responsibility for what happened, and request specifically that they remove this mark from your credit report.If you always made payments on time before and/or the period of hardship, point this out as well. You could write something like, "Up until this unforeseen event, my credit history with you was spotless and I always paid on time. I realize I made a mistake in falling behind on my payments, and I am not proud, but I would be extremely grateful if you could remove the lateness or make an adjustment."If he creditor has indicated an unwillingness to remove the negative report for goodwill, offer to pay for the debt in a lump sum upfront in order to get them to stop reporting the negative trade line.Debts satisfied through a bankruptcy should be removed as they have been technically satisfied. While the bankruptcy will remain on the credit report, the individual debts should be removed to avoid a double dip consequence.
Striking a deal with a creditor is rare, and even rarer with collection agencies. Most collection agencies will respond by stating that they are unable to remove negative information from your credit report.
 If you file a dispute with the credit bureau, you may do it either online, through the mail, or over the phone. You can go directly to the credit reporting agency’s website and file a dispute online; this is the most convenient method.However, if the credit bureau needs to contact the creditor to confirm and check the information you are disputing, there will most likely be a delay in getting the issue resolved. Your best option then is to file a dispute with the creditor directly.Provide specific information in regards to the error and evidence that proves it is a mistake. For instance, if you are shown to have made a late payment on a loan but your payment was on time, include a copy of your credit report with the error circled in red, then a copy (never the original) of documents that prove you paid on time. Request that the matter be investigated and removed from your report.
 If the negative mark on your credit was made in error (if you were not, for instance, late on your payment but it was reported as such), you can reach out to the creditor directly and ask them to correct this by providing the relevant evidence. The drawback of filing a dispute with the creditor directly is that they usually only accept disputes by mail. This means you will need to mail in a written letter.When writing your letter, focus on the relevant information and put the most important information in the beginning of the letter. If you are disputing multiple items, make that very clear in the beginning, as well.In your letter include: your full name and the account(s) you are referring to, what you are disputing and why, a copy of your credit report with the errors circled in red, and copies (never originals) of the original documents that prove that you paid an account on time, for example a credit card statement. Or, if the year you opened a loan is being reported incorrectly, include a copy of an original document that shows the correct year., You can file a dispute with both the credit reporting agency and the creditor to speed up the process. Send a written letter to both the agency and the creditor with all the important information and documents.Remember to keep the original documents for yourself and only send copies to the agencies and creditors.
 If either the creditor or credit bureau resolved the dispute, they must update their records. If the creditor resolved it, the creditor must notify the credit bureau about the change. Also, if you filed a dispute with the credit bureau, they must include a free copy of your updated credit report if it was changed.The credit bureau or creditor are required to investigate your dispute within 30 to 45 days of receiving the notification of the dispute; however, disputes are usually resolved within 14 days.
 You can also request that the credit bureau send notices of corrections made to your credit report to anyone who has received your report in the last six months, or in the last two years for employers.If your dispute was filed through a credit bureau and you disagree about the way the issue was resolved, you can add information about your dispute to your credit report. For example, write a statement summarizing what happened if the dispute did not go in your favor. This does not apply if you filed your dispute through the creditor., Reasons to file a complaint are: the dispute took too long, you were not treated well during the whole process, or there is still a valid error on your report that is hurting your credit. If this applies to you, you can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), your state’s Attorney General’s office, or your state’s Department of Consumer Affairs.In your complaint, explain in as much detail what happened and why you think you were treated unfairly.
The CFPB has an online option for you to file a complaint.

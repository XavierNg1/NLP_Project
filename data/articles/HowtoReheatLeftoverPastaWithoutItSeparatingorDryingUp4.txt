 Microwaves cook unevenly, especially if the pasta dishes contains cheese or vegetables. When reheating a large portion, use the oven instead for greater control.


Avoid using the microwave for cream sauces, wine and butter sauces, or other sauces likely to separate.
 If the pasta already includes sauce, just stir it to distribute it evenly. If the pasta is plain, stir in a little sauce or olive oil. This will help keep the pasta moist.
 A full power microwave will likely turn your pasta to mush. Reduce it to 50% power or below.
 Place the pasta in a microwave-safe container, preferably a round one to avoid uneven heating at corners.Cover it with one of the following two methods:


Cover with plastic wrap, but leave one corner open for steam to escape.This traps heat, warming the pasta more evenly.
Cover with a damp paper towel. This steams the pasta as it heats up, adding moisture to dry or sauce-light noodles.
 Heat the pasta for about 1 minute, then check on its progress and stir. If necessary, continue heating for 15â€“30 seconds at a time.


If your microwave does not have a turntable, stop and rotate the dish halfway through.

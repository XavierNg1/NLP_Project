 Launch your Google Chrome browser and visit the Chrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps.;
, Enter “Hootlet” on the search text field at the upper lefthand side of the page and press the “Enter” key on your keyboard to start searching. The Hootlet extension should appear at the top of the search result list.
 Click the “Free” button and a small pop-up message will appear at the very top of the browser asking for confirmation. Verify your action by clicking the “Yes, I trust it” button on the pop-up message and to start installing the app on Chrome.


A notification message will appear telling you that the extension has been successfully installed and a HootSuite icon (owl logo) can now be seen at the top-right corner of the Chrome window.
 Click the owl icon at the top-right corner of the Chrome window and the HootSuite login page will open on a new browser tab.
 You can choose to sign in or create an account using Twitter, Facebook or Google +.


You can also create a new account by clicking the “Create a new account” link below the buttons, but you still need to link your SNS (Social Networking Service) accounts later. So it would be best to sign in or create an account using any of the three available SNS.
 Hootsuite will ask permission to access your basic SNS account info like your name and email address. Just click “Okay” or “Authorize App” to grant permission and continue signing in.


If you’ve already created an account before with your existing SNS account, Hootsuite will skip this step and will no longer ask for permission.
 Once successfully logged in, you can now start using Hootlet. Click the owl icon again to start posting new updates on your SNS sites without having to visit the actual web pages.

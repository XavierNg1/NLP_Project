 If you're saving up for something but can't be bothered to wait, set up a stall outside your house. It's the easiest thing to do - get some old toys and make some food, and you're done. If it doesn't go that well, at least you had fun trying and you've tidied out the old things to make way for the new. Check with your local council to make sure you are allowed to do this.
 Try babysitting, car washing, lawn mowing, garden tidying, house-sitting, pet-sitting, dog walking, etc.

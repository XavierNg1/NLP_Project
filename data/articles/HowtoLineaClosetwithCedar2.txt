 If you have shelves or drawers in your closet, you can add cedar liners to boost the cedar scent. Liners will ensure that your clothes that are in drawers also smell like cedar. They will also add extra protection against insects.You can buy liners online or pick them up at your local hardware store.
If you want to make the liners yourself, measure your drawers and then use a saw to cut cedar boards that fit the bottom of the drawers.
 A clothes hamper with cedar supports will keep your dirty clothes smelling pleasant. In addition, a cedar hamper is a particularly good idea because moths eat the dried sweat and flakes of skin that are in soiled clothes. This will protect your clothes when they are their most attractive to insects., Hanging your clothes from cedar hangers adds an extra level of insect protection. The hangers and racks will match your cedar walls and add to the overall cedar aroma. In addition, cedar hangers and racks not only look and smell nice, they also keep insects out of your delicates.You can find cedar racks at your local hardware store and cedar hangers online.

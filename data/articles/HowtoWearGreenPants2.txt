 Even an understated hue like olive green can look a bit loud if paired with bright colors. When choosing a shirt and/or jacket, opt for neutral colors like navy blue, bright white, black and various shades of gray. These colors tend to work well with green pants, regardless of where they fall on the color spectrum.Avoid bright graphic t-shirts and busy patterns when wearing green pants.
For instance, try a pair of olive green skinny jeans with a black v-neck t-shirt and simple black sneakers.
 Cargo pants typically create a casual, no-frills vibe, but pairing them with pieces that are dressy and feminine can make for an eye-catching contrast. Wear army green pants with a light pink top for a trendy street-ready look. Choose pieces with delicate details, like lace or fringe, to emphasize the juxtaposition even more.For example, forest green skinny jeans would work well with a scalloped black top with lace embellishments.
 A muted shade of olive green works well with jewel tones like burgundy, deep blue and ginger, especially when you’re going for a Fall-inspired color palette. Wear olive green chinos with a deep blue blazer and burgundy scarf for an office-ready look.For a more casual outfit, try a deep blue v-neck sweater with a jewel-toned plaid button down underneath it. The visible plaid collar will provide a pop of understated color.
 If you’re wearing pants in a lighter or brighter shade of green, those should be the focal point of your entire outfit. Choose simple pieces with clean lines, such as button-downs and t-shirts, to go along with your pants. Something dark, like a black shirt, can temper the brightness of the green and make the overall look more accessible.


Avoid creating multiple layers and mixing different textures in the same outfit, since those extra details will clash with the bright green.

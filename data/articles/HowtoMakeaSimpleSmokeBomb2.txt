 Don’t use so much water that the napkin is soggy or falling apart. If you don’t have any napkins, you can use a paper towel instead. Make sure that the paper towel is big enough and all one sheet (no perforations).
 As with the egg method, you can use flour or talcum powder for white smoke. Or you can make colorful smoke by either dyeing the flour or mixing crushed sidewalk chalk into the baby powder.Be aware that these more colorful methods may leave a stain!








, Be very gentle with this step! Make sure there are no tears on the payload end of the bomb. There is no need to let the napkin dry, as a moist napkin is easier to tear through. Just be careful it doesn’t “explode” prematurely!








, Just like the egg bombs, the harder you throw your napkin bomb the bigger your smoke cloud will be. Unlike egg bombs, napkin bombs are meant for immediate use. If you try to store a napkin bomb, the twisted end will most likely come apart and your filling will get everywhere.

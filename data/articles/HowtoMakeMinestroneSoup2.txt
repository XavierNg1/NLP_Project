 This version of minestrone is both vegan and gluten-free. Kale and quinoa add both texture and heartiness to the soup. It will take you 15 minutes to prepare the ingredients. The cook time is 55 minutes.


This recipe will make about 6 to 8 servings.
 If possible, use a large stockpot to make this soup in. Dice the onion, carrots and celery. Add the olive oil to the pot and heat it over medium-high heat.


Add the vegetables and sauté them until they're soft.
It will take about 5 minutes.
 Slice the green beans into one inch segments and dice the zucchini and red bell pepper. Add them to the pot and sauté for about 2 minutes.


Add the minced garlic.
Continue cooking for an additional 60 seconds.
 Measure out and add the parsley, rosemary, thyme and granulated sugar. Season with salt and pepper (to taste). Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium.


Allow it to simmer for approximately 20 minutes.
Simmer it uncovered.
 Pour the dry quinoa into the pot. Cover it and cook the soup for another 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the cover and add the beans, chick peas, kale and lemon juice. Do not replace the cover. Cook for another 5 minutes.


You’ll know it’s ready when the kale has wilted.
Remove the pot from the heat.
 Before you pour it into bowls, let the soup cool slightly. Garnish each bowl with vegan parmesan cheese. Serve the minestrone warm with crusty garlic bread (optional) and additional vegan parmesan.
 Consider substituting the quinoa with gluten-free pasta for a different textural experience. Vegan parmesan may be hard to find in some areas, but you could try substituting it with vegan sharp cheddar instead.


Another option for cheesy richness would be to sprinkle nutritional yeast on top of each bowl before serving.
Feel free to also add any fresh herbs or seasonal vegetables that you like to the recipe, as well.

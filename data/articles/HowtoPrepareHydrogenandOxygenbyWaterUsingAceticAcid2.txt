 Add 5 tablespoons (74 ml) of vinegar to 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) of water. The resulting solution will be slightly acidic and able to conduct a small amount of electricity. Pour the solution into the tub.You may or may not use all of the solution. Just fill the tub most of the way.
 First, fill two test tubes with water. You can fill them from the tap, or with the water in your tub. Invert each test tube over one of the graphite electrodes and into the water. Be sure not to get any air bubbles in the test tubes. These tubes are meant to collect any hydrogen or oxygen that is formed.You will need to use a clamp to hold the test tubes in place over the rods.
 Connect the alligator clips (the side opposite the electrodes) to either terminal of a 9V battery. This will complete the circuit and allow electricity to flow.However, the current will be limited by the inability of the vinegar solution to conduct well. This will confirm that the acetic acid in vinegar does not promote electrolysis of water.This limitation on current prohibits the water from being split into hydrogen and oxygen.

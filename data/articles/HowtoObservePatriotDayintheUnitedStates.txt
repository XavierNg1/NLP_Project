 On the morning of September 11, 2001, terrorist hijacked four passenger airliners and deliberately crashed them into the following American landmarks:


American Airlines Flight 11, flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City
United Airlines Flight 175, flown into the South Tower of the World Trade Center
American Airline Flight 77, flown into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia
United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after the heroic efforts of its passengers who attempted to overcome the hijackers.;
, Thousands of lives were lost in this horrifying tragedy, and should be honored for their bravery and courage. Some leave flowers or an American flag at these sites, which can be found in numerous cities, as well as in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.


If visiting the 9/11 Memorial in New York City, spend a few minutes reflecting at the waterfall pools. These were placed in the footprints of where the Twin Towers once stood.
 A respectful and solemn tradition, this is performed to commemorate what transpired at the following moments:


8:46 AM
9:03 AM
9:37 AM
9:59 AM
10:03 AM
10:28 AM

, Hundreds of people did survive the attacks, and many of them deserve to be honored for their help saving lives and maintain order among the chaos of that day.
 You could also donate to charities that help the injured or to the families that lost a loved one in the attacks. If possible, and if they are OK with doing so, get to know them and help them in any way you can. Learn their stories of survival and what they saw that fateful day.
 Volunteer your time to help those who suffered from the attacks, help organize trips to visit the memorials, and attend a Patriot Day ceremony in your community.

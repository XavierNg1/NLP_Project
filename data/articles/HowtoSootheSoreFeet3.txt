 Your doctor or physical therapist may give you exercises to increase the strength and stability of the affected foot and to correct muscles that may not be balanced.


Exercises to increase flexibility will maintain or improve the length of a muscle. Flexibility helps to make a stronger muscle and less likely to be injured.
Walking in shoes that provide good support and cushioning is excellent exercise for the feet. Feet also benefit from specific foot exercises. Try some of the exercises outlined in the steps below

, Sit down with your shoes off, place one foot on top of a golf ball, and roll (don't stand) on the ball using only the weight of the foot; repeat with the other foot.
 Scatter beans or marbles on the floor, and then try to pick them up with your toes.
 Sit in a chair with one foot raised in front of you, and make four or five small circles in the air in both directions with your foot.


Next, point your toes as much as you can; then stretch them up towards you. Repeat six times with each foot.

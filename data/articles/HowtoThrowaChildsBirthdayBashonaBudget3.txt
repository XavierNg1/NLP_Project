 You don't even have to have a black light, although that would be totally cool. This type of party is great for slumber parties. Or, if you want to keep it super cheap, just let the party last a couple of hours instead of overnight. That will save you the cost of another meal, since there won't be a need for breakfast.
 The party can be inside or outside, but obviously when it's dark. 

, There are a few glowing items you can find:


Get glowing decorations. These are often around at Halloween but you should be able to find cheap ones easily online at any time of year, such as glowing stars, glowing stickers and glowing pictures.
Glowsticks are good to collect over time. These are inexpensive and you can pick up a few every time you go to the store, including the dollar stores. Glowsticks come in many different varieties so they are sure to please everyone.
Be sure to get some glow balloons too. These are easy decorations that will glow wonderfully throughout the occasion.
Glow-in-the-dark t-shirts for everyone. This will help you to find one another easily and is a lot of fun.
 Choose games that make the most of being in a darker environment. Just be sure to make the games age appropriate––nothing too scary for younger children. Also, be careful about bumps in the dark; use a space where there is nothing to bump into that could harm a child.
 Have a homemade cake and cupcakes that have been frosted with glow-in-the dark frosting. And, of course, have some ice cream and you've got a really fun party.

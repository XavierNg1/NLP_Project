 Unfortunately, you can’t blare your music for everyone to hear during class, but it doesn’t hurt to listen to emo music during breaks between classes. Armor for Sleep, Comeback Kid, My Chemical Romance, and Coheed and Cambria are some examples of emo music. Find other students that like the same music. You can show off your musical taste through your accessories without saying a word.More bands include Mallory Knox, Lower Than Atlantis and of Mice and Men.
 You don’t have to be depressed or sad to be emo. Being emo means that you’re not afraid to show your emotions. It means that you are open to vulnerability. This can be kind of difficult when you’re a kid or teenager, but don’t listen to the bullies. Being upfront with your emotions actually shows that you’re mature, and of course, emo.It’s great to show your emotions, but that doesn’t mean you have to display them dramatically. Just show and tell people how you’re feeling.
 No one (hopefully) can read your thoughts, but deep thinkers are noticeable to other people. To be able to show your emotions, it’s important to think about them first. Thinking deeply will often make you seem like a quiet person (which is a very emo trait), but it will also make you seem even more interesting when you speak., Emo people are often really creative. It’s completely fine if you aren’t the creative type, but don’t be afraid to indulge in your art form if you are. Write poetry, create music, paint, or draw anime characters. Get as deep and dark as you want.

Stop when you are one stitch away the corner., There are two ways that you can do this. The simplest way is to simply keep going, and do three double crochets in the stitch to the left of the corner, and three more double crochets in the stitch to the right of the corner. Alternatively, you can do six double crochets in the gap just under the corner., When you are back to where you started, join your last double crochet to the first chain with a slip stitch., Cut the yarn down, then pull the tail back through the loop. Gently tug on the tail to tighten the knot, then weave the tail back into your work using a yarn needle.

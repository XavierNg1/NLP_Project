 The size of your blanket will depend on the purpose and the recipient. Here are some common blanket sizes, listed in inches and centimeters:


Infant receiving blanket: 36x36 inches (90x90 cm)
Child's afghan: 36x42 inches (90x105 cm)
Teenager's afghan: 48x60 inches (120x150 cm)
Adult's afghan: 50x70 inches (125x175 cm)
Lap blanket: 36x48 inches (90x120 cm);
, The size and thickness of your blanket, as well as your crocheting skill, can help you choose a type of yarn. If you're just beginning to crochet, choose a yarn with a smooth texture, a light color (so you can see your stitches clearly) and worsted (medium) weight.


Count on needing 3-4 skeins of yarn for a lap blanket or a receiving blanket. Double that estimation for a larger blanket.
If you are at all unsure about whether you have enough yarn for the project at hand, get an extra skein or two.
If you're buying yarn that's produced in a dye lot, make sure each skein has the same dye lot number on the label. Otherwise, your skeins might be slightly different colors.
 Crochet hooks range in size from B (2.25mm) to S (19mm). Here's what to keep in mind when you're selecting a hook:


The bigger the hook, the bigger the stitch. Bigger stitches are easier to see, and they mean you'll get through the blanket faster. However, you'll also use up more yarn.
Bigger stitches are also looser, and make for more lightweight blankets. If you want a particularly warm blanket, choose a smaller hook for tighter stitches.
If you're just starting to crochet, choose a hook that's size N or bigger. You can work your way up to smaller hooks as you get more comfortable with crocheting.
 Your stitch will determine the look and composition of your blanket. There's an endless array of stitches to choose from, and you can even improvise on basic stitches to create your own. This article will outline a few easy patterns you can start with.

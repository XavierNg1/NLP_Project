 A player must either place a legal card onto the discard pile. If he/she cannot do that, he/she must draw cards from the stock until he/she picks up a card that can be played. If the stock runs out, shuffle the discard pile and continue drawing cards. Legal cards that can be played on the discard pile are:


If the top card on the discard pile is not an 8, you can play any card that matches the number or suit of the card. For example if the top card in the discard pile is a 7 of hearts, a player could play another 7 or any card that has a suit of hearts, such as a King of hearts or a 2 of hearts., The player who put the 8 down must declare what suit he/she wants to change it to. The next player must either play a card of the declared suit or play another 8. If he/she cannot, he/she follows the usual rules and must draw cards.Strategy tip: If you have an 8 but can play all your cards without using it, hold on to it and play it as your last card, since you can play an 8 down on any other card.
 He or she is the winner!

Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it very neat.;

Draw a vertical line in the middle of the head so you know where the center of the face is.
Draw a horizontal line on the middle of the face. Afterwards, add another line a bit higher than the first horizontal line. They should be parallel and should form a figure that looks like a rectangle.



At the end of the ‘rectangle’, add two curved line facing each other. This would be the ears.
Draw a big circle from the base of the face to the bottom side of the parallel lines.



Draw two tear-shaped circle overlapping the parallel lines. It should skew a bit to the center.



Add a horizontal line 1/3 part from the bottom of the muzzle. This will be your guide for the mouth.
Add two tear-shaped figures at the opposite side from the mouth. They should connect towards the lower-center. It should look like a stretched heart.
For the eyes, draw an almond shaped figure in the middle of the parallel lines.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The lineart might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the furs and the lines for the skin.
Try to add more if needed. Don’t be afraid to add more lines than what is necessary. Monkey skin is really wrinkly and their fur tends to be really hairy and coarse.

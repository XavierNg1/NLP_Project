 The gel-based formulas can be used on wet or dry hair, but you may prefer to use it while your hair is dry. Root regrowth is easier to spot in dry hair, so you’ll be able to target the problem areas more successfully. Like its spray counterpart, most gel formulas wash out with your next shampoo.Check your brand for specifics, since there are a few out there that can last up to three shampoos.
 Most gel-based formulas come in “wand” form, with a spongey applicator on the end that you use to “paint on” the concealer. Squeeze the wand until you see that the sponge is loaded with the gel. Dab at your hair with the applicator to paint on the gel, squeezing when necessary to reload the sponge., Only use enough product to fully cover the visible roots. You can always add a little more if you need additional coverage, but start off slow. Give the product a minute or so to penetrate your hair shaft. You may want to keep a towel or tissues nearby so that you can clean up any drips or spills immediately., Even if you’ve applied the gel formula to dry hair, blow drying it helps to evenly distribute the concealer and blend it into your hair so that it looks natural. Set your blow dryer to low heat and aim at your roots. Continue until the gel is no longer visible and your roots are completely dry.

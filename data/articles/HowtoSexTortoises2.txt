 You may be able to do this without picking up the tortoise. If the tortoise is afraid, or in a new place, it might not appreciate being picked up. You can get down to the tortoise’s level to try to see the tail.Determining sex by the tail length is great for tortoises that you cannot pick up for whatever reason.
 There is no set length of a tortoise’s tail. However, males of most species have much longer tails than the females. You may notices the male's tail moving from side to side.A female’s tail is usually shorter than the end of a cotton swab.
A male’s tale will be longer than that, but still not huge.
 If you’ve never looked at a tortoise’s tail before, you might not have a sense of what is a long tail or a short tail. You can look up pictures of male and female tortoise tails for comparison.If you know the species of the tortoise, look up pictures of that specific species for accuracy.

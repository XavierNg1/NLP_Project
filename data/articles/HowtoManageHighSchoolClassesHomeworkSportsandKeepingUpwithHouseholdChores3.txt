 Sometimes, life gets too busy and it’s impossible to get everything done. If this is the case for you, consider quitting or going on a temporary hiatus from your team.You can’t exactly quit going to school or doing homework or chores, so sports are the easiest commitment to eliminate.
If you’re incredibly busy at school or with practice, ask your parents if you can take a week off from doing chores (tell them you’ll do double next week to make up for it).
 If you’re constantly falling ill because of how strenuous your life is, you’re not going to be able to keep up with everything that’s going on. Eat a healthy diet, get between 7 – 8 hours of sleep each night and avoid drugs and alcohol.Have a water bottle with you at all times. Drinking water will help keep you hydrated and feeling good.
Eat fruits and vegetables. These will help your immune system and make you less susceptible to falling ill.
Make a bedtime and stick to it. If you’re not sleeping regularly, it will be impossible for you to function at the top of your game.
 Facebook is fun, but it’s also a distraction from everything else you have going on. Give yourself 30 minutes every day to be on social media, and other than that, stay away from it.Use social media as a reward – if you finish all your work for the day, you can spend more time checking Twitter.
Give yourself an hour on social on weekends as a reward for working so hard during the week.

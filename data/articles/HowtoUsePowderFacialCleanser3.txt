 Many powder cleansers can also be used as spot treatments for pimples or problem skin. Begin by making a very small amount of paste. Try starting with ¼ tsp. of paste and ¼ tsp. of water., Use your finger to dab the paste onto any place you’d like to spot-treat. Apply to pimples, blackheads, or acne-prone areas., Allow the product to dry for as long as possible. This will work best if you leave it to work overnight while you sleep. You may want to place a towel on your pillow., When you wake up (or when you are ready to remove the spot treatment), wash your wash as you normally would, using powder cleanser (or another product). Repeat as often as needed.

 Decide what makes you stand out from the crowd and defines you as a fitness model. Your brand makes you recognizable and defines the type of physique you build.Think of what your motivation is and how it could inspire others. Perhaps you’ve built your physique after having several children, or overcame a struggle through fitness.
Consider your day job: fitness magazines often use yoga instructors or personal trainers instead of standard fashion models. If you teach others how to do yoga pose or workout technique, you’ll be able to execute it precisely and look good for the camera while you do it.
Your brand also defines the type of fitness modeling you do and the type of physique you need. Competitions require a more built, defined physique than mainstream magazine work.
 Knowing how to pose properly is just as important as your appearance, so it’s a good idea to hire a modeling coach or take a modeling class. You could also look online and scour fitness magazines to learn how models pose.


For example, you can watch videos of poses required by the National Gym Association.You can also search for images online or look for videos on YouTube.
Practice different poses in front of the mirror to figure out what works best for your body.
 Set up Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat profiles and update them daily. Engage your followers by tracking your fitness journey, giving workout and meal prep tips, and sharing stories about what motivates you. Follow people in the industry, from models to photographers, to build a professional network and, hopefully, get discovered by a scout or sponsor., When you’re just starting out, creating a portfolio can be as simple as having a friend take snapshots of you in good natural lighting.A beginner’s portfolio should include 6 to 12 shots, and try to get as close to professional quality as possible. Once you start booking gigs, include published shots in your portfolio.You don’t have to start assembling your professional portfolio until after signing with an agent and booking gigs. However, you will need up to date photographs of yourself to send to agencies and magazines.
Fitness models will need to include body shots. Women should wear a sports bra and shorts, and men should wear only shorts.

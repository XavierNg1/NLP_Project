 Threshold braking is best used with vehicles that don’t have ABS. This system prevents the wheels from locking in an emergency braking situation; so cars without it are more likely to see the wheels lock. In an icy situation, this can be incredibly dangerous and send the car into a slide.

Threshold braking allows you to brake as much as possible without hitting a point that will cause the wheels to lock. Threshold braking is also known as squeeze braking.
Checking the car’s owner’s manual is the best way to know if your car has an ABS. If you’re still unsure, you can ask your mechanic., Understandably, this is difficult to do in an emergency situation, but panicking is a sure fire way to lose control of your vehicle. It’s important to keep your cool if you need to brake on ice.

If you’re worried about how you’ll react in an emergency situation, you can try your hand at driving on ice at certain driving schools., Keeping your heel to the floor lets you use the muscles in your foot to push the brakes rather than the muscles in your leg. This gives you more control.

Avoid slamming the brakes. This will cause the wheels to lock and your car will lose all traction., This is the key to threshold braking. Apply firm, steady pressure to the brake pedal. Your car should slowly start decelerating as you push the brakes. Keep the pressure even, and stop just short of causing your wheels to lock.

You’ll feel feedback in the brake pedal, a certain threshold as you brake. This is when you can get the most deceleration out of your brakes; if you go past this your wheels will lock and you’ll lose traction.

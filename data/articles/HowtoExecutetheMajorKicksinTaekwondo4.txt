 In order to get in the correct position, you’ll need to have your back to your opponent. If your sparring partner has gotten behind you, this is an ideal move or if you want to surprise him, you can shift your back to him. You don’t want your target to be directly behind your back. You’ll need to extend your leg to its fullest length for this kick. So make sure that you can do this with both legs.
 As with every kick, this is to give you more room to extend, thus adding momentum to your kick. This should be done quickly so as to not alert your target as to your intentions. 







, Drive your heel forward to your target. Back kicks don’t work for targets higher in the air. Our bodies simply don’t bend this way, so extend your leg to the middle or lower section of your opponent. 







, If done correctly, your weight will shift naturally to your toes. In which case, make sure that you are prepared for this. You don’t want to tumble over.
 This will be the first part of your foot to make contact anyways since you are kicking behind you. As always, avoid hitting the target with any other part of your foot.

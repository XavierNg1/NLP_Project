 Ask your doctor what consistency your liquids should be when you thicken them.

Nectar-thick liquids are easy to pour. They're approximately the thickness of a cream soup.
Combine 1 and 1/2 teaspoons (7.5 g) of commercial thickener to 1/2 cup (118 ml) of thin liquid.
You can purchase commercial thickeners at most drug stores.
 Honey-thick liquids are not as pourable as nectar. They drizzle off of your spoon slowly.

Combine 1 and 1/2 tablespoons (22.5 g) of your commercial thickener with 1/2 cup (118 ml) of thin liquid.
 This is the thickest consistency that you should thicken your liquids for medical reasons. You can eat pudding-thick liquids with a spoon.

To create pudding thickened liquids, combine 2 tablespoons (30 g) of commercial thickener with 1/2 cup (118 ml) of thin liquid.

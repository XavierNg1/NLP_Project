 Llamas are extremely social creatures and need at least one other llama for its mental well-being. Llamas that are not socialized can be either extremely skittish or abnormally violent and aggressive. The ideal herd size for llamas is four to six animals. Once you have more animals than that, they will begin to split and form new herds. Female llamas in particular have a strong need to form a herd.Male llamas can be problematic and disruptive to the herd. If you have a male that is particularly difficult to manage, castration may help calm him down.
If you cannot afford to purchase a herd of llamas at once, consider buying one llama and then obtaining a rescue llama, which will be much cheaper.;
, Once you have purchased your llama, have your veterinarian give it an evaluation. If it has not already received them, your llama will also need its vaccinations.Depending on where you live, you will also likely need to have your llama dewormed at some point. You should also have your veterinarian check the overall health of the animal so that you can better understand what, if any, dietary supplements you need to provide.Generally, llamas are hardy animals that do not need much veterinary care. However, it is important that your local vet know your animal in case it ever needs medical attention.
 You should visit your animal every day to check on its overall health and wellness. Check to see if the animal has any wounds or issues with its fleece. You should also physically check your llama’s body fat every now and then.
 Because its fleece can mask its size, you should score you llama regularly. Simply, feel the thickness of the animal’s back at the base of its neck and give a gentle squeeze. If the back is “U”-shaped, the llama is the correct weight. If it is “V”-shaped, your llama is underweight. If it is flat, your llama is overweight.

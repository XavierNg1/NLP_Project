 For many types of ear gauge jewelry, cleansing with antibacterial soap is the most effective way to keep your piercing and jewelry fresh. Simply lather the jewelry with antibacterial soap, rinse in cool water, and dry with a clean paper towel.This method works for the following jewelry materials:


Metal
Acrylic and dental acrylic
Silicone
Glass
PTFE
Bioplast;
, Ear gauge jewelry made from organic materials cannot withstand harsh antibacterial soap. Instead, wash your horn, bone, or stone jewelry in the mildest soap you can find (baby soap is an excellent choice), rinse with cool water, and dry with a clean paper towel.Do not allow your organic jewelry to soak in water.
 Wooden jewelry should never be submerged in water. Instead, wipe wooden pieces of jewelry down with a damp cloth, then apply a drop of oil to condition them.Good oils for this purpose include:


Jojoba
Olive
Coconut

, Note that there are many fewer of these that download subtitles than those that download basic videos. DownSub is one example of a dedicated site, but KeepVid also offers this function. Before picking a download method, click the white box labeled “CC” near the bottom right corner of the video you want to download. If the text you want appears or disappears, it is either added or generated text. It can be downloaded separately from the video sound and picture. Use Method 2 to do so.
 On DownSub, this is a white field containing text that starts with, “Enter the link,” next to a blue button that reads “Download”.
 The files this generates will be SRT files. These files are text files with coded time signatures, telling videos what to display and when to display them. You will need an SRT-enabled video player in order to view the subtitles.


In DownSub, after you enter the URL and click “submit”, you will be given a series of “Download” links, each next to a language label, either the original language or a translation.
To download SRT files from KeepVid, go all the way to the bottom of the list of file format options it gives you after you submit the URL. You will be able to pick subtitles from the original language or from several languages of translated subtitles.
Note that substantial inaccuracies are frequent in automatically generated YouTube subtitles. If you have trouble understanding what someone is saying in your language, automatically generated subtitles aren’t likely to be much help. They can still be of help to the hearing impaired, or for foreign languages.

To become a flight attendant at Air France, or any airline for that matter, you must have a high school diploma. In fact, more than one-third of all flight attendants have college degrees, even though college is not required by the airlines.;

Because Air France is based in France, they require that all flight attendants be fluent in both French and English. Speaking a third language is also a benefit as Air France assigns flight crews based on specific areas. For example, for Japanese flights, flight crews who speak fluent Japanese are given first choice for those flights.



Air France has it's permanent headquarters in Europe, requiring employees to be citizens of a European country. To learn what countries belong to the European Union, visit http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm

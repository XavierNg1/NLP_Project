 Spend your morning/afternoon exploring the house you want to photograph. Avoid exploring it at night.
 Pick a good camera and good lighting. Without lighting, it would be hard to see what you photographed.


If it's your house, you can add to simple lamps around it to help a bit on lighting the area.
Pick a good camera. Try choosing a camera that have a flash.
 Choose a good place to stand, set your camera's flash, and photograph.
 You can print the image, transfer it into a computer, keep it in a frame, or even share it online.

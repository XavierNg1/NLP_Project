 Children this age love to look at hanging objects. Hang pictures onto a hanger and hang it up over the changing table or hold it up over children's faces. Dangle a toy over their face as well. You can also lay them in a bouncer with hanging objects or on an activity gym.;
, Plush toys and puppets, soft dolls and stuffies. Dangle them over a child's face or lay them next to it. You can play with it while they watch or let them explore it themselves. Rub the soft toy on a part of the child or tickle them with it.
 Brightly colored rattles, keys, cubes, plush toys, and pictures all work. The colors should be dark and bright, not light and shaded. Bright and dark reds, oranges, greens, blues, pinks, and purples all work well.

 Such as: rattles, plastic rings, keys, squeaky toys, or cubes. Let the infant interact with the toy and suck on it. They can even just watch you play with it.
 Read, read, read! Read a child a board book for infants or a cloth book that they can feel. Plastic bath tub books are also fun. Children can interact with these kind of books, too.

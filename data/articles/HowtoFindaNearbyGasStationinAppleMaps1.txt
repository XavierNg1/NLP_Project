 The "Nearby" feature in Apple Maps was introduced in iOS 9.


You can check for updates in the General section of the Settings app, or by connecting your iPhone to iTunes on your computer. See Update iOS for detailed instructions.
If you don't have iOS 9, you can still use Siri to find nearby gas stations. See the next section for details.;
, You'll be accessing the Nearby function from the Map app's search field. You can find the Maps app on one of your Home screens.


The Nearby feature is not available in all countries. It is currently available in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UK, and USA., You'll see two rows of round colored buttons appear beneath the search field.
 This will change the selection to various transportation-related destinations. The button label will change depending on your device's screen size.
 After a moment, You'll see your location on the map surrounded by pins for the closest gas stations.
 A pop-up will appear on the map with the gas station name, address, and a blue button with the driving time to the destination.
 Maps will take you on the shortest route to the gas station that you've selected.


If you need walking or public transit directions instead, or just want more information about the business, tap the white part of the pop-up to view the details about the destination. Tap the pedestrian button (or the bus button) for transportation-specific navigation.
 Maps will begin turn-by-turn navigation to the selected gas station.

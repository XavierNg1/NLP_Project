 You must have access to a fairly large lawn that can be seen in its entirety from a location higher above.
 For this method to really work, you must allow the grass to become overgrown, so that the mowed message will stand out.
 Remember, you probably don't have a ton of space, and writing a letter in a lawn is tricky, so less is more. Try to make the message as short as possible. If at all an option, try to use text lingo or letters in place of words (for example, the letter "R" instead of the word "are"), to shorten the message.
 If you do not, you can probably borrow one from a friend or rent one.
 If you've never mowed a lawn before, you should try to enlist the help of a friend that has. (Tip: make sure the friend knows that you are trying to write a message with the lawn mower, not just trying to mow the whole lawn. If they do not know that you're writing a message, they may just mow the whole lawn.)

, To add extra suspense and drama, make them wear a blindfold until you are right in front of the lawn. (Do not put a blindfold on someone who will not consent to being blindfolded).

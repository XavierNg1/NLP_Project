 You must choose an odd number of stitches in order to successfully knit using the American moss stitch., Continue alternating between knitting and purling stitches until there is one stitch remaining on your left needle. Knit the final stitch, making sure it mirrors the first on that row (which it should, since you cast on an odd number of stitches).

Remember to place your yarn either in front or behind the stitch you are making so that the yarn is in the correct position to either knit or purl., If your last stitch was a knit stitch on the last row, then purl that stitch on the new row. If your last stitch on the previous row was a purl stitch, then knit that stitch on the new row. Then continue alternating stitch types as before., Where you did a purl stitch in the second row, do another of the same kind; where you did a knit stitch, do another., This will complete the set of four rows. In other words, your pattern should be:Row 1: * K1, P1 * K1
Row 2: * P1, K1 * P1
Row 3: * P1, K1 * P1
Row 4: * K1, P1 * K1

, The end result should be something similar to the seed stitch but more elongated.

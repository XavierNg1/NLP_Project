 Rabbits cause a problem when it comes to plants such as lettuce, carrots, or potatoes. It's a good thing that rabbits hate garlic. Before dusk, lay a few garlic cloves around your plants and they will not go near them.
 Slugs are another thing gardeners hate. Slugs love to eat leafs and stems off plants.Though, there are two things slugs really love: beer and salt.

Fill a little bowl up with beer.
Place this bowl next to any plant. All the slug will want to do is go to the beer, not your plants.
Place a ring of salt around the plant. Slugs die almost suddenly when they come to contact with salt.
 To keep them away:

Make a small spray to warn them off. All you need is a spray bottle, dish soap, and water.
Mix the soap and water together. Pour it into the bottle.
Spray it on the parts of the plants you don't want to get eaten. These parts can be leafs and stems.
 Though they seem nice, they still like to dig up plants and use it as a litter box. To keep them from doing this, spread some black pepper or cayenne pepper by your plants. Cats and dogs hate the smell of the pepper so they won't go anywhere near the plants.

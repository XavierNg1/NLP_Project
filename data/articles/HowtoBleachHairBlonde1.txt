 Don't dye or otherwise process your hair in the months leading up to the bleaching. Bleaching your hair will work much better if your hair is relatively strong and unprocessed. Your hair will withstand the rigorous bleaching process better, too.


Use natural shampoo and conditioner for strong hair. Avoid products containing sulfates and alcohol, which dry out your hair.
Avoid chemical-laden hair sprays, gels, serums, and other products.
Use heat-styling tools as little as possible.;
, Decide what shade you're aiming for, then head to your local beauty store. Bleach powder comes in either packets or tubs; it can be more economical to buy a tub if you're planning on bleaching your hair more than once.


Grab a tint brush (for applying products), a bowl, and plastic wrap.
If you have very dark hair, buy red gold corrector. You add it to the bleach powder to increase its effectiveness, so you don't have to bleach twice. If you have long, thick hair, you may need two tubes of corrector.
 If your hair is blonde or light brown, use a 20 or 30 volume developer. If your hair is black or very dark, you may need 40 volume developer; this is very damaging so try to avoid if possible. The lower the volume, the less damaging it is to hair., If you want to go platinum, you'll need toner. It takes the yellow/orange color out of just-bleached hair. Some toners can make hair white, some create warm golden tones, and others create a silvery effect. If you aren't sure, ask someone at the beauty supply store to assist you., These chemicals are strong, so crack a window! Set up all your equipment within easy reach so you can work more easily and minimize the amount of fumes you breathe.









Put on plastic gloves before you get started to protect your hands. If bleach gets on your skin at any point, wipe and rinse off immediately.

 Investing in real estate is typically viewed as a portfolio enhancer, an investment that complements stocks and bonds. Used as part of a larger investment plan, it can add stability to your income.
 Real estate investment can require a significant amount of capital, even beyond the price of the purchase. Ask yourself if you can afford to keep your investment if the market turns bad.


Since real estate is a tangible property, it will require maintenance and upkeep. While this is normally covered by rent paid by tenants, there may be times when there are no tenants to occupy the property, meaning that the costs will fall to the owner.
 If you decide to go into real estate trading, you have to be prepared for the worst. In the year that it might take you to renovate and sell, the market could take a dive and you'd be stuck with mortgage payments while you wait for it to sell.


Make sure that you have the capital to commit to a potentially long-term project.

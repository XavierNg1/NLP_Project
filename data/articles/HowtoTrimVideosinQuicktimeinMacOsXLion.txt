 You can trim any video or audio file that QuickTime supports. QuickTime is typically located in your Dock, and can also be found in the Applications folder.;
, You can access the Trim tool by either clicking the Edit menu and selecting Trim, or by clicking the arrow icon next to the Fast Forward button and selecting Trim from the menu. This will change the bar into the Trim tool.
 You can trim from either the beginning or end of the clip. Once you are satisfied with the result, click the Trim button.The trimmed sections of the clip are not removed, but instead QuickTime will start and stop playback at these new points. This means that if you open the file in a different media player, the Trim adjustments you made will not exist.
Because the Trim function does not actually remove data, trimming your videos will not affect file size.
If you wish to revert your Trim adjustments, load the movie in another media player and Save it as a new copy. This new copy will no longer have the start and stop markers that you set with the Trim tool.

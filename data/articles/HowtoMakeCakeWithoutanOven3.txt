 Place the baking mix, sugar, and milk directly into a standard microwave-safe mug. Mix the ingredients with a fork until combined.Not every mug is microwave-safe, so you should check yours before using it. An 8-oz (250-ml) microwave-safe ramekin would also work well for this recipe.
Try to break apart as many lumps as possible while stirring the ingredients together. A few small ones may remain, but most should be broken apart and mixed into the batter.
Ideally, there should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between the top of the batter and the top of the mug. If there's too much batter, consider pouring half of it into a separate mug.
 Sprinkle the chocolate chips into the batter. Stir and fold them into the batter until evenly distributed


You can omit the chocolate chips if you would prefer a plain yellow cake. Other additions, like small nuts or sprinkles, could also be used in similar proportions.
 Cover the mug with plastic wrap and microwave the cake on full power for at least 60 seconds, or until the center is set.


Microwaves that run on a lower power may need up to an additional 40 seconds of cooking time. If the center isn't set after the initial 60 seconds, continue to microwave the cake in 10-second intervals until done.
Note that a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean if the center has set.
 Remove the plastic wrap and decorate the cake with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, or powdered sugar, as desired. Eat the cake directly out of the mug.

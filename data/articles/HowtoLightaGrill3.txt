 Place the chimney starter on the open grill. Most chimney starters will hold approximately one-hundred coals. How much charcoal you need will depend on how hot your want your grill. For high heat, fill the chimney. For medium heat, fill it halfway. For low heat, fill it one-quarter full., Your chimney starter has a spot on the bottom to add paper. Fill the space with one or two pieces of paper. Any kind of paper works. For example, if you have old newspapers lying around you can use them to start your chimney.

You donâ€™t need to add lighter fluid to the charcoal when you use a chimney starter.
 Use a long match or lighter to set the paper alight. Light it on several spots to ensure the fire spreads. As the paper burns, it will ignite the charcoal in your chimney.Watch the coals to make sure they begin to turn grey. If not, light another piece of paper under your chimney.
 When most of the coals are grey and you start to see flames on top of your chimney, pour the coals out into your grill. Spread the coals evenly across the bottom of the grill with a long-handled instrument, such as a pair of tongs.

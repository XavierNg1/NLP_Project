 These will be your teams. Give everyone in the group a piece of paper and a pen/pencil. Make sure each person has a writing utensil and uniform pieces of paper to write their questions on.


Ensure that these groups of four are people who do not typically interact with one another. Follow a similar approach whether it be in a classroom or other an environment of playtime for kids. Getting to know each other more personally is important to the childâ€™s development of his or her sense of self , a great attribute in both social and learning environments for kids.
 Everyone in the group writing questions should avoid rhetorical, straight-to-the-point "yes" or "no" questions. Instead, ask questions that will allow the group to get to know one another.


These questions include, but are not limited to:

Where are you from?
What are your favorite hobbies?
What's your favorite movie?
What is your favorite food?



, The person will repeat the question to their partner and give their answer. They will then ask their "neighbor" the question and wait for the answer as well. Encourage follow-up dialogue to further emphasize creating dialogue between people. This is Round 1.
 After both pairs within the group have asked each other their respective questions, have the pair switch partners to ask and answer a new question with a new partner. Again, encourage follow up dialogue. This is Round 2.
 Have the participants repeat the steps and write down a new question on a sheet of paper, fold it, and then pass the paper to their neighbor. Facilitate the social exercise once again.

Mission: King Kaliente's Spicy Return. Beat King Kaliente before opening the Gate. If done correctly (with dodging meteors), you finally get the "Grand Star" and open the gate and the Garden.;
, That doesn't mean you chase down those bunnies anymore! You can immediately go to the place where you bumped into Rosalina for the 1st Time!

, She will not give you the little Luma this time, this time she'll trust Mario/Luigi to take the Red Star. This will transform you to red and black.
 Spin in mid-air to fly!

, Beware! Stay safe! It is more likely to encounter enemies and thorns while having 100 Purple coins.
 You know it will earn a hungry luma right where the gate HUD is.

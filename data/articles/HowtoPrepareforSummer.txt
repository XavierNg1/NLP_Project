 Buy cool clothes and accessories that are IN this season so you will look totally stylish. If you're on a tight budget then wear what makes you comfortable and own your look.;
, You will feel very lazy during the summer, so don't wear a lot of makeup, but still, take care of yourself. Wear some waterproof mascara, full coverage foundation(be sure to take it off at night),add a small amount of blush to give you a shimmering glow, and don't forget lip gloss (you'll want your lip gloss that blends with your lips).
 All you need to say is, "I hope you have a good summer and I hope to see you next year!" Then sign your first and last name. If you don't want to say much to a person you don't like all you need to do is just sign your first name.
 Buy a camera. It's good to make a photo album so you can visit memories whenever you want.
 Don't waste this season watching TV every day. Get into crafts classes, swimming classes or even dancing classes. Anything that can keep you from spending hours watching TV.
 At a local gym you can play badminton, volleyball, Frisbee, ping pong etc. Those are some favorites. If you aren't active much, a walk in the park will do you good. Maybe start eating healthier so you will feel your best when you wear that bikini. Rock climbing or sport climbing is a great thing to do during the summer but the rock climbing joints are hard to find so you're lucky if your town offers one!

, Be careful, you don't want to end up looking like a carrot. Just buy a nice spray tan from a local drugstore, but never apply it with your hands.
 There's nothing better than relaxing at the beach watching the ocean.
 There's nothing better than someone walking with his/her head straight up feeling her best. Plus, guys/girls will stop to check you out.
 invite over friends, get a week to go on vacation, make plans with significant other, etc.

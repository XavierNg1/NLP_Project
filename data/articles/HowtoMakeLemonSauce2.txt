 You should have one uniform mixture with the peel evenly disbursed throughout.









When all is said and done, this recipe will yield about 1 1/2 cups of lemon sauce.
 Whisk in the sugar and butter as the liquids cook. Make sure to stir constantly until the butter is melted and the sauce comes to a full boil.
 Let it cool slightly and serve warm. This creamy version is great on bread pudding, gingerbread, and even ice cream. And it's so easy to make!









This can keep in the fridge (in an air-tight container) for up to a month, though it's best served warm. And it probably won't last that long anyway!

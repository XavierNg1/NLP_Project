 There are several online services available that can attempt to fix your corrupt PowerPoint file. Avoid using these for presentations with sensitive material, as you’re essentially handing the file over to strangers. Some popular sites include:


online.officerecovery.com/powerpoint/
onlinefilerepair.com/repair

, Click the “Choose File” button and browse for your corrupted presentation file. Once you’ve found it, upload it to the online repair service.
 The time this will take will depend on the service’s current queue, but should only take a few minutes at most.
 After the recovery process is complete, you’ll receive an email with a link to view your recovered slides. Depending on the service, you may get this link directly through the website instead.
 The recovery service may not have been able to completely restore the presentation, but you’ll receive every slide that it could possibly extract.

 There is no train transportation. You may contact the Chicago Transit Authority for public bus routes. Obtain a site map and information about parking lot locations at the McCormick Place website.
 McCormick Place is a large trade show venue with several events often held simultaneously. Use the site map obtained from McCormick place to identify the parking lot entrances. If possible, park in the lot closest to your event.
 Prices range from about $15 to more than $30, depending on the lot rate and the amount of time you spend at the conference.
 Follow the signs to your event.
 Stop at the desks at the entrance to pay for event access. The fee will vary by event. If you already have a badge or prepaid registration ticket, this will not be necessary.
 You will be expected to show your ticket or badge.

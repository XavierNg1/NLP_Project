 Use exfoliating shower gel to clean off the grime. Turn the water to hot to start the shower (because it cleans you more effectively), but towards the end of your shower, turn the water to a lukewarm or cool setting. This lowers your body temperature to make you feel cooler (and wakes you right up in the morning!).;
, A great trick is to use baby oil instead of the normal lotions. While you're still damp, rub small amounts all over your body. If you prefer scented lotions, use something light. Opt towards citrus or flowers for a nice crisp scent. Heavy scents like Vanilla or Coconut can make you feel warm. Bath and Body works has lots of nice scents (Sweet Pea and Cucumber Melon are ideal for summer), and they usually have coupons and sales.
 Sweat and oil can accumulate and clog your pores, making your face feel dirty and heavy. A good exfoliating cream and a light moisturizer should do the trick

, Ponytails always work. Be sure to wash your hair at least once a week (or however often you need to for your hair type) to keep your scalp clean and healthy.
 You should do this at least twice a day anyway. A fresh, clean mouth can make your tongue feel cooler. Minty toothpastes and gum are good to use during the summer to help you feel cool.
 Remember: the lighter the color the less heat it attracts, so try to choose brighter colors like white, pink, yellow and orange. The weight of the fabric is also important to consider, so silk shirts will keep you cooler than denim.
 When doing outdoor sports/activities, bring plenty of cold water or Gatorade and try to stay in the shade as much as possible. A small fan or a spray bottle can help you avoid heat exhaustion too, if you want.
 The water and vitamins in fruit will treat you much better than the sodium in those savory treats.
 This can make your house feel several degrees cooler and help you avoid turning on the air conditioner, which draws a lot of power.

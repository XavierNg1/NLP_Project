 When you're wearing short shorts, you're showing off your legs to the world. Make sure yours look how you want them to. If you want skinny or muscular thighs, you may need to do some aerobics or strength training to tone them.


While it's perfectly fine to want to change how you look, do your best to love yourself as you are. Legs of all shapes and sizes are beautiful.
 While the choice between hairy and smooth legs is yours to make, keep in mind that hairless legs tend to look longer and more toned.Depending on your body hair pattern, it may also be prudent to wax your inner thighs and/or bikini area. Visible pubic hair can be an embarrassing problem when wearing short shorts.
 Although winter may be the most famous season for dry skin, many people deal with this issue well into the summer. When accentuating your legs, remember to spend as much time on them as you do your face. Moisturize daily and after each shave to avoid embarrassing flaky skin.


Remember that highly-chlorinated pool water can dry out your skin. If you find yourself having this problem, be sure to rinse your skin with normal tap water and a mild soap after every swim.

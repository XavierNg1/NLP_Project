 Add a little more than 2 cups (0.48 liters) of water to a small pot. Heat the water to boiling. Scrub the ginger clean, then cut it into pieces. Add the pieces to the water, and let it boil for about 15 minutes. It doesn't need to be a rolling boil, just a simmer, so turn the heat down if it seems too hot. When it's done, take it off the stove, and let the ginger sit in the water until the water is cool to the touch. It could take 15 to 30 minutes to cool, depending on the temperature of the room. Remove the ginger.Ginger may help with muscle soreness.;
, Scrub the outside of the lemons. To help release the juices, you can either press down and roll the lemon back and forth on a hard surface or heat it in the microwave for about 30 seconds. Cut the lemons in half, and squeeze them into the jar you're using for your sports drink.The lemons provide potassium to the drink.
 Pour in the rest of the water, about 4.5 cups (1.08 liters) of it. Add the ginger water to it, along with the 1/2 teaspoon (2.46 milliliters) of salt. Stir until the salt dissolves. Pour or sprinkle in an organic sweetener, such as stevia, until it's at a sweetness you like. Cover and store in the refrigerator until you're ready to drink it.

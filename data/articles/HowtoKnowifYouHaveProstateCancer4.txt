 Generally, if the disease is localized to the prostate, it is curable. If the cancer is susceptible to hormone treatments, the prognosis is considered to be favorable. The three-year survival rate for prostate cancer is 100% for local invasion, 99.1% for regional invasion, and 33.1% for distant metastasis., If the cancer is only in the prostate, it can generally be treated with a radical prostatectomy, which means surgically removing the prostate.For older males with a life expectancy of less than ten years who have not displayed symptoms, it may be advisable to observe the condition before committing to surgery. This is because surgery on the prostate can cause additional complications that include urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction., For prostate cancer that has progressed beyond the prostate to local regions of the body, radiation therapy is usually prescribed. In addition, deprivation of androgens (hormones that maintain male characteristics) may help to decrease the spread of the disease. When the prostate cancer has become locally invasive, treatment aims to decrease the spread of the cancer., Once the prostate cancer has invaded other parts of the body, treatment regimens will usually entail reducing the amount of testosterone produced in the body, which can be a more radical approach to reducing androgens than with locally invasive disease.Anti-androgens — These medications will aim to block androgens from expressing their effects on the proper hormonal tissue receptors in the body to reduce testosterone production.GnRH antagonists — These medications will bind to receptors in the pituitary gland and help to suppress the production of testosterone.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing agonists — These medications will also affect the androgen producing pathways of your body to reduce testosterone.
Orchiectomy — This procedure calls for the complete removal of the testes. This is usually reserved for patients who are non-compliant with their medications.

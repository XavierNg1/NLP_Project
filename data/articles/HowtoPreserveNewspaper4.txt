 Another option for preserving newspapers is to use a scanner or copier to reproduce the document. Scanning allows you to create a digital copy of the newspaper that you can keep on your computer and then view digitally or make copies of it whenever you want. Copies made on regular printing paper will be more durable than the original newspaper itself.


Make sure that you donâ€™t run the newspaper through an automatic feeder as it could damage the original document. Instead, carefully place the newspaper on the top glass for scanning, being careful not to press down too hard on the cover., In addition to scanning your newspaper, you can also preserve it by taking digital pictures of the newspaper pages. This will create a digital image that you can save on your electronic devices for future use.


To do this, you can use a digital camera or even the camera on your smartphone.
 If you want to display your newspaper, consider using a printed photocopy for the actual display instead of the original. A photocopy, even one made on standard printing paper, will hold up better over time as it is exposed to the light and other elements.Then you can store the original newspaper in a storage box so that it will be preserved more safely.

 Pea staking involves the use of dead branches as natural stakes. This style of staking works best for bushes with a spreading growth habit. Head out into the woods and find a few branched twigs that have a solid main branch.This method of staking can add some pizazz to your planters or garden beds if you come across colorful branches, such as dogwood.;
, Stick the thickest end of your twigs down into the ground 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) deep so they won’t blow over in the wind.


This is a good method for giving bushes some guidance while growing or for fixing a bush that has sustained damage and needs support., Place twigs near parts of the bush that need extra support. You’ll want to have the twig make physical contact with the bush since you will not be tying your bush to the twig.Place twigs around the entire bush if you’re wanting to guide its growth or place them selectively if you’re just fixing a few areas that are damaged.
Since your twig will have many branches, it’ll help naturally support the weight of your plant and help guide its growth.
 You may need to replace your branched twigs over time if they decompose. You should also be proactive in moving them as your bush grows, so as not to stunt growth.You’ll know to move your twigs when the bush begins overtaking them in growth. Simply move the twig out a little bit further from the plant.
 So not to weaken your bush, you should remove the supports once your bush has reached maturity or no longer needs the extra support.

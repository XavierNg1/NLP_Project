 When you first spawn, in the room with double points in the cell and the M14 on the wall, there should be a room next to it with an Olympia. Unlock this, then once in there you should see a staircase.;
, Unlock this gate. When you run through there will be a red drawing of a wolf's head on your right, and a handy 3-round burst pistol in front of you, the B23R.
 After a couple of rounds, the drawing will string to life, revealing what looks like a hell hound, but only its head is visible. It will be snapping and barking.
 It should fly into the dog's mouth and the dog will munch it up. Continue this until the dog gives one last howl and shrinks back into the wall. Move onto the next dog.
 You can access this through the dining room. When you get there, there is a UZI on the wall to the left, and this wouldn't be a wasteful purchase. Repeat step 1, but the zombies can come from behind you through the roof, so watch your back. Once the Dog has vanished, move onto the next and final dog.
 It is here where you can also upgrade the Blundergat to the Acid-Gat, if you have the required objects (See step 2). Feed the dog, watching your back once more, as zombies can jump off the dock behind you. Once the dog has disappeared, you can now get the Hell's Retriever.

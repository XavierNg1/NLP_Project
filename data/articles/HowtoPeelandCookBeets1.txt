 Roasting beets is a delicious way to bring out their flavor and preserve their nutrients. Roasted beets make a great addition to salads, and they're wonderful when they are plain as well.









Scrub the beets; make sure to remove all the dirt.
Trim the green tops from the beets with a sharp knife.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).
Rub the beets in olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place the beets in a roasting pan lined with aluminum foil. Cover the beets with another sheet of foil.
Place the pan in the oven and roast for at least an hour. Test to see if the beets are done by poking them with a fork. If you feel resistance, keep roasting the beets. If the flesh is soft, they are done.
Remove the beets from the oven and allow them to cool.
When the beets have cooled, peel off their outer skins. Use them in a recipe or serve plain.;
, Boiling beets results in a soft, wet textured beet.









Trim the leaves from the beets; be careful to leave about two inches of the leaf stalk intact. This is important to prevent bleeding while cooking.
Place the beets in a pot and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil.
Boil the beets until they are fork tender.
When the beats are almost ready, fill the sink or a large bowl with very cold water.
Drain the hot water from the beets, then plunge them into the cold water.

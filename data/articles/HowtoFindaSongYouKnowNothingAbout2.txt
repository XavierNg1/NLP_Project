 Type any lyrics you remember into Google, making sure to add quotation marks around the lyrics. This limits the search to those words in that order, so even if all you can remember is "she said you would be mine," it'll be easier to find if you group them in quotes.
 If you're looking for a song you heard during the credits of a TV show, do a quick search for "Song playing at the end of Sopranos Episode Six, Season Five" or "Song in Mazda commercial."


If you think you're getting close, use iTunes. If you heard the song on a TV show or movie, try searching for the soundtrack on iTunes. If you find it, play free samples of each song on the album by hovering your mouse over the track number and pressing the blue play button that appears.
You can also try searching on YouTube when you've narrowed your search down some.
 Describe whether its sung by a male, female or group, and any other kinds of descriptions of the song you might remember. Ask yourself if the song sounds familiar. Is the voice distinct? Could it be somebody you already listen to or like? If you think it sounds a lot like a singer or group you have heard, check that band's website or their fan sites to see if they have any new releases and listen to them

, If you're hearing the song on the radio, try to stick around for a moment and listen. The DJ may go over the songs he or she just played. Call the station or visit the station's website to see if they post a playlist of the songs played that day.

 And just like anything we do in life, fear comes from ‘not knowing’. So imagine what you could accomplish if you could perform home wiring safely and confidently. Imagine saving thousands of dollars over the years, if you could do-it-yourself!;
, It’s very important that you do not get in a hurry. Make sure that you have planned your project adequately, and that you’ve allowed plenty of time to complete your project, or at least if you have to pull off of it and come back to it later, that you find a suitable stopping point, and that you can do without the circuit that you’re working on.
 It’s not only dangerous. It is lethal. Shut the power off to any circuit that you are working on. (This means turn the power off at the circuit breaker panel. Just switching off a wall switch does not turn off the power in the wires.) Confirm the power is off with a simple pocket tester, a multi-meter, or lamp, blow dryer or another similar appliance.
, Fiberglass ladders are non-conductive. Don’t use an aluminum ladder. Spend the money for a good fiberglass stepladder.
, Never work barefoot or in socks or slippers, and don’t assume that it’s safe to work without rubber-soled shoes on concrete floors. Concrete is conductive, particularly when it’s damp (a good reason to never load or unload your washing machine while you’re barefoot).
 Even if by definition it’s called an insulator. (A conductor allows the flow of electrons, and an insulator resists the flow of electrons).
 OSHA requires us as contractors to lock it off, and tag it out with a procedure called lock out/tag out. It involves red tags and devices that will lock the breaker off to prevent it from being turned on. (If you have your panel cover off, remember that even when you turn breakers off, there are still energized components in the panel itself!).
 or “Danger�?, or something similar, so anybody who approaches that panel will see that, and immediately know what’s going on.
, Put your other hand either in your pocket or behind your back, and that’s a good practice to develop anyway. What that does is keeps you from grabbing a circuit with two hands and providing a path for the electricity to flow through your heart.
, It is well worth spending a little extra money to purchase quality tools. I’m referring to hand tools like your lineman pliers, screwdrivers, wire strippers, and other hand tools that you will use for electrical work. For instance, Good wire strippers will prevent you from nicking or skinning the wires. Good screwdrivers will prevent slipping out of screw heads or rounding them out. You get my point; good tools not only improve the quality of your workmanship, but improve your confidence as well. So don’t skimp on tools. You can stock your tool pouch with good quality tools for $100 or less.

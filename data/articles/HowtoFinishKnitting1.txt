 This type of cast-off requires two knitting needles. It will create a tight edge without much stretchiness. Replace your right-hand needle with a larger one if you want it to have a little more give., It often works best to continue following the project's pattern on this row, though you can also knit or purl across. This will leave you with two stitches on your right-hand needle and the rest of the project still on your left-hand needle.
 Use your fingers to gently lift it up and over. The second stitch will now form a loop around the yarn leading to the first. Keep the remaining first stitch on the right-hand needle.
 The new stitch should now be the one closest to the point of your right needle, while what was previously the first stitch is now the second. Continue to follow the project's pattern if you're using one. These stitches will functionally be your final row.
 Keep adding another stitch to the right needle and pulling the older stitch over it and off the needle. Work until the last stitch of your project is alone on your right needle. Be extra careful when doing these stitches, as they will make up the edge of your project. The quality of the stitching will be much more apparent than with the inner rows.
 Make sure to leave a tail of free yarn between one to five inches long. Leave a longer tail if you plan to sew or weave this piece to another. For weaving, leave at least 12 inches.
 Remove your piece from the right-hand needle. Tug the tail until the final loop is closed and secure. Trim off any extra tail yarn unless you will be adding to it later as previously discussed.

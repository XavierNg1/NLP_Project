 You can remind yourself to sit up straight by placing a post-it note on your computer monitor reading “Hey! Sit up straight!”If you find yourself becoming desensitized to the presence of this little reminder, you could also enter alarms on your phone that go off at twenty or thirty-minute intervals with a message to sit up straight at your computer. Finally, you could enlist help of a friend or colleague to send you random texts or instant messages throughout the day reading, “Sit up straight!”Taking breaks regularly at set intervals and stretching periodically will help you overcome bad posture.
 Key objects are those that you intend to use frequently, such as your phone, stapler, or coffee mug. Place them to the side of your keyboard or mouse so you don’t have to reach, and thereby upset your proper posture., Chairs might sink slightly or roll away from the desk over the course of the day. When you return to your desk after a break, reset your keyboard, mouse, screen, and chair to their most ergonomic settings.

 Classic curtain swags and tails are the most popular because they tend to be more elegant and mesh well with just about any full-length curtain. However, there are other options to consider, including scarf curtain swags and fishtail swags.;
, The rod will be visible after installation, and it needs to complement the look you are trying to achieve.
 You need to know the curtain swags' size and length.
, The brackets and screws to mount them should be included with the rods and can be installed using a screwdriver or power drill if necessary. Hang the rod onto the brackets.
 Insert the straight pin that was included in the curtain packaging into the fold to mark the middle of the scarf.
 Remove the straight pin once the scarf is secured. The clips should also be provided in the package from the curtain's manufacturer.
 Wrap it the same number of times on each side of the center clip so the effect is uniform.
 The tails, or scarf ends, should hang at the same height, and the droop in your swag wraps should also be equal. Adjust the curtains to your liking.

 Avoid using “I,” “we” or “me” in your lab report. Instead, use language such as, “The hypothesis was supported…”, Once you’ve finalized your conclusion, read through the entire report to make sure it is logical. Watch for any places where you might contradict yourself, and correct these instances. Your conclusion should reiterate what you learned from the experiment and how you came to understand these learning outcomes.
 Check for spelling and grammatical errors in your report. A report that contains errors can inadvertently decrease the report’s reliability. Take the time to ensure your report is error-free.

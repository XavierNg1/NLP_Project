 Your iPad has no built-in support for Flash content. You will need to download and install a third-party browser that comes with Flash support.;
, There are several apps that support Flash. The two most popular options are Photon Flash Player and Puffin Web Browser. Puffin Web Browser has a free trial version available so that you can test if it works properly.



Click here for detailed instructions on installing apps from the App Store.
 After it has finished installing, tap the new browser's icon on your Home screen to open it up.
 The Photon browser allows you to turn Flash support on and off. Turning Flash off improves the browser's performance, but prevents you from loading Flash content. You can toggle Flash on by tapping the "Lightning Bolt" button in the upper-right corner.
 The Flash content should begin playing as if you were using a computer to view the content.


Some Flash content may run poorly on the iPad. This is an unfortunate limitation of third-party browsers.
Ensure that you have a fast internet connection, as loading Flash content can put a strain on your bandwidth.

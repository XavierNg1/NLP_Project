 You must review accommodations that are possible to enable the employee to do his or her job.


You cannot prove an accommodation would be too difficult or expensive unless you know exactly what accommodations are available.
Available accommodations can include those suggested by the employee or proposed by a state or federal government agency.
Accommodations may include restructuring the job, modifying equipment or devices, providing a reader or interpreter, or rearranging work schedules., In most states an employer won't be liable for disability discrimination if the cost to the business outweighs the benefit the employee would receive from the proposed accommodation.


The cost of an accommodation often is compared to the size of your business. For example, as a small-business owner, you may not be required by state or federal law to make an accommodation that a large corporation would be expected to make as a matter of course.In calculating the financial burden of the accommodation, you must evaluate other sources of funding, such as tax credits or deductions, that may be available to meet the cost of the accommodation., Evaluate what your business would have to do to provide available accommodations for the employee.


Even if the employee is otherwise qualified, you aren't required to make accommodations for his or her disability if those accommodations would require significant difficulty or expense.Keep in mind that financial difficulty alone typically isn't enough to prove undue hardship. The difficulty in making the accommodation must include something more than simply a lack of money.

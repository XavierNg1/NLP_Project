 If you have at least three people in your band, its good to mix their first names.
 This will influence how much of your names you choose to use.



If you have three people in your band, have at least a 6 letter name so there are 2 letters for each person.
If the names of your band are ___, ___, ___, (for example, Tom, Dick and Harry), take the first 2 letters of Tom, To, the second 2 letters of Dick, ic, and the last 2 letters of Harry, ry, and add them together. As Toicry doesn't sound right, change it slightly yo Tockry.
 If that doesn't sound good, add "The" to the start. For example, The Tockry Tools.

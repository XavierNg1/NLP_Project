 There are two main types of car alarms: passive alarms and active alarms.


Passive alarms will automatically be armed after the car ignition is off and all the doors are closed.
Active alarms require you to press a button to arm the system.;
, Most car alarms also act as keyless entry units, where you can lock and unlock the car via the alarm remote. However, alarms also have other features you can choose from that may interest you and your needs.


Automatic rearm will re-lock your doors if you do not open them after pressing the unlock or disarm button on the remote. This feature is helpful if you accidentally unlock or disarm the car, or if you forget you unlocked the car.
Ignition controlled door locks will automatically lock your doors when the ignition is turned on, and will unlock them when the ignition is off and the key is taken out. This feature can usually be programmed to be used in different combinations.
Trunk output will automatically open the trunk when a button is pressed. This is helpful if you are doing heavy shopping or you transport bulky things a lot. You can get your trunk open without having to put anything down.
Car finder mode can help if you cannot find your car in a parking lot easily. Press the button and a siren will chirp continuously and the parking lights will flash, which is helpful for those who tend to forget where they parked the car.



Look for those that carry alarms with the features you are interested in so you talk to someone with more expertise in car alarms.
Look at and compare the brands that they carry. You can also compare prices between a few stores.
Be sure to ask about manufacturer warranties and store warranties.

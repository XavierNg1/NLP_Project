 Write the title in italics. After the title, use a period, then the abbreviation “s.v.” to show the entry has no author. For example:


“Merriam-Webster. s.v.”

, Add the date you accessed the information after the title of the entry. For example:


“Merriam-Webster. s.v. ‘Judge.’ Accessed October 1, 2014,”

, The URL is the address of the website. For example:


“Merriam-Webster. s.v. ‘Judge.’ Accessed October 1, 2014, http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/judge.”

, Use your word-processing software to create a footnote. The footnote will look very similar to the bibliographic entry. Your footnote would look like this: #*“Merriam-Webster. s.v. ‘Judge,’ accessed October 1, 2014, http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/judge.”


Note the main differences are a few periods that are now commas, and “Accessed” is now “accessed.”

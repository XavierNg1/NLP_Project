 You can import paydata from an Excel spreadsheet. First, you must create a spreadsheet with the exact same columns as the paydata grid. Open a paydata grid and export the column headers to an excel file.


From the “Process” menu, select “Paydata.”
Select an existing batch. Click the “Other Actions” link and select “Export to File.”
Choose options for naming the file and what information to include in the export, and then click on “Export” at the bottom of the window.
When the file download window opens, choose the location where you want to save the file and click on “Save.”
This will create an Excel file in a .CSV format. Enter all of your paydata in the Excel file.
 You can import paydata from your external Excel file into the ADP system. First you have to upload the file to the ADP server. Then you can import the data into the paydata grid.


From the “Process” menu select “Import.”
You will be directed to an import window. Select “Paydata” from the options on the left.
Click on the green “add” button.
Select “Browse for Files” and choose the file you want to upload. Once your file has uploaded, click “Done,” and you will be returned to the Import Paydata window.
Now the file has been copied to the ADP server, and you want to import it to the paydata grid. Select your file from the list. Select the “other actions” and click on “start.” When the import is finished, a “Success” message will display in the window.
Now you can return to the Paydata page to edit your batch if needed.
 This is ADP’s time management and attendance software. You can purchase it with your ADP software package. It is a cloud-based system. Employees can log in to the system and enter their timecard information, hours and any other relevant payroll information. This data is automatically uploaded to your paydata grid. You can get into the system and manually correct or adjust any data as needed. This process saves a lot of time and limits mistakes due to data entry errors.

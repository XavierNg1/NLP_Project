 To start this look, apply your favorite smoothing product to your hair while it is still wet. Use a product that controls frizz well for your hair type., If you have naturally curly hair that you want to style into looser waves using just your blow dryer and a brush, it's best to start by blow drying it straight. To do this, hold your round brush under a section of your hair near the roots. Then pull the brush straight down towards the ends of your hair while you hold the hair dryer against the top of the brush with your other hand.

It may help to work in small sections. Pin up the rest of your hair as you work to blow dry one area at a time.
Use the flat nozzle attachment for your blow dryer for the best results.
Your goal should be to get your hair as straight as possible during this step, as you will be adding in waves later on. Using the high heat and speed settings on your blow dryer will help you achieve this.
 Once your hair is dry, twirl each section around your round brush and continue to apply heat with the blow dryer. When you release the brush, you should have a nice loose wave.

Try experimenting with different sized brushes. A smaller brush will give you a tighter wave.
The length of time you will have to hold the blow dryer to your wave to make it hold will depend on the thickness and texture of your hair.
Applying hair spray while your hair is twisted around the brush may help it hold the wave.
 If your hair is prone to frizziness, keep it at bay by applying some anti-humidity finishing spray when you're done styling.

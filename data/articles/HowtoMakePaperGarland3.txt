 You can use any color or pattern you want. To make your banner look more interesting, consider using more than one color, shade, or pattern. For example:


If the garland is for a baby shower, you can use pink/blue paper and white paper with pink/blue polka-dots.
If the garland is for a party with an ocean theme, consider using light blue, medium blue, and dark blue colored papers.
 If your paper is a design on it, make sure that you are folding with the design part out. The blank/white part should be on the inside.
 With the paper still folded, cut it straight down the middle. You will end up with twice as many folded papers.
 The point of the triangle should be on the open part of the paper. The flat part of the triangle should be on the fold. If you were to open up your paper, you would end up with a diamond shape.
 This will be your blank space. You will not be putting any paper on these ends. This is so that you can hang your garland easier.
 Run a glue stick along the edges and down the center fold. You can also draw a squiggle of glue down the middle of the triangle.
 Run your fist across the paper to smooth it down and seal it.
 You can have them as close together or as far apart as you want. Be sure to leave at least a few inches/centimeters of space between the triangles so that the garland will hang nicely.
 You can cut letters out of colorful paper and glue them down using a glue stick. You can also paint the letters on using a stencil and some acrylic paint.

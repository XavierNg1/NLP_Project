 This means that some grades make up a bigger percentage of your final grade. For example, your grade may be made up of 30% participation, 4 quizzes at 10% each, and a final exam at 30%. Figuring out how your participation grades and final exam affect your grade, when they are 3 times as important as each quiz grade, is the tricky part.


Check your syllabus or ask your teacher how the grades are weighted.
In high school, it's common for advanced classes, such as Advanced Placement classes, to be assigned more "quality points" than average classes. If you are trying to calculate your GPA, make sure you know how each course is weighted., To make it easier to organize, you might want to first write out your grades and the total points possible in separate columns. Then multiply each number times the amount it is weighted. Keep track of these numbers in a new column.Example: If a final exam is worth 30% of your total grade and you received and 18/20, multiply 30 by 18/20. (30 x (18/20) = 540/600)

, Once you have multiplied each score by its weighted percentage, add the total number of points you received and total points possible. Divide the sum of all your weighted points by the sum of all the by the total weighted number of points.Example: Weight per assignment: Assignment 1= 10%, Assignment 2= 10%, Test 1= 30%, Test 2= 30%, Participation= 20%. Your Scores: Assignment 1= 18/20, Assignment 2= 19/20, Test 1= 15/20, Test 2= 17/20, Participation= 18/20.
Assignment 1: 10 x (18/20)= 180/200
Assignment 2: 10 x (19/20)= 190/200
Test 1: 30 x (15/20)= 450/600
Test 2: 30 x (17/20)= 510/600
Participation: 20 x (18/20)= 360/400
Total Score: (180+190+450+510+360) รท (200+200+600+600+400), or1690/2000 = 84.5%

, Now that you have identified your final percentage grade, accounting for the weighted assignments, compare that percentage to your class grading scale. This will be, for example, A=93-100, B=85-92, etc.It is common for teachers and professors to round scores up to the nearest percentage point. For example, your 84.5% will become 85% for the purposes of assigning a final grade.

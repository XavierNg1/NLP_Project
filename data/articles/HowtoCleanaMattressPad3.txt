 Set your washer to a warm/cool water setting and let it fill with water before you put the mattress pad in. If you put the pad in first, the vinyl backing on the pad can trap water in certain areas and prevent it from fully soaking the pad., Once the washer is filled with water, add a mild laundry detergent to the water. After you’ve added the detergent, spin the center agitator of your washing machine to thoroughly mix the water and detergent together. Again, you don’t want to add the mattress pad right away because it can prevent the water and detergent from fully mixing., You might use fabric softener in your other laundry, but don’t add it to the washing machine with your mattress pad. The chemicals in fabric softener can eat through and destroy the vinyl backing on your pad., Once you’ve got the water and detergent thoroughly mixed, add your mattress pad to the washing machine. Make sure that it’s fully submerged and not just floating on the top of the water. If this happens, the vinyl backing on your pad can block the fabric from reaching the water., If your mattress pad's care tag says you can dry the mattress pad in the dryer, set it to the lowest setting and add the mattress pad. You might have to dry the mattress pad more than once to get it completely dry.

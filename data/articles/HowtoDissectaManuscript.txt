, Choose how thick you want the slices and mark out the increments with a pencil. Do this on the outside and the inside as a guide for the cutting.
 Use the ruler to guide the initial slicing and you can then use the cut pages to guide the rest of the cuts. Be careful to keep the lines straight as the pages can shift and it's easy to slice off thin ribbons of paper. Move from cutting line to cutting line and go through the book.
 With the whole book cut up, grab each section and alternate direction. Half go one way and the other half go the other way. Hold it down with your hand so it doesn't flop back into the middle.
 Plop some magazines down on top of the book to keep it in place. Now get out some ridiculously large design book that you got at the store on an impulse because it had some rad pictures and it was on sale and damn if that cover isn't trippy.
 Sweet, you're done and now the book needs some nice place to be appreciated. Close peeks at the book reveal several bits of random salaciousness to enjoy. Lust and greed and overdoses, this book has it all.

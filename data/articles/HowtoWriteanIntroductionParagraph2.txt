 There are many papers for which no historical context is needed, but if historical context can help clarify things to the reader, a historical review introduction can be very helpful.


These introductions are usually used for papers written about a historical time period or topic, a historical critique of a piece of literature, or a long-standing problem that people throughout the ages have tried to address.
 Outline or review a few key historical facts that offer the reader any essential information he or she might need in order to understand the topic of the paper.


These pieces of information should not only provide context about the topic, but should also indirectly present the general topic itself. In doing this, you will demonstrate the the reader how your topic fits into the historical account you present in your introduction.
 The information provided thus far will be fairly general, so you need to focus the end of your paragraph on a single thesis statement that you will use to define the rest of your paper.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
With this type of introduction, your thesis statement should cause the reader to view the historical facts you just presented in a specific light or through a specific lens. In effect, your thesis statement should tell the reader why the facts you presented before it are important to keep in mind.

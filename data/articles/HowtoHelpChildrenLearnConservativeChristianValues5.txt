 Do you tend to change career choices often, undecided and dissatisfied with your job and never really achieving career development? If so, discuss with your child how you have decided to follow a better, new plan and are now determined to alter the choices you've made regarding finding and developing your life work not just a job.
 Thinking positively about teaching love of your lifework is in having a skill and a work that you value and enjoy--love it! If you are not happy in your work, take action and make realistic plans to get increased training or a different job description: accept new kinds of responsibility.
 Watching you make these tough but rewarding changes will have a lasting impression on your child as you come to love your work--then they believe may expect that love for themselves.

 This could be a cake bowl, a cake mold or other large container that can be placed in the freezer. Add a desired amount of water.
 Use color liquid food coloring, food dye or any other non-toxic food coloring.


The more squirts/drops/amounts added, the darker the ice will look.
 Ensure that the food coloring is completely dissolved.
 Place in the freezer; take care not to spill it, as the coloring can stain any surfaces it falls on, including the freezer plastic.
 Check how the giant colored ice cube is freezing every hour or so.
 Tip it out of the bowl for use


The ice may crack; this is normal.
 Dump it into a large punch bowl or give it to the kids or dogs to enjoy.


You can even draw on pavement with a giant ice cube.
Toss a giant colored ice cube around in the snow for a really fun toy that's easy to keep finding again. It'll last for ages.

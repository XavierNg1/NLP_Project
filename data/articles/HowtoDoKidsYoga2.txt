 Mountain pose is a good basic pose to learn. To do mountain pose, stand up nice and tall with your feet shoulder-width apart. Your arms should be straight out at your sides with your palms facing forward and your fingers spread. Then, take in a slow, deep breath and reach your arms up to the ceiling as you inhale. Then bring your arms back down to your sides as you slowly exhale., Standing with your feet shoulder width apart, step one leg forward so that you are in a lunge position. The foot that goes forward should stay straight, but the foot that stays behind should be turned to the side. Next, reach both arms straight up in the air and look straight ahead. Hold this pose for three to six breaths.Make sure that your knee does not extend past your toes. You should be able to see your toes when you look down.
 Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Then, slowly bend down until your hands touch the ground. Once your hands have touched the ground use them to walk your upper body forward a few steps until it looks like you are the letter “V” turned upside down.Hold this pose for three to six breaths.


If you have tight hamstrings, then you can do downward facing dog with your knees bent slightly.You can also place your hands on a yoga brick if you cannot reach the ground.

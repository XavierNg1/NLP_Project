 Did your hamster seem ill recently? Clues to this might be that it stopped eating or lost its appetite, it was drinking more than usual and you were having to clean out wet bedding more frequently, it smelled bad, it had lost a lot of weight, or its habits had changed radically, for example it had stopped playing on its wheel. These are all indicators of ill health and could indicate your hamster has died.On the other hand, if the hamster seemed perfectly healthy before hand and this stillness is unexpected, it doesn't rule out death but it makes hibernation more likely.;
, How old is the hamster? An average lifespan is 18-24 months, with the odd hamster making it to 36 months. If your hamster is older than this, then it was very elderly, and the chances of it having passed away increase., Hibernation is temperature dependent. If the air temperature where the hamster was kept is above 20Â°C then hibernation is not very likely. On a hot day, consider if the hamster's cage is near an air conditioning unit. Air conditioners can kick out extremely cold air, which could cause your hamster to go into hibernation, so don't discount a low air temperature even in sweltering weather.
 Hibernation tends to happen at times when it would be difficult for the hamster to find enough resources to survive. These tend to be associated with harsh winters, when there are low temperatures, short day lengths, and a lack of food.Ask yourself if the hamster has more than 8 - 12 hours of daylight a day and has plenty of food. Scarcity of food teamed with low temperature and short day length could trigger hibernation.

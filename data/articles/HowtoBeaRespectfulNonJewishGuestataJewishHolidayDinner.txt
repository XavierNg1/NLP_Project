 Also note that your participation in Jewish customs, as led by your hosts, does not obligate you to anything in any way, nor will it nullify or "de-commit" you from your own spiritual path. Many non-Jews are open-minded to learning about how Jews live.;
, For the same reason, if you are a woman, do not expect hugs, kisses, or handshakes from Orthodox men.
 If it's an Orthodox Jewish home, and you're a woman, wear a modest (covers elbows, knee-length or longer hemline, no exposed decolletage), dressy dress, or blouse and skirt. If you're a man, wear a suit and tie, and you're likely to receive a kippah (skullcap) for your head. If it's NOT an Orthodox home, business casual clothes are likely appropriate.
 Depending on the level of observance, there may be further discussion for you to participate in centered around the biblical narrative for the week (after a brief description of the narrative is given- comments and opinions welcome), and singing. Shabbat is the celebration of The Creation and the Jews' (and humanity's) place in it- completed in 6 days, with G-d resting (and commanding the Jews also to rest) on the 7th day. A festive meal and drinks are served.
 Be prepared to spend at least 2 to 4 hours at the dining room table (you may want to eat a significant snack before you go- the full meal isn't served for an hour or two after your arrival), because Passover is the holiday in which the Jews were freed from slavery in Egypt, and the story itself is read from a Haggadah (Jewish book) along with prayers and songs.
 A good host will help guide you (and be reminding everyone else at the table- it's part of the culture to continuously explain what's going on and why), so relax and enjoy!

 Sometimes it could start a bigger problem if you just confront someone at school about taking your things without asking. It can be better to avoid an argument by someone older and wiser to get involved. If you have any doubts, it’s okay to go to a teacher or other trusted adult to make sure the problem gets solved fairly and without any fighting.If the person is your friend and it’s a little thing, just tell them that it hurts your feelings when they take from you.
If it's someone you’re not so friendly with, it might be better to have a teacher mediate, or help solve, the problem.
 If someone has a reputation for using other people’s stuff without asking, avoid them! Remember, when someone takes something that doesn’t belong to them without permission, it’s called stealing. If you hang out with someone who steals, you might end up in trouble yourself., Just like at home, if you don’t want someone using your stuff at school, you’d better keep it in a safe place. For example, don’t leave art supplies out if you don’t want to share them with the whole class.


If you have a locker, keep important stuff there and keep it locked.
Remember, even if you didn’t buy them yourself, books and school supplies can be very expensive. Be responsible, and don’t tempt people with your valuables by leaving them unattended.

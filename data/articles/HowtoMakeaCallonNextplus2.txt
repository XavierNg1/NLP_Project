 Look for the Nextplus app on your Android phone. It’s the one with the app icon with a chat box and a letter “N” on it. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap the head icon from the header menu bar. All your contacts will be loaded. Swipe up and down to scroll through them.
 Tap the name of the contact you want to call. His or her contact details will be displayed, including all the phone numbers.
 Tap the phone button beside the number you wish to call. A call screen will appear and the phone will ring. Once the person you’re calling picks up, you will be connected and you can now talk with each other.


If you know the number you want to call, you can dial it directly. The number you’re calling doesn’t need to belong to any contact. You can call any number in the world. Tap on the red dot matrix button floating on the bottom right corner, and a dial pad will appear. Tap in the phone number using the dial pad, then tap the phone or call button to make the call.
 On the call screen header are several buttons for tools you can use while on the call. You can also see the call duration on here.


Muting—Tap the microphone button to mute your end while on the call.
Using the loudspeaker—Tap the speaker button to use your device’s speaker so you can have the call hands-free.
 When you’re done with the call, tap the red phone button at the bottom of the screen to hang up. Your call will be ended.

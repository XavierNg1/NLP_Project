 The Watch app is black with a picture of a sideways-facing profile image of an Apple Watch.
 At first, it won't be seen, until you scroll the screen up a little ways.
 Slide the switch until it turns green. Green on this switch means that you've muted all your notifications except your Alarms and Timers while your Watch charges.


You can slide it the other way to turn Silent Mode off.
 You'll find the slider switch right above the option for Silent Mode. Slide it to the left to soften the volume of notifications when the watch has sounds turned on, and to the right, if you want to increase the volume.

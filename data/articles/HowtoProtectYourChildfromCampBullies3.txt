 Although you may not have time to sit and chat or play together for hours, taking regular time out to spend time with your child is a great way to support them. It can help protect your child from camp bullies because it lets your child know that you care about them. It can also help them relieve some of their stress and tension just knowing that you are there for them.Spending regular time together will also strengthen your relationship and make it easier for your child to let you know if they are being bullied at camp.
Try to spend at least 10-15 minutes each day giving your child your focused attention.
 Having a low self-esteem can sometimes increase the risk of being bullied.In addition, being bullied can further lower your child’s self-esteem. Nurture your child’s self-esteem and self-image to help protect them from bullies at camp by putting them at less risk for being bullied.


Tell your child things like, “You’re a great child and a great person in general. You have a lot of positive traits and characteristics about you.”
Praise your child's talents, and encourage them at things they do well. You can say, "You're such a good artist. Will you make a picture for me?"
Talk to your child about looking for the good in themselves. For instance, you might recommend that your child give themselves three compliments a day.
 Children that are bullied may feel that they are going through this because they did something wrong or because something is just wrong with them. You can support your child and protect them from camp bullies by letting them know that if it happens, it’s not their fault. Let your child know that people bully because of insecurities and fears they have.
Tell your child something like, “I don’t want you to feel guilt or bad about what is happening. You didn’t do anything to make him pick on you. Bullying is a bad choice he’s making.”

 Place two granny squares together, one on top of the other, with the ride sides facing together.This method will create a secure seam that is strong enough to hold together large pieces.;
, Make a slipknot on one end of the yarn and squeeze your crochet hook into the loop.



Make a slip knot by creating two loops side by side. Push one loop through the other and pull, forming a single loop with an adjustable knot.
 Slide your crochet hook through the back loops of both squares on the upper right side. Grab the yarn from the other side and pull it through to form a second loop of your joining yarn.


Note that the first loop on your joining yarn, at this point, is the loop you created with your slipknot. This loop now sits over the crochet hook.
 Use your hook to maneuver this new, second loop through the first loop originally on your hook. This will create the first slip stitch of your joining chain.
 Weave your crochet hook through the remaining back loops of the entire top edge, forming slip stitches for each back loop.


Do not crochet too tightly. Doing so will make the seam too tight, and your finished product will not be very flexible as a result.
 You can attach more squares to your originally two squares using this same method around the other edges. Expand the blanket, scarf, or other project outward by adding one square at a time.


Finish the piece with a border or by weaving the end back into the final seam to hide it while keeping the joined row secure.

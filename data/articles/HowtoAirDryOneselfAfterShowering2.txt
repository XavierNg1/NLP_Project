 If a fan is available, turn it on and position your back towards it, since that will be the hardest area of the body to dry manually. Obviously, if you have time the fan could be used to dry the entire body.


You should also turn on the exhaust fan in the bathroom, if it has one, to avoid humidity which will slow down the drying process. , Another way to help speed up the process of air drying is by using a blow dryer. You can use the blow dryer on your hair after it has been wrung out by hand. You can also point the hair dryer at the rest of your body to help speed up the drying process. The blow dryer can help with getting hard to reach areas.


Some hair dryers have a cool button which can be used to control the air temperature.
 Use a long, durable article of clothing and hold either end in each hand and twirl the piece loosely in front of your body (similar to the motion of twisting a towel to snap it). This will cause a small vortex of air to dry off your skin. Move your arms up and down in front of you while twirling the shirt until desired dryness is reached.


Undershirts, pajamas, or lightly soiled laundry may work best for twirling, since the article of clothing will likely become wrinkled or creased during the process.
If you donâ€™t have an appropriate article of clothing available you can swing your arms in a circular motion to create a light breeze.
 A fresh, cool breeze from outside can also help with the process of air drying. You will be able to air dry quicker if you use a natural breeze. For privacy purposes it is best to stand in front of a window that does not face the street or directly into other houses.
 Moving around can also help to speed up the process of air drying. Try walking around your bedroom naked. Move your arms in a circular motion, jump, or flick your legs to help shake off the moisture.

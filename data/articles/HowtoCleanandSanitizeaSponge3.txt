 Use a 3-quart pot and fill it 3/4 to the top with cold water. Bring the water to a boil by placing it on the stove. Turn the burner on high until the water boils. Keep the pot covered to heat the water faster.
 Clean off any excess food or grime that is sticking to it. You want the sponge to be fairly clean before immersing it in water so that it isn’t soaking in anything dirty. Simply run it under warm water and clean it with a little dish soap. Wring out any excess water.
 Make sure not to burn your hands. Remove the pot’s lid and slowly lower the sponge into the water. You can place the sponge in the water using a cooking spoon or tongs to avoid burning your fingers. The sponge should be covered in water. Make sure it doesn’t rest on the bottom of the pot or it could melt. To keep it from sticking to the pot, stir it occasionally.


Turn down the burner down to medium-high so that the water doesn’t boil over.
 This is enough time to reduce bacteria from millions to a safe number. Keep the pot uncovered and make sure the sponge isn’t sticking to the edges., It will be very hot. Place it on a clean surface to thoroughly air-dry, such as a dish rack. This will keep bacteria from multiplying. After it has cooled for about 10 minutes, you can wring out the sponge to remove excess water and help it to dry faster.

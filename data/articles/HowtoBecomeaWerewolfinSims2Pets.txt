, On my Sims 2 game, if my Sim has custom content skin the werewolf graphics won't work, and my Sim just walks around looking a bit silly.
 I'll explain you the normal way first.


First, place lots of trees on your lot (the chances of the leader of the pack coming increases if you have trees and/or toddlers or babies on the lot). Once the leader of the pack come (he has glowing yellow eyes) greet him.
Get his daily friendship points up to about 60 and then wait. Make sure your Sim does NOT go off to do something else (it would be easiest to turn off free will for this). Soon, the leader of the pack will 'Nibble' you.
At around 8:00 your Sim will transform (as long as the Sim is not doing anything.)
And Voilà! A werewolf!

, Go to the neighborhood and hold down Ctrl + Shift + C (this will open up the cheat box) then type in 'boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true' and press enter. and then go into the lot with the Sim you want to be a werewolf and right-click the mailbox and choose Spawn...Leader of the Pack. When he comes, greet him and then you should be able to drag the relationship bar up with your mouse, do this on your Sims relationship with the wolf, then right-click the wolf and click MAKE SELECTABLE. Drag up his relationship with the desired Sim. Then right-click the wolf again and choose MAKE UNSELECTABLE. Wait a minute and the wolf should nibble your Sim. And voilá again! You have a werewolf.

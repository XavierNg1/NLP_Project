 Hearing about your amazing weekend getaway is probably the last thing your loved one wants to hear right now. They’ve been stuck in a hospital room for a certain length of time and likely don’t want to listen to how great your life is going. Try to remain respectful and considerate of their situation.


Keep this kind of conversation to a minimum, even if your loved one asks about it. Hearing your stories may serve as a distraction, but you don’t want to make it seem like you’re bragging., You may see inserting your opinion on the matter as helpful, but your loved one may see it as you being bossy or critical. They have likely done everything they think they should. Having you state your opinion may seem like you are doubting what they’ve done.


Instead, let them know that you support them and the decisions they’ve made. Tell them they are doing an excellent job hanging in there. This will mean more to them than hearing what you would have done differently., You may think that you are bothering your loved one if you call or text each day. However, your contact may make give them the encouragement they need to get through the day. Don’t back off: your concern shows you care.However, be considerate of what your loved one needs right now. Keeping them on the phone for an hour a day may take up too much of their time. Feel things out when you check in and then decide what works best for them, whether it’s a text, a quick drop by, or a daily phone call.
 Tell your loved one it’s OK to leave the room to get a change of scenery, particularly if the child is sleeping. Their physical and mental health is important right now and something they may not be concerned with. Be their reminder.

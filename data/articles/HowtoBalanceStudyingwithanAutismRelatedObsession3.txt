 This way, you won't have anything physically in your way when it's time to study.
 Sit in a comfortable place, where it's quiet. Use white noise or earplugs if you live in a noisy environment. Wear comfortable clothes and play relaxing music.


If you are hungry, try bringing a snack.
 There are many different ways to studyâ€”reading, making flashcards, experimenting, getting help from a loved one, et cetera. When you get tired of one, take a break and switch to another.


Consider different learning styles: visual, auditory, global, kinesthetic, etc. How can you incorporate several of these into your studying?
If your instructor allows you to choose projects, pick one that can be done in a learning style you like.
 Stimming may help you regulate your senses and focus on your work.


Sit on an exercise ball or rocking chair so you can move around.
Keep some stim toys, such as tangles and stress balls, in a little box on your desk. You can hold a stim toy in one hand as you study, or mess with them as you think of ideas.
 For example, if your special interest is trains, try taking engineering and robotics courses. If you're passionate about short stories, take literature classes. Studying becomes much more fun if you're learning about something you love.


Consider a career path related to your special interest. For example, a young woman who enjoys computer games may become a happy and successful computer programmer. Special interests can be incredible tools that lead to satisfaction and mastery in your career.

 Once you're within just a car's length or further away from the spot, you should switch into Reverse before you start backing up.
 This will help you maintain control of your car as you back up.
 This is a bit trickier when you're parking backwards, because you'll actually have to steer the wheel in the opposite direction that you want the car to go, instead of the same direction. If you want your car to move left, you'll have to steer to the right.
 You can check your mirrors to start moving backwards -- or better yet, put your right arm around the left passenger seat, and look behind you. You'll have a better sense of where to move your car if you're actually looking at the space.
 Once you've moved the car in the right space, press the brake firmly until the car comes to a complete stop.

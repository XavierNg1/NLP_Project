Watch for people who might instigate office feuds or spread gossip. Observing without interfering will give you the opportunity to see how office politics play out in your department. You will also notice who the problem employees might be.;
, As a supervisor or a manager, you are not expected to befriend your employees. Do not get drawn into any gossip or petty arguments.


Keep your tone and topics professional and work-related when you deal with your employees.
 Your team needs to know that gossip, rumors, backstabbing and undermining each other's work will not be tolerated.
 Calmly explain that you expect each employee to do the job he or she was hired for and to stay on task.


Remind your employees that the way they interact with other members of the team will be noted in performance reviews.
 Set a good example by treating everyone in a professional and respectful manner.
 When back office politics comes to a head, assess the situation and make a judgment based on the information you have and the behavior you have witnessed.

 The vast majority of Craigslist scams come from foreign countries.;
, Most Craigslist scams use a lot of apologies, religious references, rambling about family problems.
 The classic Craigslist scam recipe is the bad check. Offer you more money and ask for some in return.


For example: "I can't come over and take a look because I have something I need to finish for work. Since the item's still up for sale, please email me your details (full name, contact address, email and phone number), so that I can issue the payment via cashier's check. I'll also arrange for the pick up." The person then sends you a check for too much. They then ask you to reimburse the additional amount but the cashier's check is a fake.
 They can't meet with you, but are certain you are a good person. There is always some reason why the Craigslist scammer cannot meet with you. That is a big red flag.
 The basis of any Craigslist scam is to get you to act without thinking about it.

 In order to remember the names of ions, you will need to remember the names of the elements that form them. Commit the periodic table to memory, and you will have a much easier time naming ions.


It's fine to consult the periodic table if you can't remember the name for an element.;
, In order to distinguish an ion from an atom, you must use the word ion at the end of the name., The simplest ions to name are positively charged monoatomic ions with single oxidation states. These simply take the same name as the element that forms them.For example, the name for the element Na is sodium, so the name for Na+ is sodium ion.
Positively charged ions are also known as cations.
 Monoatomic ions with a negative charge and a single oxidation state are named using the stem form of the element name, with the addition of the suffix -ide.For example, the name for the element O2 is oxygen, so the name for O2- is oxide ion. The name for the element F is fluorine, so the name for F- is flouride ion.
Negatively charged ion are also known as anions.

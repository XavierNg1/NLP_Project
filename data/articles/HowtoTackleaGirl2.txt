 Even if the girl doesn't mind being tackled, she might not be so comfortable with you touching her breasts or her pelvic region. The legs and the midriff are usually safe. Wrap your arms around her waist, or aim low for her knees.Try not to worry too much about inappropriate touching. Pretend that you are tackling a male friend, but be a bit gentler. If you obviously aren't aiming for her private areas, then there shouldn't be a problem.
 Once you wrap your arms around her for the tackle, try placing your arms on her back so that she won't be hurt when she hits the ground. If you make a diving tackle from a few steps behind, then you will tackle harder in your effort to catch up. If you are worried that you'll hurt her, try to catch up to her first, then bring her slowly to the ground – that is, if you can catch her!

, Girls are tough, too. If she wants to play tackle football with you, then that is her choice. It is not necessarily your place to treat her like a delicate doll. Be careful, certainly, and treat her with respect – but do not assume that she is weak just because she is a girl!

 If you experience acid reflux frequently, you may have noticed an increase in your symptoms when you eat certain foods. Try cutting back on the following foods to experience acid reflux less often:




Chocolate
Spicy food
Garlic and onion
Fried or greasy foods
Acidic foods such as tomatoes and citrus fruits
Mint and peppermint;
, Eating more often and in smaller portions helps your digestive system operate more efficiently, so acid does not build up. Limit your portions to one serving size each. Wait until you no longer feel full before eating more food.
 Give your digestive system an assist from gravity by not eating too close to bedtime. Wait at least 3 hours after eating before you lie down.
 Obesity is a chief contributor to acid reflux. The extra weight puts pressure on your esophagus, causing acid to rise back up.Diet and exercise may eliminate symptoms without requiring further treatment.
 Alcohol and caffeine loosen the sphincter that controls the passage of the esophagus into the stomach, allowing acid to flow backward. Avoiding them, especially before bedtime, can ease the symptoms of GERD.
 Smoking interferes with digestion and can damage the lining of the esophagus. Even if you can't quit, it's important to cut back as much as you can.
 Tight waistbands compress the internal organs and may block digestion. Wear pants and skirts with elastic waistbands. If you wear form-fitting clothes and heavy fabrics at the office, change into sweats or other comfortable clothing as soon as you get home.
 Simple gravity is a contributor to GERD, especially if you are overweight or have a hiatal hernia or other abnormality of the passage from the esophagus to the stomach. If your head is higher than your feet, acid can’t back up.





Use blocks to raise the whole head of the bed. Raising your head with pillows isn’t as efficient, because it exaggerates the bend in your waist.

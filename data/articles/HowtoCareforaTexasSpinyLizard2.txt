 Texas spiny lizards require a diet of live insects, and will thrive if you provide them with a variety of species. Giant mealworms, crickets, waxworms, regular mealworms, silkworms, and non-noxious caterpillars are all great choices.Feed your lizard once a day. If your lizard is active and healthy, feed them as much as they can eat over a 15-20 minute time period. If they are overweight, talk to a vet about a diet plan that will keep your lizard healthy.Be sure that the insects are relatively small in comparison to the lizard’s head. Otherwise the lizard may suffer digestive problems. Cut the insects yourself if the pieces seem too large.
If you live near fields or meadows that are not sprayed with insecticides, you can collect your own insects (known as “field plankton”) with a sweep net during warmer months.Remove any uneaten insects from the cage immediately after feeding., To ensure that your lizard is getting proper nutrients, dust its food once a week or every other week with vitamin D3 and calcium powder.You can purchase Rep-Cal Reptile Calcium Powder with D3 online at either PetSmart or Amazon.
To dust the insects, place the insects and a little bit of dusting powder in a glass jar and shake until the insects are coated with the powder. Then feed to your lizards immediately.
 Provide fresh water for your lizard in a shallow dish. Be sure to change the water every day to keep your lizard healthy.


If the water splashes around too much you’ll have to clean the substrate to keep the habitat dry., Buy a mist spray bottle and mist your lizard’s cage twice a week. Lizards like to lick water off plants, and misting the plants and vines in your cage will give them extra opportunity to hydrate. Don’t drench the cage as the habitat substrate needs to stay dry. Instead, lightly mist any surfaces that your lizard likes to climb or play on.

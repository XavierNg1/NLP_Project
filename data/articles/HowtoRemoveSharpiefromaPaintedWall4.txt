 Wear gloves when using these cleaning agents. This will also keep the ink from staining your hands. If you are working on a large area of the wall that has been covered in Sharpie, consider opening a window as well.
 Put a small amount of the cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area of the wall. Many cleaning agents can discolor or remove paint, so scrub carefully to see how your wall reacts.









If you have latex paint, be very careful about applying cleaning agents to your wall to remove stains. Latex paint will start to turn tacky or come off if you rub something like isopropyl alcohol or nail polish remover on it. It will also remove any gloss on that spot., If you are using a rag, make sure it is something you don't mind throwing away.
 If blotting doesnâ€™t work, try scrubbing in a circular motion. It may take a few passes to remove all of the Sharpie marks.
 After the Sharpie mark is removed, cleaning the wall will remove any residual harsh chemical on your wall.

 Place the sweater so that the front is facing up, towards you, on whatever surface you are using. Spread the sweater out flat against the surface.Use the flattest surface you can to ensure cleaner folds.
Make sure no parts of the sweater are bunched up.;
, Take one sleeve and lay it over the front of your sweater, with the cuff towards the opposite side of the sweater. Take your other sleeve and cross it over top the first sleeve in the same fashion.









Make sure to smooth any wrinkles as you work.
Don't extend the cuffs beyond the edge of the sweater.
 Bring the hem up towards the neck of your sweater. Make the fold itself at the level of your sleeve cuffs.









Folding the hem up too high may cause wrinkles.
Some sweaters might require two folds.
 Complete the fold by double checking that all parts of the sweater are folded and remove any wrinkles.









Store the sweater carefully so as not to undo the folds or cause wrinkles.
If the fold looks wrinkly or bunched up, simply start again from the beginning.

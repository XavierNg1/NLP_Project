Place one end of the garden hose in the bottom of the container from which you will siphon the water.
Anchor the garden hose with an object heavy enough to keep it in place, but light enough to keep from blocking the water flow through the hose.
Place the other end of the garden hose where you would like the siphoned water to flow.
 Attach a shut-off valve to the end of the garden hose lying outside of the container of water to be siphoned. Leave the valve open.
 Attach a second garden hose to the shut-off valve on the end of the garden hose acting as a siphon.


Secure the other end of the second hose to a water valve.



Turn on the water valve connected to the second hose.
Allow the garden hose acting as a siphon to fill with water.
Close the shut-off valve connecting the two hoses.
 Remove the second garden hose from the hose acting as a siphon.
 Water will flow from the container out of the garden hose.

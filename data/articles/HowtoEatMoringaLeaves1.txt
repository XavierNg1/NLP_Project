 Add enough water to a pot to cover the amount of leaves you intend to boil. Turn the burner to medium-high heat. Then just wait for the water to start boiling., Once the water’s boiling, add the leaves and stir them into the water so they’re nice and wet all over. Boil them for about three minutes. But be sure to stir them constantly. Otherwise they may end up sticking to each other and end up as big clumps, which can make them taste a little nasty!You don’t want to overcook the leaves, either, but depending on how much you’re making at once, they may need longer. If they do, start taste-testing after three minutes to make sure you don’t ruin the whole batch.
 After three minutes, empty the pot into a strainer in the sink. Then take each leaf and spread it out on paper towels so it doesn’t ball up into a clump. Press the length of the leaf into the paper towel to squeeze out the water. If you need to, switch it to a fresh towel and repeat.

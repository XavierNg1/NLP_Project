 Take a look at your closet, and see what is the dominant color among your skirts and dresses. Next, buy some tights or stockings that match those colors. This will make creating outfits easier in the future. For example, if you have mostly grey or brown skirts and dresses, choose tights or stockings in those colors., Certain colors just go better with certain occasions and locations than others. For example, bright red tights might not look very professional in an office-type setting, but they'd work great for a party or concert. On the other hand, black might be too severe for a casual picnic in the park, but they'd be appropriate for a grand evening at the opera.Nude-colored tights and stockings are suitable for all occasions.Remember to choose a color that matches your skin tone.
 There are no rules as to what you should and should not wear, but dark colors tend to look better when it's cold, and light colors tend to look better when it's warm. You'd probably want to avoid wearing dark colors during the hot summer month; they are too warm and absorb too much heat. In fact, you might want to skip wearing tights or stockings during the warmer months altogether!If you do choose or need to wear tights or stockings during the warmer months, choose something that is lighter in color, or something that is close to your skin tone.
 Many fun-colored tights contain patterns. This is a great way to add movement to your outfit and make it look more complete. You have to be careful, however; too many patterns can make your outfit look cluttered. Stay on the safe side, and choose a pattern that matches your outfit. Another option would be to pair patterned tights with a solid-colored outfit.For example, a pair of lacey black tights would look cute with an ivory, fit-and-flare dress and a thin, black belt.

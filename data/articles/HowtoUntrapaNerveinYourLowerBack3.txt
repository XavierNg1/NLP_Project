Twist your core as you place your hand on the opposite knee. Lean forward to stretch your back muscles as you twist. Hold for around five seconds, then stretch the other side.Stretch your sides by standing and leaning to one side to gently stretch out those muscles. Hold for a few seconds, and then stretch the opposite side. Go back and forth five to six times.

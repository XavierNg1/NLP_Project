 If you do not have nail polish remover, you can also use rubbing alcohol.
 Scrub at the tattoo so that it begins to flake off of your skin. You may need to wet the cotton ball again or get a new cotton ball, depending on how large your temporary tattoo is.
 Use a washcloth to rinse your skin where your temporary tattoo was. Use warm water and soap to remove any of the acetone left behind by the nail polish remover.

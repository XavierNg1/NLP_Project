Rodeo and bull run
Scarborough Renaissance Festival

Everyone expects to see knights and princesses at the Renaissance Festival, but cowboy duds and boots are the order of the day at the rodeo.

If traveling any time but summer bring cool-weather and warm-weather clothes as well as rain gear. The weather could change drastically at any moment.
Plan on drinking plenty of water during the summer. Dallas gets hot!

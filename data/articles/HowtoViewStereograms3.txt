 For the best results, you should have the image approximately one foot in front of you. As with the other methods, don’t try to focus on stereogram. Instead, try focusing on an object or even an imaginary dot behind it., With the stereogram in front of you, look at the image but allow your eyes to naturally diverge so it becomes blurry or even doubled. This can be a difficult thing to master, but it should be similar to what happens when you’ve been reading for a long time and your eyes can no longer focus on the words.If you’re having trouble relaxing your eyes, try “daydreaming” as you look at the stereogram. That can often help you naturally unfocus your gaze.
If you relax your eyes, they naturally look apart, which is why the images you see are blurry. To see the stereogram's hidden image, you need to allow your eyes to diverge at different angles until you find the right one for the image to appear.
 Continue you look at the stereogram with an unfocused gaze until you begin to see a blurry 3D image take shape. It make take a few minutes, so it’s important to be patient. Eventually, it will sharpen until you can see the stereogram image clearly.It may help to "blink" at the stereogram. Close one of your eyes and look at it with just the other one. When the image starts to come into focus, open the eye that you'd previously closed to help make it sharper and clearer.

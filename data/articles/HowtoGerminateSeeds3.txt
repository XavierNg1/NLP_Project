 When you see the first green shoots poke through, move the seedlings to a sunny area. Make sure the room temperature is above 70 degrees, but provide a bright space so they can grow strong and healthy.
 If you covered your seedlings with a sheet of plastic wrap or newspaper, remove it and keep the seedlings moist with a couple of waterings a day. Water in the morning and early afternoon, but avoid watering later in the day. If water sits on the growing medium all night long it might facilitate the growth of mold.
 Since the growing medium doesn't contain nutrients, you'll need to fertilize the seedlings with plant food after they've gotten a few inches tall. Find out what type of plant food is appropriate for the seedlings you're growing. Use organic fertilizer if at all possible.
 If a lot of the seeds germinate and sprout, it's necessary to thin out some of the weaker seedlings so the strong ones can get even stronger. Thin them out to the point where you have 2 or 3 sprouts per seed container, or 2 or 3 sprouts for each area the size of one egg carton segment. Pick the extra sprouts out close to the base, pull out the roots and discard them.
 When the growing season begins it will be time to move the seedlings to bigger containers or your outdoor garden. Make sure you get the right type of soil for your plants, and plant them in an area with the correct amount of sunlight and drainage.

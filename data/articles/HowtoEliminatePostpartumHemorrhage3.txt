 Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage include a prolonged third stage of labor, multiple delivery, episiotomy, fetal macrosomia (large baby) , and history of postpartum hemorrhage., Active management, which involves administering a uterotonic drug with or soon after the delivery of the first shoulder and using controlled cord traction and uterine massage after delivery of the placenta can decrease the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and shorten the third stage of labor with no significant increase in the risk of retained placenta., Reexamination of the patient's vital signs and vaginal flow before leaving the delivery area may help detect slow, steady bleeding.
 Prophylactic administration of oxytocin (Pitocin) reduces rates of postpartum hemorrhage by 40 percent. This reduction also occurs if oxytocin is given after placental delivery.

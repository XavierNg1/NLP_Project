 You will need to delete your Chrome browsing history from within the Chrome browser, instead of through the Settings app. Tap the Chrome icon on your Home Screen to launch the app.
 This is located in the upper-right corner of the screen. Select "Settings" from the menu.
 This is located in the Advanced section of the Settings menu. This menu will allow you to delete various data related to web browsing.
 Tap the "Clear Browsing History" button to erase all of your browsing history in Chrome. You will be asked to confirm your decision.
 You can also delete your cookies, cache, and site data by tapping the appropriate Clear options in this menu. You can delete everything at once by tapping "Clear All"., If you find yourself deleting your history regularly, you may want to browse using an Incognito window instead. When using this mode, Chrome will not store any browsing history or cookies for the sites you visit. You can start an Incognito window by tapping the Menu (â˜°) button and selecting "New Incognito Tab". Any browsing done in this tab will not be logged by the iPad.

 There are few feelings so sweet and nice as when someone plays with your hair. Gender doesn’t matter, simply run your hands through your partner’s hair while you cuddle. This may or may not be a variation of a scalp massage crossed with a finger hairbrush. Playing with your partner’s hair is a certain way of making them happy and comfortable.
 Kiss your partner in a sentimental fashion, not in preparation for making out. Plant little kisses on their forehead, arms, or hands to show that you love and care for them. This move is sure to leave them swooning and happy to be wrapped up with you.
 Everyone loves a good massage, right? Show your partner some love by gently massaging the areas nearest to you. This will likely be their back, shoulders, or arms. If you don’t want to do any massaging, just rub them back and forth with your hands.
 Lightly stroke their body with your fingertips. Run your hands down their torso, along their legs, or along their arms. This is easiest to do from a spoon or half-spoon position, but can accomplished in any cuddling form.
 Gently tickling your partner will have them squirming and giggling closer to you in no time. Be careful not to take the tickling too far; do it only long enough to show that you’re flirting and that you want them closer to you.

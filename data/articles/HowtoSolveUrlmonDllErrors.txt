 We are fortunate in that a lot of websites have now been launched which offer direct free downloads of DLL files, giving you the ability to replace any defective or damaged ones on your system. To do this, you should first log onto Google and look for "Download Urlmon.dll". This will bring up the sites which have this file, allowing you to download it. After downloading it to your PC, you should back up your original copy in the "C:/Windows/System32" folder and replace it with the new one from the Internet.;
, Use the command regsvr32 C:/Windows/System32/Urlmon.dll.
 This will roll back any settings / options that may have changed on your computer to a time when the error did not show. This will allow your PC to properly read the files & settings again, which should hopefully stop the error from showing.

 Call out (state their position) anyone you see and details about how much shield they have. 9/10 times in higher levels of play, players with low shields will be taken out, thanks to detailed communication

, This separates the good teams from the great teams. what's the point in taking someone down to low shield, just for them to escape around the corner and recharge their shields? The idea is that the more people firing on a single person, the quicker they will die and the less damage your team members will sustain. Again, good communication is a must to develop good team-shooting

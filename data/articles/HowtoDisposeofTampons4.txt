 You should try to always change your tampon every four to eight hours as leaving it in for longer than eight hours can increase your risk of developing Toxic Shock Syndrome. You may end up using multiple tampons in a day, depending on your flow, but this is to be expected.If you tend to forget to take out your tampon, you may set a reminder in your phone for every eight hours so you remember to change it. You should also only wear tampons to bed if you plan to wake up in eight hours. Do not wear a tampon to bed if you plan to sleep for longer than eight hours.
 You should look for tampons that have the absorbency level that you need based on your flow. This will ensure you have the necessary protection and are using a tampon that fits your needs. If you have a heavier flow, especially during the first two to three days of your period, you may go for a tampon with higher absorbency. If you have a lighter flow, especially during the last few days of your period, you may opt for a tampon with the lowest absorbency.You can also determine your required absorbency by noting how the tampon appears when you remove it. If it appears dry, you may be using a tampon with an absorbency that is too high. If it appears soaked and very wet, you may need to use a tampon with a higher absorbency.
You should never use a tampon to soak up discharge that is coming out of your vagina. They are only made for use when you have your period.
 You should see a doctor right away if you develop any symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) while wearing a tampon. TSS is a bacterial infection that is caused by a build up of bacteria in your vagina.You may experience one or two of the symptoms of TSS at one time, including:A sudden fever (102 degrees Fahrenheit or more)
Vomiting
Diarrhea
A red rash on your body
Dizziness or faintness when you stand up

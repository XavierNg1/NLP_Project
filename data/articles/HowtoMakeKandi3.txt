 Similar to making a single-strand piece of kandi, wrap your string around your wrist to get an estimated length. Then, unravel your string so that you have a significant amount more, about three feet in excess (3 feet makes about 8 rows).
 Choose a pattern of beads that you want; this could be very simple and geometric or a complete image. Many websites offer patterns you can use to produce an image on your cuff. Place enough beads on the string to completely encircle your wrist.
 You'll end up with one short end and one very long end of elastic. You will continue adding rows of beads onto the long end.
 To do this, continue past the stopping point of the first row in a circular pattern one row above. In the second row, string your thread every-other bead through a bead below it in the first row. This means your beads will be staggered between rows, not lined up vertically.
 Follow the same step as in #3, where you thread your string through a bead in the row below it every-other bead. Continue this for as many rows as you like, or until you run out of string. By this time, if you used elastic thread, your rows should start to stand up creating the more obvious cuff shape.









Tip: Always thread through the next high row bead.
 Do this at the end of a complete row so that your cuff is even. Thread your string through the last bead in the row beneath it and tie it off.
 Your cuff is now completed, and is ready to be worn or gifted as a token of friendship.

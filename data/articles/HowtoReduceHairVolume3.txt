 Use a towel to draw out excess water from your hair. Always refrain from rubbing your hair in the towel to get rid of the water--this causes frizz!Instead of wrapping your hair with a bath towel, opt for a soft cotton t-shirt, a cotton pillowcase, or a microfiber towel. Since these items all have finer fibers than a bath towel, they cause less damage to wet, frizz prone hair.
 To reduce the amount of time you spend blow-drying your hair, let your hair air-dry. Wait until your hair is at least 50 percent of the way dry. This will also decrease your hairâ€™s exposure to heat, which can dry out your frizz-prone locks and increase the volume of your hair., While your hair is still damp, apply an anti-frizz cream. Before blow-drying, apply a heat protectant spray. This will help prevent your hair from drying out.
 Using a comb, divide your hair into 5 sections. You will have two sections in the back, one on each side, and one on the top of your head. Clip the sections in place.
 Start with the section on the top of your head. Pull the hair taut against your forehead. Place a round brush at the roots and slowly move it down the length of your hair. Follow the brush with the barrel of your blow-dryer down the entire length of your hair. Repeat as needed. Repeat this process on the side sections and then the back sections. Apply a smoothing serum or anti-frizz cream to your hair for a sleek finish.








Experiment with hair styling products. Waxes, pomades and even anti-frizz serums smooth out frizzy hair and add weight to the hair shafts which decrease hair volume. Friction caused by hair movement causes the hair strands to separate and poof out. An appropriate styling aid will help keep hair sections together and control individual hair strands.

 To make one iron block, combine nine ingots in a crafting table. You'll need four blocks (36 ingots) to make one iron golem.


If you're short on iron, learn how to find more quickly.;
, Pumpkins can grow on any grass block with air above it (but not on tall grass or snow). Plains biomes are the easiest place to find them. You need one pumpkin (or jack o' lantern) for each iron golem.


You only need one pumpkin to start a pumpkin farm and grow as many as you like. First, turn the pumpkin into four pumpkin seeds in the crafting screen. Plant the seeds in farmland next to water, leaving one empty dirt block for each seed. The pumpkins will grow onto the empty blocks., The space must be at least three blocks wide and three blocks tall, but it's a good idea to work in a larger space. If you craft the golem too close to a wall, there's a chance it spawns trapped inside the wall and suffocates.Break any tall grass or flowers in the area before you begin. These sometimes prevent the golem from spawning., Place one iron block on the ground. Put the other three in a row on top of the first one, forming a "T." This will become the body of your iron golem.
 This will change immediately into an iron golem.


The pumpkin must be the last block you place, or the iron golem will not spawn.
 If iron golems sense a village nearby, they will wander over there and patrol its buildings.This defense isn't as foolproof as a good wall and torches, but you get to see the golem hand flowers to the villagers.


Unlike naturally spawning iron golems, your own creation will never attack you, even if you harm it or a villager.
 Put up barriers if you want your new iron golem to stay in place instead of wandering off to protect villagers. The iron golem will also stay put if you surround your house with vines., You can use a lead to make the iron golem follow you, or to tie it to a fence (although it won't defend very well when tied up).Craft a lead using four string and one slimeball.

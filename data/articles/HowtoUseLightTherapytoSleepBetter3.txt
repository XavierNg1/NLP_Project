 The first step in establishing good sleep hygiene is to make sure you are on a regular sleep schedule. Try to bed at the same time each night and wake at the same time each morning. Consistency will reinforce your sleep-wake cycle, helping you to sleep better.Light therapy should only be part of your treatment. For it to be effective, it's important to also maintain good sleep hygiene.
 In order to get a good night’s sleep and for light therapy to be effective, you need to ensure that your bedroom is free from visual and auditory stimuli. Try hanging room darkening curtains and eliminating sounds such as television., Limit your consumption of alcohol, caffeine, and stimulants before bed as these can disrupt your sleep. Smoking before bed should also be avoided as should heavy meals., The blue light emitted from devices like tablets, laptops, smartphones, and television suppresses your body's production of melatonin, which is the hormone that makes you sleepy. This makes it harder for you to fall asleep and stay asleep.Stop using all electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bed. If you use your phone as an alarm, set the alarm 30 minutes before you go to sleep and do not look at it again until the morning. You might also consider getting an alarm clock instead and making your bedroom a technology-free zone.
 Physical exercise is key to getting a good night’s sleep. Making sure you get at least thirty minutes of exercise each day will help you fall asleep quicker, stay asleep longer, and sleep deeper. Try to exercise earlier in the day, as physical activity too close to bedtime can cause some people to become too excited to sleep., Doing something relaxing before bed such as reading a book or taking a long, hot bath will help both your mind and body prepare for sleep. If you choose to read, try reading something unrelated to your work or daily life such as a novel.

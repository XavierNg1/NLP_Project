 Sentences that use passive voice are much wordier than sentences that use active voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence is doing the action.For example, “The paper was completed before the deadline by Jessica” is wordier than “Jessica completed her paper before the deadline.”

, Reduce descriptive and modifying phrases to one word. Replace a descriptive phrase that follows a noun with one-word adjectives. For example, “People who are experienced with taking photos know how to manipulate lighting,” can be revised to “Experienced photographers know how to manipulate lighting.”A modifying phrase can be reduced to an adverb. For example, “Sympathizing with his pain, she listened to his story,” can be replaced with “She listened sympathetically to his painful story.”

, Expletives like “there is” and “there are” are wordy. They are also a weak way to start a sentence. Instead, be more direct.For example, instead of saying “There are a lot of people around the world that love chocolate,” say, “People around the world love chocolate.”

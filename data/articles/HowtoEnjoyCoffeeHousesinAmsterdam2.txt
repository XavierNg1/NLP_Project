 Coffee shops are places where you can buy and use an amount of soft drugs (mostly cannabis) for personal use only. They are very tightly regulated:


You have to be over 18 to even enter a coffee shop. Coffee shop owners are legally obliged to check your age before they let you in.
A coffee shop is not allowed to sell any other drugs, nor are they allowed to sell alcohol.
A coffee shop is allowed to have an amount of soft drugs behind the counter that is reasonable for the average amount of customersÂ they have. This is checked by the police on a regular basis.
A coffee shop owner has to keep an eye on the well being of their customers and can be held responsible if something goes wrong.
 Dutch customs check on this too! Also be aware that you might even be prosecuted in your own country if you arrive home from Amsterdam still under the influence of what you used in Amsterdam.
 Where do you get an actual coffee then, if coffee shops are not the place you want to be? Fortunately, there are many choices remaining for you, including:


Look for cafes, lunchrooms, restaurants, terraces and such. Any place that does not smell of weed.
Even some bakeries (bread shops) or patisseries will sometimes have some tables and chairs to have a cup a of coffee.
Check some of the bigger general stores like V&D, Bijenkorf and Hema.
Museums and libraries are also excellent places to look for a coffee corner.

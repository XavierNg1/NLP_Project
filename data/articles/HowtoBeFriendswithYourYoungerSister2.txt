 Sharing important parts of your life is a great way to bring you and your sister closer.Feeling left out can make your sister less apt to want to spend time with you. Make sure she knows that she is welcome to participate in what you’re doing.Explain what you are doing and tell her why it’s important to you.
Make sure your sister understands the importance of what you’re sharing and how important it is to you. Also let her know that it’s important to you that she participates.
 It’s important not only to share what’s important to you, but to share in what matters to her.


Acknowledge that you and your sister are both individuals and that it’s okay to not like all of the same things.Demonstrate sincere interest in learning about and understanding her interests.
Don’t make fun of her interests if you don’t share them. It may not be your favorite thing, but it matters to her.
 You can’t always be welcoming and care free, so there’s bound to be a time when you and your sister don’t get along.Know when to walk away. Sometimes it’s better just to split up and spend a little time alone to cool off.
Explain your frustrations as patiently as you can. Your sister may not understand why you’re annoyed or frustrated. By explaining it to her, you can make sure she knows you’re upset at what she’s done, not who she is.
Set some places or times as off limits, but explain why you need to do so. Maybe you need time to get your homework done or talk to someone important on the phone. Make sure your sister knows why you need the alone time and that it isn’t because of her.
 Sometimes getting closer to your younger sister can be as easy as just setting aside some time to spend together.


Let her know that spending time with her is important to you and that you look forward to it.
Listen to what she has to say and play an active role in the conversation so she knows she has your full interest.

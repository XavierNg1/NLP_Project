 Place the decal where you want it on the clean window. Use three pieces of tape to hold the decal in place. Place one piece on the bottom and top, then one on a side. Leave one side empty., On the side with no tape, carefully take the transfer tape and peel it back. You should stop when you get to the tape in the middle of the bottom and top sides. Use a pair of scissors to cut away the white paper where you peeled the decal.








You should be cutting away about one third of the backing paper.
 With the white paper backing gone, move the part of the decal back over to the window where it originally started. This part of the decal will adhere to the window where you cut away the white paper.








Use a credit card to squeegee the decal to remove all air bubbles.
 Now that part of the decal is stuck to the window, get rid of the three pieces of tape. Lift the free edge and slowly remove the white paper backing.
 All of the decal should be ready to stick to the window. Carefully place the transfer tape and decals onto the window. Stick the decal a small section at a time. Use a credit card to push the decal and transfer tape against the window. Start where the part of the decal is already on the window and use the credit card to stick the decal.








Use the credit card to rub the decal slowly onto the window. Don’t try to stick the rest of the decal onto the window at the same time. Go from the middle outwards.
 After the decal is securely on the window, take the edge. Slowly remove the transfer tape at an angle. Use only light pressure so you don’t rip off the decal.








You may want to wait at least 24 hours to make sure the decal has adhered to the window.

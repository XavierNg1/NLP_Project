 Remember to smile as you answer as that will sound much better than someone sounding like they have been there for to long.;
, It probably is a good idea to say 'Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening'. If you have numerous connections and you know that they will not want to stay talking to you say 'what department would you like to speak to'.


Here is an example of a good answer at the start of a phone call. 'Good morning, Bobs Jeans. What department would you like to speak to?'

, Even if the person at the other end of the line is annoying you. There is nothing more annoying then someone who is speaking in a low,bored monotone.
 There is nothing worse than having the phone slammed down in your ear.

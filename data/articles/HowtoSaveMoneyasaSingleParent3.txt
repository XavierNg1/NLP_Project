 Explain that you have a specific amount of money to live on every month so they understand how they will be impacted. This is especially important if your situation as a single parent is new or sudden.
 Let your kids know that they will be expected to help out. around the house. Even the little ones can be responsible for making their own beds or putting away their toys.


Address the allowance issue. Some kids might expect a weekly allowance, especially if they received one when you were a 2 parent family. Discuss your expectations that everyone pitches in without payment. Or, offer a small allowance for really outstanding work.
 Teach them how to prioritize their activities and personal possessions.


Start a "wish list." Allow each child to write down things they want but do not need on a wish list, and use the list for birthday and holiday presents.

 There are 2 different connection for hard disk and optical drives: SATA (serial ATA) and PATA (parallel ATA, also known as IDE, EIDE, or UltraDMA). If you need to connect your older PATA drive, then you'll need to find an IDE to USB adapter.;
, If you have access to older hardware (your own outdated computer equipment or a computer salvage center), you may salvage an enclosure of an appropriate size by stripping out the older components inside. Or, fabricate one yourself from left over wood or scrap metal. Almost any durable box will work, such as sturdy cardboard box or a plastic food container (ie: Tupperware).
, Make sure nothing is poking or hanging outside of the box. Affix the drive and adapter to the box either with molding tape, foam pads with double-sided tape, or drill your own holes and add screws.
 Use a drill for harder materials such as ABS plastic and metal, and a box knife for softer materials such as cardboard and thin plastic.
 Once you're at the desktop of your operating system, connect the USB cable. Most operating systems will install the required drivers automatically.

It is not waterproof like PVC and must be treated carefully to maintain it.
 microsuede dyes fade very easily. This is especially important for microsuede furniture and clothing., Microsuede is water-resistant, so the sooner you can mop up liquid, the less likely it is to sink in and stain.Make sure not to rub the spill, as it could settle in the surface. Dab at the spill with your cloth until the liquid is cleared., Dish detergents are formulated to remove grease and water-based stains. Wet a cloth with the solution and rub it on the stain until it comes out.Use as little water as possible when cleaning microsuede. The water can sink into the lining or pads after prolonged wetness.
 Use a clean sponge, dipped in water, to rinse the stain.After rising, blow dry on a cool setting to prevent a water-ring from forming.

You may need to clean microsuede with upholstering cleaner every few months, since it is prone to staining and damage from the elements., You can find a spray on the Internet, supermarket or cleaning outlet. Look for an indication that it is safe for microsuede before using.

 Tape between the nail and the first knuckle, on the top and bottom of your finger. Apply a base coat and let dry.









A couple coats of white base color will make the colors above it brighter.
 Choose several colors of nail polish and unscrew the lids. Leave them loose in front of you so you can quickly switch between them. You'll need to move fast to make the pattern before the polish dries.
 Dab a small circle onto one spot of your nail. The circle should be wet and thick enough to allow for some spreading later.
 Working quickly, dab on dots of various colors until your nail is covered. It's up to you how many you want â€” three or four dots for a simple tie dye, or man dots for an impressionist effect.
 Place the point of the toothpick in the center of a circle. Drag it outwards in a straight line, spiral pattern, or other designs. As you drag it through the other colors, you'll leave a multicolored trail. Repeat with other areas of the nail, until you have a design you enjoy.









Start with the first circles you put on, since they'll dry first., Point your nail downward and squeeze the side and top edge with your thumb. Some of the polish should slide off your nail and onto your thumb, without ruining your design. This will help it dry more quickly.
 This will take longer than you're used to, due to the thick coat. Once it's ready, cover in a top coat, peel off your tape, and admire your design.

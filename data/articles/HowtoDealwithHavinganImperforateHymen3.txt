 Once your imperforate hymen has been surgically repaired there should be no long term problems. Your vagina will function normally, you will have normal periods and be able to use tampons, and you will be able to have sexual intercourse. Having a history of an imperforate hymen will not make it harder to have children in the future., Having a hymen doesn't mean someone is a "virgin." Some girls are born without a hymen. Yes, the hymen can stretch or tear during sex, but this can also happen when using tampons, during sports, or during some medical procedures.Don’t feel like having the surgery takes away your virginity or changes who you are.
 While procedures that make only a small cut in the hymen to “preserve virginity” may exist, the opening often closes up again causing unnecessary pain and the need to repeat the procedure. Cultural views about virginity and how the hymen should look should be discussed with your doctor, but should not stop you from getting the appropriate surgery., It might feel difficult to discuss sex with your partner if you're in an intimate relationship, but it will help to let him or her know that the pain and trouble you're having with sex is normal for your condition and can be fixed.


Talking to friends and family can help relieve stress about the condition or the surgery. You can always ask loved ones to go to the doctor with you to better understand your condition.
Remember that having an imperforate hymen wasn't caused by anything you did or your mom did during pregnancy. It just happens, and isn't that uncommon!

, Since there are lots of young ladies out there with the same condition, it might help to read about their experience or share your own.

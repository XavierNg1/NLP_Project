 You can choose both winter shoes and summer shoes as your wardrobe evolves through the spring.
 Summer is the time to enjoy your sandals and espadrilles. Just be sure to enjoy them without socks.
 You can still be somewhat flexible as your wardrobe transitions to winter, but avoid the sandals and espadrilles. They don't match with the heavier fabrics and colors of autumn.
 Choose loafers, flats and boots. Make sure that your heels are wider to avoid slippage.

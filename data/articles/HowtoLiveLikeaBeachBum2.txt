 You can just go to Walmart. Here's a list of things you need:


Bodyboard (boogie board)Â 
Leash (cord that attaches your wrist to your board)
Sex wax (surf wax; optional)

, Find a good beach around your area or go to a wave pool. The waves should come up to your knees for beginners.
 Paddle out with your board where the waves start to break. Lay on your board with your stomach on the board an your arms out. Your pelvis should be on the tail of the board. When a wave comes, don't panic. If you don't want to ride that particular one, bend your knees and jump as high as you can with your board still against you. This is called hopping the waves.
 Make sure that when your waiting on a wave to keep your hands on the railing of your board. When a wave comes that you want to ride, turn around so your face is away from the wave. Paddle really hard. Chances are the undertow will be rough. When the wave picks you up, put your hand in the nose of the board and dog your body into the wave. This is called grinding. Lift up the right corner of the nose to go left and the left corner of the nose to go right. If the water is white you didn't do it right. If the water looks glassy, ride that wave!

, Repeat step 4 but this time before you grind look both ways to see which way the wave is falling faster. Wherever that is go that way. Left or right.
 To do a drop knee you need to repeat step 4 but instead of going left or right, stay with the wave. Go towards the shore. When you are steady on the wave pull both knees up at the same time and balance yourself with your arms. This is highly difficult to keep your balance especially on smaller waves.

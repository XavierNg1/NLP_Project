 Peel the carrot and cucumber. Cut the cucumber in half, cut out the seeds in the center, and discard them. Then cut the cucumber into small bite size pieces. Slice the carrot into thin strips. Mix the chopped cucumber and carrot in a bowl and add the salt.;
, This will allow the salt to slowly draw out the water from the vegetables. Do this for a minute or two, until the vegetables are tender but still crunchy, you will be able to see the water drawn from them at the bottom of the bowl.
 Put the 5 grams (0.18Â oz) of dried wakame in a small bowl, and add enough water to cover it well. The seaweed will soak up the water and expand.
 Add the wakame, the pinch of chilli, 2 teaspoons of dashi and cup of water.
 Leave this in the fridge to pickle for about half an hour.
 Take the chilled vegetables out of the fridge, remove the bowl on top and then scoop the contents into a serving bowl.

 Preheat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit (176° Celsius). Grease and flour a 9 inch round cake pan., In a medium-sized bowl whisk the almond milk, vanilla extract, almond extract, and eggs. Beat until the egg yolks break and the wet ingredients are well-combined., In a large bowl combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar using a hand or electric blender. Add the butter, only adding a few pieces at a time. Blend until the dough becomes slightly doughy., Pour in the wet ingredients with dry and mix on low speed for about three minutes. Blend until the cake batter resembles a bright pink color and is creamy. There should be no more flour streaks., Using a rubber spatula, scrape out the strawberry cake batter and pour it into the cake pan. Scrape the edges of the bowl to remove any excess cake batter off the sides., Place the cake pan in the oven and have the cake bake for about 30-40 minutes, until it rises and the edges are slightly brown. To test if the cake is done, poke a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out dry the cake is ready to be removed from the heat., Flip the cake pan on a wire rack. Leave the cake to cool for about 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle and frost., Consider frosting the cake with strawberry frosting, cream cheese frosting, or vanilla frosting. Decorate with sprinkles, extra strawberries, cherries, coconut flakes, and/or fondant flowers., Slice a piece of strawberry cake and lay it on a serving plate. Serve with a glass of milk if desired. Enjoy!

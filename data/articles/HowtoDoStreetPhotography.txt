 This is the closest distance setting for which subjects at infinity are still acceptably sharp. That will take some playing around, but it will improve your shots.
 Since these lens have such a great depth of field, just about everything is in focus. That way, you don't have to focus with each individual shot.
 Keep in mind that, in today's world, being sneaky about it can be a bit dangerous, and being public about it also has its own set of risks.
 Walk around. Check out store fronts, reflections, look up, look down, look everywhere. If you wait for a photo op to come to you, you may be waiting a long time.
 You never know who might have been stalked in the past and could be very concerned about being watched. If someone is at all uncomfortable, don't do it.
 People will feel much more comfortable with you if you don't stand out.

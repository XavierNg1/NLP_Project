 So breaking up the number in this way helps you divide the number quickly, since an even number will have no remainder when dividing by 2. To break up the number into an even number +1, subtract 1 from the number.

For example, if you are calculating 75รท2{\displaystyle 75\div 2}, break up 75{\displaystyle 75} into 74+1{\displaystyle 74+1}.
 You will likely be able to do this in your head, since it will divide evenly. The easiest way to do it is to take half of the tens and half of the ones, then add them together.

For example, half of 70 is 35, and half of 4 is 2, so 74รท2=35+2=37{\displaystyle 74\div 2=35+2=37}.
 Since 1รท2=0.5{\displaystyle 1\div 2=0.5} to reach your final answer, you need to add the two parts together: the even number divided by 2, and 1 divided by 2.

For example, 37+0.5=37.5{\displaystyle 37+0.5=37.5}. So, 75รท2=37.5{\displaystyle 75\div 2=37.5}.

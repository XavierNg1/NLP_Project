 What will your business be? Selling something? Providing a service? Try thinking of things you're really great at (like sports, music, school, etc.) and go from there. If you love kids, why not babysit? Do something you know you'll enjoy.;
, Okay, so you have your hobby/passion decided. But try to stay logical: can it actually make you money? Sure, you love cooking, but how are you, as a kid, going to make money with that? Be reasonable and don't overestimate people's willingness to pay you for something they shouldn't waste.
 This is the fun part! What's your business's name going to be? What about a logo? Will you have business partners? Will you have a slogan? All of these are important questions to answer. Make sure to have all these steps because you will need them.
 Friends, neighbors, or just anyone who wants to help out. Have a couple employees doing the sales. Somebody needs to be your advertiser. If you're not good with money, have an accountant. Get an assistant. All of this isn't necessary initially, but as your business grows, you'll need more and more people to help you out and handle things. Plus, working with other people is fun!


Having a team is important for help, as well as having the best people work on what they're good at. This frees you up from trying to do too many things, some of which you won't be as good at anyway.
 This is the creative part. Signs, fliers, email advertisements, word of mouth? There are dozens of different ways to get your business recognized. Be colorful and informative on your fliers and be careful where you put them. Make your business known at school, or around the neighborhood.
 No pun intended, of course. So once you start getting customers, make an awesome first impression to bring in more business. Bring your customer service up to date. Be polite and do your job well if you expect to get paid.
 You have your business, congratulations! Have fun with your money and good luck with your first business!

Most pad/tampon websites tell you about their products so learn which ones sound good. If you can, avoid buying pads or tampons until you have samples so that way, if they're crummy, you didn't waste any money on them.
 Some do period starter kits! They come with little bits of everything so you can figure out what's easiest and most comfortable for you!

 When you are still irregular, it might help to wear pantyliners every day so if you start it doesn't leak through anything. Mark a calendar so you can track your days but make it private. (Maybe, a little dot on the days in your calendar so it can be discrete and useful at the same time)

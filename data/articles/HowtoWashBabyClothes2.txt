 Some might think "meat" when thinking of protein, but for a baby, this category includes breast milk, most kinds of formula, spit-up, blood, and most kinds of baby food.Protein can bind with the fibers of the clothing, making these stains difficult to remove.If the stain is fresh, wipe away the excess protein that has gotten onto your baby clothes and soak it right away in cold water. This is best way to prevent the stain from setting into the fabric., If your stain has already dried and left a film, crust, or excess matter, you should try to remove as much of this as possible before proceeding. This will prevent the spread of a stain and lead to the best results when cleaning., Heat or chemicals can cause a protein stain to react in such a way that it binds to the fabric you're trying to wash, which can leave a permanent stain.Soak these stains in cold water to help loosen the proteins from your fabric, agitating the soaked garments for best results., Now that the clothes have soaked in cold water and the protein stain loosened from the fabric, apply a dab of baby-safe detergent to the afflicted area. Allow the detergent to set for a while, and then you are ready to wash., You should check and make sure the clothes that you are washing are safe for a cold machine wash. You should use cold water to keep the protein from binding with fibers while the cleaning agents in your detergent lift the stain., While waiting for the load to finish, you might prepare the next load of laundry, accomplish other chores around the house, or take a short break.
 To ensure that all potentially skin irritating detergent is removed from your baby's clothing, you should allow the load of laundry to go through one more rinse cycle.Once this cycle is finished, you can remove the clothing and dry according to the garment tag instructions.


If you are concerned your dryer might be too indelicate for your baby's clothing, you may want to consider allowing your clothes to hang dry on a clothesline.

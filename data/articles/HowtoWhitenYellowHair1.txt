 Dark hair often ends up with orange or yellow tones after bleaching. The right toner will cancel out these brassy tones and makes your hair closer to white or platinum blonde.;
, Just about any pharmacy should carry toner, and you might even find it in the hair product aisle of a supermarket. Pick a purple or violet toner to remove yellow tones.
 If you also have undesired reddish tones in your hair, buy red gold corrector from a salon or online. Mix this with the toner according to label instructions.


Green or blue toner will cancel out reddish or orange tones without the need for a corrector, but will leave your hair yellow, not white.
 Choose a developer with 30 volume or less. High volume developers may make bleached hair weak or even cause it to fall out.
 Check the toner label to find out how long you need to leave it on your hair. Leaving it in too long can make your hair purple, so don't overdo it.


Alternatively, a very easy option is to simply book an appointment with a hairdresser for a toner to be put in. It takes less than half an hour, and can be as cheap as about $20.

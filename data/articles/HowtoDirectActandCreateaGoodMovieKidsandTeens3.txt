 Use any program you like, such as Windows Movie Maker (it usually comes with the computer), the Sony Vega, Medial Impression. Note: It's always better if you use the program that comes with the camera. Sometimes you can't edit the videos with another program if you don't save them with the program that comes with the camera first. These type of programs aren't usually very good, unless it's an expensive camera. Plus you can edit your movie with as many programs as you like, until you get good results. If you filmed it with a green screen, there are some programs that can edit those type of videos. When buying one, get well-informed about what the program can do.
 Try to actually make your own music, if you want. Put a title and credits. Include all the people who worked in the movie. If you did most of the work it might be a good idea to put: A film by (_) Don't forget the date. If you can't add credits and a title, you can paint the letters with the program Paint that all computers have, and save it as an image. So when putting it all together just include that.
 Upload it to YouTube if you want everyone to see your work.
 Did it look good? Was it what you expected? Did you have fun? Has everyone had fun? What where the main problems when making the movie? What did you like the most about the film? and the worst? What would you do better next time? Why? Would you repeat the experience?

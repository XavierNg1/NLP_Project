 This is usually played against overpitched deliveries.









Stand on a balanced back foot. Place the front foot up to the toes (padded portion) vertical or upright.
Hold the bat horizontally close to the pitch by the phase of the bat in an opposite manner.
Move the bat to the offside so that the ball is struck the instant it touches the ground.
 This shot was made famous by Kevin Pietersen in 2008.In this shot, a batsman changes his handedness and posture to adopt a stance the mirror image of his traditional handedness while the bowler is running in to bowl. As a fielding team cannot change the placing of fielders while the bowler is in his run-up, the fielding side is effectively wrong-footed with the fielders out of position. This shot's legality was confirmed by the ICC in 2008.The shot is risky because a batsman is less proficient in the other handedness and is more likely to make a mistake in the execution of his shot.

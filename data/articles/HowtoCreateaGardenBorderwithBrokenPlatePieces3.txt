 The tool must be able to cut through porcelain without spidering or smashing the plate. Recommended tools include a band saw, a wet tile saw, a hammer with nippers, a tile cutter or wheeled nippers.


If you don't want to do the cutting yourself, contact your local hardware or craft store to inquire about professional cutting. They may let bring your plate set in for cutting if you donâ€™t have the right tool.
 In this case, the simple half moon shape is used. Place the finished cut plates that will be used as a border in a separate area while cutting the remainder of the plates.


Make sure the plates cannot be disturbed by children or pets (they could break again if moved or dropped).

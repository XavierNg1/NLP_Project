 If a barking dog is approaching you and you believe it may be aggressive, call for help. Yell loudly and clearly. People in the surrounding area may notice and come to offer you assistance.Avoid yelling if the dog is close and rapidly advancing toward you. The dog may perceive your yelling as a threat, and continue its advance.
 If a dog is barking and you think it may pose a threat, find something for it to bite that isn’t you. A frenzied dog will bite at almost anything, so find a stick, a bag, or another object that you can hold out for the dog to bite instead of you.If you cannot find such an object and truly believe that a bite is inevitable, wrap your arm up in a shirt, jacket, or other heavy material. Encourage the dog to bite the covered arm while you call for help or try to retreat.
 An aggressive dog is encouraged by fear and anxiety. Avoid yelling or kicking, stand tall, and stand slightly sideways to show the dog that you don’t want to take their space.If possible, claim your own space by holding out an object such as an umbrella or a bag to make yourself look bigger. This lets the dog define what is your space and what space belongs to it.
 If you have your mobile phone available, call animal control to let them know that there is an aggressive stray in the area. Provide them with the general location of where you last saw the dog, as well as what kind of aggressive behaviors it exhibited.If you think the dog is an immediate threat, also notify 911 and ask for help to be sent to your area immediately.

 Set the oven for 350°F and let it preheat completely. Different ovens take different amounts of time to preheat, so make sure the oven is up to the right temperature before you insert the chicken for reheating.
 Because the chicken has already been cooked, you don’t really need a roasting dish with deep sides, because there won’t be juices running off the chicken. However, a roasting dish is still a good size for reheating a rotisserie chicken.


Rub butter or oil on the surface of the dish, or spray it with nonstick cooking spray, to keep the chicken from sticking to it.
Place the whole rotisserie chicken in the dish.
 Place the dish in the properly preheated oven, making sure it’s in the center rack for even heat application. Depending on how large your chicken is, you might need a little more or less time, but it should take about 25 minutes for your chicken to reheat thoroughly.Use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 165°F.
Begin checking the temperature a few minutes early, especially if your chicken is on the small side.
Don’t let the chicken overcook, as it gets tough and dry — especially the white meat.
 Remove the chicken from the oven, using oven mitts and trivets to protect your hands and the counter from the hot container. Let the chicken rest at room temperature for about five minutes before cutting into it. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, keeping it moist when served.

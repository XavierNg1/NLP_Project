 This brings the short side of the paper over to one of the long sides. Line up these two edges and crease the fold. You should now have a right triangle made from the folded sheet, plus an extra rectangle of single-sheet paper.;
, Cut along the edge of the triangle to separate it from the extra paper.


If you do not have scissors, fold the small rectangle over the triangle and crease well. Unfold the paper. Press down hard on the small rectangle with one hand, and on the rest of the paper with the other. Slowly move your hands apart to tear along the crease., You now have a perfect square with a diagonal crease in it.


To make the crease less obvious, flip the paper over and fold it the other way along the same crease.

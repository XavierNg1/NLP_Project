 If your stopper has a pivot rod, then you will need to remove this to remove the stopper. Look under the sink and locate a locking nut where the pivot rod goes into the drainpipe. Unscrew the nut, pull out the rod, and remove the stopper. Then screw the nut and rod back in place without the stopper.If you are plunging a kitchen sink, make sure to clamp the dishwasher drain hose. Do this by tightening a clamp around the bendable drain line before you begin plunging.;
, Bring five cups (1,182.94 ml) of water to a boil. Pour half of the boiling water down your drain. Reserve the other half for a later use., As your sink is filling, place the plunger over the drain entrance. Fill your sink until the plunger is completely submerged in the water, about three to four inches (76.2 to 101.6 mm) of water. The water will suction your plunger to the sink.If you have a double sink, then you will need to cover the other sink’s drain with a wet rag or another type of cover. This will prevent water from spewing out of the sink’s drain while you plunge the other drain.
 Do this by rapidly moving the plunger up and down for at least 20 seconds. On your final upstroke, make sure to pop the plunger off of your drain to create extra pressure. This will help release the clog in your sink trap., If the water in your sink whirls down your drain easily, then the clog is clear in your sink trap. If not, then you will need to keep plunging. Repeat the plunging process until the water whirls smoothly down your sink., You may need to re-heat the water at this point. Re-heat the water until it is boiling again. Then pour the water down your drain.


The boiling water should clear away any remaining residue in your sink trap.
If your sink is still clogged, then repeat steps two through six, or use a different method.

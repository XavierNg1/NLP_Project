 Wait for a quiet moment when you’re together. If she’s self-conscious about public displays of affection, choose a time when the two of you are alone. Ideal moments could be:


Sitting on the couch while watching TV.
Lounging on a blanket outside in the sun.
Waiting for an outdoor concert to begin.;
, Attempting intimacy always feels awkward when you could fit a car between the two of you, so sit close to her and get cozy. Put your arm around her. Start stroking or playing with her hair. Pay her a compliment about its texture, look, or scent. Be natural about it, so you don’t look like you're trying to force a rehearsed move on her.Keep your eyes on the TV or whatever the two of you are watching at first.
Play with her hair absentmindedly, as if you don’t even know what your hand is doing.
Then act as though whatever it is you compliment suddenly woke you up to what your hand is up to.
 If she’s worn it braided for you before, tell her how much you like it that way. If not, tell her how great you think she’d look. Or, if you know that she enjoys having other people braid her hair as a way of relaxing, simply offer to do it yourself.


If you’re confident about your skill, just offer to do it, plain and simple, to show your confidence, like: "Hey, how about I braid this for you?"
If you’re unsure, just ask her to teach you. This way she probably won’t mind any mishaps, and you’ll still have an intimate moment together. Say something, "Hey, why don't you show me how to braid your hair? I always wondered how you do that."
If you’re confident but want to make this even more of a bonding experience, play dumb and ask her to teach you so she feels like she’s sharing something with you.

 Thick stock paper works better than thin printer paper, since the heavy paint has a tendency to soak through and weigh the paper down. You and your kids can create as many pictures as you want, and you can dispose, save, or display the artwork as you see fit.
 Older kids will love creating their own wearable designs. You may want to have them practice their pictures on plain paper before applying them to the fabric, though.
 Depending on how many kids you have, each child can sponge paint a design onto one or two sides of a wooden or heavy paper mâché box. You can use sponge paint to decorate the lid. By the end of the project, you will have a box that you can store any artwork, cards, or mementos your kids give you.
 Coloring eggs is typically a family event to begin with. Instead of working with messy liquid dyes, you can sponge paint pictures and designs onto the eggs, instead. You may need to craft stands or hold the egg for your kids as they paint, since holding and painting might be difficult for younger ages.
 Use painter's tape to section off a rectangle on your child's bedroom wall. Allow him or her to use sponge paint to create his or her own room décor inside the taped off space.


Instruct your children to practice the picture on plain paper before painting it onto the wall.
Stick with paint that can be removed with water. If your kids do not like what they design, you can wash it off and have them try again.
Seal finished designs with a clear coat of gloss, or hang a backless frame over the area.

 Put alcohol onto a paper towel. Rub the alcohol onto the decal until it is saturated. Lay the paper towel onto the decal. Wait a few minutes to allow the alcohol to work on the adhesive. If the paper towel will not stay, thoroughly saturate the decal and allow it to sit., Try peeling the decal off. If it does not work, take a tool, like a paint chipper, and work on removing it. Apply more alcohol and allow it to sit for a few more minutes if the sticker does not come off completely the first time. The surface should dry quickly.If any stickiness remains after removing the decal, apply alcohol and scrub the stickiness of with a rag.

 Don't pick an address that's long and cryptic. Instead, think of things that are important to you (hobbies, pets, etc) and with an easy-to-remember set of numbers to go with it, if you want them.;
, Remember that it will sound unusual to those who need to know your address.
 Reflect a little bit. What are you passionate about? Think of any hobbies, sports, and other activities that you're involved with or that you simply love doing.

An example for a volleyball fan could be 'volleygirl@yahoo.co.uk', and one for a Star Wars fan could be 'theforce96@aol.com'.

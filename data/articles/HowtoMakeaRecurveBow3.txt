 Put notches into the top and bottom of the limbs. These are what holds the bowstring in place. It's best if you do this with a long, cylindrical file, but it can be done with a knife and a flat, narrow file.


Cut the notches on the inside of the bow to protect the integrity of the outside wood.
 Tillering is what gives your bow its draw. Once you have gotten your bow to the shape you want it to be, place a tillering string on it. The tillering string should be about twice as long as the intended bow string. Tie a loop in each end of the string and attach it to the notches on the limbs.


Parachute cord works well as a tillering string.
 Pull the tillering string to one of the notches closer to the top of the stick. Slowly and gradually pull the bow further, taking note of how the bow is bending.


The tillering process takes a long time, and is very gradual.
If you hear noise coming from the bow, stop, and use the large file to shape the limbs a little more.
The tillering process can take months, and doing it slowly will allow you to increase the draw of the bow to a good length.
Once your tillering process is started, you can smooth off the front of the bow with the large file.
 Once the bow has reached an acceptable draw, remove it from the tillering stick and take off the tillering string. Attach the bowstring. Loop both ends around the notches.


Nylon is a very popular bowstring.
The bow can be strung and fired during the tillering process, although it may not be at full strength, and firing might hinder the success of the tillering process.
 Once you have completed the tillering process, you can add artwork, leather, or a protective coating to your bow.

Preheat oil in your deep frying appliance until it reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Follow manufacturer's guidelines for the amount of oil to add. When the oil has reached the preset temperature slowly lower in the shrimp 1 at a time until the basket is nearly full. Do not overcrowd the shrimp.



Cook the shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes for medium size and about 3 minutes for large shrimp. Remove the shrimp when they are golden brown and slightly curled. Let them drain on a paper towel for 1 minute then serve.

 Hairspray is an unlikely but effective stain remover that you can use to remove your ink stain. Find a hairspray that is alcohol-based, as alcohol is the key element in hairspray that is effective at breaking up the stain.








If you haven’t already, lay out your garment and place a clean cloth underneath the stained portion to prepare it for cleaning.
 Before using hairspray or any other cleaning method, it’s a good idea to spot test to make sure that the cleaner doesn’t further stain the fabric. To spot test, spray a small amount of hairspray on an inconspicuous area of the garment, wait about 30 seconds, then blot it away. If the area looks a little damp but otherwise unchanged, it’s safe to use hairspray on the stain.








If the hairspray smears or alters the color of the garment, do not use it on the stain.
Hairspray works best on polyester-based fabrics. Do not use hairspray to remove a stain from leather, as alcohol-based products can damage the material.
 After you have laid out your garment, hold the hairspray about a foot from the garment and spray the stained area evenly and generously with hairspray.
 After you spray the stain with hairspray, let the hairspray set for a minute. This allows the alcohol of the hairspray to break apart the ink stain. Don’t let the hairspray sit for too long, or it will dry into the fabric., After about a minute of letting the hairspray set, begin blotting the stain with a clean white cloth or a cotton ball. You should see the ink stain being lifted. Keep dabbing at the stain until the stain is removed or until no more ink is being lifted.








If the stain is completely gone, launder the garment as usual.

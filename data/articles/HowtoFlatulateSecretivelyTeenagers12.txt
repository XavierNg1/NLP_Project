 While your voice is raised, release your gas. If this action causes a smell, quickly be the one to ask, "Who farted?"

, Either your fart won't be noticeable, or the fart will cause more laughter.
 Don't turn your back to them. Still in plain sight, do a fake armpit fart (where no noise comes out), and fart at the same time. If it's a silent fart, pretend to have failed at the armpit fart and walk back, saying "Dang, it didn't work." If it sounds too realistic, laugh and say, "I bet you can't do one as good as that!" You may initiate a full-on armpit fart contest!

, Then go to someone at the sleepover ( please choose wisely )wear a sad or strained expression on your face and walk up to him/ her.Stop and slowly extend your arm with your forefinger pointing at the victim,and with a pitiful voice say: ' Please, hold my finger for a while' or whatever you might think convincing.The victim is suspicious and reluctantly holds your finger looking at you in the eye. With a perfect sense of timing you let out a sonorous big fart. The victim is so startled the he/she even jumps back and hollers...everybody split their sides with laughter... and even the victim may join in.
 If the person whose house you're staying over at has a dog, make sure the dog is by you. You can quickly blame it on the poor, unsuspecting animal. If the person doesn't have a dog, try to hold it until everyone is asleep or quietly excuse yourself to the bathroom.

 While you can send an email instantly, getting a package, or letter in the post is a much more intimate and a heartfelt effort. Letters also create a keepsake that just can’t happen via email.Don’t worry about writing the perfect poem or something profound, the fact that you made the effort to write is enough. You can draw a picture, find a heartfelt pre-made card or even send a postcard from a special place.
If you want to try to write something special, try telling the story of how the two of you met. Give him special details that create a bond that only you two share.;
, Keeping a long distance relationship special means making an extra effort, including sending an email just because instead of always replying to their emails. This can be as simple as a quick message to say they are on your mind or sending something funny.


Keep in mind you may not always get a reply right back, we can’t expect the other person to always be available but you can make an effort to send them an email they can read when they are.
 No matter how busy you each get, taking the time to set aside routines like ending every night with each other on the phone or video chat makes the other person know they are important. Make plans to make time every day for each other.

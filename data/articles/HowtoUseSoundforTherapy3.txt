 Sit in a quiet place and close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths by inhaling and exhaling. Let any distractions in your mind dissipate before you begin.Let your thoughts gradually disappear by focusing on your breathing. Focus on the inhale and exhale of your breath and the sensations that it produces in your body.
 Do you want to reduce stress, increase positive feelings, or decrease depression? Whatever the reason, remind yourself and be clear to yourself why you are using your mantra. Keep your intention positive, and make it short term, as opposed to long term.For example, if it is to reduce stress, you can set your intention by saying, “I will be more relaxed this week.”
You can also set your intention by saying, "I intend to forgive others, as well as myself," "I intend to be grateful and happy," "I will be open to new ideas," "I will treat others the way that I would like to be treated," or "I intend to help another every day this week."

, You can say your mantra either out loud, or silently to yourself. Whether you say it out loud or silently, try to recite your mantra with feeling. Also, try to coordinate your mantra with your breathing.For example, coordinate the mantra with your breathing by saying it after each exhale.
If you are using the mantra to heal a specific part of the body, place your awareness on that part of your body as you say the mantra.
Continue breathing and repeating your mantra for one minute.

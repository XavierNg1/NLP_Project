 You can either use a single ribbon in a color that complements the blooms or a sheer ribbon. Or, you can place a sheer ribbon on top of your colored ribbon and tie them together simultaneously., It should be about 1/2” to 1” (1-2.5 cm) wider than the diameter of your blossom cluster.
 It should be the same size and be above your original loop.
 You want four to five loops of a uniform size.
 Secure the centers with florist’s wire. Leave about 2” (5 cm) of florist’s wire to attach the ribbon to the rest of the corsage.
 This will create the traditional bow look.
 The center of the ribbon should be placed at the point where the blooms and the greenery are taped together.
 This holds the blooms and greenery together.
 This will hold your corsage together.
 Leave a bit of ribbon dangling beneath the blooms. Cut the ribbon at an angle or cut a notch into the ribbon to complete the corsage.

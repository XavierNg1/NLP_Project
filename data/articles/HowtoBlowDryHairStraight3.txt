 Turn your dryer to the cool setting and finish off the top layer by blasting your hair with cold air from the roots down toward the tips. This helps the hair shaft lie flat and prevents frizzing throughout the day.
 Use an anti-frizz serum or argan oil to keep your hair shiny and straight. Rub a little through your fingers and comb it through your hair, focusing on the tips, which tend to dry out sooner than the rest of the hair.
 Curly or wavy hair can be difficult to completely straighten with a hair dryer alone. You hair should be sleek, but it might not be bone-straight. If you want it to be perfectly straight, use a straightening iron on each section of hair.

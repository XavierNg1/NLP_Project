 Having a clear objective is critical for any team, whether it is an athletic team, or one formed to accomplish a specific task.;
, Whether you are a leader, or a bottom-tier team member, understanding the potential of each team member will help you perform your part.
 If you are the leader, you will need completely different skill-sets and talents than if you are a minor contributing member. Once you know where you belong, you can begin to focus on your own job as a team member.
 In sports, you may practice drills and workouts, in other efforts, you may need to sharpen specific skills or research to become more proficient at doing your part.
 The leader should be the primary mover and shaker of your group, but each person can help another member who needs a hand, and if you are falling behind, you should expect and be willing to ask for a hand yourself.
, In sports, this might apply to your uniform, helmet, glove, cleats, or other gear. In a workplace environment, it may be tools and other gear needed for the team activity.
 Being a contributing team member often means increasing your level of performance, not just reaching a satisfactory place, but exceeding it.
 This includes listening to guidance from the team leader and others with authority over the team's project.

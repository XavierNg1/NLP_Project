 If you live in the United States, you'll notice blue USPS mailboxes bolted to the sidewalk in cities and suburbs. Walk to one of the boxes, open it with the handle, place your letter in the slot, and close it. A postal worker will collect your letter and start the delivery process.


Every mailbox has a notice detailing when the mail gets picked up. If you place your letter in the box after the scheduled pick up time, your letter will get picked up the next day instead.
Be careful not to place your letter in a brown mailbox. Brown mailboxes are for residential or commercial use.
 If you have a mailbox on your house, you can place your letter there and alert your mail carrier of its presence by lifting the red metal flag affixed to the side of the box. When the flag is raised, the mail carrier knows that there's a letter that needs to be mailed.
 If you need to buy postage at the post office, you can leave your letter with the post office worker and he or she will mail it for you. Even if you don't need to buy postage, you can still take your letter to the post office to be mailed.


The post office is a good place to mail your letter if you want to make sure it gets to its destination as quickly as possible. Taking your letter directly to the post office can cut down on the transit time by a day or so.

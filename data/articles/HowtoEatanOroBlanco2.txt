 Place the oro blanco on a cutting board and using a sharp knife slice through the equator (or center) of the fruit. In other words, cut through the fruit horizontally. Once cut, you should have two halves that expose the fruit in tiny segments., Take the two halves and place each of them in a bowl. This will help contain the juices and prevent you from making a mess while you eat., Using a serrated spoon, scoop out the individual segments of fruit and eat directly. You can sprinkle the oro blanco with sugar to sweeten the fruit, although you want to taste the fruit first because it is quite sweet., Once you have finished eating all of the fruit segments you can squeeze any remaining juice into a glass and drink it! Alternatively, you can use your spoon to scoop out the remaining juice.

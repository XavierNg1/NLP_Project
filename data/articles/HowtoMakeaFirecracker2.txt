 Use the nail to make a small hole in the top of the ping pong ball. If necessary, you can use a hammer to help the nail puncture the ball.
 Use the razor to cut a slightly larger hole opposite the hole you made with the nail. It should be large enough to allow you to pour the powder into the ping pong ball.









Use a razor with a handle for greater precision. Be careful not to cut yourself as you wield it; the surface of the ping pong ball may be slippery.
If you don't have a razor, use a nail or another item to bore a few holes close together to create a hole large enough to pour the powder through.
 Cut a length of the string several inches long and thread it through the nail hole in the ping pong ball. Pull it through so that the base of the string hangs in the center of the ball, and the end of the string juts out from the ball by an inch or two.









If you have trouble threading the string through the hole, dip it in a bit of melted wax to create a hardened tip, then push the tip through the hole.
For a slower-burning fuse, dip the length of the string in candle wax or beeswax. When you light the fuse, it will burn more slowly before the firecracker explodes.
 Use a small spoon or funnel to fill the ball 3/4 full with the black powder. Don't overfill the ball.









Never smoke or light a flame while handling black powder.
Take care not to spill any black powder in your workspace. If you spill some, clean it up with a dustpan and broom and dispose of it safely.
As soon as you're finished with the gunpowder, close the canister tightly and store it in a cool, dry place away from flammable or combustible substances.
 Use a piece of duct tape to patch the hole, pressing down firmly to make sure it doesn't come loose. The fuse hole should not be covered.
 Use nail polish to paint the outside of the firecracker. Allow it to dry completely.

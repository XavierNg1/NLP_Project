 If you have a rayon piece of clothing, store it by hanging it on a sturdy hanger with a good grip. Rayon isn’t really inclined to wrinkle when hung properly, and should be stored vertically to prevent any creasing of the fabric.If you must fold a rayon garment, try to fold along the clothing’s seams, and don’t put too many other items on top of they rayon. This prevents deeper creasing from pressure.
 For larger rayon pieces such as drapes or blankets, consider investing in a large plastic storage container to help keep the fabric safe and prevent anything from sitting directly on top of the rayon. Fold along the seams of the fabric when possible.


Rolling rayon may cause more smaller wrinkles, but may help prevent larger creases to the fabric.
 If you have your rayon dry-cleaned, it may come back to you in a plastic dry-cleaning bag. Excess exposure to these kinds of plastics may cause some yellowing of the fabric if left on for extended periods of time.If you prefer to have your rayon piece covered while in storage, cover it with a clean, colorless muslin, or purchase a garment bag meant for rayon storage.

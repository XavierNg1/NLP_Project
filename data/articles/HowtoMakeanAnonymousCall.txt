, When you hear the tone type "*67" before you make a call. You will hear a double dial tone to let you know that you have now restricted your call without revealing your identity to those you are calling.



Before entering the number type "*67" just as you would if you were making an anonymous call from a land line phone. However, you do not need to wait for a double tone before entering the rest of your number as when using a land line phone.






Before entering the rest of the number in your cell phone make sure you enter "1" before the area code (some companies don't require dialing the 1 after "67", so if it doesn't work with the "1" try it without), a step which can be easily forgotten as it is typically not necessary when making calls from a cell phone. Instead of your cell phone number showing up on the caller ID of your call recipient's phone, the word "Restricted" will show up instead.



All cell phones are different, but some may offer an option to hide your number as a default setting for all calls. Check with your wireless provider if you are not sure how to implement this setting on your phone.
 While this is not available for cell phones it is an available feature on landlines through phone providers.


If you try to make an anonymous call to a number with this feature implemented a pre-recorded message will be played alerting you that the person does not accept anonymous calls. To reach this person you will need to call back without hiding your phone number if that is an option.






While this can be a useful tool to implement it can also screen out desired calls from callers that typically hide their numbers, such as doctor's offices, a police officer, or other offices or individuals who have a legitimate reason for consistently hiding their number.

 The pencils can be sharpened or unsharpened. Just make sure the pencils are approximately the same length. Line the pencils up vertically. Make a triangular pattern by setting two of the pencils lined up in a row, and one pencil lined up in the middle of the other two pencils.
 Simple scotch tape or masking tape will work fine. Wrap a small piece of tape around the erasers, and another small piece around all the tips. This will help hold the pencils together. You don’t want them sliding out of position while you wrap them together.
 You will want to switch to a stronger tape. Electrical tape or duct tape is ideal. Start wrapping around one end, then roll the tape around to the other end. You can make two or three layers if you want a little more cushion to your grip., They should rest over the lower half of the launcher on the backside. The pencils should be away from any of the moving pieces of the launcher.
 Place the pencils so they about an inch or two rests on the bottom portion of the launcher. Wrap the tape around the sides and crossing over the pencils vertically until the launcher feels secure. Be sure the tape does not interfere with the movement of the ripcord.
 Try launching a couple of Beyblades and make sure the grip seems to be stable enough. If you can feel the launcher moving at all you may need to add another layer of tape. Once you’re satisfied with the grip, add some decorations or stickers to finish it off.

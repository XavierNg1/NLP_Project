 Turn it on and let it preheat for about 10 minutes.
 Make sure there is a little room around each brat. Line them up to be perpendicular to the grates on the broiler pan.


You can also use a cast-iron skillet instead of a broiler pan.Be sure to rotate the brats every 5 minutes to prevent them burning on one side.
 Place the broiler pan on an oven rack and close the oven. Let the brats cook for about 5 minutes., After 5 minutes have passed, open the oven and use an oven mitt to hold onto the broiler pan. Use tongs to turn over each brat. Put the pan back in the oven for another 5 minutes, and then turn the brats again. Cook the bratwurst for a total of 15-20 minutes.


If you don’t rotate your brats, you will risk burning them.
 Use a meat thermometer and poke into one bratwurst so that the tip of the thermometer rests in the middle of the bratwurst. It should reach 160 °F (71 °C).

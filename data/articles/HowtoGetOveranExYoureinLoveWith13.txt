 Don't expect your ex to travel places with you, to talk to you every night or to spend all the weekends with you.
 If you and your ex are now friends, you may as well make the effort to get to know someone who is important to them. If you don't get on with him/her at all, then don't try it again, but still be polite to them. You never know, you may gain a new friend.
 Even if you start to have the kind of friendship where you are always there for each other, donâ€™t just rely on them, show that you have a life of your own and can cope without them.

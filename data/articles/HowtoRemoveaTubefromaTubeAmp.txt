 Tubes can be expensive, so before replacing them you should assess whether they need to be replaced. If the tube is burnt-out and will not glow when the amp is powered on, then replacement is necessary. If the amp has begun sounding excessively muddled, produces hissing or squealing noises, or demonstrates unpredictable fluctuations in volume, the tubes are probably worn and should be replaced. With average playing time at average volume levels, tubes should be replaced about once a year.;
, Before attempting any work on the amp, unplug it. Leave the speakers connected to the amp with the power switch on for a few seconds to help drain any remaining voltage from the amp. Before working on the amp, give it at least 10 minutes to ensure the tubes have fully cooled.
 In many amps, you will need to remove a plastic or metal panel from the rear of the chassis. This is usually done with a Phillips head screwdriver. Set the panel aside after removing it.
 If the tubes have not been replaced in a while, consider replacing all the tubes at once. If a single tube is burnt-out, you can power on the amp and watch to see which tube does not glow. Make sure to let any tubes cool before touching them.
 Some tubes may be covered by a metal cylinder. Grab the cylinder and twist it to unthread it and remove it. Set it aside.
 Tubes are seated using a 9-pin connection, with the male pins extending from the bottom of the tube and the female receptors located in the socket. To remove the tube, gently grab it and work it slightly back and forth while lifting upwards. Be gentle to avoid bending or breaking the pins. Do not twist the tube while lifting.
 If replacing the tube, insert the new tube using the same motion as you used to remove the old one. Lower it gently down, working it slightly back and forth to seat it fully. Discard the old tube. Replace the metal cover if applicable and replace the rear panel.

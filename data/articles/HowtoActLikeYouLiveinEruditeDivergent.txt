 All members of Erudite must wear at least one article of blue clothing everyday. The color blue is calming and it helps to stimulate the brain. Also, most members wear thick glasses to make themselves appear smarter.;
, In your free time, read a lot! Maybe catch up on some studying for school or just study for fun. If other Erudites are around, start a conversation about current events, books, or the news.
 Think about a job as a teacher or doctor, if you're a student take up a part time job as a librarian or at a bookshop. Stay ambitious though, a true erudite should always be looking for a promotion, whether this means getting a degree, sucking up to the boss, or putting in the hard hours, always keep career advancement in sight., Ignorance is defined not as stupidity, but as a lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge leads to a lack of understanding. And Erudites never lack understanding.
 Lack of understanding leads to a disconnect among people in differences. That is so not Erudite.
 Disconnection with others leads to conflict. And we Erudites don't like conflict, do we?

, Erudites believe that knowledge is the only solution to conflict. So, in order to not have conflict, have lots of knowledge. Simple, right?

, The people of Erudite strive for knowledge. So, never drop out or skip school. Go to a good college and never stop learning!!

, Erudite was formed by the people who blamed ignorance for the wars and problems of the world. And, Erudite still believe that ignorance is the reason for the problems in the world today!

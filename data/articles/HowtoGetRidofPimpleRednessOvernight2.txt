 Eye drops for red eyes contain tetrahydrozoline, which is a drug that constricts your blood vessels. This ingredient can help to reduce blood flow to the pimple and bring down the redness instantly, but it is only a temporary fix.Put one to two drops of the eye drop solution on a Q-tip and apply it to your pimple.
Keep in mind this method wonâ€™t last long, usually no more than an hour, so it may be better to use it just before or during your special event.
 Aspirin contains salicylic acid, which can help to reduce inflammation and redness on your skin. Make sure the aspirin you use is not coated with enteric, as you will need to dissolve the aspirin to apply it.Place two to three aspirin tablets in a teaspoon of water, allow them to dissolve, and mix to form a paste. Dab it on the pimple and leave it on until it dries. Then, rinse it off with warm water.
 You can also use an over-the-counter spot treatment product that contains salicylic acid on the pimple to reduce redness. Salicylic acid can be found in the form of a gel or a lotion. You can then apply a small amount of the gel or lotion directly to the pimple. Let it dry overnight.Look for salicylic acid products that contain .05 to 1 percent salicylic acid with a pH of three to four. Use 2 percent for salicylic acid for stubborn acne. You may also find salicylic acid in cleansers, but the acid works best if it is given time to dry and set in your skin so the cleanser may not be as effective as a toner, gel, or lotion.
You can find spot treatments with salicylic acid at your local drugstore or in the beauty aisle. Many major brands use salicylic acid in their spot treatment products.

 You'll find yourself at Redwoods National Park. There, you may view beautiful "original growth" redwood trees, go camping, do some fishing, view educational exhibits at one of 5 visitor's centers, or simply enjoy a picnic.;
, You'll pass the coastal city of Eureka, CA, then start to head inland...towards the very heart of "California Redwood Country." If you stop at the small town of Scotia...about 20 miles (32Â km) south of Eureka...you can tour the Pacific Lumber Company sawmill. Watch wood go from the "whole trunk" stage to the finished product!

, You'll pass mile after mile of beautiful, huge California redwoods.
 Enjoy displays in the visitor's center. Camp in developed or primitive sites; aah, the aroma of the trees is a treat! Hike along miles of trails through the trees.
 Can you believe that the California redwoods are big enough to hollow out and use as a small house? They are!

, (That's further south yet, in Leggett, CA.) The drive through the tree is just plain fun...and the tree itself lives on in good health...despite having a "tunnel" through its base.
 As you drive south on Hwy 1, you'll be able to view the Pacific Ocean much of the time as you continue to travel south to San Francisco.
 At Fort Ross, you'll see what's left of a fort and trading post established by Russian explorers, traders and military men 2 centuries ago.
 You'll find an art colony, a selection of quaint bed and breakfast inns, and opportunities for outdoor sports and exploring.
 Check out filming sites made famous in Alfred Hitchcock's tense thriller, "The Birds."

, Most of northern California beaches are rocky, so cherish it!

 There are several different methods of measuring pH. The hydrogen electrode method is considered the most accurate standard, but is inconvenient for most applications. The most commonly used method is the glass diode method. It is easy to use and you get the same results (or close) each time you use it. If you are using very small sample sizes, you might consider a semi-conductor type pH meter., You want to make sure that your sample is as close to uniform as possible. Shake or stir the sample before measuring with the pH meter. Be sure that there are no solid particles in your sample, and that the sample is at a stable temperature. This way you will get the most accurate reading., Each meter will differ slightly, and you should follow the manual given with the meter you choose. Usually, preparation will consist of putting the one electrode in the sample and another electrode in a solution of known pH. Be sure that both electrodes are clean., Submerge both electrodes into the proper liquids. The difference in voltage between the two electrodes is related to the pH of the two solutions. This allows the meter to calculate the pH of your solution.

 To counteract this, keep in mind that most people aren’t going to advertise their flaws, but they may be very vocal about their achievements.


Don’t assume that what you see on social media or hear about in conversation fully describes their situation. These people have setbacks and doubts, too. Refuse to compare your full story to someone else’s highlight reel.It has been proven that looking at other people’s “highlight reels” on websites like Facebook can contribute to depression. If this is the case for you, then delete your account or at least limit the time that you spend on the site., A primary symptom of perfectionism is the fear of how others view you. As a result, you try to buffer their evaluation by doing everything exactly right. The resulting desire to be perfect can lead to conditions like social anxiety and eating disorders. You can decrease these feelings of self-consciousness by removing your access to negative media.When you witness people who judge or shame others on TV, magazines, or social media, you will automatically believe that this is how others will perceive you, too.
Access media that focuses on solutions rather than problems. It can also help to view media that emphasizes the many positive differences in people rather than expecting everyone to be the same.Try to focus on positive or uplifting media to help improve your outlook.
 Parents, friends, or partners who suffer from perfectionism can be very demanding. They may require perfection from themselves and you, only reinforcing this negative habit. Other perfectionists may make constant comparisons between themselves and some ideal. When you're around them, it's easy to fall into the comparison game, too.


If possible, minimize the time you spend with these people. And turn on your inner-filter when around them to tease out negative and unhelpful feedback.Build a support network of positive people who encourage and accept you. Spend time with them as much as you can.

 As of this writing, this program will be effective up to iOS 9.0.2. It will not work on iOS 9.1. Apple constantly tries to patch any hack of its operating system from one version to the next, and is in a running war with groups like Pangu, so any jailbreaking instructions can quickly become out-of-date for the most recent Apple products.;
, A USB cable is the standard and best way to do this.
 Turn off iTunes, Find my iPhone, and Xcode. Disable Passcode and enable Airplane mode.


You can disable passcode by going into Settings and selecting “Touch ID & Passcode”. Turn off Find my iPhone by entering settings, tapping “iCloud”, and selecting “Find my iPhone”.
 You will need to run it as an administrator for it to work properly. You can access this option by right clicking, rather than double clicking, the program.
 Click “Start” once the program detects your phone, and “Already Backup” when it appears on the screen. Enable Airplane mode again once your phone reboots.
 Open the Pangu app on your phone from your Home screen. Tap “Accept” and then “Allow” as they appear on your phone’s screen. Once the phone reboots, your iPhone should be jailbroken.
 It is available at http://www.mediafire.com/download/aqi9os99lfea96b/Complete+Android+Lollipop.zip.
 Cydia will have been installed during your Pangu jailbreak. Open the Cydia app from your Springboard, tap the search tab at the bottom of the screen, and search for “WinterBoard”.
 Tap “Install” in the top right corner, then tap “Confirm” in the top right corner.
 The theme should be placed in an appropriate “.theme” folder.
 Tap “Select Themes”, then select theme you want.
 Your Springboard (your iPhone’s home page) will restart, with your theme on display.

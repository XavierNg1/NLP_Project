 (Most popular paint brands make paint in these textures.) Apply it directly to the wall with a paint roller. Apply 1 to 2 coats and let dry. This is perhaps the quickest way to retexture your walls.
 Venetian plaster paint is a 2-tone paint made by popular paint brands to create the look of marble and stone on your walls. Work in a 3 by 3 foot (1 by 1 m) area and apply a small amount of paint in an overlapping, random motion until you have a thin coat on most of the surface. Allow some areas of the original wall to show through. Dry for 1 to 4 hours until it is a lighter color and matte finish.


Apply a small amount of the Venetian plaster paint to the spatula and skim the surface at a 90-degree angle to even out the surface colors. Let dry as before and repeat until you have achieved your desired texture. Using light grit sandpaper, polish the surface in circular patterns.

 Make your hair look wavy and sand-swept. Your hair can even look a little bit wet, as if you just stepped out of the ocean.


Wear a shell headband if you have one. You can also add a starfish hair clip to your hair.
 Your mermaid makeup should make you look natural and beautiful. You don't have to wear too much makeup for the right look.


Wear a light pink lipstick.
Shade your eyes with subtle colors like blues, greens, and purples.
Put on silver or blue mascara for emphasis. If you wear black mascara, make sure it's subtle.
Add a light layer of makeup to your face.
 Your shoes should be simple and beachy. Since real mermaids don't wear shoes, your skirt should cover most of your feet and you don't need to draw attention to them.


Wear slinky flip-flops or sandals with shells on them.
Wear shoes that are brown or another neutral color.
Paint your nails and toes a subtle shade of pink.
Avoid heels.
 Mermaids don't have too much time for accessories because they're busy swimming, but there are a few things you can add to complete your mermaid look. Here are a few things to try:


Put on a mood ring or mood necklace.
Wear a small coral purse.
Wear coral and shell jewelry.

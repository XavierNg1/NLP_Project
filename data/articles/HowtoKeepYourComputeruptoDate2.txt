 Before upgrading your operating system to a newer one (or if you have the latest operating system and would like to keep it as up to date as possible) you should download service packs and updates whenever they are available. If you have Automatic Updates enabled, then your computer will alert you when they are ready.


If you are running a version of Linux, and another version of your distro was just released, you don't need to upgrade to it unless support for your version has been terminated. It can help, but there's no need to go to all the trouble.
 You should know the specifications of your computer's performance before doing anything related to hardware or software on your computer. Operating systems have minimum requirements for the hardware that it uses. With RAM, be sure to at least double the minimum RAM requirements, and with processor speed, be sure to double, or preferably triple, the required processor speed. More about hardware can be found in the Hardware section.
 This is very important, since everything on the disk will be destroyed in the process of reinstalling the operating system.

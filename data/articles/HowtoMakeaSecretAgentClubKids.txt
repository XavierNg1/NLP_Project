 What sort of secret agent activities do you want to investigate? You might want to look for lost pets, missing items, or have general secret missions. Perhaps you want to train others in doing detective work.
 Need help? Take a funny word, and make it stand for something. For example, you could name your club the B.D.E! Committee, which would stand for BEST DETECTIVES EVER! Educating Events.
 Is the field at recess fine, or should you make a clubhouse?


A secret room for your club might be fun.
 Who's the leader? Who's the co-captain? Who's the rookie? There are a lot of jobs you could make also. Event organizers make up missions/contests and pitch them to the captains. Helpers can teach new members the ropes. Guards can guard the members, rookies, and captains as they are having a meeting or starting an investigation.
 (A fun thing to do is make up a contest where people make up their own handshake or password and others vote who's is the best).
 Is there any rumors at school that there's a ghost haunting a bathroom or something mysterious? Think up a way to get to the bottom of it.
, It may help to look over it later.

If your tool cannot be upgraded, discard it.
Most power tools in use today have a three-wire system. This third wire serves as an emergency ground in the event of an internal short or ground fault.



Adapters not properly connected to receptacle boxes make the ground fault wire ineffective.



This causes the cord's insulation to rapidly deteriorate.
Inspect tool and extension cords routinely for fraying and other signs of deterioration. Repair or replace immediately.



GFIs do not replace traditional protection provided by current isolation, insulation and grounding, but they are a backup if insulation or grounding fails due to age, abuse or mechanical breakdown.
The GFI detects low levels of leaking current and cuts off power quickly at leakages greater than 5 mA.
 Most electrical tools come with a switch to allow for the device to run without holding down the trigger. If this switch is on and the device is plugged in, it will turn on immediately. Pulling the trigger is the usual method of switching these switches off.

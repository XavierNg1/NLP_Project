 Puppies are adorable creatures that are easy to love, but housebreaking a puppy can be a frustrating and tedious process. A prime benefit of bringing a senior dog into your home is that, in most instances, the housebreaking has been done for you. Furthermore, most senior dogs have good manners, and some can even perform tricks.Senior dogs will almost always be potty trained.
Many will also be able to perform “sit,” “down,” “come,” and other commands.
This is especially great for busy families who may not have time to train a puppy.;
, Older dogs have had to refine their social skills and learn to live around people. As such, they tend to be more patient and tolerant than younger dogs or puppies. This can be very helpful if you have kids at home.If a senior dog suffers from a painful ailment—like arthritis—they may not like to be grabbed or climbed on.
 The old adage that you “can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” is actually very misleading. Older dogs tend to go with the flow more easily than younger dogs, and can easily find their place in your household.This can be great if you have additional dogs or other pets at home.

 This will open a window displaying your OS X version and a summary of your system specs. This includes your processor speed, memory (RAM), and graphics adapter (if installed).
 The newest version of OS X has tabs along the top of the About This Mac window that allow you to quickly jump between the different categories of hardware. If you are using Mavericks (OS X 10.9) or earlier, skip down to the next step.


The Overview tab gives you a brief rundown of your most commonly-searched for specs. This page should be enough to determine whether or not you can run a program.
The Displays tab will show all of your connected displays.
The Storage tab will show your drives and how much space each one of them has.
 This will open a new window with detailed hardware information. Use the navigation tree on the left to find the hardware you want to inspect.The Hardware section will display detailed information for all of your hardware components. When you select "Hardware", you CPU information will be shown in the right frame. If your CPU has more than one core, they will be listed here.
Note: This shows the advertised speed of the processor, which is fine when determining if your computer meets the requirements to run a program. It will not, however, show the results of any overclocking. Click here for information on finding the actual speed of your processer.

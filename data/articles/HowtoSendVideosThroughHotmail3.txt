 Open the video you want to share in YouTube. Don't worry about clicking the Share tab or trying to embed the video, as Outlook takes care of that automatically.
 Click on your browser's address bar and copy the URL for the video When you click the Share tab, you will see a link to the video underneath the social media icons. Copy this link to add it to your email.


If you want to share the video and have it start at a specific time, click the Share tab and check the "Start at" box and enter in the time you want the video to start. Copy the link that appears in the field beneath the Share tab.
 If the recipient is using Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo, or most other major mailing services, the video will appear in the email. Outlook and Gmail allow the recipient to play the video directly from the email without having to go to YouTube.

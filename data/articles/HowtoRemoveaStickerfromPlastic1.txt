 This is a stronger solution, so you will only need to soak the sticker for 5-10 minutes. After you've let it soak, scrape up the sticker with a broad, flat item for an adhesive-free clean up. Some specialty products, like Goo Gone, function similarly., Get a carton of isopropyl alcohol—preferably a 90% solution. Pour a small amount on an old rag and begin wiping the adhesive. The adhesive should begin to lift after a minute or so of scrubbing.
 You can use a degreaser like WD-40 to wipe away the sticker. First, test the WD-40 on a patch of the plastic to make sure that it won’t harm the sticker if you plan to keep it. Then, spray degreaser on a clean cloth or directly on the sticky label or glue residue. Rub in a circular motion with a towel until the sticker pulls away.
 Soak the sticker in a container of nail polish remover. If you don’t have enough nail polish remover, you can apply the remover with a cloth and scrub away the sticker. The sticker will be easier to remove if you give it a few minutes for the remover to react.

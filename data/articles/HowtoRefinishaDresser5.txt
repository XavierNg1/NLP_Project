 The most popular paint for wooden surfaces is water-based acrylic. It's easy to apply, the paintbrushes wash out easily in water and the finish is smooth and durable. Enamel paint can provide a lovely glossy finish but it is slower to work with and the brushes require cleaning in mineral turpentine, which means more effort, odor and longer drying time.


In general, enamel paint should be preferred where the dresser will get a lot of wear and tear (such as in a children's playroom or in a retail outlet). Acrylic paint will be fine for a dresser not likely to get too much buffeting.

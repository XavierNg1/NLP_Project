 Expect different styles of longboarding to require different levels of skill. If you’re reading this, chances are you’re new to longboarding, so stick with “cruising” for now. This simply means using your longboard as an easy means of transportation over relatively level and smooth ground. As you become more accustomed to this level, you can progress to more advanced forms like:Freestyling, which focuses more on doing tricks rather than traveling distances.
Freeriding, which incorporates more hills and technical maneuvers while traveling.
Downhill longboarding, which utilizes high hills and high speeds and requires very precise maneuvers.;
, Don’t be overwhelmed by all the different shapes that longboards come in. Narrow down your search right away by choosing between designs that are most ideal for the style of longboarding that you’re interested in. If you’re a beginner starting with cruising, you have the most options upfront. However, think ahead and consider what other styles you hope to advance to in order to make life easier, since many designs are ideal for multiple styles.Ideal shapes for cruising include bamboo, commuter, cruiser, drop down, drop through, and pintail.Drop down and drop through are also both ideal for freestyling and freeriding.
Cruisers, speed boards, and top mounts are best for downhill.
 Treat width as the primary concern when considering the board’s dimensions. Make sure the board’s width is no less than your shoe size, since your feet will most often be placed with your toes and heels pointing to either side, rather than its front and back. After that, decide how long you want your board to be. Keep in mind that:The longer the board, the more stable your ride, generally speaking. However, your height is a factor, too. So while taller people will benefit from the longest boards, shorter riders and young children will benefit more by scaling back.
Midsize boards are generally the most versatile and a safe choice for beginners.

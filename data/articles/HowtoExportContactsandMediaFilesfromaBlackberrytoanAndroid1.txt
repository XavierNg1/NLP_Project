 Tap open the phonebook icon you see on your home screen to open your device’s contact list. Here, all the contact information—email addresses, mobile numbers, and more—will be displayed.
 Inside the Blackberry contact list, press the Menu button (Blackberry logo) usually found at the bottom of the screen regardless of the make and model of your phone and a pop-up menu showing additional options that you can do while inside the contact list will appear., From the pop-up menu, select “Export Contacts” and your Blackberry will begin saving your contact list as a VCF, or Virtual Contact File.

A VCF is a type of file that contains contact information that can be synced or copied to any type of devices.
 Connect your Blackberry and your Android device to a computer. Take your Blackberry’s data cable, plug one end to your phone and the other to an available USB port on your computer. Do the same your Android device with its data cable.

Move the created VCF file from the Blackberry’s storage drive to the Android’s storage drive (both accessible through My Computer/Computer on your PC) by either dragging it from one window to another, or using the copy-paste function. You can move the file anywhere inside the Android storage.
 Tap the phonebook icon you see on the screen of your Android phone to open its contact list. If you don’t have any contact information saved yet, you may find this list empty., Open the options or settings of the Android’s contact list and select “Import” from the pop-up menu. You’ll be asked where you’d like to get your contacts from. Select “Virtual Contact File,” or “VCF,” from the option and it should automatically sync the Blackberry contacts on to the list.

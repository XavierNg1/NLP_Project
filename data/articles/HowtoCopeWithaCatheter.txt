, You will need to empty the bag or bulb contents on a regular basis.


Turn the bag or your bulb upside down.
Take the cap off the bag.
Pour the contents of your bag or bulb into your toilet, and take care so that no part of your bag or tubing actually touches the toilet or the water. This can introduce contaminants.
Put the cap back on the bag.
Adhere the bag back to its original location.



Don't immerse your catheter or any of the dressing in the deep water of a bath.
Cover your dressing with plastic wrap if you plan to shower with it.
Remove any wet dressing as soon as possible and replace it with new dressing, leaving your catheter device alone.

Assess yourself for any distress. A high fever could be a sign of a backup in the line or infection, and you should contact your physician if you have any fears about your catheter.
Avoid any kinks in your line.
Make sure there are no leaks in your catheter tube.
Look for irritation, swelling or skin that is red or tender at your insertion site.
Ensure that your drainage bag doesn't get too full, resulting in dragging or pulling on your catheter.
Sharp pain, nausea, vomiting and chills are warning signs as well.



Carefully wash around your drainage tube with soap and water.
Rinse the catheter site well, and then dry it with a clean towel.
Powders and lotions should not be used around the site where your catheter has been inserted.

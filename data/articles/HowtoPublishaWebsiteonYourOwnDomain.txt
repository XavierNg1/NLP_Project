 Your website will need two things:


A unique domain name. Each domain name is registered with a DNS (Domain Name Server), which identifies a domain name with a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address.
Space. Each website must have a web space allocated to it. This is provided by a web server, many of which are maintained by private companies.;
, Many websites (such as domainsbot) will catalogue which domains are available. Or, you can always try typing the domain you want into the URL field of your browser.
 Searching a taken domain will turn up similar domains that are still open. For example, if you want to register the domain name “domainhostingcompany.com” you'd see that “domainhostingcompany.co” is available but “domainhostingcompany.com” is already registered.
 Find a domain name registrar and sign up your domain. (To find a registrar, simply search "domain name registrar.") You'll probably have to pay a start-up fee, as well as a yearly fee to keep the domain registered in your name. Afterward, the registrar will provide you with access to a control panel for your website.
 From the control panel, you can check your disk space and monthly bandwidth space. You can also upload and download the contents of the website, as well as updating the files and folders of the website using FTP server address.
 There are several applications that will apply themes (or designs) to your website.

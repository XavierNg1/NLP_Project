 You can also look for signs of lameness by observing your horse’s demeanor, as horses often have a change in personality due to pain or discomfort. Watch your horse for signs of grumpiness or irritability. Your horse may appear more subdued or withdrawn. He may also become more aggressive and appear grumpy day after day.You may notice that your horse is less playful and interested in movement or physical training. This could be a sign that he is in pain or feel discomfort due to lameness.
He may be breathing more heavily than usual and sweating more profusely than normal after a training session. This could be because he has to work much harder during training due to lameness.
 Your horse may also isolate himself from the other horses as part of his reaction to being in pain. You may try to bring him back to the herd and see if he avoids interaction with the other horses. This could be a sign that he is uncomfortable and needs medical care.You may observe that your horse is also more aggressive towards other trainers or people in his area or space. This could be because he is experiencing pain and does not want to be around others.
 You should pay attention to how often your horse feeds. A horse that is lame may have a poor appetite and be less enthusiastic about eating. He may also have a change in work ethic, where he is less excited about exercising and doing physical training.You may also notice that your horse is lying down more often than usual. This could be due to foot pain or lameness. He may be trying to stay off his feet to avoid being in pain.
If your horse refuses normal commands (like to go over jumps or pick up certain canter leads), this can indicate he is in pain and doesn’t want to do something that will hurt.

 You take your pets and fight against other animals in unique settings. For every battle you win you'll earn at least 5k gold but the rewards go all the way up to 1 billion gold and you may also get special chance items which can sell for a lot on the market unopened but the items they produce may sometimes be worth even more. You also get gold for level up your pets and selling items used only in the game like health and damage potions can also get you a lot of gold fast so don't be afraid to spend a while playing this game to really make some gold all for free unless you choose to spend money on it

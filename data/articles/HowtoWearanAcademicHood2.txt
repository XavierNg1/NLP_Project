 Your superiors, professors, and school heads will award you with your achievement by placing your earned academic hood on you during the ceremony.


At some universities, you will not need to carry your hood with you. Instead, you will be expected to drop off your hood ahead of time. Follow your university's commencement instructions closely., You’ll want your hood folded in half with the turned-out velvet lining fully visible. The velvet strip should be at the front of your arm, facing outward. The narrow, or neck, end should be facing out from your body.If the hood includes a button and cord, such as for the satin lining, be sure these are unfastened. Your professor will secure them for you during the ceremony.
 You’ll need to check on your program’s policies to be sure you use the correct arm. Most will require you to use to the arm closest to the adorner and furthest from the audience, usually the left. Some university ceremonies, however, may want you to drape your hood over the right arm., Your hat can get in the way of the hooding ceremony. Remove it and then turn your back to the adorner. This will allow your adorner to smoothly affix the hood to your robes.
 Your adorner will lift the hood over your head and place it on your shoulders. They will then align the cord with your neck. Your adorner will place the velvet lining along your shoulders so the hood flows smoothly down your back and turn the bottom half of the hood out so the satin lining shows. Finally, the adorner will fasten the cord across the middle of the hood to secure the fold.

 Get to know the species and study there bones. Draw them,take pictures of them and really get to know the species through online research. You could even make a power point and show it to your friends at your Dino party!;
, Some suggestions:


Harry and His Bucketful of Dinosaurs
A Dinosaur Named Sue
How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?
Jurassic Park
The Lost World
Journey to the Center of the Earth

, Most people love Jurassic Park, but branch out and try some weird science fiction dinosaur movies. Prepare some dinosaur snacks, like sandwiches cut into to dino shapes and dino shaped cookies too. Try icing cakes to look scaly or even try dino shaped ham which is available in most English supermarkets. Now all you need is some friends, dino movies and of course, popcorn!

,


It might be difficult but you could build a float dedicated to dinosaurs and parade it up and down your street!







, Invite all your friends around and ask them to dress as dinosaurs, whichever one they like. Decorate the room with banners, flags, balloons and scene setters, all with a brown and green dino theme.

Try similar snacks that you had for your movie marathon. Maybe try chicken wings and brand them as pterodactyl wings, try dino nuggets and cupcakes decorated with green and brown icing, you could even order (or if you're feeling brave bake) a dinosaur cake and use it as a center piece.If you are having a kids party try games like pin the tail on the stegosaurus.
At the end of the party give out a trophy and small dino themed prize to the winner of a best costume competition (mention on invites) extra points for home made.

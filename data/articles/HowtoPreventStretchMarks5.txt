 Exercise has a host of benefits for pregnant women, including mood enhancement, stress relief, relief from discomforts like backaches, weight control, and the promotion of healthy skin and the possible avoidance of stretch marks. Safe, moderate exercise at least three times per week is recommended.Follow your doctorâ€™s advice if he or she gives you different recommendations for exercise, or instructs to you avoid strenuous physical activity during pregnancy.
You can exercise at approximately your pre-pregnancy level, but don't overdo it. Your heart rate should stay without about 70 percent of your target rate (220 minus your current age).
Try moderate activities such as swimming, brisk walking, stationary cycling, yoga, and aerobics.
Avoid exercises which can cause injury, including: horseback riding, contact sports (football, basketball, etc.), hopping, jumping, skipping, bouncing, or running, and sit-ups.
 You can prevent discomfort and possible health problems by avoiding exercise in hot and humid weather. You should also avoid hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms. When exercising during pregnancy, you should be able to breathe normally.
 Loose-fitting comfortable clothes, and a good support bra are recommended for exercise. Footwear should be appropriate to your exercise, but must always be comfortable and good-fitting.
 Warm up and stretch for five minutes before beginning exercise. Then try cardio/aerobic activity for about 15 minutes, followed by 5 to 10 minutes of less strenuous exercise. End by stretching again.


Do not exercise for more than 45 minutes at a time.Make sure to drink water before, during and after your exercise routine, and wait at least an hour after eating to engage in exercise.
Stop exercising if you feel pain, dizziness, suddenly cold, changes in your heartbeat, or anything else unusual. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.

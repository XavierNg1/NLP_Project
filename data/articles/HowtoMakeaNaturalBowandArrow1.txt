 It would be best to cut a branch directly off of a tree but wood can be sourced elsewhere as well. The ideal branch would be flexible, snap right back into place when bent and also have a slight natural curve.


Be sure you are allowed to use the wood you are taking. Your neighbors may not like you cutting their trees and some trees in local parks or forests may be sensitive or endangered.;
, Remove all extra twigs, though you may want to leave a short one in the middle of the bow to use as a guide for the arrow. Remove the bark in order to make the bow easier to hold and the arrow easier to loose.
 Ideal string will be about six inches shorter than the bow itself. Thinner, stronger string is best.
 Find a stick that is thin, light weight, and strong. This will help ensure that the arrow flies fast and straight.

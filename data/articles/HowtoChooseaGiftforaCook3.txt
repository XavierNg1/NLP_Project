 Once you have an idea of the things that you want to get the cook, write or type down a list so that you can organize your thoughts. Do research on each gift and determine what falls within your budget. Try to stay within an appropriate price range depending on your relationship with the cook. For instance, if they are in your immediate family or a significant other, you may want to spend more money than if the cook was an acquaintance.
 Talk to people that are close to the cook and ask them what they are getting. Avoid duplicating gifts or getting them a different version of the same gift. Aim to get something unique and meaningful. Think of things that you've talked about and purchase something that can relate to your experiences.
 If you purchase your gift online, you'll want to make sure that you give your order enough time to ship and arrive at your house. Beware of the holiday season, as often things can sell out or get delayed. Give yourself ample time before you give the gift to compensate for any unexpected delays.


The average order to delivery time during the holidays is 6.7 days., Look online for physical store locations if you don't want to order the gift online or don't have enough time to wait for shipping. If you already have an idea of what kind of gift you want to get, give the store a call to make sure that they have the product in stock.
 When you purchase the gift, ask that you receive a gift receipt. A gift receipt will not display the price of the gift but will enable the receiver to return it. A gift receipt a great insurance plan in case they already have what you've gotten them or someone gets them the same gift.


Ask the cashier by saying, "This is a gift for someone. Do you mind printing out a gift receipt?"

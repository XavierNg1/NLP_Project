 Make an outline on a piece of butcher paper and arrange your tiles on a flat surface. This will allow you to visualize how they will lay on your wall. Some stick-on tiles will be smaller, brick-sized tiles while others will be sheets. If they are brick sized, stagger them when you line them up on your butcher paper.
 Dip a large flat brush into an oil based primer. The primer will prepare the surface of your wall so that the adhesive will stick to it better. If you don't prime the wall, you'll likely have to add additional adhesive to the back of your tiles to ensure that they stick for the long run., Remove the white film on the back of the stick-on tiles to reveal the adhesive. This adhesive is usually incredibly strong so be careful when laying them onto your wall. If you need to reposition them, make sure to do so before the adhesive fully sets.Removing the clear plastic film before placing the tiles makes it easier to remove.

 These will serve as the guidelines for your drawing. Most of the shapes are fairly irregular, but you should be able to draw them with little difficulty by looking at the image to the right.;
, Add Donald's eyeballs, tongue, and hat (which is like a French beret with a tassel coming off of it).
 Give Donald his sailor suit, with a stripe on the shoulder and a full bow-tie. Make sure his collar encases his neck and don't forget to tuck his arms behind his back!

, Do so by putting both an oval shape and some curves and jagged shapes to draw attention to this lower portion.
 The back one should only be visible as a wide, webbed foot, while the leg in front extends from the body, bends at the knee, and ends in the same kind of webbed foot.
 His feathers are white and his sailor suit/hat combination is a deep blue, complementing his red bow-tie so as to look very patriotic. Make his bill and legs approximately the same yellow-orange color, and his eyes a very light blue.

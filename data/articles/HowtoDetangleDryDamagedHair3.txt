 Don’t use a brush, as brushes can make tangles worse. This method is best for long hair with only minor tangles. If you can’t run a comb through your hair at all, try one of the other methods instead.
 Separate your hair out into back, right, and left. Hold each section in place with a large hair clip. This step is to make your hair easier to handle. If yours is short enough, you can skip this step.
 You can use either plain water or a specialty detangling spray. As with most of the products recommended here, what you pick is dependent upon your hair type. In general, curly and coily hair benefit most from detanglers, while plain water often works for straight and wavy hair.
 Slowly and gently comb your hair in sections, moving from tips to roots. Continue combing until your hair is completely untangled. If you find this step difficult, you may need to wet your hair a bit more. Just make sure it isn’t completely soaked!








, If your hair is straight, don’t let the previous sections completely dry while clipped. This could result in a chaotic, messy look. Simply remoisten as necessary to prevent drying.
 Allow your hair to air-dry. Remember that blow-drying can dry out your hair too much and lead to further damage. Avoid having to repeat the detangling!

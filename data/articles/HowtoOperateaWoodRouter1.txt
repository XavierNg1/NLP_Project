The most common wood router is a mid-size router that varies from 1.5 to 2.5 horsepower and comes either with a fixed or plunge base. This size router is used for a variety of tasks, including the trimming of laminates, routing of molding and the cutting of dadoes and rabbit joints. It usually comes with a .5-inch (12.7 mm) collet with a .25-inch (6.35 mm) adapter collet. You may also find European routers with a collett of 3/8-inch (8 mm).
Next is the trim or palm router. It rarely comes with anything other than a fixed-router base. It can be gripped in the palm of your hand and operated with one hand due to its size and can be used for laminate trimming; light edging, such as rounding over an edge; and to cut small dadoes and rabbits.
The heaviest and largest of the three types are the 2.5 to 3.5 horsepower routers. These routers come with a fixed base and are usually found in professional woodworking shops. They are also often found bolted under a router table and used in molding and trim work or dealing with hardwoods.;

 You want to find outfits that are cute and comfortable. You'll need a good mix of clothes, because you don't want to wear the same thing more than one time a week. If you wear a uniform, make sure your outfits are in good condition. Since you'll be wearing them a lot, you want them to fit well and not have any rips or stains.;
, Accessories add personality to any outfit, especially a school uniform. Get some earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and rings. You could also get some cute scarves and belts.
 When school starts, you'll want to have plenty of fresh makeup. During the summer, you can experiment with different types of makeup to figure out what style you like best. For school, you'll want a natural, polished look.
 Do you like to wear it straight, or curly? Do you want to wear it down, or pulled back? Don't think that you have to wear your hair the same way you wore it last year. If you've been thinking about getting a new haircut or getting highlights, go for it! Also, learn a new way to braid or pull back your hair. When school comes around, you can wear a different style every day! Remember, hair accessories such as clips and headbands can help you look great without much effort.
 This doesn't necessarily mean lose weight. If you actually are overweight, the summer is a great time to start exercising and eating well. But if you are already at a healthy weight, you don't need to lose any more. If you simply eat healthy foods and exercise for sixty minutes a day, you can replace body fat with muscle, making you stronger.
 You might want to get them whitened before school starts to brighten your smile. Make sure to brush at least twice a day, and floss at least once a day.
 You don't want to start to year with oily, broken out skin. Wash your face when you get up and before you go to bed. Use a mild cleansing soap.

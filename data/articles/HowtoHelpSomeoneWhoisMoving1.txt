 Talk to the person moving about the logistics of the move.


Find out if this is a long distance move or just around the corner. Ask if there will be professional movers involved, or volunteers only. Take a look at what kind of items will be moved.;
, You might agree to help thinking that you'll just drive the truck when your friend is expecting you'll be there at 6:00 a.m. to help load.


Discuss what is reasonable. Do not make promises that you cannot keep.
 If you are petite and your friend has a grand piano to relocate, you will not be much help with that piano. However, you could offer to make sandwiches for the moving crew.


Explain your skills and talents to your friend so he or she knows how you can be counted on.
 If you are unable to help on the move day, try to help your friend get organized.


Collect boxes, packing tape, bubble wrap and other necessary moving items.
Go through clothing, furniture, appliances, books and other personal belongings to determine what will be moved and what can be sold or donated.
Start packing the things that will not be immediately needed. You can pack up off season clothing and shoes, picture frames and wall hangings and other items that will not be used before the move date.
 If your friend wants to sell a lot of stuff before the move, take charge of that process so he or she can concentrate on the move itself.
 Help someone who is moving by going over to the new home to clean before the moving commences.

 If your jar used to contain food or other perishable items, be sure to thoroughly scrub the inside with soap and water to avoid bacterial or mold growth. Any residual odors can be removed by using baking soda and vinegar.Some odors, like sauerkraut or coffee, are more stubborn. If baking soda and vinegar did not work, you can also use soapy water combined with coarse sea salt to absorb the odor. Shake the jar vigorously for 30 seconds to abrasively clean the inside of the jar, then rinse and let the jar dry.;
, Most labels should be removable by using a combination of water and white vinegar or washing soda. Fill your sink or a tub with the solution and submerge the jar for around 10 minutes. Some labels can take up to half an hour, but feel free to check before then. Use a sponge or steel wool to scrub off any remaining adhesive.You can also use nail polish remover or mineral spirits to remove residue from particularly stubborn labels.
Another method for removing labels is to use a hair dryer and melt the adhesive behind the label with prolonged heat. This method has mixed results, however, and will only work on glass jars. This method is unsuitable for plastic containers as they would melt under the heat. , Future decorations like paint, tape, or glue have limited effectiveness when applied to a wet surface. You can either dry the jar with a towel or let it air dry in sunlight or overnight. If you choose to use a towel, pay special attention to the threads at the top where water is most likely to remain.


Drying a jar in sunlight has the added bonus of potentially removing any leftover odor that you missed.

 It’s important to remember that cleaning a softball bat before tournaments or games is not ideal for the player.


The ball will slip easier off of the barrel of the bat which can cause foul balls, ground balls, and even pop flies.
In order to avoid such problems, it’s a good idea to make sure to let the bat dry for 36 hours before using it in any games or tournaments.
 The initial care before even attempting to clean your bat is very important.


Banging your bat against your cleats or using any ball other than a baseball/softball (such as the ones used in practice) can degrade the quality of your bat's finish which can in turn cause long-term problems.It is also best to turn the bat a few centimeters after every hit when playing a game as this ensures you are not constantly wearing down one part of the bat.
Try not to hit waterlogged balls, and don't use rubber cage balls. Avoid using fast-pitch softball bats in extreme heat, as they may dent more easily.

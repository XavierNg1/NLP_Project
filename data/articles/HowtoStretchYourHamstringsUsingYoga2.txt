 Make some room to practice this stretch in your living room, yoga studio, or anyplace with enough floor space and a clear wall. The extended hand-to-big-toe pose offers a great hamstring stretch and can be easily modified if you have tight hamstrings. It is similar to the regular hand-to-big-toe pose but involves an additional element of balance. You can do the pose in the middle of a room or you can practice it beside a wall while you work on your balance.
 Using your left hand, place your hand on the side of your hip with an open palm. Hold your hip firmly but not too tight. You can have your knees slightly bent but keep your spine perfectly straight. Relax and take a few deep breathes.
 Bring up your right leg and grab your knee or your big toe with your middle and index fingers. If you like, you can use a strap to hold your foot. It is important to allow your breath to take the lead in this pose, so that the upward movement of your right leg is slow and in tune with your in-breath.
 Push forward with the ball of your foot onto your hand or a strap. It is important to keep your abdominal muscles engaged, your spine straight, and left knee slightly bent while you are pushing forward with the ball of your right foot. Breathe deeply into the pose.


If you have tight hamstrings, try modifying this pose by keeping your knees slightly bent throughout the stretch., While extending your right leg, you should exhale. If you have tight hamstrings, keep your knee slightly bent.


If you are having a hard time balancing, you can do the pose beside a wall and hold the wall with your left hand. Try not to lean into the wall too heavily., Finally, gradually let it down to the ground.Repeat the pose on the other side to stretch both hamstrings.

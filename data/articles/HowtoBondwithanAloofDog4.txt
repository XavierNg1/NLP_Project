 If your dog doesn't warm up to you or doesn't get excited around you, you may consider taking them to the vet. There may be an underlying medical problem that is causing them to feel bad or be lethargic.Some medical conditions can cause fatigue, depression, or overall lack of exuberance.
 Another reason your dog may be aloof is because they have had a bad experience with you. Figure out if you have punished your dog when you have come home or when the dog has approached you.If you believe this is a reason for your dog to be aloof, you should work on providing your dog with more positive associations with you. For example, after you come home, give your dog love, take them for a walk, or play with them. When the dog comes when you call them, give them a treat.
 If your dog remains aloof, try to make every experience positive. This includes things your dog may hate, like a bath. When you need to do something your dog may not like, try to use positive reinforcement to make it more pleasant for your dog and form a bond with them.For example, you may get bath toys for or give treats to your dog to help make it a better experience. This may have to be done gradually as you help train your dog to associate positive ideas with the unwelcome activity.

 If you plan to have more children, you may decide to keep your clothing and equipment for the future. Even if you do not have more children, you can save certain items for your future grandchildren – particularly special articles of clothing, like christening gowns, and favorite toys and blankets.;
, If you plan to have more children, it might be worthwhile to store larger items like cribs, highchairs, strollers, and infant furniture. If you have room in your house or garage, that’s great; if not, consider renting a small storage unit.
 Wash each article of clothing before storing, and then fold it neatly and sort it into a plastic tub or cardboard box, organizing by size and (if applicable) season.
 These items can carry bacteria, so it’s important to clean them thoroughly before storing.


Keep in mind that before you use these items again, you will have to inspect them carefully. Rubber can rot over time, and these items don’t always hold up in storage.

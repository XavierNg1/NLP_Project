 Find a container large enough to hold your cookware. Fill it 3/4 of the way with a solution of half vinegar, half water.
 Allow it to sit for three to four hours, checking it's progress along the way. The vinegar should dissolve the rust.









If the rust isn't fully dissolved after four hours, remove the cookware from the solution and use a nonmetal brush to brush off the remaining rust.
Don't leave the cookware in the solution for more than four hours, as it will start causing the metal to degrade.
 To make sure it's completely dry, heat it through on the stove, or bake it in the oven for a few minutes.
 Dab a paper towel in olive, grapeseed or canola oil and rub it over the cast iron before storing.
 Since you burned off the protective layer of seasoning, you'll have to re-season the cast iron before using it again. Otherwise, it won't provide a nonstick cooking surface, and it may begin to rust.









Coat the cookware in olive oil and bake in a 350-degree oven for one hour. You'll have to cook with the cast iron several times before it's fully seasoned, but this method will start the process.
Stores that sell cast iron usually carry seasoning products to apply to your cookware. Try one of these if you'd prefer not to season your cast iron yourself.

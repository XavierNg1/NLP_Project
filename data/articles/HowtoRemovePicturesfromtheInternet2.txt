 Websites usually has an “About” or “Contact Us” page that contains the contact information that you may use to reach either the site owners or moderators/administrators.
 Once you get hold of the administrator or site owner, notify them of the picture you want to be deleted. If you’re communicating through email, provide the URL of the image you copied earlier to help them identify the specific photo you want to be removed.
 If the site administrators find your request to be valid, the pictures will be taken down and permanently removed from the Internet.

,, You don't want them so close that they could get tangled up with each other in mid-turn, but you want them far enough apart for stability. The right width is important in making banked turns without your knees colliding.
 Focus on putting you weight on the ball of your foot just behind your big toe and on your inside arch, at the same time as you press your shin forward gently on the cuff of the boot. As you start to turn, push your inside ski slightly forward (and lift that inside knee slightly, which will commit your weight to the inside of the turn) and let your hips fall in and forward toward the inside of the turn. Keep forward pressure on that forward inside edge of the outside ski until the turn comes all the way around. Make sure that no matter how sharp your turn is that your upper body remains parallel to the hill. (Not tipping your shoulders)

, Commit to the turn! Do not exit the turn too early (which would be when you are accelerating straight downhill -- trust that your forward and inward pressure will bring that ski around). Remember: finish the turn skiing perpendicular to (across) the slope before going on to the next turn.
 Then repeat, going the other direction into the next turn.
, With shape skis, as you get more proficient, you can learn to keep more weight on your inside ski, carving that ski in the same fashion as the outside ski (except on the inside ski you have to weight the 'outside' of the ball of your foot inside the boot).

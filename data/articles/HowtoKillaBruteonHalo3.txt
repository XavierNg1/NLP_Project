 They are extremely powerful at close to medium ranges and quite often throw grenades and flares to kill you. The higher-level brutes may also carry gravity hammers or plasma cannons and their spikers are good at close range attacks, so keep your distance at all costs. Their berserk power also makes them formidable at close range.;
, A battle rifle or a few grenades should do the trick, but try not to enter into a group of them with a brute as you will likely get swarmed. It goes without saying that you should never charge into a full group of brutes either!

, This will, at least, remove this armour. Unless they are in a tight group however, you may find it hard to stick one on its own.
 The head is the easiest way to kill a brute, either with a sniper or beam rifle or with a carbine or battle rifle. It may take a few shots to first remove their armour, but it is far quicker via the head than the body.
 This will be most effective if the brute is alone and not aware of you, as it will remove their armour and open them up for a second attack.
 Most brutes won't follow you too far (unless it's a high-level brute, often with gravity hammer) so take the time to restock on ammunition and wait for any equipment they've deployed to dissipate (such as bubble shields or regenerators). Make sure you retreat well away from their grenade throwing range as this is their most deadly aspect.

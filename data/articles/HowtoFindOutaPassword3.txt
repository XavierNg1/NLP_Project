 You can do this by typing "Password Manager" into the computer's search bar (or Finder app). Password managers store and apply commonly-used passwords for the appropriate services (e.g., Facebook or Google). Common password managers include the following:


Keychain
Google Smart Lock
Stored browser information

, In most cases, this will be password-protected. If you know the password, you can easily view and apply any saved passwords to their appropriate services.


If you don't know the password, you'll have to rely on autofill data for the website or program you're attempting to log into.
 If the account you're trying to access has a saved password associated with it in your selected browser (or program), it may automatically enter the password for you once the username is entered.


Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox both do this if the user has the cookies and autofill features enabled.
If the account holder's computer is a Mac and you have their Keychain password, you may be able to use Keychain to access their stored passwords by navigating to Keychain Access (it should be in the Mac's Utilities folder), opening the "Passwords" tab on the left side of the screen, and selecting the pertinent password. After entering your Keychain password, you'll have the option to display the password in plain text.

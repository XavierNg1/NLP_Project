 Citing the premier leaders in your academic field is a great way to get noticed by them. Cite anyone who has been influential in your work, in order to create a connection.
 Include a handwritten note telling them how valuable you have found their research.
 Get in touch with people you have cited to encourage discussion about your work. Ask for their valuable advice as a junior person in the field.


Although this will not work with every occurrence, flattery can help to start a relationship. Ultimately, it is your goal to foster a relationship with premier academics in your field.
 Add a link on your personal website, faculty website, guest blog posts, author bios and at the end of your emails. The more people who read your work, the more likely you are to make a connection.
 Send them a copy with an email or hand written note saying that you value their opinion and you hope they will consider adding a review post to their blog.
 This will depend on the policies of the journal; however, it never hurts to ask. Ask if you can post a copy on your blog or on your institution's website.
 This website is a combination of social media and scholarly research. Once a journal is listed, it will be in a database that helps students cite scholarly work.

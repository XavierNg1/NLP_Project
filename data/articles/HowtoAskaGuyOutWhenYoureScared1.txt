 If you are too afraid to ask your crush out in person, then you can do so electronically. If you have their number, call or text them and see if they’d like to go out. You can even DM or email them if you have his email address or social media information.


You can say something like “Hey Trevor, how are you? I was wondering if you would like to go out with me on Saturday night?”
If you are nervous about his response, go and do something else like watch a show for 30 minutes or so to calm down, and then check your phone.;
, If you prefer not to ask via text, practice asking him out in the mirror to build your confidence up. When you do so, think about how you look and what your gestures or facial expressions are conveying. If they express nervousness, then keep practicing until they don’t., Put together an empowering playlist of your favorite songs. Listen to them that morning while you’re getting dressed, in your car on the way to work or school, and whenever you have some free time during the day before you see him. This will also put you in a good mood, which will make the ask easier and more enjoyable.

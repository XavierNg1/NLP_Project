Take accurate measurements of the length and width of the area to be landscaped.
Make notes of areas that receive shade and sunlight to determine the appropriate types of plants needed for the job.;
,


Make a rough sketch of the area to be landscaped.
Make labels for each type of plant used and the dimensions of the area.


Use the measurements of the area and multiply the length times the width either in feet or meters.






If you are working in feet, multiply by 0.166 (giving you 2 inches depth of mulch). Multiply by 0.0508 if using meters.






Divide the answer in feet by 27 to convert cubic feet to yards (the unit in which mulch is sold). No division is required if using meters, because mulch is typically sold in cubic meters.






Multiply your total by the cost of each cubic yard or meter of mulch to determine how much the mulch will cost.


Tally the type and amount of each plant used in the landscaping project.
Multiply the cost of the plants by the number of plants you'll need.

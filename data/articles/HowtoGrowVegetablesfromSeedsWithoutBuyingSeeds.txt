The pulp should float, and can be discarded.

Flip the seeds over to make sure they dry evenly and don't stick.
, Make sure you don't fill too much.
 Depending on container size you might be able to fit more or less. If you can fit 5 pots but they are really squished together, it will be better to have 4. Try not to cram all the pots in.
 If the seeds are small, leave them uncovered.
 The soil should be moist but not really wet. Check with your finger. And always spray the soil with water if the soil is dry.
 Don't give up if your seed doesn't sprout in 5 days or less. Each and every seed germinates at different times, meaning tomato seeds will sprout after 7/10 days, or like basil will sprout after 3/4 days.
 After the seeds have sprouted into seedlings, it is important to wait for them to be strong enough to be moved out of the container. Seedlings are ready to be moved once a 2nd set of leaves appear. Even then watch and wait for them to be bigger and leafier. You can do a test by leaving the container lid open, so the humidity diminishes and see if the seedlings do well. If not quickly put on the lid and they will recover.

 You need to get your name out there, and you’re a one-person marketing department so be prepared to work for it. Here are some ways to spread your name and get recognition:Network. Go to industry events and make yourself visible. Engage in conversations and make contacts.
Cold calling. It’s not everyone’s favorite thing to do, but business won’t just walk up to you and hand you money. Hit the phones and try to drum up some business.
Public speaking. Offer to speak at events on topics you have expertise in. This visibility and demonstration of knowledge will be very attractive to prospective clients.
 Writing a book, article, editorial piece, or even maintaining a blog can get you recognition as a noted authority in your field.
 You’ve probably made some contacts in your career thus far; don’t be afraid to ask them to put you in contact with people they may know.
 Don’t be afraid to use a referral from a satisfied customer to help get your name out there.


Ask for their permission before using their name.
See if they’ll give you a quote in writing that you could use in an ad or on your website.

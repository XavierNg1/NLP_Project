 Add the water and stir to make a smooth thick batter. Put aside to prove for 45 to 60 minutes or until doubled in volume.;
, Heat honey, lemon juice and rosewater together and bring to a gentle simmer. Add fruit and optional extras as desired and allow to cool. Ideally be selective with your optional extras, to ensure the flavours are compatible.
 Ideally the oil level should be no higher than 2/3rds of the volume of the pan.
 Scoop the batter carefully from the sides of the bowl to ensure maximum lightness. Do not overcrowd the pan as they will expand. Keep turning the loukoumades to ensure they brown evenly.
 Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on some paper towel. Keep them warm as you cook the next batch.
 Ideally 4 each is a decent serve, may also be served hot with the syrup and vanilla bean ice cream.

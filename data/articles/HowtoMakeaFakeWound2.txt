 For this method, you need Vaseline, eyeshadow, lip gloss or lipstick, makeup brush, and a toothpick.


You want to get eyeshadow with colors that include dark blue, light blue, light brown, dark brown, red, dark pink/peach and yellow.
Dark red lip gloss or lipstick works well for the blood. Lip gloss will give your wound a shinier, more fluid look than lipstick. Lipstick will work perfectly as dried blood.
You can also use fake blood at the end to add an extra touch.
 The thicker the layer, the more swollen the wound will look.


Blend out the edges so that it looks less like a clot of Vaseline and more natural.






This method with Vaseline is better for smaller wounds around your hands or arms.
 Use your toothpick to trace your wound in the Vaseline.


If you wish for your wound to look as if you were stabbed by something, make the line a little uneven but keep it relatively thin.






If you’re going for a larger cut or gash, carve a larger area that’s a bit wider.
 Let the Vaseline dry a bit so that you don’t blend it too much with your eyeshadow. Then with an eyeshadow applicator or brush begin adding the eyeshadow.


Use a darker shade of brown or gray in the center to add depth.






At the edges, use a light pink/peach tone to blend the edges of the wound to your actual skin tone.






Use the red eyeshadow between the pink/peach and the brown to make part of the wound look fresher.






You can also use the blue and/or yellow eyeshadow around the wound to create a more beaten up look. Blues, yellows, greens, and purples will give your wound a bruised component.






Make sure the eyeshadow is blended well, so there are no unnaturally straight edges.
 Apply the gloss or lipstick to the middle of the wound to give it a freshly cut look.


Lipstick will give your wound more of a dried up look than lip gloss.






Drip the fake blood in the center of the wound and let it pool or run to complete your wound.

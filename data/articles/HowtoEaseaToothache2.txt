 This is really the most important step to keeping your teeth healthy and pain-free. If you don't clean your teeth every day, and floss, the plaque and bacteria will build up and cause problems like cavities and infections.








The saying goes "only floss the teeth you want to keep." Flossing really does work to keep your teeth healthy and free of bacteria-causing factors. Make sure that you floss at least once a day.
Brush at least twice a day, 30 minutes before or after meals. Too soon before or after a meal and you can damage the enamel on your teeth as you will brush with the acids formed immediately after the meal, which will cause abrasion of the enamel.
 You can find fluoride in lots of natural things, like water sources or certain vegetables. Check and see if your tap water is fluoridated. If not, talk to your dentist about options for getting more fluoride.









Since a high concentration of fluoride can be toxic, the best way to use fluoride is to apply fluoride gels on your teeth for three minutes and then rinse with water.
Most toothpaste has fluoride as the active ingredient, but check to make sure that you're getting the right toothpaste.
 What you eat makes a huge difference in how healthy your teeth are. Not only that, but certain foods are harder to get off of or out of the areas between your teeth. Pay attention to what you eat so that your teeth will be happier.









Avoid sugars and starches as much as possible. These two substances feed bacteria, especially sugar.
If you're going to eat food that gets stuck between your teeth make sure that you have floss or a toothpick on hand.
End your meals with a salad or an apple because these can act as a natural toothbrush.
 This is actually really important and a lot of people skip out on getting checked over. A dentist will catch early cavities and problems with your teeth so they don't develop into bigger issues.

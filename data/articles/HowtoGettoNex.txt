 Nex is locked away in the Ancient Prison at the south part of the Dungeon. After entering the main level of the dungeon, you’ll face four different armies that serve each of the four major gods: Armadyl, Bandos, Saradomin, and Zamorak.
 Upon defeat, each of the four armies drops a piece of key that make up a frozen key, which unlocks the door to the Ancient Prison. To defeat the armies, you must have at least 70 skill points in Agility, Constitution, Ranged, and Strength., Key pieces are dropped by combatants outside boss rooms., The frozen key has a total of 10 charges, and uses one charge each time you enter the prison., The door to the Ancient Prison will open, and one charge will be subtracted from the frozen key. An empty room lies on the other side of the door.,, Beyond the safe room is another room that contains Nex’s army of dangerous monsters, including soldiers, blood reavers, ancient warriors, ancient mages, and ancient rangers., The Shard of Zaros is obtained after completing an earlier quest called “Fate of the Gods,” and prevents aggression from all monsters in God Wars Dungeon, including Zarosian followers.Wear a full set of Ancient ceremonial robes if you don’t have the Shard of Zaros. These robes allow you to pass through the Ancient Prison without being harmed, and are dropped by ancient mages and monsters located throughout God Wars Dungeon., Behind this door are 40 Zarosian followers., The next room is a safe room featuring the spirit of Ashuelot Reis, and a magical barrier that keeps Nex sealed in the room to the east., This prevents you from having to recollect four pieces of the key and Ancient robes if defeated by Nex., If fighting Nex in single-player mode, try bringing a shield to counter Nex’s ice attacks. If fighting Nex with other players, gear up with Ganodermic armour and Chaotic weaponry., The only ways to leave Nex’s room are to die, or teleport from the room using resources such as spells, enchanted jewelry, or teleport scrolls., The magical barrier will fall away, and Nex will be ready for battle.

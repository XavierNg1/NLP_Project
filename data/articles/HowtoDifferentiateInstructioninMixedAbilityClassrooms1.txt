 Look up state and national requirements for the curriculum you are teaching and identify the skills that your students should master. Keeping student assessment levels in mind, assign projects that use different skills and mediums (e.g. research papers, oral reports, slideshow presentations) to keep kids with different learning styles interested and engaged. Give students the option to add content and resources to their studies to enhance their learning.For instance, identify some current pop culture narratives that reflect one of the main themes in your course (e.g. Twitter and other social media with regards to the study of rhetoric) and encourage students to observe them mindfully to add context to their lessons.;
, To differentiate learning with regard to procedure, try alternating the process of how students learn. Learning styles and preference vary greatly, and a fresh take on old course material can reinvigorate a student's desire and aptitude to learn. For instance, cover one chapter of a textbook by lecturing on the topic, then cover the next chapter by initiating a group discussion about the assigned reading.As another example, if you are teaching 20th century history, lecture one day, then have students visit online archives to look for relevant pictures and documents the next day. To further engage creative students, have them write a fictional story about the historical period covered in that week's lesson using accurate historical information.

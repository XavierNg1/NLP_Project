 You never want to get onto a motorcycle without the proper gear. This includes a thick motorcycle helmet, leather gloves, jeans or leather pants, and a strong leather jacket. You also want some strong boots, preferable leather, with some proper grip. When you're first getting started, it's also not a bad idea to wear elbow, ankle or knee guards, as you'll be going down a lot., Remember that learning this will take you quite some time, and you'll probably take a couple bad spills. You don't want to harm any pedestrians around you or crash your bike into any cars, either mobile or parked. Your constant attempts are also going to make a lot of noise, so you don't want to disrupt those around you.


It's illegal to wheelie on a street bike, so finding a secluded place to practice will also help you evade any trouble from law enforcement.
 If you're attempting to learn the power wheelie on a sport bike, you'll probably want a 500 cc motorcycle, at the minimum. You'll be lifting the front wheel solely with your acceleration, so you want to make sure that your bike has the power to pull that off.


You can also learn the power wheelie on a dirtbike. If you have access to one or want something a little more comfortable, this could be a smart idea. A 100 or 150 cc bike should have enough power to practice this stunt.
 You don't want any wobbling on that end. It's also ideal to run your tire pressure a little bit lower than you might normally, as it will make the wheelie more stable.
 This sensor might cause your bike to shut off if you tip too far backward. You will be tipping backward, and because you're just learning, may tip even further back than totally comfortable. Make sure your bike doesn't give out on you mid-wheelie by removing this sensor.


Your back exhaust may also hit the ground, depending on where it's located on your bike, so make sure that it won't tap the ground while you're on one wheel. If it does, you may grind the road and fall off of the bike.

 In order to use the Samsung Find My Mobile service, you will need to have your Samsung account linked with your phone. You can do this by opening the Settings menu, selecting "Accounts and sync", tapping "Add account", and then tapping "Samsung account". You will be prompted to enter your Samsung login information, or you can create a new account.
 This needs to be enabled in order to use the Find My Mobile service. When you register a Samsung account on your phone it is enabled by default. You can check to ensure it is turned on by opening the Settings menu, tapping "Location and security", and then checking the "Remote controls" box.
 This can be accessed through the Samsung website. You will be asked to log in with your Samsung account. Make sure that it is the same account that is associated with lost phone.
 Click the "Locate my device" button in the left menu. A map will open, showing the last known location of your phone.
 You can use the left menu to choose from a variety of actions to perform on your lost phone:


Lock my mobile - This will enable you to enter a new code to lock your phone. You can also display a message and phone number that people can call if they find your phone.
Ring my mobile - This will make your phone ring, making it easier to find if it is lost nearby.
Call logs - You can check all of your recent calls using this option. This will let you know if other people have been using your device without your permission.
Wipe my device - This will erase all of the data on your phone if it is completely lost or stolen. Be careful when selecting this option, as it is irreversible. You can choose to just erase the media storage, or completely wipe the phone to factory settings.

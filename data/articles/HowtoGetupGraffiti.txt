 Your name is very important and can sometimes go hand in hand with the type of graffiti you are doing, such as poster child as a wheatpaste artist (that name is taken).


Many traditional artists use what is called a "Blackbook", which is a sketchbook for graffiti artists, usually black hence the name.;
, First you should develop a "Tag" which is a signature used by writers, often dressed up with arrows, quotations, halos, etc. Then you should make a "Throw Up" which is a basic spray painted bubble letter version of your name or phrase. Throw ups are two colors: an outline and fill, most commonly black and white, but any two colors will do.
 As you do this you should mind other peoples work that is better than or equal to our skill level. Try to meet other artist and research in books and internet to gain inspiration.
 Choose what colors match and look good with each other. Also Try to distort your letters and try to develop "Wildstyle". Wildstyle is the very complicated use of letters, the most famous of graffiti. Try to add arrows, layers, backgrounds, create a 3D illusion, and use lighting effects such as shine and shadow.

 If you don't receive the title, contact your local government branch that handles creating a lost title report.
 This includes making all necessary repairs, and cleaning the inside and outside of the vehicle.
 Consider the year, make, model, mileage and overall condition of the vehicle. Tools for evaluating the worth of vehicles are available on the Internet and in your local library.


Browse your local auto ads and classifieds for vehicles similar to yours to get an idea of what price to list your vehicle.
Increase your selling price by $300 to $500 to provide you with a negotiating edge.
 Methods include advertising in your local newspaper, putting a "for sale" sign on the vehicle, posting information on social networking sites and advertising on online vehicle sales websites.

 Athena is the goddess of wisdom, Zeus has power over the sky, along those lines. You can make it for anything you want. It can be the god of trees, mavericks, or even something as simple as fruit. Dionysus is the god of wine!;
, Depending on what the god is of, one gender is usually more appropriate than another. However, this has varied in different old religions, and don't just make the god/goddess's gender be based on a modern version of what is feminine or masculine. Artemis, for example, was the goddess of hunting and dogs.
 One way to do it is to combine names of already existing gods in mythology. But don't choose a god everyone knows about like Hades, Horus, Venus, etc. You can also just say something random that sounds cool. There are also other methods to name your god.
 And don't be afraid to borrow traits from existing gods. Let's say, for example, we have Aperkses, and he is the god of storms.You can give him the power to shoot lightning bolts like Zeus. If we have a god named Sucuel, the god of darkness, and you like Hades' depression, you can give him that trait if you like. Just make sure you aren't ripping off any gods.
 The appearance should match the god's personality though. If you have a god of fire, you can give him spiky orange hair, (even flaming!) and give him eyes with attitude! But let's say you have a goddess of beauty. Make her exotic and pretty! If you have a goddess of air make her look calm and intelligent, maybe with wings!

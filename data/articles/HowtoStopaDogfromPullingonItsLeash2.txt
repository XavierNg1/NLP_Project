 In order for this method to be effective, you need your dog to respond to the clicker. Every time the dog obeys a command, click the clicker and give your dog a treat.Be consistent with the clicker so that your dog associates the sound with treats.
 On the walk, stay ahead of your dog at all times. This will ensure that the dog learns to follow you rather than the other way around., As the dog catches up to you, click the clicker and drop a treat on the ground before the dog passes you. If the dog does not immediately respond to the clicker, give it a verbal command to stop. If the dog responds, click and drop a treat.If the dog does not stop upon your command, do not give the dog a treat. This will ensure the dog does not associate negative behaviors with treats or the clicker.
 Keep repeating this process on your walk. This exercise will train the dog to pay attention to you. Moreover, it will ensure that it learns to stay next to or behind you when walking on its leash.

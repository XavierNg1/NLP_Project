 Cut a large section of lemon peel. Sprinkle some table salt onto the outer side of the peel.Rub the salted lemon on the stained cup or dish in small circular motions. The acidity of the lemon peel and the abrasiveness of the salt will remove the tea stain.









Apply more salt as needed until the surface is clean.;
, If the lemon peel and salt method doesnâ€™t work, create a baking soda paste. Mix together baking soda with a little bit of water in a small dish.You want the paste to be thick enough that you can rub it onto the stained area with a cloth or paper towel.


Use some pressure to rub the tea stains out of the dish or cup. After a few minutes the stain can be rinsed away., Rinse the dish or cup underneath some water to remove baking soda, lemon and salt flavors.Wash the cup as you normally would with some dish detergent and water.

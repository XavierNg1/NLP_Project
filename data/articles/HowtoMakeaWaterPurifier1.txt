 You will need two 5 gallon (18.9 L) food-grade plastic buckets with lids, and a food grade spigot. You will also need a pair of water filtration elements. These will be the most expensive part of the project.


Make sure that your filter elements are NSF certified.
You will need a drill with 1/2” and 3/4” drill bits.;
, You will be stacking the buckets on top of each other to let gravity pull the water through the filters. Drill two 1/2” holes in the bottom of the upper bucket. These holes should make a line across the diameter of the bucket.


Drill two matching holes into the lid of the bucket that will be underneath. The holes should line up when the buckets are stacked.
 Install the spigot, making sure that it is properly sealed so that no water can escape.
 These are installed into the upper bucket. The nozzle for the filter element secures through the hole drilled into the bottom of the upper bucket. Make sure both filters are securely installed. The nozzles should be protruding from the bottom of the bucket.
 The newly-installed filter element nozzles should fit directly into the holes drilled into the lid of the bottom bucket.


Consider sealing the space between the two buckets if you don’t plan on moving your filtration system often. This will help keep debris from getting in between the buckets and contaminating the clean water supply in the lower container.
 Fill the top bucket with water. It can take a long time for water to start filtering through new filter elements. The process will speed up as they get used more.


Continue adding water to the top bucket to increase the speed of the filtration process. More pressure on the filters makes them work faster.
 As solids build up on the outside of the filters, the filtration process will slow. Clean your filters with a plastic scouring pad to keep them flowing. If the water you want to filter is cloudy, pre-filter it with folded cloth to remove excess debris.

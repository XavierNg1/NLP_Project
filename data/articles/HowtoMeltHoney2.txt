 A thick glass container, like a glass canning jar, is usually a safe choice. Spoon the honey you need to melt into the container.


It is best to check the container to verify that it is microwave-safe before using it. Typically, this information is labeled on the bottom of the container.






Never use a metal container.






Plastic containers are debatable. Many are marked as being microwave-safe, but there is some evidence that chemicals from plastic can leech into the contents of the container when heated.
 Set the power to 50 percent, then microwave the honey for 30 to 40 seconds.


The exact amount of time can vary based on how powerful your microwave is and how much honey you have inside the container.






Keep an eye on the honey as it melts inside the microwave. If it appears fully melted before the full amount of time passes, stop the microwave and remove the container.
 Carefully remove the container of honey from the microwave. Stir the honey with a spoon to distribute the heat. If some of the honey has not yet melted, return the container to the microwave and heat for another 20 seconds at medium power.


Repeat this process as needed. Heat the honey in 20-second intervals at 50-percent power, stirring after each interval, until the honey melts.






If you are trying to decrystallize honey, stop heating it once you can no longer spot any crystals. If you only want to melt honey to a thinner consistency, simply stop heating it once it has become thin enough for your liking.
 Pour the melted honey into an airtight storage container. Store that container in a dry, room temperature location until you need to use the honey.


The ideal temperature range is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 21 degrees Celsius). Colder and hotter temperatures can speed up the crystallization process. Moist conditions should also be avoided.






The container must be an airtight one if you want to prevent moisture loss and crystallization.

 After the names are drawn for partners, be sure to ask your pro what time he wants to meet in the morning, and where you should meet him.;
, When you meet your pro after the draw, ask him what you should be prepared for. If he says you'll be throwing spinnerbaits all day, don't bother to bring your finesse gear. Two or three rods and a tackle box are plenty.
 He wants you to catch fish, since any you add to the live well increase his weight, too. If it's not shared weight, then consider it an opportunity to watch and learn. Any fish you catch will be a bonus.
 Plus, it's his boat. Don't get uppity.
, Every circuit has minor variations. Maybe you aren't allowed to net for your partner or something. Read the rules.
,, Keep your casts behind an invisible line that cuts the boat in half.
, If he asks you not to fish a certain spot, you should probably go along with him. But if he tells you he doesn't want you to fish at all, you can tell him to go pound sand.
 Never, ever tell any other angler what your pro was doing or where he was fishing on the first day, even if they ask (which is a major breach of etiquette). After the tournament is over with, you can tell your buddies, but until the checks are distributed, mums the word.
 He'll probably ask you to back him in before the tournament, then go up and get the trailer afterwards.

 If your child is scared of a particular relative, caregiver or a neighbour, do not ignore it or force the child to be with them. Instead, speak to your child about it and let him explain what makes that person fearful. Even if you think that the person is unlikely to cause any trouble to the child, do give your child some benefit of doubt.
 Making fun of a child’s fear will not make him less fearful; instead, it will increase his anxiety and at the same time lower his self-esteem. This can lead to more intense problems like developing phobias (an advanced state of fear). The child can overcome his/her fear only with your love and care. Neglect will only develop negative feelings in the child.
 Don’t send wrong messages to your child by saying things like: “Stop being a baby”, “Don’t be scared”, “See, your friend is not scared”, etc. This makes the child believe that it is wrong to be scared and he/she will stop sharing his fears with you. Tell your child that it's all right to be afraid. Also, explain him that it is okay to share his fear and to ask for help.

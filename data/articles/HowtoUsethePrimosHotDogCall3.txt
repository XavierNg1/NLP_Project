 Real coyotes do it when unwanted males chase them. Place your lip between A and B. Blow as if saying "too" and quiver your jaw while doing it. Repeat a couple times and you'll sound like an upset female coyote!

, Blow and glide lips from C to B, making a higher "hoooooo" than the male locator.
 This is what a female sounds like when looking for a male to mate with. Glide your lips from C to B, making a "hoo, ho, ho, hooooooo" sound.

Planting is done after removing the polythene cover and making sure the roots are not damaged. Planting is usually done in the evenings. Partial shade is provided for the first two weeks to protect the plants from the sun. Irrigation is given daily until plants are established.
 Bananas require 25 liters (6.6 US gal) of water per plant per irrigation. In larger varieties like Nendran, up to 40 liters (10.6 US gal) of water per irrigation is required during summer months. Irrigation is done once every 3 days in summer. It is important the base of the plants are not water logged.
,, Retain 1-2 suckers produced after emergence of bunch.
 Once all the hands have developed the rest of the inflorescence is removed.
 In certain varieties the heavy weight of the fruit bunch causes the plant to go out of balance. This may cause the plant to break up. To avoid this, plants should be propped up using a ‘V’ shaped pole.

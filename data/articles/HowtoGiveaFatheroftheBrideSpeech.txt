 We have all been to that wedding with the disastrous father of the bride speech where the whole room is dying with embarrassment along with the bride. This is an opportunity to show your daughter your pride in her and the woman she has become. Mark it appropriately and don't distract from it with cheesy one liners.;
, It may be half of the room knows exactly who you are, but the other don't and it is good manners to start any wedding speech with an introduction.
 Remember these guests are there voluntarily and give gifts from their hearts not out of a sense of obligation. It is good manners to thank people for this.
 Make this part appropriate and formal. This is not the time to tell the room about her topless vacation to Cancun or any other embarrassing moments best left for something like a 21st birthday speech. Tell the room about your pride for your daughter and the accomplishments you feel helped make her who she is. Express your love for your daughter and your sadness at her no longer being your little girl with ribbons and curls.
 Again this part should be appropriate and formal. Remember half the room is filled with his guests and family. This is not the time to threaten a meeting with a shot-gun if he breaks your daughter's heart. Be genuine when speaking talk about why you allowed him to marry your daughter and what you like about him or admire.
 Remind them fairy tales do come true and that your daughter was the biggest fairytale to you of them all.

 If you are the caregiver or just are dealing with your parent dying, consider joining a support group. You can join one that deals specifically with terminal illness and grief. If you take care of your parent, you can join a caregiver support group. This can give you some much needed emotional support during this trying time. You may also receive tips or ideas to help care for your parent.Talk to the doctor or local hospital about any support groups in your area. You can also look online, or join an online support group.
 You may feel like taking care of yourself is the last thing you should be worried about while your parent is dying. However, running yourself ragged will not help anyone. Make sure you take breaks, find ways to relax, and not let yourself get too run down.Talk to your family and friends. This can be very therapeutic, especially since this is a difficult situation.
 You cannot do everything alone. There is nothing wrong with asking others for help. This might be to do errands for you, stay with your parent so you can take a break, make dinner, or just to listen when you need it.You can ask siblings, your significant other, children, or other family members to help. If you or your parent have close family friends, see if they can help out.
If you or your parent are involved in a religious organization, you may want to ask a religious leader for help. Often, these people can be great sources of help and support.
You can also hire a home care worker to assist you. You can specify what exactly you need help with (providing meals, cleaning the house, medical care, and so on) and hire a home care agency to send assistance, or privately hire someone of your choosing.

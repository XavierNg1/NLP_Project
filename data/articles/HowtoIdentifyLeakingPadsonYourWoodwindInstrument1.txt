 You can sometimes tell if your instrument has a leaky pad from the sound quality of the notes that you play on it. Playing a chromatic scale can help determine if there is a problem because they contain 12 pitches that are each a semitone apart. That provides plenty of opportunity to listen for abnormalities with the notes., While you’re playing the scale, pay careful attention to the sound of each note. On a woodwind without leaking pads, they’ll sound clear and crisp. However, if there is a leak, the notes will have a fuzzy, almost blurred sound even with very little finger pressure.Not all leaky pads will lead to fuzzy-sounding notes, so it’s a good idea to check your instrument using an additional method to ensure that your instrument is in proper working order.
 In addition to changing the sound of your instrument, leaky pads may make it feel differently when you’re playing it. You may suddenly notice that your instrument seems to play with greater resistance, which means that you need to blow harder into it to generate enough air pressure.Greater resistance in your woodwind instrument can also be indicative of other issues, so you should check the pads using another method to ensure that they’re the problem.

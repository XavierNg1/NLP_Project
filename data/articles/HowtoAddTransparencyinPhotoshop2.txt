 Select the layer that you want to make transparent by clicking on it from the list of layers in the Layers tab.
 Click on the numeric box that appears next to Opacity at the top of the Layers tab. The default opacity is 100 percent.
 Drag the arrow on the opacity meter that appears to change the opacity of the layer. If you want the layer to be completely transparent you should change the opacity to 0 percent.

 This drink is best enjoyed at room temperature. The ice will also only disrupt the layers. The glass should also be clear, so that you can see the layers.;
, Aim it into the middle of the glass, so that you don't get any on the sides. Getting liquid on the sides could mess up the later layers.
 Turn the spoon upside down, so the dome part is facing up. The tip should be touching the inside wall of the glass, just above the Kahlua. The spoon will help you pour the next two layers slowly, and keep them intact.Some people find it easier if the tip of the spoon is just touching the Kahlua. Other people prefer to hold it just a little higher up. You may need to experiment with what is easiest for you.
 Make sure that you are pouring towards the hand that's holding the spoon. Move the spoon upwards as the liquid level rises in the glass. Don't let the tip of the spoon get inside the liquid.


Patience is key. The slower you pour, the better. If you pour too fast, the layers will mix.
Don't worry if the layers start to mix. If this happens, stop and wait a few seconds. They will eventually settle and separate.
 Use the same spoon method as you did for the Irish Cream. Try to fill the glass as close to the rim as possible. Don't worry about spills. You can always wipe them up.
 Don't sip it. The flavors won't blend right.

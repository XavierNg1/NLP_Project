 By doing so, the prospective employer knows straightaway that you are at least suitable for the role when they glance over your CV.;
, You might need to think carefully about all of your relevant achievements and tailor them to the specific job role on offer. Make your CV short, snappy and direct, as opposed to listing every single achievement, as this will only result in the employer looking elsewhere.
 You don’t need to do this in great depth, but where appropriate mention some of the transferable skills from other insurance jobs you have had in the past and how this could benefit the company if you were successful. This is a great way to gain the employer’s attention and keep them interested in what your CV has to say.
 It’s no good having a standard CV for the purpose of insurance vacancies as some points won’t be relevant. Instead, use the description as a guide and work out the key areas that will need to be included in each CV. Do you have training experience in certain areas or have you gained results in one of the other areas they are talking about? Only use the strongest points for each CV and again make sure you are direct rather than long-winded.
 If this is the first part of your CV then it’s an easy way to instantly stand out and make a difference.

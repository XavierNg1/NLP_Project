 Inexpensive systems simply plug in to your car's cigarette lighter and are small enough to store in your glove compartment, but they're not as user-friendly.;
, Some systems come with a monitor that displays a map. The monitor is commonly installed on the dashboard or on a pedestal extending from the dashboard. In some cars, such an installation may block air vents or make it somewhat uncomfortable for a passenger to enter or exit the vehicle or sit in the passenger seat.
 This can include by address, by intersection, by a personal address book or via a location selected directly from the map.
 The systems that use a map and monitor include arrows that show you the direction of a turn and also indicate where your car is on the map in relation to the destination. Other systems use the head unit or radio to display the name of the street on which you are to make a turn or on which you are traveling. Both of these systems also give you verbal directions as you approach a turn.
 Most GPS systems include locations of airports and other transportation services, ATMs and banks, restaurants, hotels and a host of other sites.
, Systems that rely on maps displayed on monitors are more complicated and take longer to install than other types of systems.
 Most retailers will have demo units in-store that you can see, touch, and experience. You can always check online retailers for a better price.

 If you don't have any, try the local thrift store. When choosing the suitcase, consider the following:


Is it big enough for my pet?
Is it best left intact or should it be cut in half to accommodate the pet? Does the design permit this?
Is the suitcase safe, as in no dangling bits or pieces your pet might get caught up in. (Cut off or remove anything you're concerned about.)
If the suitcase is moldy, falling apart, filled with bugs, etc., discard it and look for a better one. Your pet deserves a healthy bed!;
, Will it be a handy portable bed for when you travel? If so, you probably will want to your pet's items in one side and the bedding in the other. Or, perhaps are you're just looking for a cute bed to keep at home, in which case, storage of items won't be required.
 If your pet is leery of suitcase (some pets have an aversion to even seeing suitcases in the home if they associate them with you leaving), he may not want to even go near the suitcase. Before you go through the effort of creating bedding from the suitcase make sure Fido or Felix has no problem plopping down and making himself at home.


Be aware that your dog or cat may be more enticed once soft bedding is in the suitcase. Provided you're game, going ahead and making up the bedding portion may be enough to convince your pooch or kitty to give it another go.

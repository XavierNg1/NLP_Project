 Flirt, and give them hints that you might like to do something more than talk. This will give them a chance to consider the possibility that you might be interested in kissing them, and to think about whether or not they’d like to kiss you. This might be a good time to break the touch barrier, and put a hand on their arm or shoulder to indicate physical interest. Consider asking them to dance if you are somewhere that dancing is appropriate, but make sure not to do anything that could be construed as overtly sexual - coming on too strong will scare most people away. Pay attention to how they respond to this touch: if they pull away, or act uncomfortable, chances are they aren’t interested.
 Try to stick to something that isn’t sexual in nature, and won't come off as creepy, or overly personal. Make sure to take the situation into account, and consider the gender (or gender identification) of the person you’re trying to compliment. While you won't know much about this person yet, compliments that aren't physical are usually more effective, so make use of anything that you've gleaned about them. This below list comprises suggestions, but not all will be applicable to everyone, so you should use discretion and your awareness of their body language to filter the suggestions.


I’d like to get to know you better.
I know we've just met, but you seem really talented / smart / caring / kind / funny.
You’re really interesting.
I think it's really interesting that _________, (Insert something you actually find interesting about them!)
You’re beautiful / gorgeous / good looking / strong.
You make me feel (really) excited / nervous / happy.
I love your eyes. (You can also say something like mouth, or face, but try not to get any more personal than that.)
It's really cool that you_____________. Can you tell me more about_____________. This can be especially effective if you make them feel special for the knowledge they have by adding something like, "I've never met anyone who____________."

, Men and women tend to use slightly different movements for expressing interest using body language, but some general signs that a person may be interested in physical contact with you are:


Leaning towards you rather than back.
Paying attention to you when you're talking. If their gaze wanders around the room frequently, it's probably a sign that they wish something else would happen to give them a way to stop talking to you.
Making eye contact. If a person is wiling to look into your face for an extended period of time, it's a good sign that they're interested in you.
Looking interested and engaged. It's usually pretty easy to tell if the person you're talking to is bored with the conversation. If they have been quiet, or look bored or uninterested, either change tactics and talk about something else (try offering them the chance to choose a topic of conversation by asking an open ended question), or look elsewhere for someone to kiss.
 Even if someone seems willing to kiss you, think about whether you have taken into account their body language, or whether you are relying on common assumptions and stereotypes. An example of an assumption you might make is that if someone is dressed in a revealing way, that they are asking for sexual attention. Remember that these assumptions on your part do not constitute consent on their part. When body language fails to tell you what you need to know, you can always just ask them if they’re interested in doing something with you.
 If you might want to start a lasting relationship with this person that is emotional as well as physical, consider that kissing them right off the bat might not be the best way of accomplishing this. Letting the physical tension escalate slowly as you get to know them better may be more effective at starting something that lasts. On the other hand, kissing soon after meeting can be a good way to tell whether there is any physical chemistry between you – something which can be good to establish before too much time has been invested!

, Just because you haven’t gotten to know this person very well yet, it doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t take the same precautions you would for a kiss at the end of a first date! Make sure that they’re interested in kissing you via body language and other signs, and make sure that your mouth is reasonably clean.

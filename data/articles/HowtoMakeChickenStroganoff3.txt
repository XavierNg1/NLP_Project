 Slice 1.2 kilograms (42 ounces) of boneless, skinless chicken into strips. Roll the chicken strips across a plate dusted in a light coat of flour. Heat 50 grams (1.75 ounces) of butter in a skillet. Place the chicken strips in the skillet. Allow them to sauté for five to 10 minutes, then turn them over and allow the opposite side to sauté., Once your chicken has finished sautéing, remove it and set it on a plate. Chop six green onions. Dump them in the skillet and sauté them until brown., Once your onions are browned, add two carrots chopped into thin slices. Pour one cup (240 milliliters) of vegetable soup, 200 cubic centimeters (0.85 cups) of cream, ½ cup (118 milliliters) white wine, one teaspoon paprika, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook everything over medium heat. When it begins to boil, lower the heat., After about five minutes, add 200 grams (seven ounces) of peas. Wait about 10 minutes and check the chicken. When it is tender, reduce heat to the lowest setting., In a separate skillet, pour one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil. Slice 300 grams (10.5 ounces) of white mushrooms in thin slices. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Sautee them in the skillet over medium-high heat., To plate the vegetable chicken stroganoff, fill half a bowl with rice. Scoop the stroganoff mix into the other half of the bowl. Then place the mushrooms over the rice. Enjoy your tasty chicken stroganoff.

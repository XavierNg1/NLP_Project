 Using a tape measure, measure the height and width of the door opening. Write the measurements down.






;
, Check the floor for level and the jambs for plumb. Measure the exact amount that the floor is off-level. The opposite jamb must be cut by this amount to level the door in the opening.
 The door should be 2" smaller than the rough opening (jack studs). It should be slightly (1/4") smaller than the finished opening to allow a margin for closing the door. There is some leeway to also purchase a door that is a little larger since you will be trimming it.
 Use a pencil to apply the measurements. Generally, allow for a 2mm (1/16 inch) space between the door and the top and sides. The bottom of the door should be 6-12mm (1/4-1/2 inch) up from the floor ( If your measurements were 1992 mm (83 inches) high and 768 mm (32 inches) wide, for example, mark the door so that it's 1984 mm (82 2/3 inches) tall (1992 mm minus 2 mm for the top and 6 mm for the bottom) and 764 mm (31.8 inches) wide (768 minus 2 mm for each side).









Keep in mind whether your door will be going over a carpet or a wooden floor.

 Your audience includes the people that you want to attract to your website. If you're too general, then your website will lack focus. If you're too specific, then your website will only appeal to a small niche.;
, Is your audience looking for quick information? Are they looking for a specific product or service that you provide?

, You want to make certain things happen, and you want to prevent other things from happening. What steps are necessary to help you to meet your goals?

, You will only be able to accomplish so much, and you will only have so much time for website maintenance. Add extra features depending on their importance to your goals while realistically considering how much time and personnel that you can allocate to the task.



Make the site easy for audience members to follow.
Only create pages that offer something of value. Don't create extra navigation pages.
Make sure that your pages deliver what they promise. If your page is entitled "Application Form," then make sure that it contains a downloadable or printable application form.
Keep it quick. You may think that an awesome Flash video will make your site more attractive, but the same video may make your page distracting or very slow to load. Balance visual appeal with speed to keep your visitors coming back.



Avoid using colors or graphics that make the content difficult to read. Readability is the most important priority.
Avoid icons for navigation unless they are universally recognized. Use text to make sure that everyone can understand your navigation buttons.
Use a clean layout. Avoid frames or other visual clutter.
Colors and graphics should reflect the personality of your site.

 You can use "aimer" (to love), "adorer" (to adore), or "d√©sirer" (to desire).


"Aimer" is the strongest in emotion of the three verbs. Don't use it lightly!;
, It's not likely you'd be telling someone formally or someone unknown that you love them!


"Tu" and "vous" are the two forms used when addressing another person. "Tu" is used for people you know well or children.
In "je t'aime," "tu" is contracted to "t'" because of the succeeding vowel. Literally, it translates to "I you love."
If you are seeking to risk a restraining order, "je vous aime" (zhuh voo zem) is used formally.
, If you're nervous, practice will be invaluable. Telling someone that you love them can be exciting or terrifying and saying it in French makes it seem even more romantic. Bonne chance! (Good luck!)


Get the pronunciation down. French is full of sounds that are represented a bit differently in English.

"j" in "je" is pronounced -- like the g in mirage
"e" (in "je") is pronounced like the oo in good
"t'aime" is pronounced to rhyme with them.

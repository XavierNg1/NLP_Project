Create a super defence potion. For this, you will need a cadantine herb, a white berry, and a vial of water.






Collect a lantadyme herb. Invest in clean lantadyme for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy lantadyme are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
 This will create a three dose extreme defence potion.


Be sure to click on the herb first, then the potion. Clicking on the potion first will accidentally consume a dose.

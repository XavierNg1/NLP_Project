 Pinpoint the location of the eyelash before trying this method. This works best if the eyelash is trapped in the top part of the eye.
 Pull the lid gently, not strongly. Your upper and lower lashes should brush against each other. Try blinking once or twice with your lid closed. It might help loosen the lash from the area it's stuck.
 Ideally, the motion of your lid against the eyeball as it moves dislodges the eyelash. It may stick to your lashes instead of the eye, from which you can remove it easily, or fall out of your eye as you open your lid.

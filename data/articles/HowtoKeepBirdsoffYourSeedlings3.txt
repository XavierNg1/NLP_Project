 As mentioned previously, birds are scared of their own reflections, but they also don’t like loud noises. Hang your pie tins on a clothesline or mount them on stakes. The loud noises they make when the wind blows them into one another is sure to keep the birds away.When hanging or mounting your pie tins, make sure to place them closely together so they can touch and rub against each other.
If you don’t have pie tins, you can substitute other kitchen utensils, provided they are metallic.
 Birds use their sense of hearing to help them avoid predators, but you can also use this to your advantage. Place a CD player in your garden and play recorded sounds of predators on loop.When creating your bird mix, include lots of eagle, owl and vulture noises. These are all predatory birds and their calls are sure to terrify smaller birds., Wind chimes are the most innocuous way to keep birds away from your seedlings; they look pretty, sound pretty and are very cost effective. Birds, however, don’t like the chiming and tend to steer clear of them. Hang your wind chimes above your seedlings and enjoy the pretty music (and your bird-free plants.)You can also try substituting bells for wind chimes.

 Before you start using a pendulum, you need to know what it is and how it works. Luckily, a pendulum is no more than a hanging weight allowed to swing back and forth. The string is attached to a fixed point so that only the weight and string are moving. Hold the end of pendant necklace or yo-yo between your fingers and move the "weight" at the bottom. You've made your first pendulum!
A common example of a pendulum is the large swinging weight in a grandfather clock.;
, Make sure you keep the string taught and release the weight without pushing it. The weight will swing back and forth, returning to roughly the same height you dropped it from.


A pendulum will swing forever if nothing happens to slow it down or change its direction. In reality, outside forces like friction and air resistance will slow down a pendulum.
 If you learn through hands-on activities or want to teach children how pendulums work, you can quickly build a pendulum to experiment with:


Tie one end of a string to the middle of a yardstick or poll.
Tie the opposite end to a battery or other small weight.
Balance the yardstick on the backs of two identical chairs so that the battery hangs freely between them and can swing without hitting anything.
Pick up the battery, keeping the string taut, and release it so that it swings back and forth.
 Like most scientific pursuits it is only possible to understand and use pendulums if you know the words that describe them.



Amplitude: The highest point the pendulum reaches.

Bob: Another name for the weight at the end of the pendulum.

Equilibrium: The center point of a pendulum; where the weight rests when it is not moving.

Frequency: The number of times a pendulum swings back and forth in a set amount of time.

Period: The amount of time it takes a moving pendulum to return to the same spot.

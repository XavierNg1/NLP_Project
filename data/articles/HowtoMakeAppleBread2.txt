 Prepare the loaf pan by either greasing it and sprinkling with flour or lining with parchment paper. If lining with paper, cut the paper carefully to fit neatly in the corners, to avoid creasing the bread during baking., Chop into fine pieces. Divide into two halves for ease of use shortly., Mix together to combine. Put to one side., Mix by hand or stand mixer until a smooth mixture forms.

If using an electric mixer, use medium speed.
 Then add the vanilla and continue beating until combined well., Stir in. Then add the milk, stirring in. The batter is now formed., Spread one half of the cut apples across the surface of the batter. Gently push down using the back of a large spoon., Spread across to cover the apples completely. Sprinkle with some of the apple and cinnamon mixture made earlier, using about one quarter of the mix., Ensure an even coverage., Gently pat down with the bag of the large spoon., Bake for 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean., Allow to stand in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool until firm., The apple bread can be eaten still warm or when it is cold. Cut into slices and serve with tea or coffee. It goes well with butter or jam, if wished.

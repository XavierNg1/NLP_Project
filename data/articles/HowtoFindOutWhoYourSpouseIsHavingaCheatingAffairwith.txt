 Look for any abnormal phone numbers that you do not recognize. Understand that not every phone number that you do not recognize will lead to a person that your spouse is having a cheating affair with. But you might find the proof you need. Call each unrecognizable number and wait to see who answers. If it's someone of the opposite gender from your spouse, explain that you had found their number on your spouse’s, and your phone bill , and were curious as to what it is. Understand, however, that you have to take whatever they tell you at face value.;
, Is there one in particular he or she spends a lot of time with, goes on business trips with, or helps out more than normal? Some men like to hide their paramours in plain sight.
 Find one in your local newspaper, phone book, or hire one that someone that you know has used before. Sometimes this method can prove to be very costly, so make sure you can afford it.
 Set it up in the bedroom, since this is where most affairs take place. Know, however, that if it is found your relationship is probably over.
 If your spouse has been cheating over emails, you can take the email address that have been writing to and type it into a Google or Yahoo search. This will often link you to tons of websites that email is registered with, often revealing a name, online identities, and sometimes addresses and phone numbers.
 Track your spouse’s routine and attempt to catch him or her in the act, or at least see if he or she is lying to you.

 If you'd like the blanket to be double-sided, cut two pieces of fleece instead: one that is solid-colored, and one that is patterned.
 Trace the corners first using a pen, then cut the corners out using a sharp pair of scissors.Not only does this give your blanket a unique touch, but you won't have to sew Mildred corners when adding the bias tape.


You can also use a plate or a lid.
 Unless you made your own bias tape, or bought it already the right length, you will have to sew two or more lengths of bias tape together to make one long, continuous strand.Open up both ends of the bias tape, then pin them together, with the wrong sides facing out. Sew the two strands together using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.
 Nestle the raw edge of the blanket right into the fold of the bias tape. Place a sewing pin ever 3 inches (7.62 centimeters)., Trim off the excess bias tape until you have about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) left. Overlap it by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then fold the excess under itself. Press it flat with an iron, then pin it in place.
 Remove the pins as you sew.
 Go over your blanket and double-check for any missed pins, then carefully trim off any loose threads. Your blanket is now complete, and ready to use!

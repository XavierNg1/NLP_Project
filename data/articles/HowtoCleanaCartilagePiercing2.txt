 While it is healing, avoid handling your cartilage piercing for any reason other than cleaning it. Turning or twisting the jewelry could cause an infection. The piercing should only be touched with freshly washed hands., To avoid infection, make sure that your clothing and sheets are clean. During the healing process, clothing that may touch your ear (e.g. a hooded sweatshirt) should be washed after each occasion that you wear it. Make sure that bed sheets (pillow cases in particular) are laundered at least once a week., Avoid using rubbing alcohol or peroxide on your piercing as they can be very drying and damage your skin. Antibacterial soaps and moisturizing bar soaps may leave behind a residue that might contribute to an infection or longer time to heal.

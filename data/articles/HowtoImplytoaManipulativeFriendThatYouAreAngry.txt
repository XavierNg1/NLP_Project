 If nothing special has happened and you simply want to break up with them because they've been using you for too long, you may state, "I wanted to talk about something... you've been using me", and state your viewpoints in a calm, rational way. Implying that you are angry instead of simply stating it when nothing has really triggered it, won't work.;
, You can now imply that you are angry. Gather your friends and tell them what happened.
 At lunch, sit at another table or continue giving them the silent treatment. Keep in mind that when they will eventually ask why, you must be prepared.
 Say something along the lines of, "What you did to me wasn't right. You paired up with that mean guy/girl, and went against me. Yet you suppose we are friends."

, "You've been using me for a long time, but I didn't want to appear rude. You always copy off me even after I say you can't. You look off my paper, but when your friends come by, you run away from me like I was never there. I don't like it. If you were really a friend, you wouldn't have needed anyone to tell you all this is wrong."

, Others who take pity sometimes simply don't understand unless it happened to them. The 'friend' themselves may appear very sad. Keep in mind that no matter what they say, it is only because they know you won't help them anymore. They aren't in your good books, and now they know it.
 Continue to hang out. If the 'friend' does keep following you and your friends when their friends aren't around, ignore them. Continue to give them the silent treatment. Your own friends may not approve of what you did, but that is because they don't understand. Most friends should surface out and talk to you in the end. If not, then they are conditional friends and not true friends.
 They will continue to use you as long as you let them. The best route to take is to try avoid them at all times.

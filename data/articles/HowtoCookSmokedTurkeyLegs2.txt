 Follow your manufacturer's directions to get the heat between 250 and 275 degrees F. When you see smoke coming from the vents, you can add your turkey.


You can use an electric, gas, wood, or charcoal smoker.
 Smoke the turkey legs for 2 to 2.5 hours.


If you want smokier turkey legs, consider smoking them longer at a lower heat. Try 3.5 to 4 hours at 225 to 240 degrees.
 Use a meat thermometer and check to see if the legs have reached 165 °F (73.9 °C). If so, they're finished. If not, continue checking the temperature at regular intervals until they're at 165 degrees.
 Serve the turkey legs immediately or wrap them in foil and refrigerate if using much later.


To reheat the turkey legs, set the foil-wrapped cooked turkey legs in a 275 degree F. oven for 30 minutes.

 Cut down through the ham, cutting as close to the bone as you possibly can, and then cut off the largest section of boneless meat from the ham. Set the boneless section aside for now--you will slice it once finished with the rest of the ham., Keeping the flat end on the cutting board, cut quarter-inch slices. These should be parallel to the flat end of the ham to maximize the tenderness of the slices.Cut from the top and work downward. When you are finished, cut through the ham close to the bone to detach the slices., After cutting the boneless portion, your ham is completely sliced and ready to serve.

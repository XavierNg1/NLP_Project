Note that the essential oil is not necessary. The vinegar is the component responsible for softening clothes. It strips away residue on your clothes that would otherwise make them stiff, and it has properties that can break down some of the minerals found in hard water supplies.
If you do decide to use essential oils, you can use any scents you want.;
, For a normal load, fill a fabric softener ball with 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the fabric softener solution or add the same amount directly to the washer just before the rinse cycle begins.


Do not add the fabric softener to the machine before its primary wash cycle.
Pour the rest of the fabric softener into a storage container. Make sure that this fabric softener is labeled so that you do not accidentally use it for another purpose. Shake or stir well to before each use to make sure that the essential oil and vinegar have not separated as it sat.
 You do not need to do anything special from this point on. Let your rinse cycle finish up as it normally would.

 This is how you increase the air pressure in the bottle. Each pump adds air to an already tight, pressurized system. With nowhere to go, this pressure builds up in the bottle and propels it when freed.
 The water will be your "fuel" as it comes under pressure.
 Use the U-shaped wire to lock the bottle in place. It will want to move as pressure builds up.
 If you don't have a pressure gauge, just pumping for 15-25 seconds would work out just fine. Make sure that you are in a wide-open area.
 Make sure your head and hands are away from the launcher and bottle -- it will really fly if you're not careful.
 As the air pressurizes the bottle and launcher and is then released it creates an action force blowing the escaping air down. In turn this creates an equal and opposite force for the bottle to go in the other direction, upwards! This is because of Newton's Third Law of Motion. Increasing the pressure inside the bottle increased the thrust (Newton's Second Law of Motion). The water is inside the bottle to add velocity, as the water is heavier than the air so as the air pushes the water out first on launch your bottle will fly further.

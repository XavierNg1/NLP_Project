 Log into the Twitter app with your login information.


If you don't have the Twitter app, it can be downloaded for free from the Google Play Store.
If you're using a third party app to access Twitter, you should still be able to save Twitter images, but the steps may be a little different.
 Scroll through your Twitter feed until you find the image that you want to download. Touch the image to expand it.
 Touch the menu button in the upper-right corner. Touch Save. The image is saved to your Android's storage. If you haven't saved any Twitter images before, a Twitter folder will be created.
 Depending on your settings, you can access the Twitter image in either the Photos or the Gallery app.

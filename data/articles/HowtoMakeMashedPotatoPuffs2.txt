 Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Get out a mini-muffin pan or regular-sized muffin pan, depending on the size of puffs you'd like. Grease the pan well or spray it well with cooking spray.It's important to grease the pan, since the grease or spray will prevent the puffs from sticking to the pan.
 Measure all of your potato puff ingredients into a large mixing bowl and whisk them together until they're combined. Ensure that your mashed potatoes are at room temperature or chilled. You'll need to mix:2 cups (650 g) mashed potatoes
3 large beaten eggs
3/4 cup (75 g) of the grated cheese (like Parmesan or Gruyere)
1/4 cup (5 g) minced chives
1/4 cup (40 g) diced cooked bacon or ham, optional
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

, Divide the potato mixture among your 12-count muffin pan or 24-count mini-muffin pan. Sprinkle the last 1/4 cup (25 g) of grated cheese over the tops of the puffs.You can use a small cookie scoop to easily fill the muffin pan with the mixture.
 Put the pan in the preheated oven and bake the puffs for 20 minutes. The puffs shouldn't jiggle and they'll be brown on top once they're baked. Carefully flip the cheesy mashed potato puffs onto a wire rack and let them cool for a few minutes.If you leave the puffs in the pan, they may stick and be difficult to remove.
Consider serving the puffs with sour cream.

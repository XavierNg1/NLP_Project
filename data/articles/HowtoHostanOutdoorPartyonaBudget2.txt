 If you don't have the proper equipment like chairs, stereo equipment, bowls, or glasses, you can ask your friends to help you. Call friends that are coming to the party and ask them if they can bring party equipment with them. Make sure that they arrive early so that they can help you set everything up.You can also ask your neighbors if you can borrow some of their equipment for the party.
 One of the largest expenses for many parties is the cost of libations. Instead of putting the burden on yourself, let everyone know that the party will be BYOB and that they are expected to bring their own drinks. You can still buy some alcohol for people who don't bring anything, but you won't have to serve the entire party., Instead of a more formal sit-down dinner, consider passing around appetizers and hors dâ€™oeuvres throughout the night. If you do make smaller dishes, ensure that you make enough of it so that people aren't left out at your party., If you've already thrown an outdoor party in the past, there's a good chance that you can reuse most of the decorations and equipment instead of renting or purchasing new stuff. Take stock of the party gear that you have, and create a plan to reuse it.
 Eliminate the cost of food or having to purchase ingredients by making your outdoor party a potluck. Tell people to bring their favorite cold dish, or dish that can be reheated on the grill. The more people that bring food, the fewer people you'll have to pay for.

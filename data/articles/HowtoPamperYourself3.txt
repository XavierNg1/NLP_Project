 If you have been working a lot, or have been very busy, set aside some time to pamper your heart by making plans with the people you love. Plan a day of activities, or simply decide to go see a movie with some friends.


When you surround yourself with people you love, you may find that you are more relaxed and happy.
 Pampering yourself can also involve pampering your partner. Spend some time planning a getaway for you and your beloved. It doesn’t mean that you need to go far; simply scheduling a day trip could be a great way to pamper yourself.


Consider booking a hotel for a night for a change of scenery, or driving to the beach or a lake.
 People are not the only creatures that can make you feel loved. Spend some quality time with your pet to pamper yourself emotionally. Go for a walk with your, curl up and watch a movie with your cat, or ride your horse on a wooded trail.


If you don’t have a pet, consider volunteering at an animal shelter. You may just end up with a pet when the day is done.
 Catching up with a dear friend can also be a great way to pamper yourself emotionally.


You could even plan a skype date with your friend, so that you could giggle together no matter where in the world the both of you are.

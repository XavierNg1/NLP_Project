 During the first inch of filling, you can continue walking around the liner and working the wrinkles to the outside of the pool. This will be the last chance you have to create a straight surface for your pool floor. If you’re walking around on the liner, make sure you aren’t wearing shoes (even water shoes or flip flops) and that you haven’t tracked any rocks into the pool with you.
 Sit back and slowly fill the pool. Once your pool is filled half way, check your skimmer and filter instructions on how to install them.
 You’re almost done! Apply the finishing touches, and fill the pool the rest of the way.


Install the safety warnings. If you don’t have them, get in touch with your manufacturer and they will provide you new warnings for free.
Your warranty will be voided if you don’t add your labels.
The bigger label is for the outside of your pool directly next to the entryway.
Smaller label is attached on the liner, above the water line, and directly across from the pool’s entryway.
Fill the pool. Your water level should be 1/3 and ½ way up the skimmer.

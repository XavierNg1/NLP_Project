Passive (Soul Eater) Nasus has life steal for his attacks  
Q (Siphoning Strike) Nasus' axe is empowered and his next basic attack will deal bonus damage. If Siphoning Strike kills a unit, it will gain stacks of Siphoning Strike which will permanently deal more damage on usage of Siphoning Strike.  
W (Wither) Nasus slows an enemy champion for 5 seconds. The slow percentage increases over time.  
E (Spirit Fire) Nasus puts a spirit flame in a circular area. This deals magic damage and reduces foes' armor every second. This has a high mana cost so make sure you don't use it too often.  
R (Fury of the Sands) Nasus transforms into a big version and increases damage, life steal and attack range. This also gives a massive health boost. Enemies near Nasus are damaged by a percentage of their maximum health. Siphoning Strike deals extra damage in this duration too. Nasus turns back into his normal form after a few seconds.;

 Ancient Coin will help you get coins without having to kill all of the minions by yourself. In an early game, if you didn't farm Siphoning Strike, you have no damage for late game.
 This can also be used to protect allied minions from enemies.


If enemies get too close to you while you are farming minions, punish them with Wither and Siphoning Strike.

 LinkedIn displays how often your profile appears in search, and what people are looking for when they find you.


By adding more details about what you are doing, you can directly see how many more people are finding you online.
 The more contacts you add, the more people will see your updates.
 They tend not to be commented on like a Facebook post, but they are widely read. Use the same caveats as in any social media posting.
 The most important posts you can make to spread your personal brand are to LinkedIn groups that consist of professionals like yourself. They are most likely to be interested in what you post, and take action (should you want them to).
 Influencers can have followers and their posts can be featured on LinkedIn Today.


Influencers also can write mini blog posts that include images, which also boosts your readership.



There are ways to show LinkedIn that you are an influencer. You can tie your personal blog to LinkedIn so LinkedIn knows your readership carries over to LinkedIn.
If you want to try to become an Influence, you can email to influencers@linkedin.com. Another good method is to hit someone who works at LinkedIn with a LinkedIn message.

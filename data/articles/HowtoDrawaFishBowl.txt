 Use light pencil strokes to begin. You will need to do some erasing in the next step.;
, Erase everything above the line.
 Make sure this line is parallel to the top of the fish bowl. This line is your waterline. If you plan on having a colored fish bowl, sketch this very lightly.
 Using a ruler, lightly draw an even line about 1⁄4 centimeter (0.1 in) from the bottom most part of the bowl. Take your ruler and measure where the fish bowl itself and your new line are exactly 1 centimeter (0.4 in) apart. Draw a light line here, and repeat on the other side. Curve the sides of the bottom up a little, so it looks more circular.
 Add plants, gravel, fish castles, or whatever you please.

 In order to use Apple Pay on your watch, you'll need to add a credit or debit card. You can do this from the Apple Watch app.
 This will open the Apple Pay settings for your watch.
 If you already have a card on file, you'll just need to enter the security code on the back of the card to activate it on your watch. If you've never added a card, you'll be prompted to enter the card details or use your iPhone's camera to scan it.


You can repeat this process to add additional cards to your Apple Pay account.
 When you're ready to use Apple Pay to make a purchase at a retailer that accepts it, press the side button twice to open the Apple Pay interface., You'll be able to select from any of the cards you've added to Apple Pay., Hold the watch faces about an inch from the reader, twisting your wrist if necessary. After a moment, you should feel a vibration, and the payment will be processed.

 Gather information that the support agent will need to verify your identity, such as your account number or billing address.
 If your wireless modem/router came from your ISP, they can log into it and remove unauthorized users.
 If you think someone is using your password, ask your support agent to configure a new one at this time. Remember, passwords are case-sensitive.
 If itâ€™s been a long time since your router has been updated, your support agent may also take care of this now.

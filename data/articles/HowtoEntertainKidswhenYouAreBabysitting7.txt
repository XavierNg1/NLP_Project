 Some kids enjoy reading, while others don't. Find a good book or ask the kids what they want you to read to them. Download some nice background music on your iPod. A good website to get this music from is Incompetech.com. Play the music in the background while reading. This will also work for acting out something or for putting on a talent show. Adding background music will really set the mood!

, Old MacDonald had a farm, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Baa Baa Black Sheep, Happy Birthday or the ABC song are good. Bring along a kiddie music CD or download some kid music onto your iPod, and play it. Kids love dancing, singing, and music.
 Little kids love to sing and dance, so play some music that's age appropriate and let them jump and sing and dance.
 Pop some popcorn and put the popcorn in individual bowls for each child (if they are young). Give each child a ticket awhile before the movie. Be the ticket-taker at the door to the room, and give each child a bowl of popcorn. Then turn off the lights and start the movie!

, Use chairs and big blankets. Fill the inside with pillows and blankets. After it's made, you can tell (or read!) stories. If it's possible, make it over a TV, so the TV is inside, and you have a movie theater! If the children are 4 or older (and less likely to make a mess), pop some popcorn to get the great movie atmosphere!

, Babysitting all girls can be fun. You can do hair, make-up, nails, tea parties, etc. Be sure to get permission from parents before doing any make-up, nails or anything messy.

 Being loud is one of the easiest ways to annoy people. Singing a song is a great way to get under peoples’ skin since songs can easily get stuck in your head. Sing a short song like “It’s a Small World” over and over again to vex your fellow passengers.What’s even more annoying than hearing someone sing a song over and over again is when they get the words wrong. Pick a popular song but get the words slightly wrong to really be annoying.
 Use your phone or a portable radio to play loud, repetitive music. You can even sing along with it to be especially annoying, or dance like you’re in a club., Bring an instrument like a guitar or an accordion into the elevator. Start playing it and making random notes and chords without playing a song. It’s even more annoying when the instrument is especially loud or off-key., Bring a book into the elevator and start reading loudly. Pretend to not notice people looking at you, and act as though it’s completely normal., Even though it’s not a loud sound, the sound of someone clearing their throat repeatedly can be extremely annoying. Clear your throat as you get on the elevator. Wait a couple seconds and do it again. Keep clearing your throat until you get off.
 It's a fine line between being lighthearted and mischievous and being a jerk. Aim to brighten the day of your fellow passengers instead of making an annoying racket. Start out quietly, then if the passengers seem amused, continue your prank. If the passengers look annoyed or irritated, don't keep going.

 Take the cat to a vet and ask them if there is a microchip in the cat. The vet will be able to tell if someone owns the cat if a microchip exists. The vet may also have notices of any missing cats you can check.


If the microchip doesn't exist or the owner cannot be traced this way: Leave a message on online sites that help people find lost cats. Take a digital photo and upload it, along with a short message about where and when you found the cat and any distinguishing markings. Auctions sites, animal welfare organization sites and even Twitter and Facebook can be great places to use for finding an owner.;
, In the meantime, care for the cat as you'd care for your own. If the cat does not have an owner, you will be able to adopt it.
 Get everything treated before keeping the cat.


Ask the vet about the cat's temperament. The vet will be a good source of advice as to whether or not a crotchety cat will be likely to calm down enough to be kept by you safely.

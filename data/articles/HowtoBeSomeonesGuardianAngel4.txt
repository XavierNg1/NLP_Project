 Showing that you care about someone’s emotional and physical well-being is an important gesture; it lets them know that they can continue to come to you for emotional support, and that there is trust and familiarity in the relationship. To remind someone you care, try:


Send them a card or an email reminding them they’re on your mind.
Come straight out and say something like, “You’re an important part of my life.”

, While supporting the people in your life is a valuable interpersonal skill, it does not replace a need for professional mental care. If the person you are caring for suffers from depression or another type of mental illness, they may need more assistance than your support provides.


Focus on how you can help the person rather than trying to solve their problems for them. For example, if the person has lost his home and job, then you can help the person with a job search, but do not do the job search work for him. Sit down with him and help him with the search, application process, deciding what to wear for an interview, etc.
Do not try to replace a medical or mental health professional. For example, if the person has schizophrenia, then do not try to manage the person’s condition without medical assistance.
 By supporting this individual, you have made a decision to support them over a long period of time. There will be setbacks and difficult times—when this person wants to express frustration, sadness, or is upset, be there for them.


When this person is angry, let them cry or vent, rather than trying to improve their emotions or make them feel happy.
If this person feels like their situation is hopeless, assure them that they will pull through regardless of how tough things seem right now. Try saying something like, “I know things might seem bad right now, but this is only a temporary setback. Things will get better.”

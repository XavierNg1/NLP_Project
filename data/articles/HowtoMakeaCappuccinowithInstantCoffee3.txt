 Use a medium-sized mixing bowl. Or, to reduce the number of dishes to wash later, simply add and combine the ingredients directly in a sealable container. Stir the following together:1 cup powdered non-dairy creamer (86 g)
1 cup instant chocolate drink mix (86 g)
¾ cup instant coffee granules (65 g)
½ cup sugar (100 g)
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg

, Seal the container to keep pests out once you’re finished. Store where desired. There is no need to refrigerate it.
 For each serving, add 2 tablespoons of your mix to a mug. Boil ¾ cup of water in a kettle, pot, or microwave. Pour the boiled water into the mug. Stir well to mix.

 Crayons are easy to find in the art section of large stores and art and craft stores. You don't need to buy very expensive art crayons, just make sure you have the colors you want in them and that they are non toxic.


If the crayons are non-toxic, it should say so on the box. A reliable brand of crayons for this project is Crayola.
If you are sensitive to smells, smell the box first to make sure that the scent isn't too strong for you.;
, You can just choose one, or you can blend two together. You should need just one crayon.
, You can use old lip balm containers, plastic jewelry boxes, pretty much anything that is clean, food-safe and easy to store.
 Stir well. You can also use a double boiler, melt the crayon/crayons. To use a double boiler, fill the bottom with water and place it over heat to boil it. Place the crayon in the top part of the double boiler.


To make your own double boiler, take a large saucepan and fill it with water, and place a smaller saucepan or heat proof bowl to put your crayon(s) in. It can be hard to get the crayon off, so don't use any pan that is super expensive––a thrift store one is just fine.
 It can be coconut oil, olive oil, almond oil, jojoba oil, or even Vaseline. Mix the crayon and oil together until they are combined.
 The oil will help it stay soft, so you can reuse it. Make sure the container you put it in has a lid, so it doesn't completely dry out.

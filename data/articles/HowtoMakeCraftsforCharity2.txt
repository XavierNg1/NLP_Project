 If you want to keep your support local, then brainstorm local non-profit organizations who could use your help. Some of the following ideas may be a good place to start:


Make cloth diapers for local women's shelters. You can also make baby blankets, children's toys, baby socks and hats. These can be sent in kits or individually to expecting or new mothers who are in need.
Create quilts for the fire department or police department. You can create simple quilts to be handed out to people who have had car accidents or who've had a fire. They will help people in shock and be a comfort that they can keep through hard times.
Can, grow or make foods for the local food bank. Approach your local food bank to find out what foods are permissible. They most likely have to follow state food preparation standards. They may be able to direct you to other group homes or centers that are in need of prepared food.

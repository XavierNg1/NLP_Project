 Maple trees are easy to grow from cuttings. Select a maple tree branch that is appealing in shape. The size of the branch can be up to the diameter of your little finger.


There are many possible cultivars of Japanese maple. Select according to what you're wanting––some will grow larger than others, some have rough bark and some require grafting.
It's a good idea to take several cuttings; that way, you will be assured that one will take well (sometimes the roots are weak, rot or simply don't form).
Note that red-leafed cultivars of the Japanese maple tend to have weak root systems and are usually grafted onto other rootstock. Unless you know how to graft, or have someone knowledgeable to help you, it might be a good idea to avoid the red-leafed cultivars until you are more experienced.;

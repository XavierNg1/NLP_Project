 A pill pocket is like a treat. However, a pill pocket has a space for you to place the pill inside. Place the pill inside of the pocket for your cat to eat. Then give your cat the “treat.”If a whole pill pocket is too big for your cat to eat, then break up the pill pocket. Wrap some of the dough around the pill and give the “treat” to your cat.;
, Pour its canned food out onto a platter. Use a spoon to place the pill in the middle of the canned food. Make sure the pill is fully submerged in the food. Then give your cat the platter of food to eat.If your cat will not eat the pill this way, then you will need to try a different method.
 Make a small, treat-sized meatball out of your cat’s favorite foods. Pack the food around the pill until a small ball is formed. You can use cheese, peanut butter, or meat and/or chicken-flavored baby food.Try to use very pungent foods to mask the flavor of the medicine, like liverwurst, anchovies, sardines, and tuna paste.
Avoid using foods that are toxic to cats such as grapes, chocolate, raisins, onion, garlic, and macadamia nuts.

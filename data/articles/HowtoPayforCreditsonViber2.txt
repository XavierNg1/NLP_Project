 If you don’t have any credit or would like to load some, click the “Buy Credit” button beside your credit balance to begin buying credits.
 A Checkout page will load containing a menu of prepaid credit values. You have three options to choose from: $4.99, $9.99, and $24.99. Click the option you’d like to buy.
 Right below the menu, you have to click on your payment method. You can pay with Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or PayPal. When you’ve selected your preferred method, click the “Buy” button to proceed.
 Viber will process your payment. If you selected a credit card as a payment method, you will be asked to fill up your credit card information in another page. If you chose PayPal, you will be brought to PayPal’s payment page. Complete the transaction by following the instructions on your screen. Once the purchase is completed, the credit amount you’ve just bought will be added to your credit balance.

 Label each section of the roof. You will write your measurements on the diagram to make it easy to make the roof's size calculations. Being able to see where you have been and what you have already measured will help make the process go more quickly.;
, This is not as difficult as you might think. The area of a triangle is half the length times the width (L x W / 2). Use a tape measure to measure the length of the eave and the length from the center of the eave to the opposite point. Multiply these two numbers together and divide by 2. Mark this number on your diagram as the square feet for this section.
 Use the measuring tape to measure the length and the width of the squared off sections. Multiply these two numbers together, and that is the square-feet total you will mark on your diagram.
 Add up the square feet you determined for each section. The sum of these numbers is your total square feet of the roof.
 Roofing materials are determined based on the number of "square" a roof is, not the number of square feet. To calculate the square of a roof, take the number of square feet and divide it by 100.

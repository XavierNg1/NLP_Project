 One possible reason your cat may be climbing on furniture is because he isn't getting enough exercise and stimulation on a daily basis. If you cannot provide him with a cat condo, get your cat a scratching post, and use interactive toys that allow him to chase, run, and jump. This should tire him out, removing some of the necessity to climb, scratch, and explore your furniture., Cats and dogs have a natural aversion to anything that smells or tastes like citrus or bitter apple.You can use this to your advantage as you train your pet to stay off counters or furniture. Use citrus-scented cleaning products on the counters you want to keep a cat off of, or spray a little citrus-scented oil or bitter apple on couches to keep pets off. (Just be sure that you don't ruin your furniture by spraying oil extracts on the cushions!) Dogs and cats are both repelled by these scents, and will stay away if you make certain environmental elements smell like these undesirable scents., If your pet tends to climb on furniture when you're not home (evidenced by lots of hair or scratch marks on furniture), consider getting a crate for your dog when you're not home, or confining your pet(s) to a designated area, like a bathroom or kitchen. You can also use baby gates to block access to certain rooms or pieces of furniture.Just be sure your animals have access to food and fresh, clean water, and aren't exposed to uncomfortable temperatures, no matter where you confine them.

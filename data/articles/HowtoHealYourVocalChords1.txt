 Make sure to consult your laryngologist first before using at-home remedies to heal your vocal chords. Your laryngologist will be able to diagnose the problem and prescribe a treatment for your specific case.For mild cases, your doctor may prescribe voice rest.
For moderate to severe cases, your doctor may prescribe cough depressants or antibiotics in addition to voice rest.
For severe cases, your doctor may prescribe surgery to fix the issue, especially if you have nodules on your vocal chords.;
, Depending on the severity of the damage, you should rest your voice for one to five days. To rest your voice you must avoid any kind of speaking, as well as activities that may strain your vocal chords like strenuous exercise and heavy lifting. Write things down if you need to communicate to others.If you must talk, then take a 10-minute break for every 20 minutes of talking.
Do not substitute whispering for talking. Whispering actually places more strain on your vocal chords than regular talking.Activities you can do while resting your voice are reading, breathing exercises, sleeping, and watching movies or TV.
 Drinking water will help keep your vocal chords lubricated, which can help promote healing. Keep a water bottle with you so you can refresh your throat whenever it feels dry.At the same time, you should try to avoid liquids that can prevent a speedy recovery such as alcohol, caffeine, and sugary drinks.
 Sleep also enables your vocal chords to rest and heal. Therefore, make sure you are getting at least seven hours of sleep each night while they are healing.If you are taking a day or two off from work or school to rest your vocal chords, try not to go to bed too late.

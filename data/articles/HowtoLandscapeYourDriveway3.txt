 Think of your driveway as one element in a larger picture, rather than its own canvas that’s entirely separate from the others. Use your home’s architectural style as a starting point and from there decide which ideas will complement that. Landscaping your driveway can be a huge investment of time and/or money, so avoid making impulsive decisions on design ideas that may end up clashing with your property’s overall aesthetic.For instance, gravel driveways may be more fitting for rustic or rural architecture, while pavers or brick would complement classic designs.
 Be aware that weather can have a huge impact on your driveway’s longevity. Whether it’s the driveway material or the vegetation used for borders, always research the product to find out if it’s well suited for your area. Moisture and freezing temperatures are two primary concerns in both instances, so definitely look into how well a given product will stand up to your region’s average precipitation, humidity, and freeze-thaw cycles.As an example, concrete is pretty susceptible to heavy damage if you experience heavy freeze-thaw cycles, while asphalt is more durable in these conditions.
 Whether you’re installing a new driveway or sprucing up your existing one, remember that what you choose to add to your property may require extended work long after the installation is done. For each option you’re considering, remember to factor in how much time and money it will cost you in the long run, not just upfront. Research the product’s durability as well as the labor and budget required to maintain your landscape, and then consider whether you’re willing to commit to it.

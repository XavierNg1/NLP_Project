 Measuring the package is important because it will determine whether or not you can ship the box through a private carrier such as UPS, DHL, or FedEx.
 Companies like UPS and FedEx list their dimension restrictions online. They often have an oversized package fee that is charged for packages over a certain size, and there may be a certain size or weight beyond which they cannot ship. Scheduling a pickup with these carriers can be done online.
 For packages that are too large for regular package carriers, you can ship the furniture through a freight company like Old Dominion. These companies usually require you to have a standing account before shipping, which can often be opened through their website.
 Some transit services also offer low-cost options for shipping large furniture. In the United States, Greyhound offers inexpensive shipping aboard its bus lines, but your recipient will have to pick up the furniture at a Greyhound station.

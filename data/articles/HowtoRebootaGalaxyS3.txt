Push down on the plastic part of the rear to slide the cover downwards, allowing you to lift the back cover to reveal the battery.
 Do this by lifting the bottom of the battery, prying it out of the battery slot.
 Wait a couple of seconds then put the battery back in. Remember to align the metal connectors of the battery to those in the battery compartment properly.
 Replace the back cover and slide the bottom part up again to lock it in.
 Press and hold the Power button until you feel the phone vibrate slightly, signaling that the phone is powering on.

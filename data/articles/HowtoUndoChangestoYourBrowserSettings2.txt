 You can find it from the Start menu or from the Quick Launch bar. #Go to Settings. Click the button with three horizontal lines at the upper right corner. This will open a submenu. Look for “Settings” and click on it. The Settings page will load. You can also directly go to this page by entering “chrome://settings/” in the address field.
 Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the “Show advanced settings” link to expand the Settings page. Further settings will be displayed.
 The last option is for “Reset settings.” Clicking the “Reset settings” button will restore all settings to their original defaults. Click on it, and a confirmation window will appear. Click the “Reset” button in the confirmation window. This will reset your homepage, search engine, extensions, temporary and cached data, and other browser settings.
 It is a good idea to restart your computer, or at least the browser, to have a clean start.

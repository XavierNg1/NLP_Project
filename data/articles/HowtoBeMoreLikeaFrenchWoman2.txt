 Washing your hair every day strips it of its natural oils, which can cause dry, brittle, flyaway hair. Instead, stick to a schedule of once every other day, or even once per week (if your hair permits). Use dry shampoo in the meantime, if necessary.


Ideally, your hair should have a smooth shaft. If your hair has a lot of split ends, cut off as much as needed to rid yourself of them., Whether your hair is curly, straight, wavy, or somewhere in between, embrace your natural texture. Instead of spending countless hours with curling irons or flat irons, play up your natural texture as much as possible.For curly hair, this might mean foregoing a routine of gel, blow drying with a diffuser, and styling.
Straight-haired girls can leave their hair down and let it sit straight, rather than faking waves or curls.
For natural hair, embrace your texture by avoiding the blow dryer and allowing your hair to air dry and fall where it naturally prefers.
 French women are not known for sleek, slicked-back hairstyles. Instead, they are usually associated with hair that looks a bit undone. Although this does not mean you can’t put your hair into a specific style, let some strands fall out of an elegant French twist, or embrace flyaways you might find in a low ponytail., Parisian cafes are filled with messy buns piled atop the heads of French women. The key to a messy bun is in its structure: rather than opting for a slick, ballerina-style bun, loosely coil your hair in a bun, pin it in place with some bobby pins, and you’re good to go.This particular style can be worn with shoulder-length and longer hair. Shorter hair is not likely to stay in.
 Although many countries boast young people with neon-colored strands, French women opt for either natural hair, or naturally colored hair, sticking in the neighborhood of blacks, browns, reds, and blondes. Highlights and ombre styles do make appearances, but are typically more subdued in appearance.

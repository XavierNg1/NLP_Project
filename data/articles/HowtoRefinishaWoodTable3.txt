 To get the look you're going for, it's important to apply it evenly and to get the excess off promptly (depending on the shade you desire, of course). Since you've put in the dirty work of stripping and sanding, it'll be thirsty for the stain, so time is of the essence. Once you have your stain on, grab a piece of cheesecloth to remove the excess. If it's still too light, just repeat the process once more, still maintaining an eye for evenness.








Apply at least 2 coats of stain, using a light grade sandpaper in between coats to smooth the surface of any fibers sticking up.













If you're looking to go green, liquid water-based stains should be your pick; they're better for the environment. They work much the same as oil-based stains, as more applications equals a deeper color. They're also very convenient in that they clean up well with only soap and water. The only downside is that they can raise the grain of the wood. To minimize this effect, dampen the wood with a moist, clean rag., The work's not quite done yet. You want to protect all your efforts with a coating of polyurethane, wax or tung oil. Polyurethane is the most popular option, but paste wax does a great job, too. The latter adds a warmth and protects from water damage, too.








The type of finish you choose is just a matter of your personal preferences. Penetrating oil finishes are soft, natural, and easy to apply, but offer less protection than varnish or lacquer. Polyurethane, on the other hand, is hard, durable, and comes in a variety of sheens (and Estevezes). Unfortunately, good as lacquers look, they take a bit of skill to apply on well. What's your confidence level like with this particular piece?Stain your table. Apply the stain liberally with a paintbrush. When brushing it on, go with the grain of the wood. Allow the stain to soak in for a few minutes and then wipe off the excess with a cloth. The longer a stain sits on the surface, the darker the hue will be.

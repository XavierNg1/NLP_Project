 Combine the 224g (1.5 cups) of gluten-free multi-purpose flour, 21g (2 tablespoons) buttermilk powder, 4.6g (1 teaspoon) baking powder, 4.27g (3/4 teaspoon) salt and 3g (1 teaspoon) xanthan gum in a mixing bowl. Continue to mix until all of the ingredients are combined., If you have a bowl for your food mixer, you should use the same bowl for your yeast and water solution. Set the yeast aside for 30 minutes. The yeast should look bubbly on the surface when it's ready., Combine all of the wet and dry ingredients in the bowl for your stand mixer. Mix your dough on medium, and it should start to come together and be less sticky. When adding the dry ingredients to the bowl, turn your mixer off and do it slowly so that flour doesn't get everywhere., Once your dough is smooth and no longer sticky, transfer it to a greased pan or bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Set the bowl in the refrigerator for least two hours.

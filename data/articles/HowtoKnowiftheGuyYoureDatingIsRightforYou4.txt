 After you determine your priorities and evaluate your relationship, you should reflect on your feelings. Think about how the relationship as a whole makes you feel. Pay attention to your gut. If you feel that the guy you’re dating isn’t right for you, consider ending the relationship.
 When you are trying to decide if your relationship is a good fit, it is important to reflect on both the negative and positive aspects of the relationship. Take a piece of paper and make two columns – one for positive things and one for negative things. After filling in each column, reflect on the relationship as a whole.


Positive aspects might include effective communication, mutual respect, and bringing out the best in you.
Negative issues might include emotional or physical abuse, not respecting your opinions, and not sharing common values or goals.
 Set aside some time to talk about your relationship. If you decide he isn’t right for you, use this time to explain to him that you don’t want to continue the relationship. If you think he is right for you but the relationship could use some improvement, utilize this time to talk to him about what is or isn’t working for you in the relationship.


Try saying, “John, I am really happy we are together, but feel there are some things we need to work on. Can we talk about how we communicate with one another?”
You can say, “Evan, I don’t feel you treat me with respect and we do not share common values. I think it would be best if we go our separate ways.”

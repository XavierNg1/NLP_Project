 Once you enter the door will shut behind you and a large beetle will fly in. You'll notice that its butt is shrouded in the purple smoke you saw earlier. After the cut scene ends he will rotate around in the center of the arena. When he stops, he will stab his horn at you. Dodge it and move to his rear.;
, Use your Whirlwind to blow out the purple smoke and attack his rear. He will get back up and the process will begin again. Do this two or three times.
 Once he's had enough, he will fly up into the air, making you think he's gone. No! He's back, and he really wants to kill you! He hovers in the air and he lays three Blastworms (blue spiky caterpillars) in the arena. Hit them to make them go into ball form

, When it shows like wind around him aim your Whirlwind at one of the Blastworms and line it up with him.
 When he is about in the center blow, time it right to blow his face up. He will fall on his back and freak out. Then is the time to attack his rear. He will get back up, so repeat this process about two or three times.
 Once you take the final hit, a cut scene will start. Once it is finished go up to the chest that appears and collect your brand new Heart Container! Step into the blue portal to leave.

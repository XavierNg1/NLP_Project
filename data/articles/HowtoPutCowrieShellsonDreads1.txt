 The width of the dreadlock needs to be small enough to fit into the front opening of the cowrie shell. Do not choose a dreadlock that is significantly smaller than the cowrie shell, though, since the shell could end up weighing down the hair and weakening the dread.


It will also be much easier to use a dreadlock with a tight end rather than one with a loose, fraying end.;
, Place the end of the dread over the front opening of the cowrie. Apply pressure to the front of the dread, forcing it into the opening and out through the back of the shell.


You can use your fingernail to apply pressure, but if this proves too difficult, use a long toothpick or pen to shove the entire tip of the dread through the hole in the shell.
Continue pushing the dreadlock through the hole in the shell until roughly 2 inches (5 cm) stick out through the back.
 Use your fingers to drape the dreadlock over the top of the shell and back down over the front of the shell.


The tip of the dreadlock should once more be positioned over the front opening of the shell in the same manner and placement as before. Essentially, the tip of the dread will form a full circle around the top of the cowrie.
 As before, push the hair into the opening of the shell and out through the shell's back.


Since you'll also need to maneuver the hair over the previous layer you already inserted, the use of a long toothpick or pen will probably be needed.
Make sure that the wrapped portion of dreadlock is wound tightly around the cowrie shell so that it stays secure.
 One cowrie shell is successfully attached to one dread. You can repeat this same process to put on as many cowrie shells as desired.


Since the cowrie shells are attached to the bottom of the dread, you will only be able to attach one shell to each dread.
This method is probably the simplest to perform, but it is also the most temporary.

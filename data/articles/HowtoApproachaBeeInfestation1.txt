 Careful observation is more likely to make sense of what is happening.;
, When bees swarm, it's so their colony can spread out into new areas. This means they minimize the risk that a single disaster will wipe out their gene pool at one location, and they increase their chances of survival. Nature benefits because this also increases the number of bees for pollination. There are also other reasons, but this is the main one.
 Bees not under human management, so called “feral bees”, cross breed and benefit from more defensive characteristics rather than increased productivity, therefore they tend to become more dangerous. Their poison is often more severe, and they more easily get angry. When they are difficult to handle, they can’t be checked for disease, and they can carry parasites that spread to healthy hives.
 It's really important that we protect the managed bees that we rely on for pollination and honey from bees that can easily bring serious problems, such as parasites or disease. It often means that feral bees need to be removed by someone with proper knowledge to do this safely. If he can't safely check them for disease, its better that they are put down. He may need a licence to use chemicals safely, to do this job. The best chemicals for the job are virtually non toxic to humans, anyway.
 Safe and careful intervention is essential for bee eradication that both prevents infestation and protects healthy bee populations. Further information follows.

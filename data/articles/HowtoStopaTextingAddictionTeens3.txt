 Recruit your parents to help you with your texting addiction. Explain to them that you are trying to text less and that you want them to monitor your usage. It might seem embarrassing or childish to ask your parents for help, but if they help you set ground rules and stick to them it will help you text less. You can also ask them to get mad or even punish you if they see you texting too much or if the number of texts you send each month does not go down.You could even make a deal where you have to pay them a certain amount for each text, and the money goes into a college account.
 You, or your parents, can change your phone plan so you text less. If you have an unlimited phone plan, you’re more likely to text too much. Change your phone plan to allow fewer texts and fewer data per month. This is a good way to force yourself to text less.
 Apps such as Kik, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messengers will only feed into your addiction since they can be used for free with Wi-Fi. Delete all of the messaging apps that you can off of your phone. You won’t be tempted to use them if they are not on your phone.
 Texting with an iPhone uses an app called iMessage. This uses the internet to text. Many other texting apps also use the internet to text. Turn your Wi-Fi off for at least some of the day so you are not tempted to text. Go into your phone settings and turn off your cellular data too. This way you will have no way of receiving and sending text messages through the internet.
 Although you will probably still feel the need to check your phone obsessively, turn off all texting notifications on your phone. On many phones you can make it so your phone does not make any noise, so nothing pops up on your screen, and even so there is no way of knowing at all that you got a new message unless you go into the texting app.

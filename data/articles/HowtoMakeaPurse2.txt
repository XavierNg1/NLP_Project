 The old adage "measure twice, cut once" holds true in sewing as much as it does in carpentry. In sewing patterns, watch for things such as "cut on fold" or instructions such as "cut two from fabric and two from interfacing."









Pin the pattern to your fabric to make cutting a little more fool-proof and easier to manage.
 Follow the pattern instructions carefully. Generally the author has put this purse together several times before and can save you a lot of time and wasted effort by providing the best instructions.









Don't throw away your extra material! Keep it for a matching coin purse or second patchwork project.
 This will aid in assembly and ensure evenly spaced seams.









This makes a temporary seam that is easily removed and re-done if the purse does not look the way you want. This will save you a lot of time in undoing a more tightly sewn seam if things go wrong.













You can baste by hand or by machine, depending on your circumstances and what you prefer.
 Remember that not all seams can be sewn by machine. You will have some hand work to do no matter which pattern you choose.
 Now you can add any embellishments you like to make your purse your own.









Consider ribbons, flowers, or pins to give it a signature look.

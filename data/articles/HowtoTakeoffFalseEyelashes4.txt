 False lashes don’t have to be tossed after a single use; if you clean and store them safely, they can be reworn a few more times depending on their condition. If your lashes aren’t missing any sections, are not bent along the lash line, and are generally clean and well-kept, you can clean them and save them for a future date.
 Get out a small bowl or cup, and fill it with ½ inch to 1-inch of oil-free liquid makeup remover. The makeup remover will dissolve any mascara or eye product on your false lashes, preparing them for the next use.
 Set the lashes n the dish so that they are totally covered in the makeup remover. Leave them to soak for 5-10 minutes, so that the remover has a chance to dissolve all the stuck-on makeup.
 Turn on a slow stream of warm water in your tap, and carefully rinse off the makeup remover on the lashes. Don’t rub or scrub at the lashes too much, as this could cause some of the individual hairs to fall out.
 Place the now-clean lashes on a dry tissue or towel, and leave them there to air-dry for 15-20 minutes. You may pat them gently with a tissue to absorb some of the excess water, if they are drying too slowly.
 Keep your lashes out of your regular makeup bag where they might get bumped around, and put them in a place where they won’t become damaged. If you have the original case the lashes came in, put them back in that for storage. Otherwise, place the lashes in a small bag or small container, and store them in a dry area until their next use.

 Think about which shape would best suit your design--tall and narrow? Fat and round? If you're going to use stencils, look for a pumpkin with a shape similar to the pattern you're going to carve.;
, The flesh should be firm, not elastic in any way. Inspect the entire pumpkin. Stay away from pumpkins with bruises, cuts, scratches or any signs of mold. If you'll be using stencils, steer clear of dents as well.
 Not all pumpkins will taste good in a pie. Sugar pumpkins are 200-250 millimeters (8-10") in diameter and will have smoother, less stringy flesh than a decorative pumpkin.
 Ripe pumpkins will make a "hollow" sound. If the pumpkin is on the vine, the vine should be dry and the stem should be hard and brown. The ripeness of the pumpkin might not matter as much if you're only interested in carving (in which case an unripened pumpkin might last longer).
 You don't want to choose a pumpkin for carving only to find that it won't sit up straight for you. If the pumpkin grew on its side and has a flat spot there, you might be able to incorporate it into your design or turn that side against a wall so it isn't seen.
 You can cut the vine on both sides of the stem and then later cut the stem carefully at home. This will help it keep longer. Obviously, this only applies if you're actually harvesting pumpkins.

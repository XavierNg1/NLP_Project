You want to be as conscious about what you put on your body, as you are about what you put into your body. Today it is understood that medicine travels through the skin - as long as the molecules are small enough. This is true for toxins and therefore also for moisturizers. Germinated Seed Extract has molecules that are small enough to go through the skin. Instead of merely ingesting the oils and having your body transport the molecules to the skin you can apply the oils directly.

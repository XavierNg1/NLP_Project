 Using a clarifying shampoo and skipping the conditioner creates the right conditions for dreads to begin forming. If your hair has too much oil or conditioning present, it won't begin to knot, or lock, into dreads.


Avoid shampoo that is marketed as "moisturizing," since this shampoo usually contains conditioning agents that remain in the hair after rinsing.
Stop using conditioner for at least a few weeks before you want to start dreading your hair.
 If you use chemical straighteners or another straightening technique, it will be much harder for your hair to start dreading. Let your hair be as natural as possible so your hair has the ability to knot.Â 

, Dreaded hair is simply hair that has knotted together into clumps. Every time you comb your hair, you prevent this from occurring by detangling it. When you're ready to dread your hair, put aside combs brushes and other implements you use to untangle your hair.
 You can facilitate the formation of neater dreads by separating your hair into even sections as your hair reaches the point where dreads will begin to form. The sections don't have to be completely even, since the beauty of the natural neglect method is that it requires little effort.
 If you want to help your dreads along, roll them between your palms so they stay together. Rolling a few times a week will help create neater, more uniform dreads - but again, this step isn't necessary if your goal is to go completely natural.
 Once the dreads have formed, continue shampooing your hair regularly to keep them in good shape. If you plan to go camping or participate in an activity that could get the dreads dirty, wear a hat to keep them clean.

 Choose a sunflower with bright, undamaged petals and pluck these petals off one by one using your fingers., Keep a layer or two of blotting paper above and below the petals. Place these sheets of paper, with the sunflower petals still inside, in between to pieces of stiff cardboard.

If you do not have blotting paper, you could use tracing paper, parchment paper, or clean paper towels, instead. None of these options will work quite as well as blotting paper, but they are decent alternatives.
Make sure that the petals do not touch one another. If they touch or overlap, they may end up sticking together, and you could cause the petals to break when you attempt to peel them apart.
 Place the petals-filled pieces of cardboard underneath a stack of books or other heavy object.

Alternatively, you can create an even more secure flower press with a few layers of cardboard and wooden press boards.If you do so, you will not need to place the petals beneath a heavy stack of books, and you can move the structure around as needed while the petals dry out.

Place cardboard or padded board below the blotting paper sandwich securing the petals and a second padded board above it.
Place a third padded board on top of the others.
Sandwich everything between two wooden press boards and hold the pressing structure together with rubber bands.
 Press the sunflower petals for a few weeks, disturbing them as little as possible during the process.

When you do check the petals after two or three weeks, remove the cardboard and blotting paper carefully and pick the petals up gently. If the petals still feel moist, lay out new blotting paper and continue pressing them for another few days to another week before checking again.

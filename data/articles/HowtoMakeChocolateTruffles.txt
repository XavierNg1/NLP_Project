 Place a medium cooking pan in a high heat and pour around 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water. Bring the water to a simmer.;
, Usually, following the lines on the chocolate will suffice, unless the bar is divided into very large pieces.
, Try to keep the bottom of the small pot from touching the water in the big pot.
 This step should take around 8 minutes.
 Do not remove the pan from heat; keep it at melting temperature and continue stirring until the cream is completely mixed with the chocolate.
,


Bring the water to a simmer again and place the pan containing the ganache on the heat once more.
Add the butter and stir to fully melt it. When done, turn the heat off and remove the pan.
 Line the surface of the ganache with plastic wrap (this prevents a film from developing at the surface). Put the bowl in the fridge until the mixture is stiff (about an hour).

Take the bowl from the fridge and place it in the work surface.






Place the cocoa powder into the medium bowl.






Use a melon baller, small ice cream scoop, or teaspoon to get small amounts of the ganache.






Make small balls, rolling them into the palm of your hands as quickly as possible before they melt too much.






Put them into the bowl with the cocoa powder and roll around until they are coated.






Place the truffles into a serving bowl or on a tray.

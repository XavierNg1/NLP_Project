You can buy already prepared colloidal oatmeal for the bath, or you can make your own. To make your own, purchase rolled oats, not the instant cooking variety, from your grocery store. Place 1 cup (236 ml) of rolled oats into a food processor, blender or other grinding device. Grind it until it has become a fine powder.;

Resist the urge to fill the tub full of hot water. Hot water will only exacerbate the itchiness of dry skin as it removes essential oils and moisture from the skin. Instead, fill the tub with water that is warm. Add enough water so that most of your lower body will be submerged, but don't overflow the bathtub.



As the tub is filling, add the colloidal oatmeal to the tub by pouring it slowly into the stream of water from the faucet. This will ensure that the oatmeal is evenly dispersed throughout the tub.



Carefully lower yourself into the warm water with the oatmeal in it. It can be slippery from the oatmeal so go slowly. Soak in the tub for 15 minutes or so, and then carefully get out of the tub.



Rather than vigorously drying your skin with a towel, pat yourself dry. Rubbing can further irritate skin and it will remove any moisturizing benefits from the oatmeal bath.



If necessary, you can take oatmeal baths up to 3 times per day. Your doctor may recommend taking them more often, depending on your particular condition.

 If the recipient is a big fan of fresh flowers, try a flower delivery service. Companies like H. Bloom, FTD, and 1800Flowers allow you to choose weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly deliveries. You can also talk to a local florist about setting up regular deliveries, which can be cheaper than using a subscription service., Companies like the Wine of the Month Club, the New York Times Wine Club, or the Craft Beer Company will send a selection of wine or beer to the recipient. The types of wine or beer, frequency of delivery, and price all vary by company, which gives you a lot of freedom to personalize the gift to the recipientâ€™s tastes., If you have a serious coffee-lover on your hands, consider signing them up for coffee delivery. Starbucks Coffee has a subscription service that sends one 8.8 ounce bag of Starbucks Reserve Coffee for one, six, or 12 months. Other companies like Intelligentsia Coffee or Stumptown Coffee Roasters give you a larger variety of coffees to choose from., You can try a meal delivery service like Blue Apron for the foodie in your life. Fresh grocery delivery from somewhere like Local Harvest or the Department of Agriculture CSA lets you send fresh, local produce to the recipient that they can use in their own recipes.

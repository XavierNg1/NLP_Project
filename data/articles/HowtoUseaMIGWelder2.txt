 You will need a full set of safety equipment to ensure your safety while welding. This includes gloves, masks, and protective clothing.


Make sure that all of your skin is covered to prevent overexposure from UV rays. You will need a mask with at least a #10 shade or darker. This will help prevent arc eye.
If you are working in a poorly ventilated area, you will need a vapor mask to minimize the amount of toxic vapors inhaled during the welding process.
Wear gloves that can protect your skin from molten metal.
Keep a CO2 extinguisher and a bucket of sand nearby for emergency fires.
 Some are shaped like pistols, while others may look like acetylene torches. The size of the machine will depend on the size of the project.


A MIG gun may also be water or air cooled. Air-cooled guns are used for 200 amps or less and are easier to manipulate in small areas. The air-cooled gun is the type that home MIG welders typically use.
 Remove all flammable material and find a good surface to weld on. Although you can put the ground connection right on the piece you are welding, most shops have a large metal workbench that the ground is hooked up to.


If there are other people present, set up welding curtains around the work area. This will protect them from UV damage.

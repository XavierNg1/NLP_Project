This option does not delete your conversations, stories, or saved chats. Clearing browser cache is similar to deleting your browser history and cookies.

This option does not delete your memories. When you view a memory, your device stores some data for easier and faster access to the image file. Clearing Memories Cache will only delete this data; you will not lose any of your memories.

 It is recommended to have a large aquarium, at least 2'4 feet (1.2 m) long, 1'5 feet (1.5 m) tall and 1'2 feet (0.6 m) width. As they get larger your cage sizes should change accordingly. Your iguana will continue to grow regardless of its cage size. Remember that height is most important but don't get a telephone booth shaped cage. Your iguana should be able to lay flat without being cramped.;
, Iguanas are a tropical reptile and therefore require a high humidity in order to shed properly and be over all more healthy. The Habba Automatic Misting Machine is a great mister than you can use from hatchling to adult! Don't forget the water dish!

,, They are cold blooded reptiles and can not properly digest their food. They should always have a basking spot which should be kept in the mid 90's. Heat rocks are NOT acceptable as the heat can not be regulated and may cause burns on the underside of your iguana. Without the proper heat source, your iguana WILL die.

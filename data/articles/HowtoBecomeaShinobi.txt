 Do you really want to do this? If so, read on.;
, This is important. Historical ninjas were tired of taking junk from the samurai, and they had to protect their families. Get into a similar frame of mind. Step into their shoes (tabi- we'll talk about this later).
 If you can't find one near you, don't have the money, or are a kid and don't want to ask your parents, find a website to assist you with locating a suitable school.


Your first and best shot is to find a teacher, (like Kakashi or Uruhara or a nice guy) or have a teacher find you. It matters not which one you choose, but keep in mind that each choice requires something different. It is recommended that you try ninjutsu or taijutsu first.
Some suggest joining a martial arts class to start (after you have a hold on things, you can move on).
 This is the art of moving freely and efficiently through your environment.
 See whether people notice you.
 The ninja uniform may not be necessary, but at least get tabi, which are the split-toed ninja shoes. Also, get weapons. Shuriken are available online, but check your local laws first.
 Be proficient with a bunch. The more weapons you have experience with, the better your odds in a fight.
 You'll be giving them a weapon, and you'll lose yours.
 You're more likely to fight someone who has a knife than a bo staff these days.
 Note that after the class training, which will take a few years you can start working on your "energy". This is a favorite of Naruto fans.
 It's okay to tell people you're a ninja, but make it seem like a joke. Don't let people find out that you are an actual ninja.
 If you want, handpick a group of friends to train them. Start a group of ninjas.
 You can't be a ninja unless you are emotionally ready to be one, that's because being a ninja/shinobi is not a game. Being a ninja means you now carry the responsibility of protecting someone, something, or somewhere.

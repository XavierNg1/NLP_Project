 An easy way to earn money with your social account is to sign up for major e-commerce partner program, like Amazon, Best Buy, Barnes and Nobles or Walmart.;
, It is handy to visit the "popular" section of the shop you want to promote. Try to understand what others would like to see and get to as wide public as possible. Do not post based on what you like, but what most of your friends do. If your public is mostly families with kids, try to pick child-related products.
 Keep it simple so your followers can read the most valuable information without clicking anything. Do not make it sound like advertising; try to make it natural. Explain in few words your experience with product or write a simple suggestion based on reviews that can be found online.
 You can use link shorteners like bit.ly to make your post looking more organized and clean. A shortener will make your affiliate link much more accessible and it will provide you with a lot of inside data and click numbers.
 Once your friends and followers purchase anything from the website that you suggested to them, you will earn a small commission. Just remember to not post such reviews to often to avoid your followers to get annoyed and even block you.

 Half-Elf, Human and Dragonborn are good race choices.;
,Â This is assuming that you are a beginner, so you should use the first option in your Player's Handbook which is to use the basic points which are 16, 15, 14, 14, 13, 12 (or something) or you can roll them up. Use 4d6 and roll them. Remove the lowest number and add up the rest. Do this six times. Assign your scores to your skills which are on your character sheet. Apply your racial skill points.
 As a paladin, your deity and alignment matter! Choose wisely! Also, choose your name and other things that go at the top of your character sheet.
 You take 2 at will powers (3 if you are a human), 1 encounter power and 1 daily power (2 if you are human). Also choose your channel divinity.
 You get 1 feat at 1st level. Choose well because the feat you choose will stick with you forever and ever and ever.
 You start with 100gp which you need to use to buy gear. As a paladin you should use plate armour and a longsword unless you want to do a lot more damage which you should use a feat for Wep. prof. and use the Bastard Sword. You should also go with a shield if you are using a two handed weapon. The longsword can be used two handed. Unless your DM specifies you should buy that standard adventurers kit along with the climbers kit. A ranged weapon and ammo for it is good as well.
 All you have to do now is fill out your other defenses and AC (armour class). After that you are ready to run your newly made 1st level character!

 Put the petroleum jelly in a microwave safe bowl. Cook for 30 seconds. Pull out the jelly and stir, checking the consistency. Keep cooking in 30 second bursts until it becomes a liquid.


Be careful as you pull the bowl out of the microwave. It will be very hot.
You can also melt the jelly on the stove in a double boiler. Place the jelly in a heat safe bowl over a pan of boiling water. Make sure the bowl is not touching the water. Stir until the jelly liquefies.;
, When the jelly is finally liquid, let it cool for a little bit. It needs to be close to room temperature. Pour the Kool-aid into the jelly. Stir until the crystals dissolve.


You can use any flavor or color of Kool-aid that you want. It just depends on what you like.
If you don't like Kool-aid or would like a more natural fruity alternative, mix in 1-2 teaspoons of fruit juice instead.
Don't wait too long. The jelly may re-solidify. If this happens, heat the jelly again.
 Pour your mixture into small lip gloss containers. Set the containers aside to cool. They should solidify in about two hours. Once the two hours pass, check the consistency. If they are still too runny, allow them to set for another hour.


This number of containers of lip gloss will vary depending on the size of the containers you use. Look for the kind of container you want in your local craft store.

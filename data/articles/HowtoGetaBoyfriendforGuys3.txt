 Once you have completed the steps above, you have been on a few dates, and you feel like things are going well, it is a good idea to be honest about your feelings. While it may take time to fall in love, you may quickly have strong enough feelings to start dating more seriously, which of course could lead to being boyfriends. It may be a little scary, but it could be worth it because being in a great relationship can contribute to a happier and more fulfilling life., Once you have gotten past the initial stages of getting to know each other, be honest about your feelings. If your feelings are growing deeper, it is perfectly fine to share that information.
 A relationship is a two-way street and it is important to truly listen to him too, instead of just talking about how you feel. Participate in active listening,which is the process of listening to him so that you truly hear what he is saying as opposed to listening in order to simply respond in your favor.


If you share your feelings and he does not feel the same way, do not get upset or worry about it. When someone does not reciprocate your feelings, it does not mean that you are a bad person or that you are not good enough, it just means that you were not compatible.
 Not all relationship are healthy relationships.It is important to pay attention to any red flags that you may see during the infancy stages of your relationship. Issues such as uncontrollable anger or abusive communication are things that you want to pay attention to because they are not part of a healthy relationship.


Introduce him to your close friends and family if you feel comfortable doing so. Sometimes they will notice potential problems that you cannot see.
 If you like him but you have minor concerns, it is perfectly fine to have a conversation with him about your concerns so that they can be resolved before you move forward with the relationship.

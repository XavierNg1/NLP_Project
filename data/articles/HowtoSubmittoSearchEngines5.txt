,,, Here you will find multiple categories that can help pinpoint where your site fits in. Try to narrow it down as much as you can for better results.
 If you don’t see the button to click, chances are that the category is still too broad or is no longer accepting submissions. Narrow your path or choose a slightly different one until you see the “Suggest URL.” button displayed.
 From there, simply enter your regular URL (http://www.mywebsite.com), the title of your site (usually the name of your site or company), a brief description (30 words maximum), email address (preferably from your website) and their character code to ensure your humanity. Then click “Submit.”


This process can take a while, maybe even 3 – 4 months. Don’t worry about re-submitting for at least six months. By then your website will be full-fledged with valuable content.

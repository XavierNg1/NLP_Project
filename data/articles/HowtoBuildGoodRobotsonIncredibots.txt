 Choose what you want to make. A detailed car? Something breakable? A Rube Goldberg machine (RGM or RGB)? Once you've decided, move on.;
, Most users don't have the inspiration halfway they're building the contraptions and bots, and quit.
 If you're building a car, then start making the frame. If you're making something breakable, build the central piece. For a Rube, make the starting contraption.
 Such as filling in a car's frame, pieces of something breakable, or making more of your rube.
 Shading, 3D stuff, or anything else to make it look cool.
 Remember, people have reputations, and you can get a good one by helping people to fix bots, making really good ones yourself, and by spending lots of time on IB. Good luck!

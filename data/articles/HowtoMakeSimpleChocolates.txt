Melt the chocolate in a microwavable container.
Mix the crumbled Madeira cake and melted chocolate together. They should make a thick, coarse paste.
Roll them into balls about the size of your eyeball. You have made a basic truffle.
Roll your truffles around in the bowl of cocoa powder. Make sure they are covered completely.
Leave them to set on a tray or in a bowl but make sure they are not touching or your truffles may become deformed.
When the truffles are fully set dunk them in the melted chocolate.
When the chocolate is set, drizzle the melted chocolate to decorate the truffles. Try different colors.;
, The amount of time may vary according to the power of your microwave, so keep checking and stirring the chocolate.
Brush the melted chocolate gently around the inside of the cake cases. Paint it thinly and assure that the chocolate gets inside all the grooves. Once you've done all 20-30 petit-fours cake cases the first one you painted should be dry. however you should still check. Repeat this roughly four times until the edge of the chocolate inside the cases is about 4mm.
When you are absolutely sure the chocolate is set, peel off the paper cases and discard.
The truffles should be set after about one hour of being put aside. When they're set place them inside the chocolate cases and you're done.
 When the petit-fours are finished, decorate them by rolling them in different color powdered cocoa, or drizzle them with different color chocolate.

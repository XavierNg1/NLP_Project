 Communicate openly with them, and let them know you care about them and are interested in what is going on in their life.


All people, especially teens, need to feel loved. Regardless of how independent or averse to you they seem, they still need positive, reassuring attention from you.
 If they are involved in sports, clubs, or other positive activities, be supportive of them so they can be as successful as possible in what they are doing. Knowing they have a fan will encourage them to pursue these positive goals.


You may need to be rather obvious with your support. In research, teens often misread facial expressions; when shown pictures of adult faces expressing different emotions, teens most often interpreted them as being angry. This is because teens use a different part of their brain to identify emotion.
 Your teen may have trouble having you as an outlet but a certified therapist can be a healthy alternative.


Consult your spouse or a close family member for their opinion. If therapy seems necessary, talk to your son/daughter first. If they are opposed, make clear the benefits of therapy and explain that there are no stigmas attached - in fact, no one will have to know.

Choose a therapist that specializes in teenagers with troubling issues. Each therapist has a specialty and doing your research beforehand will maximize the possible effectiveness of your child's therapy.

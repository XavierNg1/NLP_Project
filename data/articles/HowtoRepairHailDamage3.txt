 If you were out and unaware of a hail storm, check your past weather forecast. This can be a simple confirmation of whether your property was subject to hail. Hail can damage the roof of a house just as dramatically as your vehicle.
 Hail will have a different effect to the different types of roofs. For asphalt shingles you'll notice random damage with no succinct pattern. The hail impressions will probably be black in color. You might also notice a loss of granules and the asphalt will appear shiny., Again like the asphalt shingles, hail causes random damage without a clear pattern. Look for a split in the shingle that is a brown/orange color. Also look for splits that have sharp corners or splits that have little to no deterioration around the edges., Clay tiles, also known as terra cotta roofs, commonly feature multiple fractures centered around a common impact point. The most sensitive sections of the roof are the corners and the overlays along the edges of the tiles.Clay tiles are easy to spot because they usually have a clear break.
 Metal paneled roofs will rarely be punctured by hail. This style of roof is one of the sturdiest made. They seldom become dented because of the material and its proximity to the surface below. Youâ€™ll experience functional damage if the seams or edges of the panels become damaged. This will allow moisture to seep through.Metal shingles damage much like asphalt shingles, and are much less resilient than metal panels.

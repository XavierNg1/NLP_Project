 Leeks, potatoes, and chicken broth are the main ingredients in this tasty soup.
 Use soy milk and Brewer's yeast to substitute the traditional use of eggs in this healthy vegan dish. Just combine the leeks along with a few other ingredients, saut√© them lightly, and then bake them in an oven.
 Heat 2 tbsp. of olive oil on a pan and add 1/2 a clove of minced garlic after one minute. Let the garlic cook for 2-3 minutes and then add 1 bunch of diced carrots and 1 bunch of diced turnips to the mixture. Cook them for another 3-4 minutes and then add 1 bunch of diced leeks to the mixture. Cook the veggies until they're tender, for another 3-4 minutes, and then season them will salt and pepper to taste and serve them.
 Heat 4 tbsp. of butter and 1 clove of minced garlic in a large skillet for 2 minutes and then add 4 diced tomatoes, 1 bunch of thinly diced leeks, 1/2 diced red onion, 1 tbsp. of pepper, 1 tbsp. of salt, and 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the pan. Continue to cook the ingredients for 5-7 minutes, until the leeks and tomatoes are tender and all of the ingredients are incorporated. Place the pasta sauce over whole wheat pasta and top it with 1/2 a cup of Jack cheese and 1/4 cup of chopped parsley.
 Boil, fry, or poach the leeks and then serve them up with a simple baked salmon, broiled chicken, or tuna steak. Add mashed potatoes to this combination for a complete, healthy, and tasty meal.

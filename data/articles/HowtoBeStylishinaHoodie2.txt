 A popular look is the combination of the casual hoodie with something a little fancier, like a dress or miniskirt. The contrast creates an edgy vibe that trendsetters lean toward. Try wearing a zip-up fleece hoodie with a long flowing dress with a girly print, such as a floral. To up the contrast even more, add a pair of combat boots.You can also try it with a short, flouncy cocktail dress or lace skirt., Hoodies make great outerwear all by themselves, but they can look more stylish (and keep you even warmer) if you wear one under a nice jacket. Try wearing a black hoodie underneath a black leather jacket. Make sure you pull out the hood, so that it’s visible and hangs down in the back, on top of the jacket. If black leather isn’t your style, try wearing a gray hoodie under a denim jacket. It’s important that you still pull out the hood so that it’s visible, though.
 This is another trendy style that uses contrast to make a statement. Opt for a slim-fit hoodie, and pair it with skinny jeans or pants that are structured to have a well-tailored look, such as dress trousers. You can even make a slim-fit black hoodie work at the office if you wear it with a pair of nice dress slacks in a neutral color, like gray.


The hoodie gives your overall look an athletic-wear vibe while still creating a sleek silhouette that looks dressy enough to be considered business casual.

 If you have a lemon, squeeze in some lemon juice for good measure. The lemon juice acts as a bleaching agent -- it doesn't technically remove the dye, but it can maximize the effects.
 Rub it onto the affected area until the stain has lifted. This might take some time if you have an ample amount of dye on your skin. Be patient.









If most of it has lifted, but it seems to have stopped working, apply more of your concoction to the washcloth. Stay diligent!

, Baking soda may dry out your skin, so apply lotion to the covered area when finished. This is especially important if your skin is sensitive.

If you've got a waist, make the most of it: it gives hourglass figures balance and makes you the envy of all those women with no shape!
If you have no waist, go for a large jacket with a belt to give the illusion of one - it's very flattering.;

"For every centimeter of heel you lose a kilo in weight," according to Marina Rinaldi. Heels make you taller, longer and leaner, but they can tire you out quickly, so go for boots during the day and save your stilettos for the evening if you struggle with foot ache. A good advice: High heels and a suit with a belted jacket can make anyone look instantly slimmer.



Follow your curves. Jennifer Lopez has a classic curvaceous figure and knows how to work it, but remember: no two curvy girls are the same.
If you have a toned, peachy derriere like Jen, go for a dress that will cling in all the right places to show them off.
If you have real authentic 1950s curves, nip your waist in to show them off.
If you're tall, put your legs on display in shorts. The golden rule is never to hide your curves but to dress them up subtly.



All the stick insects within a 3-mile radius are jealous of your jugs and men just can't help but stare. So make the most of your assets without going weird - you wouldn't want to make anyone else feel inadequate, naturally... Go for dresses with plunging necklines, open blouses, trench-style coats and jackets to show off your decollete.

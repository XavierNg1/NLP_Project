 Make it high so you can make the piñata seem like its hanging.

It is impossible to wear a blindfold in Minecraft, so to make the piñata breaking part seem realistic, make the room as dark as possible.;
, Don't make it too big. Just 6 stone blocks will do. Put one for the base. Leave its upper space empty and put the 4 other blocks on the other sides. Drop the items you want to put inside. Then put a stone block above the items, still leaving the center space empty.

If you want it easier to break, you can use wood blocks for the piñata.
To make it look like its hanging, use fence to attach it connect it to the ceiling.
The base of the piñata should be 4 blocks off the ground.

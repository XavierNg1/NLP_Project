 If you donâ€™t remember whether you had the chickenpox or not, you were born after 1980, and you do not have family members who can remember, your doctor can draw a blood titer. This is a blood test that measures the antibodies in your blood for the chickenpox virus.


If you were exposed to the chicken pox and had the illness, even if it was a very mild case, then you will have antibodies in your blood that will protect you from getting it again.
 There are some people who should not have the vaccine to protect from chickenpox because of other medical issues.You can discuss your medical history with your doctor to determine if you should not have the vaccine. In general, you should not get the vaccine if you:


Have had an allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine
Are pregnant
Have allergies to gelatin or neomycin
Have an immune system disease
Have received a high dose of steroids
Are undergoing any treatments for cancer with x-ray, drugs, or chemotherapy
Have had a transfusion or received blood products within the last 5 months

, Getting vaccinated against the chickenpox can also protect you from contracting the disease. Although most research has been done on vaccinations prior to exposure to the virus, vaccination after exposure does offer some effective protection.However, it is important to get the vaccine within five days of exposure to the illness for best results.If you have not had the chickenpox nor received the vaccination, speak with your physician about being vaccinated.
Some people who get the vaccine will get a mild case of chickenpox with fewer blisters than normal and often no fever at all.The vaccine is made from live or weakened viruses.Children get the vaccine at 12-18 months and another dose between 4 to 6 years old. The most common side effects of the vaccine are pain, redness or swelling at the site of the injection. A small percentage of the children and adults who get the vaccine will also develop a mild rash around the spot where the shot was given.

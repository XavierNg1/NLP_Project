 You will need enough metal to form a bomb casing, explosive lenses, enough enriched uranium or plutonium to produce (at least) a 10 kiloton explosion, and a rocket, launch pad and satellite to get the stuff into space. oh, almost forgot - you'll need a radio detonator for the explosives, with enough range to send a signal into space., The explosion from the bomb will create a very big, high-power EMP. Connect the bomb to the detonator.,,, Make sure that any space stations and other satellites and stuff are outside the blast radius., The gamma rays from the explosion will interact with the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field and generate an EMP. If you build a big enough bomb, the EMP can affect an entire continent.

 Preventing infection, which may lead to the recipient’s body rejecting their new kidney, is vital. In particular, remind them to wash their hands after eating, handling food, touching anything unclean, or going to the restroom.Wash your own hands before spending time with them as well.
 If possible, a transplant recipient should avoid direct contact with pets, especially for a few months following the procedure. Never allow the recipient to handle pet waste with bare hands, and convey that it’s important for them not to do so.If you take care of pet waste for them, wear gloves and mask. Dispose of everything in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.
Ask the transplant coordinator for more information about pets in the recipient’s home.
 Other people, especially in large groups, can cause a risk of infection for someone following a transplant. During the eight weeks following the procedure, instruct the recipient to keep house guests to a minimum. Anyone with a cold or other infection should be kept away from the recipient. Young children should also be kept away from recipients for this time period.Do not allow the recipient to eat from a salad bar or buffet.
Instruct the recipient to avoid churches, theaters, malls, and other places with large numbers of people.
 If any signs of infection arise, contact the post-transplant coordinator immediately. You may need to bring the recipient to the hospital immediately. In particular, watch out for the following:High fever or flu-like symptoms, including chills, aches, dizziness, or nausea and vomiting.
Pain or tenderness in the abdomen.
Noticeable swelling elsewhere on the body, or sudden weight gain greater than 4 pounds within 24 hrs.
A substantial decrease in the need to urinate.

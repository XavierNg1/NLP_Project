 Include doors and windows in your drawing as well. Leave enough room in the drawing to write down measurements.
 To calculate the area of a wall, use the standard (Width) x (Height) = Area formula.Using a measuring tape, measure the width and height of the wall. Since walls can be tall, you might want to ask a friend or neighbor for help holding the measuring tape. Record the measurements on your drawing.
 Using a calculator, multiply the length and width. This will equal the total square footage of the wall. Write this number down.
 Record the length and width of any doors or windows on your drawing.
 Use a calculator to multiply the length and width of any doors or windows present. Record each individual total. These measurements indicate the square footage of any doors, windows, or fixtures.
 This only applies to walls that have more than one door, fixture, or window. Write this number down.
 Use a calculator for this step, too. This number equals the square footage of the wall, and you can use this square footage to buy paint or wallpaper.

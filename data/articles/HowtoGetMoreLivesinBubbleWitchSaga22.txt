 When you launch the game, you will see your available lives inside the heart on the header menu.


You can have a maximum of five lives. If you still have five lives, you won’t be able to add more.
 If you’ve run out of lives, click the plus sign beside the heart on the header menu. This will bring out a window for “Get more lives,” and the options for getting more lives will be listed.
 A set of five lives costs 10 Gold Bars. This is clearly indicated in the button below “Ask friends!” If you want to get your full set of lives immediately so you can continue playing, click the green button with 10 Gold Bars.


Your Gold Bars balance will be reduced by 10, and you will have a full set of five lives.
Note that Gold Bars cost you real money; 10 Gold Bars cost $1.

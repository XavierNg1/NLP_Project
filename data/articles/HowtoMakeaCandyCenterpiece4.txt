 You'll need two vases. One should be a hurricane or other large-style vase, preferably with a stem. The other vase should be a straight-sided cylinder that fits into the first vase. The second vase doesn't need to be quite as tall as the first one, but if it's not, you'll need a small ramekin to go underneath. You'll also need small candies in colors of your choice and flowers to fill the smaller vase., Place the ramekin in the bottom of the larger vase if your smaller vase is too short to reach the top of the larger vase. Place the ramekin bottom-side up. Set the smaller vase on top of the ramekin. Make sure both are centered in the larger vase., Pour candy in between the smaller vase and the larger vase. Try layering colors for a more interesting effect. For instance, for a Christmas vase, you could add a layer of green candy, then a layer of red candy, and finally, a layer of white candy. Keep layering the candy until you reach the top of the vase., The final step is to fill the smaller vase. You can use silk flowers as the center, though fresh flowers will also work if you're careful. You can also simply fill the middle vase with a different kind of candy, so that guests can snack on them.Add a ribbon for a sophisticated touch.

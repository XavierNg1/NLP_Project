 If you've got a record, get a record player, If you've got a tape, get a tape player, etc. Odds are if you have the media you've already got the media reader, but if not you'll need to get your hands on one.;
, That's a fancy way of saying a headphone jack, though there are more kinds of audio outs than just your run-of-the-mill headphone jack.
 Not surprisingly, this is done with an "audio in" port, which is a fancy way of saying microphone jack. Some computers have audio in ports built into their sound cards, but most modern Apple computer designs have opted for a built-in microphone instead. Fortunately there are peripherals that can help. A good, but not the only, device to use would be the iMic USB audio adapter (see tips).
 This uses the simplest hardware of the whole thing, a wire. A male-to-male stereo audio cable is really all you need for this step (see tips). There are lots of types of audio cables in the world, so be sure your cable is the same format as your ports.
 (Note: Connecting some record players directly to the audio input will yield unsatisfactory results. See warning below.)

, You are going to want some sort of program that can record from your "line in." (the line in is what your computer calls the microphone data). A good free program that should work well is Audacity. Another good user-friendly and capable program is Audio Hijack, but this will cost you money.
 This differs from program to program, but it shouldn't be too hard if you read your user manuals. If all else fails, check your system preferences to see if your computer is still trying to record from the built-in microphone.
 That means record in stereo with a high bit rate. If you can choose an encoder, go for .mp3 or .aac, and if you'd like you can use .lossless for extra high quality (see tips).
 If everything is connected properly and all your software is functioning well, then it should all be recording onto your computer.
, iTunes is good at doing that sort of thing.

 Lana sports vintage as well as hipster looks. She often changes her image, but usually relies heavily on mid-to-late century Americana.One of the most iconic Lana styles is 60’s style vintage dresses. Shirtwaist and circle skirt dresses are a good place to start.
Try a modern Nancy Sinatra look with A-line skirts paired with a cardigan, knee-high socks and mary-janes, knee-high boots, flower accessories, and sundresses paired with cowboy boots.
Rock an 80’s inspired bad-girl look with t-shirts tied at the waist, high-waisted and acid-wash jeans, cutoff shorts, leather pants and skirts, big gold jewelry, and plenty of neon prints and accessories.
Visit a local thrift shop to look through vintage clothing and put together unique outfits. Consult some pictures of your favorite Lana Del Rey looks for inspiration as you shop.
 Lana sports hair that ranges from retro beehives to teased-up 80’s curls but no matter what decade she’s pulling from, her hair is often done up big.For a vintage vibe, pull your hair up into a beehive and accessorize it with a cute headband or ribbon.
For a more 80’s look, try a perm or tight curls teased up and out with a side part.
One of Lana’s more iconic hairstyles is big waves swept to one side. Achieve this by using a large diameter curling iron along a side part and brushing the curls out slightly.
Lana is also known to wear flower crowns to accessorize her wavy tresses. Pair the crown with the side-swept waves look for special occasions.
 Lana has several tattoos on her body. Mimic her tattoos by drawing the letter “M” or the word “paradise” on your left hand with a body art marker.


Another option is to draw “trust no one” on your right hand.
The phrase “die young” is tattooed on her ring finger.

 Use a bread knife to slice it into slices thin enough to fit into your toaster, but substantial enough to hold together when you butter it or use it as part of a sandwich.


Keep in mind that the thinner you make the slices, the more quickly the bread will toast, and the crisper it will turn out.
You can toast thick, hearty slices in the oven if they won't fit in your toaster., If you're looking for a quick, convenient, and effective toasting method, nothing beats a toaster. Load the bread into the slots, change the setting to your preferred level of doneness, and push down on the knob that lowers the toast into the toaster and turns it on. When the toast springs back up, it's ready to eat.


Be careful when you remove your bread from the toaster. You might need to let it cool for a moment if it's too hot to touch.






Never stick a knife or fork into a toaster to extract the toast. Unplug the toaster and remove the toast.
 This adds a tasty gourmet touch, since nothing beats the texture of oven-toasted bread. Turn on the broiler in your oven and let it preheat. Place your bread slices on a baking sheet. Put the baking sheet under the broiler for two to five minutes, or until the bread is toasted to your preferred level of doneness.


For extra delicious toast, try buttering the bread before you broil it.






You can also melt cheese on the bread to make a great afternoon snack.

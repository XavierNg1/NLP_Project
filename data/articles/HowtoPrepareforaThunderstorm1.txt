 Plan to stay indoors whenever a thunderstorm is approaching. For severe thunderstorms, designate a safe place in your house where your family can gather. Choose a location that’s away from windows, skylights, and glass doors.Make sure you plan for your pets as well. If possible, designate a family member to bring your pets inside during a thunderstorm.;
, Cut away any dead or rotting tree branches as soon as you notice them. Similarly, remove any dead trees in your yard. Thunderstorms produce high winds that can topple weak branches and trees, causing property damage, injury, and death.


Check your local government website to find out how to dispose of dead tree debris properly. Each city has different rules and you could be fined if you don’t follow them.
If you don’t want to prune your own trees hire a tree service to do it for you.
 Patio furniture, grills, smokers, and flower pots can become lethal projectiles in high winds.If possible, secure the outdoor furniture with cinderblocks or strong tethers. Otherwise, create a plan that allows you to quickly store the outdoor objects in a gardening shed.


Practice storing the items and time yourself. Try to do it as quickly as you can. It’s better to be indoors with unsecured outdoor furniture than caught outside in a storm.

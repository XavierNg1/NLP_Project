When deciding on your color scheme, you can disregard your baby's gender as a defining factor., The ocean is comprised mainly of gray and blue shades. Therefore, rely on this for your main color scheme. Carpets, walls, and furniture should be in varying shades of grays and blues.There is no need to use one shade.

If you feel blue is too gendered of a color, you can stick to varying shades of gray or use a more grayish blue to downplay the gender factor.
 There are many other colors found in the ocean. Hints of shades caused by the reflection of the sun can give your nautical nursery some added flavor. Try throwing in splashes purples, pinks, and greens throughout your nursery.For example, you could have a dresser with sea-green knobs or a changing table with pink polka dots.
Decorations can also follow the color scheme. When selecting things like mobiles and stuffed animals, go for ocean-based colors.

 You'll find the icon among your frequently-used applications or wherever you've chosen to store it (e.g. on your desktop). Click the icon to open the browser.
 Begin by clicking on the gear icon at the top, righthand corner of your browser window. Then select "Internet options" from the dropdown menu that subsequently appears.
 Select the "Security" tab under "Internet options." Then click on the "Custom level..." button. This will take you to a number of advanced settings, including your preferences associated with JavaScript.
 Under the "Scripting" section, check the status associated with "Active scripting." It will show a checked circle next to one of three options: Disable, Enable or Prompt. The circle next to "Disable" will be checked if JavaScript is in fact already disabled. Simply check the circle if you wish to adjust your preference and then click "OK" when finished. Selecting "Prompt" will show you a warning before interacting with a website using JavaScript.

 The first step in any septic installation is to perform a site survey and do a percolation (soil) test on the area where the POWTS is going to be installed. The system then can be designed based on the findings of the survey and results of the soil test. After this, the appropriate permits and approvals can be applied for.


Site survey findings that influence the design include things like:

available space
topography
intended purpose and perceived water use based on the size of the dwelling/building the system will service.


location of the well and/or neighboring wells.
Soil test findings that influence the design include things like:

soil type and layering (sand, clay, rock, and where it is located relative to depth)
ability of the soil to drain and filter wastewater.
 Upon receipt of the necessary permits and approvals, the system can be installed. Be sure to perform the following procedures in compliance with any and all laws and applicable plumbing and building codes.

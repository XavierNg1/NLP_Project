 You’ll be fighting Moldorm on a platform that has a hole. Moldorm will attempt to knock you through that hole and to lower levels.


If you do fall down, then Moldorm will recover all of his health, so keep a close eye on where you are on the platform, and where he is. Keep moving in order to ensure that you don’t get knocked off.;
, It is a tool that can be purchased from Ravio’s shop for 800 Rupees. It is extremely useful in this fight because using the hammer on Moldorm (anywhere on his body) will stun him. Therefore, you should make sure that you have the hammer with you.


Press X or Y to use the equipped item (in this case, the hammer).
 The only way to actually damage Moldorm is by hitting the red dot at the end of his tail. This is why the hammer is so useful. If Moldorm is stunned, it will be significantly easier to manage attacking his tail.


Watch his movements, and position yourself as best as you can so that you press “A” to swing your sword and attack the red dot.
 Keep following all of the above steps, and you will eventually defeat Moldorm. It may sound like a lot to juggle, but it really is about being patient.


Watch your surroundings, track Moldorm’s movements, and be ready to strike (either with the hammer by pressing "X" or “Y” or with your sword by pressing “B”) when the opportunity presents itself.

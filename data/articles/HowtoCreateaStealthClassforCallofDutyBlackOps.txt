 If you want to remain undetected when firing, this attachment is a must!;
, For your Perk 1 slot, Ghost will help hide you from those pesky spy planes, and the Pro version will make you invisible to any Attack Helicopters, Chopper Gunners, and Gunships.
 For your Perk 2 slot, Scout will help anyone who'll be doing some long distance sniping, since it doubles the time you can hold your breath. If not, Sleight of Hand would help make sure you can aim at the enemy before he does and not get caught with a slow reload. If you're having trouble aiming down the sights, switch Sleight of Hand with Warlord so you can have a Suppressor and Red Dot Sight.
 For your Perk 3 slot, Ninja will help you get close to the enemy without him hearing your footsteps. If you're afraid of any Motion Sensors spotting you, Hacker Pro would help keep you hidden from them.

 Cotton is a good choice because it is easy to care for yet long-lasting.;
, Add an additional 1 1/4 inch (3 to 4 cm) to the measurements to allow for the seams. Also allow a bit of added material if you're going to include a zipper or other closure on the slipcover.
 Do this by measuring how long the longest slipcover sections will be. Add these together, then divide by 36 inches (90 cm). Many fabric shops have printed guidelines for figuring out the amount of material needed for slipcovers.
 Wash and dry the material in the same manner that you'll use on the completed slipcover. This step does not apply if the slipcover will be dry cleaned.
 Be sure you're marking the down side, also called the wrong side or inside, of the fabric. Mark the fabric for the largest sections first, then fit in the small sections where you can. Label the sections so you'll know where they go.

Hold the fabric sections up to the furniture. Pin the seams together so the right sides face each other, following the lines of the furniture underneath.
Make sure the seam allowance is uniform. Insert the pins approximately every 2 inches (5 cm) along the lengths of seams.
Make the task easier by poking T-pins into the furniture to keep the slipcover material from slipping while fitting the sections together. Eventually you'll have the slipcover completely pinned together inside out and atop the furniture.
 Take out the pins as you proceed. Start by sewing all the seams that "dead end" into, or connect into, other seams. After you're finished sewing, flip the slipcover over so that it's no longer inside out.


Add decorative cording to the slipcover, if desired. Cover cord with leftover fabric. Sew the covered cord onto prominent seams that you want emphasized. Fabric for the cording should be 1 1/4 inch wide (3 to 4 cm).
 Correct any errors, if necessary.

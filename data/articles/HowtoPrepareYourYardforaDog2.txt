 To prepare your yard for a dog, remove all garden poisons, insecticide, and fertilizers. These chemical-based products can cause gastrointestinal irritation, drooling, seizures, and even death if ingested. Opt for natural, non-harmful options instead (e.g. canola oil to repel instincts and caffeinated coffee to kill slugs.), There are a number of common plants that, when ingested, can be fatal to dogs. Visit the Pet Poison Helpline's website at http://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/poisons/ for a list of substances that are poisonous to dogs, as well as the signs of poisoning to look for. Some plants to watch out for are:Azalea
Daffodil
Hyacinth
Oleander

, It is important to make sure your yard is flea and tick free to keep your pet healthy and prevent it from bringing them into the house. Keep grass trimmed and neat (since ticks thrive in tall grass) and keep the yard swept and free of clutter. Remove any garbage cans from the yard that would attract rodents, which may also carry fleas and ticks.Eliminating clutter will also help to keep snakes that could be harmful to your pet away from the yard.

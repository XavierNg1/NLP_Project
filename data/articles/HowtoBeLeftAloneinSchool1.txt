 Bullies often try to control others’ emotions. Instead of giving them the power they are attempting to exert over you, simply walk away. Avoid responding to bullies by retaliating in the same way you are being bullied, like resorting to violence or verbal abuse.Simply ignore the bully when walking away or politely tell them that you are not interested in what they have to say.;
, Finding a friend to accompany you while walking to and from class, or around the school during lunch and breaks, will help deter bullies from approaching you. Let your friends know if there is a specific individual you feel you need to avoid, or if you generally feel uncomfortable being completely alone.Have your friend meet you at your class so that you can be accompanied the entire time you are walking.
Set up routines with your group of friends, like meeting at the same place at the same time everyday.
 Taking a position of empathy and trying to understand someone else is not always easy, especially if they are bullying you. However, it can be useful to think of the bully’s perspective to see what other factors or elements might be causing them to act the way that they are.


Ask yourself questions, like “How would I respond if something like that happened to me?” or “How would I feel if I had their experience?”

, Find a trusted adult, like a parent, teacher, instructor, or school counselor to report the bully to. Getting others involved will bring you one step closer to ending conflict with whoever is bullying you. Adults can often find ways of dealing with bullies without letting the bullies know who told on them.


Be sure to immediately report all threats to your well being.

 Or you could pick a common topic that's regularly associated with the public, like "mean" cliques in middle school or a "Cinderella" like story, and add a twist to it. Just make sure that people will not be annoyed by that. Another method that works is to pick a few key words of the theme your story will be and write them down. For example, a few words of the theme of your story could be "scary", "horror", and "terrifying". It's basically the mood of your story, the theme of it and what "feeling" it sets off to your readers.
 If you want to base your story towards younger people, write about youthful topics. If your age group is based towards older people, it is better to write about more mature topics. Don't write about callow topics if you're basing your story towards older people. However, keep in mind, some older people do like younger story topics.
 Make sure the characters relate to your story and try to mix it up a little. Like you could have a bizarre character be in a professional business. You can write a whole profile for your characters, or you could just keep it simple by just writing their name, age, and maybe a small description. Give them a unique name. Give them an unexpected personality. Just don't overdo it or readers will be confused.
 This plot could be anything, from talking zebras to upwards gravity, anything. Make it interesting and unique. Make up a topic that was never used before. That may sound hard, but it's really not. Pick a random scene with a unique topic and plot. It's really important to make sure it interests you.

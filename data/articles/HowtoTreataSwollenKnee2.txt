 Go to the doctor if there is significant swelling or if you can’t bear weight on the knee. You should also visit the doctor if there is any obvious deformity or if you have a fever and redness in your knee, which may indicate an infection. Also see the doctor if you don’t notice improvement after about 4 days. Your ligaments might be damaged.


Your doctor will evaluate your knee to determine what condition is causing the swelling. He may administer an imaging test such as an x-ray, ultrasound or MRI. These tests will detect bone, tendon or ligament injuries.
Another procedure that your doctor may try is an aspirate of the joint knee fluid to check for infection based upon the number of white cells and bacteria in the fluid.Your doctor may inject a steroid into your knee to try to reduce the swelling.
Finally, the doctor will take your temperature to make sure that you do not have an infection of the knee.
 Depending on the condition causing knee swelling, your doctor may recommend that you get surgery. Some of the most common types of knee surgery are:Arthrocentesis: Fluid is removed from your knee to relieve joint pressure.
Arthroscopy: Loose or damaged tissue is removed from around the knee.
Joint replacement: You can get a replacement knee joint if it becomes clear that your knee is not getting any better and your knee pain is intolerable.
 Your doctor may prescribe physical therapy. A physical therapist will examine your leg. He will also give you specific exercises, based on your condition, to strengthen the muscles around the knee joint.
 Foot problems like flat feet and other conditions may contribute to knee pain and swelling. Visit a foot specialist and ask this person to assess your feet. He might recommend that you wear orthotics, which are inserts that go inside your shoes.The orthopedist may need to assess your back and hip as well. Pain resulting from the back, hip, or feet is called referred pain.

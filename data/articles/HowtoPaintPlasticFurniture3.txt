 Prepare the surface of the furniture by washing it with warm water and an all-purpose cleaner. After rinsing and allowing it to dry, use fine grit sand paper to remove any visible scuffs in the plastic’s surface. Sand the rest of the furniture’s surface lightly, as this will help the primer adhere to the furniture.
 Apply a full coat of a primer designed for use with latex paint. This will help ensure your paint adheres to the furniture you’re painting. Since plastic does not hold paint as well as other materials, an adhesion primer is vital to make your top coat last.
 If you’re painting a piece of furniture that will be kept inside your home, you’ll want a paint that is less likely to release odor or gas. Further, paint of this type will be more resistant to stains and will be easier to clean than other option.








Go with either a satin or semi-gloss finish.
This sort of paint will have more color options in liquid form. Ask someone at the paint counter of your local hardware store for a sample portion of whichever color you favor, as this will be especially cheap and will likely be enough to cover a plastic chair, for instance.
Use a synthetic brush, or soak a bristle brush in water overnight before use.

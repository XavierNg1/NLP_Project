 If you are wearing an outfit with more gray scale or earthen tones, use your bucket bag to add a pop of color to your look. For black and white outfits, most any color will work. For neutral tone outfits, find a more vibrant version of a color you're already wearing.If, for example, you have an outfit that already has browns in it, choosing a copper or ochre color bag will add color without clashing with your garments.
Use your bag as a splash of color for occasions where you normally wouldn't have much color in your outfit, such as white-tie affairs or when you are wearing a suit.
 Bucket bags were a staple in the 90's, and bringing them back means you have a chance to play with other 90's style staples. Pair your bucket bag with a plaid shirt and a choker for a more informal look, or with a denim jacket when it's cold outside.Pick one or two staple 90's pieces, such as plaids, dark lipstick, chokers, crop tops, or spaghetti straps to make a statement in your outfit. Too many will look chaotic and uncoordinated.
 A slouchy bucket bag pairs well with peasant blouses, harem pants, and other flowing drapes. Find a bucket bag with a natural texture, such as one imitating hide or raw silk, to get a dreamy bohemian effect from your outfit.Overly-structured bucket bags can downplay the bohemian effect. If you are looking for more of a free-spirited look, stick to a slouchy bag. If you're looking to add a bit more structure to your outfit, a sturdier bag with clean lines can help.
 Bucket bags are great to carry into the office because they can often hold all you need them too, but don't look as serious or stern as a briefcase. Pair your bucket bag with a blazer your favorite blouse and trousers combination to add a bit of fashion to your daily look.For office looks, a structured bag tends to work better. The clean lines have a more professional aesthetic, and a structured bag makes it easier to keep things organized and access them quickly.

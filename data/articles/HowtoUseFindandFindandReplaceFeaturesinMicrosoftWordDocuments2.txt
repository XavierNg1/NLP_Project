 If you wish to replace text in only a portion of the Word document, drag your cursor over the part you wish to work with. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
 You can do this the same way in your version of Word as if you want to simply find text and then click the "Replace" tab, or you can do it the following way:


In Word 2003, select "Replace" from the Edit menu.
In Word 2007 and 2010, select "Replace" from the Editing group.
, As with the "Find what:" field, you can also click the down arrow at the right of the "Replace with:" field to select a previously typed entry.
 These are the same options described above under "Finding Text."

, Click "Find In" and select "Current Selection" to search only the portion of the text you highlighted or "Main Document" to search the entire document. (If you did not select any text, this will be the only available option.)

, You can do this in either of 2 ways:


Click "Find Next" to find the first instance of the text to be replaced, then click "Replace" to replace that text. Repeat the procedure for each instance you wish to replace.
Click "Replace All" to replace every instance of the text to be replaced with the new text. (This option works best if you restrict it either by selecting a portion of the text for the search and replace, restricting the replacement to whole words only, or both.)

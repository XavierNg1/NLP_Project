 Hopefully, washing the inside of your microwave with vinegar will have gotten rid of any burnt or food smells. Once you’re done, give it in a sniff. If you still detect the same smells as before, move on to the next steps.If not, leave the door open so the vinegar scent airs out. Test again later on to make sure the vinegar didn’t overpower any lingering odors that become more obvious as the vinegar airs out.
 Don’t count vinegar out just because it didn’t get the job done the first time. If smells persist, soak a sponge with pure vinegar, then dust it with some baking soda. Microwave on high for about 25 seconds. Then use the sponge to wipe down the inside of your microwave a second time., If wiping your microwave down a second time with pure vinegar and baking soda didn’t do the trick, grab some acetone-free nail polish remover. Soak some cotton pads or cotton balls in it. Use these to wipe down the inside of your microwave., Don’t leave these chemicals lingering in your microwave. Use a sponge to wash away the nail polish remover with dish soap. Then wipe down the inside again with a one part water to two parts vinegar mixture. Leave the door open so the microwave airs out.

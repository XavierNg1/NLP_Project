 Your guests may be thirsty so here's the perfect drink: Vampire Blood Fruit Punch. All you have to do is buy/make some red fruit punch.
 Put some salad on some white bread and add tomatoes and more. You choose!

, Add some M&M's, Pretzel sticks, etc. in a bowl and there you go. Simple, easy and good.
 Make the mini hot dogs, and then carve out a toenail area on the hot dog. Then dab ketchup on the "toenail".
 Serve the guests regular food, but tell gross stories, describing some disgusting objects with the same texture as the food.
, Mix in crushed Oreos and gummy worms.
 For best results, make them as gooey as possible.;
, Pour chocolate syrup on the finished brownies, then sprinkle them with coco powder. You could also consider adding little bits of a chocolate bar.
 Put gummy worms and other gummy critters on top of and around the cake. Cover some of them with coco powder to make it look like they're coming out of the dirt.
 Melt red starburst, jolly rancher chews, and tootsie rolls. Then, tear them into chunks and spread them around certain parts of the cake. To make them look even more real, you can add them to the creepy crawlies from the previous step.

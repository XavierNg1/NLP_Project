 You may want:

The Rotted Fork for its high knockback value
The Jester's Arrows for Creepers (more on that later)
The Blade of Grass
The Ball o' Hurt
Flaming Arrows (probably the most effective)

, There are two ways to do this:

Destroy three Crimson Hearts (found scattered throughout the Crimson.
Craft a Bloody Spine.
 You will have to kill them to even damage the Eye of Cthulhu.

The Jester's Arrows will work well against the Creepers, since they can pass clean through multiple rows. The Ball o' Hurt is also useful, given its wide range.
 The Creepers will disappear, and the Brain will begin to teleport.

It's not as bad as it sounds. Use the Blade of Grass to quickly disintegrate its health, and bam, it's dead.

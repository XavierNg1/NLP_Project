 Use purple foam if you want to make a violet, but other colors are fine if you'd like to make a different type of flower.
 Cut evenly-spaced slits from the edge of the circle toward the middle, stopping about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) short of the center.
 Lift each petal and cut an inverted "v" shape by making two diagonal cuts.
 This will be the center of the flower.
 Place a dab of hot glue in the center of the violet, then stick the small white circle to the glue.
 Pinch each flower petal in half vertically, so they stand up a bit and created a 3-D effect, rather than lying flat.
 Use a green pipe cleaner as the stem, and glue the top to the back of the flower's center.

 Turn the unintentional slight into something you can laugh about by following the comment with a joke.


Saying “Just kidding! Can you imagine if that were true? Wow!” can help you to play it off and brush aside the comment
Add some levity by saying something like "one of my many talents is knowing the perfect thing to say to anyone in any situation" and laughing.
 Tell the person you accidentally insulted that you were just kidding and the comment was more of a personal statement about yourself. Someone is more likely to let it go if you say that you were actually being honest about yourself and didn’t mean the comment about the other person.If you insult someone's looks, make up a story that turns your comment into a personal narrative. "I have always been self conscious about my looks, so I sometimes project onto others.
 Let the person know that you didn't mean to insult them and apologize honestly for the slight. Admit your mistake in insulting the person and try to wrap the comment with a compliment.


If you insulted the person by pointing out something that you don’t like about the person, be honest about it. Say something like, “I’m sorry that I hurt you. I just think sometimes you wear too much perfume to work. Maybe I just have a really sensitive sense of smell. I really like your outfit though! You have the best wardrobe, where do you shop?”
If you sent an email to the wrong person, apologize and say that the message was meant for someone else, but that you really shouldn’t have said the comment at all.

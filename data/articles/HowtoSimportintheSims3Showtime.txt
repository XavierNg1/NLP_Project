 If you are unsure about the Patch, then load your Game Launcher and hover over the icon in the bottom left corner. If the first 3 digits are "1.32" or greater, then you are ready to go. If not, then you must update your game.;
, Make sure the checkbox is ticked that says "Automatic Updates". Also tick the box that has a series of numbers next to it - like: 1.21.123.011002 to 1.22.9.011002.
 Then proceed to launch a saved game or begin a new game.
 The Household must have at least 2 Sims in it - this is so you can continue to play the game while a Sim is away on a SimPort.
, Select "SimPort".
 This will bring up a list of your friends on www.thesims3.com.
 Then confirm a location for your Sim to perform. Once you have chosen all of this, confirm it.


There will be a small waiting time for the SimPort connection to be established.



If the player was not online, you will have to wait for them to accept your request before your Sim is paid fully.

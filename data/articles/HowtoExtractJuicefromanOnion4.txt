 A whole onion will be too large for many juicers to work with, but small chunks or chopped onion will be too small for you to push through. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut your onion into quarters, lengthwise, for the best results.
 Use an electric centrifugal juicer with a chute and a spout. A hand juicer, or a juicer that requires you to press the fruit or vegetable against a bump to extract the juice, only works with soft fruits like lemons, oranges, and limes. To extract juice from hard vegetables like onions, you need a juicer with a spout that you can feed pieces of the vegetable into.
 Some juicers come with a glass collection container, but for many strainers, you will need to place a bowl or drinking glass beneath the dispensing spout before you begin since the juice will pour out as you work.
 Wait until each quarter has finished being juiced before inserting the next quarter into the chute. The juice should automatically filter out through the spout while the pulp will be collected into a separate compartment. No additional straining should be necessary.

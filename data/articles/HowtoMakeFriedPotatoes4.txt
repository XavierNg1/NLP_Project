 Cook until tender (about 10-15 minutes).
 Allow to cool enough to handle, then cut into even cubes about 2cm/ 3/4 inch across.
 Fry the onions and garlic until golden brown. Remove from the pan and keep warm.
 Fry until crisp, then drain the oil onto the fried onions for added flavor.
 Add the potato cubes and fry until browned evenly.
 Season well, then cook for a few more minutes.
 Stir the fresh chopped herbs through the mixture. Turn into a serving dish.
 Serve immediately; this is best eaten hot.

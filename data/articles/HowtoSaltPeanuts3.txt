 Fresh, raw peanuts often have dirt on them, even if it isn't visible. Place 2 pounds (907 g) of peanuts in a colander, and use cool water from the sink to rinse them. Shake the colander well to ensure that all of the peanuts are cleaned.There's no need to dry the peanuts after rinsing them if you plan to boil them.
 Add the peanuts to a large stockpot, and cover them with 3 gallons (11 l) of water. Mix in 5 tablespoons (85 g) of salt, and stir well to ensure that it’s completely incorporated.You can use any type of salt that you like, including regular table salt, but kosher salt is usually the best option.
 Place the pot on the stove, and turn the burner to high. Cover the pot, and allow the peanuts to simmer for 4 hours., After four hours, remove a peanut from the pot and open it. It should have the texture of a cooked, dried bean and should hold its shape but not crunch when you bite it. If the peanuts aren’t done, allow them to simmer for another 3 to 4 hours until they reach the proper texture.The cooking time will vary based on how fresh the peanuts are. Fresher peanuts take less time to cook.
You may need to add additional water to the pot during the cooking process.
 When the peanuts are done boiling, drain them in a colander. Shake well to remove the excess water, and set them out on a clean towel or piece of paper towel to dry. Place them in a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to a week.

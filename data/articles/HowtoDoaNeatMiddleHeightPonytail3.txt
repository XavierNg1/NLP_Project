 Follow the instructions above to create a neat ponytail held firmly in place in the middle of your head. Use a straightening or curling iron to help your ponytail look as neat as possible.
 Take the section of hair at the top of your head and alongside your temples, and pull it out of the hairband. You want to remove a large handful of hair. It will eventually go back into the ponytail, but for now you want to pull it out.


If you need to loosen the ponytail to take it out, that's fine.
The purpose of putting it up in a ponytail first is so you can make sure you grab a section of hair that will sit right on top of your head when your hair is in a ponytail.
 Use one hand to hold it while the other grabs a comb.
 Run your comb from the tips to the roots in order to tease up the hair and add volume. Keep doing this until you have the amount of volume you want., Lay the section against your head so you can see where it will fall. Take your comb and carefully smooth out just the top layer of the hair, leaving the bulk of the hair underneath teased. That way it will retain volume in the finished style.
 Pull it out and put your hair back up, including the teased section. Now the hair at the top of your head will have some pretty volume, rather than lying flat against your head., Pin it in place with a bobby pin to hide the hairband from sight.
 Spritz in both the front and the back to hold your style in place.

 Allowing your friend to spend time with another person frees up your time to do the same. You could focus on other friendships, build new ones, or give yourself time to focus on your school, work or hobbies. Make an effort to keep touch with your friend, but enjoy the time that you now have free., If your friend is no longer in your life or spending as much time with you, acknowledge the good times you had together and move on. Avoid dwelling in the past or spending all of your energy chasing this one friend. Allowing yourself to be happy will not hurt the odds of mending things with your friend, in fact, it will help you be less bitter about the whole situation.Keep yourself entertained and happy by going out to movies, social gatherings, etc. with new friends (or other old friends).
 Even though your main problem is with the person who took your friend away, you might still find that you harbor hard feelings towards your friend for allowing it to happen. After some time, your friend may feel that they made a mistake. If so, they may make an effort to rekindle the friendship. If this happens, it is okay for you to forgive your friend.If this happens, it is appropriate to discuss how the rift made you feel. Then, move on and start rebuilding your friendship.

 On days when school is canceled due to the snow, take the extra time you will have in the morning and make your child’s favorite breakfast. Have your child help you make homemade waffles or bake a batch of buttery biscuits or scones. The snow day will feel extra special when your little one gets to skip their usual oatmeal or cereal and enjoy their favorite breakfast dish instead.
 After a long afternoon of playing in the snow, let your child warm up with a cup of hot chocolate. Let them add a little bit of whipped cream or marshmallows on top, or sprinkle in some cinnamon or cocoa powder for extra flavor. Have them stir the rich drink with a candy cane stick.
 Making snow ice cream is a special, delicious way to spend a snow day. To make this unique treat, blend a ½ cup (4 fl oz) of whole milk, ¼ cup (50 g) of sugar, and a ½ tsp (5 ml) of vanilla extract until the sugar dissolves. Add 4 cups (32 fl oz) of clean snow to the mixture until it has a similar consistency and texture to real ice cream. Serve in a bowl with your child’s favorite toppings, or mix in some fresh strawberries, blueberries, and bananas.To ensure that the snow is clean, place an empty bowl on your porch or window sill as the snow is falling. The bowl will collect the clean snow, and all you will have to do is grab it and toss it in with your other ingredients.

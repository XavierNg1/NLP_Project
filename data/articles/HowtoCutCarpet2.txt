 Use a tape measure to find the length and width of the room you’re carpeting. This will give you an idea of exactly how much carpet you’ll need. It will also make it easier to cut each section to the proper specifications.Most rolls of carpet come in widths of 12 feet, so be sure to take this into account when plotting out the best way to cover the floor.To find the inner area of the room, multiply the length of the room (in feet) by the width.
 The key to installing professional-looking carpet is to take your time and give each section the same amount of care and attention. Unroll the carpet as you go, separating it into more manageable strips. Cut two or three feet, then scoot back and resume cutting from a comfortable position.


The roll itself can serve as a convenient reference for tracing straight lines.
 Whenever space allows, fold the carpet roll over and run your knife directly over the backing to achieve a cleaner cut with less struggle or guesswork. The backing is hard and flat, which means you won’t have to fight your way through the thick piling.Mark the backing with a pencil or permanent marker to indicate where you need to cut, or simply use the intersecting seams as a handy visual reference.
Folding the carpet will also create a more secure cutting surface, preventing you from scarring the flooring underneath., For some layouts, it may be necessary to leave space for a fireplace, a section of tile or some other piece of detailing. Measure these areas first so you’ll know how much carpet you need to trim. If you’re worried about making a mistake, you can lightly score the carpet on the first pass before committing to the cut.It may be helpful to perform a mockup of the cuts you intend to make on a scrap piece of cardboard first.Complex cutouts may be best left to the professionals.

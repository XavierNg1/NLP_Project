 Note that a steam cleaner should not be used for this clean-up. It will set the odor and stain into your carpet or furniture.
 This will allow clean water to cycle through the affected area, taking the urine with it., There are many store-bought options, but regular baking soda sprinkled on the area is an effective, low-cost option as well.Sprinkle dry baking soda in the area, let it sit for five minutes, and vacuum up the remaining powder.
 If the smell does not disperse, you may have to replace the carpet or upholstery.

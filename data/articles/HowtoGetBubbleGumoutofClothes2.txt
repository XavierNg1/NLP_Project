 Let it soak in for a few minutes. Hold the clothing under water and use a toothbrush or sharp knife to scrape off the gum.
 Place the area with the gum at the mouth of a kettle or any other pot that produces concentrated steam when water is boiled in it. Allow the gum to absorb the steam before scraping it off.
 Scrub a toothbrush in small circles over the affected area until the gum loosens. You may have to continue to dip the clothing in the vinegar several times to apply a fresh soaking of the liquid. Be sure to wash off the toothbrush as it becomes full of gum.

 You may use the alcohol based ink (in bottles) used for rubber stamping, or India ink used for drawing.Alcohol-based ink is widely available at arts and craft supply stores, or in the crafts department of large retailers.
Feel free to mix different colors of ink together to make your own custom colors.
Food coloring also works, but is less permanent.
 Make sure it can be tightly closed. The easiest way to do this is in a resealable bag.


Make sure you have enough space in the container to move the sand around vigorously.
You can color as much or as little sand as you need.
You may also use table salt instead of sand. Avoid using sugar, as this will get sticky.
The best sand to use for this is the white “colored” sand available at craft stores.
 Continue mixing until you reach the color you want.


If there is any leftover ink left in a clump, and your sand is already the color you want, remove it and discard.
If the color is not dark enough, continue to ink 1 drop at a time until you get the color you want.
 Make sure that your container does not leak or spill.

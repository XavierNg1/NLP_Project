 This will help a lot in diluting the salt.
 As long as you don't mind rice with noodles, rice can work well and also make the soup more filling.

You can also add pre-cooked noodles, though they probably won't absorb so much salt.
 It is chicken noodle soup, after all!, Use one egg per serving (or more if you like).

Beat the eggs in a bowl using a fork.
Heat the soup to a rolling boil.
While stirring the soup rapidly with a fork, slowly pour in the eggs. Keep stirring until the eggs are combined thoroughly.
Turn off the stove and let the soup sit for 30 seconds before serving.
 This will help detract from the salty taste.

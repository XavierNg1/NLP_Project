 In Italian, there are two main phrases to say that you love someone: Ti amo and Ti voglio bene. Their differences are slowly morphing as the language changes and evolves.


"Ti amo" implies a sexual relationship. An element of lust is present.
"Ti voglio bene" is considerably less sexual. It's more "I care for you." As a human, as someone you'd risk your life for. It's both less serious because it's less passionate, but more serious because of the sense of commitment.
 Once you decide which one is more appropriate, start practicing how to say it. "Ti amo" is a bit easier than "Ti voglio bene," but both can be easy.


"Ti amo" is pretty straightfoward: tee ah-mo. Simple as that!
"Ti voglio bene" sounds like tee VOH-lee-oh BAY-neh. Think of the vowel in "bay" without the "y."

, You've got it down pat, you've been practicing, and now you're ready! When the moment is ripe, go for it. All your hard work will surely pay off.


If it's appropriate, add a "cara mia." That's "my darling." Imagine it: cara mia, ti voglio bene. You can practically hear the hearts pounding from over here.

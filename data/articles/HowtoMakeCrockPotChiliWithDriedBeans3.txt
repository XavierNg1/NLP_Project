 This delicious variation on crock pot chili uses ground turkey instead of ground beef. Replace the kidney beans and pinto beans with great northern beans, and use plenty of green chiles.
 You can skip the beans altogether and use 2 pound of chopped sirloin steak instead of ground beef. Slow cook the meat and vegetables until the meat is fall-apart tender.
 Replace the ground beef with an extra cup of black beans, and add carrots, celery, sweet potatoes, and any other vegetables you love to eat. Cover the chili ingredients with vegetable broth instead of water. After 6 - 8 hours of cooking, your vegetarian chili will be deliciously rich.

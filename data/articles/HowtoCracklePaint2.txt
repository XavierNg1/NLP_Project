 If you want a significant contrast in color, use two different colors. Alternatively, you can use two shades of the same color - one darker, one lighter - to create a more subtle crackle effect.
 Good quality paint is essential. Acrylic paint is recommended.
 Select the shade of paint you want to use as your base coat and spray a thin, even layer over the surface. Then wait for the paint to dry.
 Apply a second coat of the same color, spraying heavily. Wait for the paint to begin drying, just until it becomes tacky.
 Now spray the second shade of paint to achieve a crackle effect. Make sure the paint you use is a high-gloss acrylic. For a heavier crackle effect, concentrate on spraying some parts more than others.
 Use a heat gun to dry the final layer of paint. This will cause the top layer of paint to crackle and form interesting patterns.
 You could also give your work an aged woodwork effect by applying a thin dark stain to the surface, then wiping it off with a cloth. Raw linseed oil is a good option, as it doesn't dry too quickly.

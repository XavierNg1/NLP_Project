 Spear through two sides of the ball to hold the ball in place.;
, Paint a coat of brown to cover the ball, turning the needle to ensure full coverage. Allow to dry.
 Allow to dry. Paint at least one more layer; if it looks nice and deep, the painting is done.
 This makes it appear shiny. Allow to dry.
,, Only take this piece halfway down and make indentations that appear like dripping custard.
, Immediately take the topping part off the clay ball and place it on the painted ping pong ball. As it cools down, it will shape itself to the ping pong ball and looks like custard on the pudding.


Poke a hole through it to meet the hole already made by the knitting needle.
 It now needs to be glued onto the ping pong ball or it will simply fall off when it hangs up. Glue well in exactly the same position. Allow to dry.
, Knot it at the ends; make sure it is a big, strong knot; this knot will sit at the base of the pudding and stop the thread from pulling through.
 Keep the knot at the base and pull the thread right up and through the top. The loop formed at the top now becomes the hanger for the ornament.
 The pudding ornament is now ready for hanging.


Repeat for other balls if making more than one Christmas pudding ornament.

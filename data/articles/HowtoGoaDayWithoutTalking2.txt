 It is likely that you will encounter situations where you must talk in order to get an important message across. Avoid being rude or disrespectful when possible.


For example, if one of your teachers doesn’t know that you plan to go through the day without talking, you might have to write them a note or simply tell them.
If you are participating in national Day of Silence, for example, consider carrying around a note that explains that you are protesting the silence that LGBTQ youth face daily.Remember to use gestures. If you are spending a day in public, use your body language to communicate. You can smile, point, shake your head, and otherwise move your body to communicate what you need., If you must open your mouth, be conscious of the words you choose. Remember that your goal is to speak as little as possible. Use the minimal words necessary to communicate.For example, a teacher might stop to ask you about a change in time for your club meeting the next day. If for some reason you can’t give them a pamphlet, listen to everything they say before you jump in to give explanations. If there is only one good time for your club, try saying, “3:30. If not, we can cancel tomorrow.”

, Whenever you are tempted to say something, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Inhale slowly as you count to five. Hold your breath for a few seconds. Exhale as you count to eight. Focusing on your breathing calms you.It may also help distract you from the urge to talk.
 Notice how challenging it is to go a day without speaking. Whatever your motive, staying silent will give you time to notice things you may not have noticed before. Observe your feelings, others’ reactions, and the overall experience of not using your voice.If your day is personal and spent alone, notice the thoughts and desires that surface. Whether you choose to spend the day meditating or simply spend some time alone, take note of what comes up for you.

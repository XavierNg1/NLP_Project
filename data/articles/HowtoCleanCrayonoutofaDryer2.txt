 Donâ€™t spray the WD-40 directly in the dryer because it is flammable. Scrub at the crayon stains with the rag. Continue wiping until the marks lift off.


Avoid using this method in a dryer with a pilot light.
 Discard the rag with the WD-40. Get some paper towels wet and soapy. Use these to remove any oily residue in your dryer., After you wipe out the oil, unplug your dryer. Dip a sponge or clean rag into a bucket of warm soapy water. Wash the entire inside of your dryer. Focus on wiping down the areas where you rubbed most with the WD-40. Use a clean rag to wipe the inside of the dryer., Finish cleaning your dryer with a load of clean, wet rags. This will also collect any stray crayon pieces. Check the drum of the dryer for any streaks of crayon after you run the load. If you see more crayon, repeat the WD-40 cleaning process.

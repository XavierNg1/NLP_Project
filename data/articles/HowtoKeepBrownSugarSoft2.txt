 Remember, brown sugar hardens due to a lack of moisture. The simplest way to get it to soften is by adding water. Sprinkle a few drops of water over hardened brown sugar. Then, seal the sugar into a plastic bag. Set aside for a few days and it should soften considerably as the water makes its way through the sugar., You can also use a cloth to add moisture to brown sugar. Place your hardened brown sugar in an open container. Then, get a cloth or paper towel wet. Wring out until moist and set it over the container. Leave the sugar like this overnight. If this method is successful, your sugar should be soft by morning., You can also use tinfoil and paper towel to soften brown sugar. To start, put the hardened sugar in a sealable container.


Place a piece of tinfoil over the top of the hardened brown sugar. Then, get some paper towels damp and place them over the tinfoil.Seal the container. Let it sit long enough that the paper towel dries. This can happen overnight but may also take a few days. Once the towel is dry, the sugar should be softened.

 Put a small brush nozzle on the end of your vacuum cleaner. Carefully vacuum the plants, working from the top to the bottom of the plant., You can use the same can of forced air that you use to clean your keyboard and computer. Use the can of forced air to spray off the dust that has accumulated on your silk plants.An alternative to compressed air for cleaning electronics is an old can of hair spray.You could also use an air compressor if you have one available, but be careful not to hold the nozzle too close to the plant since the force of the compressed air could damage the plant.
 Put half a cup of cornmeal in the bottom of a grocery bag. Remove the silk flowers or petals that you want to clean and put them in the bag. Roll up the top of the bag and give it a shake for one or two-minutes. The cornmeal should rub off the dust.If you don’t have cornmeal, you can also use salt.
 Remove the petals and flowers from your silk plant. Put them in your dryer with a dryer sheet. Turn your dryer to a low heat setting. Run the dryer for one or two-minutes to remove any dust., If you are looking for a quick dusting solution, you can use your hair dyer on a cool air, high fan setting. Use the hair dryer to blow away the dust. You may want to do this cleaning outside, so you don’t get too much dust blown around your apartment.

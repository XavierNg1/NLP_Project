 Use a moderate sound and a smooth bow. With good ear training, perfect fifths are easy to hear, while out-of-tune fifths can be picked out by recognizing the dissonant vibrations and a sound that is not quite right., Adjust your D string until the A and D strings produce a perfect fifth.

Assuming your A string is in tune, press the D string near the nut to slightly sharpen the pitch, and adjust as needed. If a perfect fifth results from doing this, then the D string is flat.
Likewise, if you need to press the A string near the nut to obtain a perfect fifth, then the D string is sharp.
 As with tuning by harmonics, this relies on your ear to make sure that your strings are actually in tune - otherwise, the errors accumulate as you get lower.

A perfect fifth of the G and C strings may be a bit difficult to hear at first, especially if your strings are not high quality or if you are tuning in an orchestra with other cellos. Use harmonics if needed.

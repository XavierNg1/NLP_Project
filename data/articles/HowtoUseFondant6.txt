 This can be done by using a very fine brush dipped in food coloring or luster. Simply brush onto the area you would like more color added.
 Lines, indents, curves and other designs can all be carved or pushed into the fondant using a palette knife.
 If you don't want to go to the trouble of making a template (as outlined above), sometimes simply punching out motif shapes in rolled fondant using cookie cutter shapes is the best solution. Anything from stars to bunnies will work well. You can always build on the basic punched out shape by adding details such as eyes, hair and clothing, etc.
 The kitchen and craft cupboard are full of possibilities when it comes to implements that can make interesting shapes, details and patterns. Think of such things as the end of piping or cookie dough nozzles, drinking straws, designs on spoons, buttons, sculpting knives, cookie stamps, unused printing stamps, fork tines, etc.

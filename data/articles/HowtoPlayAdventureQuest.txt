, You should see a "Create New Account!" button on the right hand side of the page, near the sponsors. Click on this button.
 Then insert a user name (this will not be your in-game name, just the account name to log in with) and a password. Take note of this! Last of all type in your email (this is just so you can clarify your account) and click next. You will see a 'secret code'. Note this down with your name and password, because if you lose your password then you have that code to retrieve it.
 Just fill in exactly what you put as your password and email before, and you'll be okay. Then click create, and you will be on your way!


If it says the name is already in use, then you will just have to change it a little bit. Example. You put SDF123 as the account name, and it was taken. Change it to something like SDF1234 or SDFG123. Make a few digit or letter changes. This is not the person's name, just the account name required to log in.

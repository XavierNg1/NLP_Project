 Check your temperature or your child’s temperature frequently and watch for other symptoms.


If a fever develops or you observe flu-like symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, this can possibly mean the infection is getting worse and that home ear infection treatments are not working effectively.
Symptoms that necessitate a trip to your doctor include confusion, neck stiffness, and swelling, pain, or redness around the ear. These symptoms indicate that the infection may have spread and that it needs immediate treatment.
 This could indicate the eardrum has ruptured. Ruptured eardrums can result in temporary loss of hearing. They can also make your ear more susceptible to infections, making the situation even worse.In addition to the absence of pain, there may also be drainage coming from the ear.
Although ruptured eardrums usually heal within a couple weeks, even without treatment, some problems may persist that require medical intervention or treatment., While most doctors recommend a 48-hour “wait and see” approach, if you experience worsening pain during that period, call your doctor. Your doctor will be able to recommend more intense treatment or antibiotics., This may be coupled with significant hearing problems.Sometimes, a short-term hearing loss can occur, which is especially concerning for children two years and younger.
If your child is younger than 2 and experiencing fluid buildup as well as hearing issues, your doctor may not wait three months to start treatment. Hearing problems at this age could affect your child’s ability to speak and lead to other developmental problems.

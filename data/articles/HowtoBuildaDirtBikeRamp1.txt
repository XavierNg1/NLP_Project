 You’ll need around a third of an acre at the bare minimum to make a dirt jump track. If you have any doubts about making the space permanent, it’s a good idea to build a wood ramp instead of digging jumps into the ground. And of course, make sure you have the authority or permission to build or dig.If you decide to dig dirt jumps, you’ll need to locate an area where you’ll have enough room to accelerate, for take-off and landing ramps, and for decelerating and stopping after hitting the jump.
You’ll need even more room if you plan on making a circuit track, or a loop from the end of the jump to its start.;
, Whether you need a portable or permanent jump will determine what you build. A portable, wooden ramp would be better if, for example, you’ve got a great spot to practice jumps up in the mountains that you only drive to every now and then. If you don’t want to or don’t have permission to dig up your land, go with the portable wood ramp. You can tow it to any location suitable for practicing jumps.


In order to build a permanent site, you’ll have to make absolutely sure you have permission to modify the land you’re building on.
 Building a dirt bike ramp is no joke, whether you’re constructing it out of wood or digging it into the ground. If it’s easier and more cost effective to acquire wood beams, planks, a saw, nails, and a nail gun, build a wooden ramp. If you or a friend have easy access to a backhoe or other heavy-duty digging equipment, dig out a dirt jump. Consider what’s easiest to build and easiest on your wallet.

, Include a little extra in case (for the neck). Put the head on top of the body at an angle then smooth it in with your fingers and some water. Use the extra to make a neck. To get this part right, it is suggested that you keep a picture of a bird in front of you.
 Smooth it in, in the same manner as you did with the head.
 For the beak, just locate the right place and put on a little bit of clay and smooth it in, then use a toothpick to shape the beak. Easy.
 Use a toothpick and your fingers to shape it. Do the same on the other side to make wings.
 Make some ruffles by adding and smoothing in some clay strips the length of the tail.
, If there are any, smooth them out with water and your fingers.
 Carefully spoon out the clay, being careful at the head. Don't hollow out the tail.
 If wished, you can paint the bird or add clear varnish.

 This is a good default size for a screen that allows you to do and enjoy everything from typing word documents to watching movies. However, if you have the space, it’s never a bad idea to go a little larger. Display size is measured in inches and diagonally from a top corner to a bottom corner, not horizontally.


Only consider getting a display smaller than 20 inches if you’re very pressed for space, limited financially, or if you typically just stick to office work., Consider getting a curved screen if you’re getting a monitor that measures 27+ inches. The biggest appeal of a curved screen is that it allows you to see more without being far away from the computer.If you only do basics on your computer, such as run-of-the-mill internet searches and typing, this may be an excessive and unnecessary feature.
Music Producers especially benefit from having a curved screen because they can see a longer chunk of a song at any given moment.
 When comparing monitors, check the capability of the stand. Aim to get one that’s strong, stable, and somewhat flexible.


Professional-grade monitors are a great option if you need a stand that can pivot, tilt, swivel, and adjust height.

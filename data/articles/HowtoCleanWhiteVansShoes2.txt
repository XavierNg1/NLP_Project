 This easy method is great for canvas Vans that are covered in mud (don't use it for suede or leather shoes). Go ahead and take out the laces and the inserts so everything will come out nice and clean.
 Containing everything in a bag will protect both the shoes and your washer from getting beat up during the wash cycle. Make sure the pillowcase or bag is tied tightly so it won't come undone in the wash.
 This will be sufficient to clean your shoes without damaging them. Don't be tempted to use hot water, no matter how dirty your shoes are. Hot water can cause the glue holding them together to start coming loose.


Remember to add the same amount of detergent you'd add for a small load of wash.
Don't wash your shoes with other articles of clothing, especially delicates. Your shoes could end up damaging your other clothes.
 Do not tumble dry them, even on low heat, because the heat will damage the glue in your shoes. Stuff them with newspaper so they'll keep their shape, then place them to dry in a sunny spot.


Check out the shoes to see if you're happy with how clean they are. If you still see spots and stains, use a stain removal method.
When your shoes are dry, you can replace the inserts and shoelaces.

 This is a basic move where you stay basically in one place. Take your right foot and kick it in front of the left. Then you're going to cross it over to the left side of your left foot. Then your left foot is going to step back and to the left.
Repeat with the left foot, kicking it in front of the right foot, stepping it to the right side, and then stepping back and to the right with the right foot.
After you practice this a few times, try bouncing your shoulders to the beat. After you get the hang of that, do it twice as fast, or “double time”.;
,


Each step is half a beat. If you count it out, this will be “one-and-two-and-three-and-four”, with each one of these counts being a step. You do not step on the “and” of four, making it seven steps altogether.
Bend your knees out and to the side. Take a small step forward with your knees bent, taking your hips with you to the forward step. Repeat it with alternating legs up until the fourth beat.
After you have practiced walking it out with your legs, add your arms. Your arms should be bent at the elbow, with your fist facing out. Put your fingers in a loose “snapping” formation, with your thumb raised. When you step with your right leg, your right arm should move forward and your elbow should move in towards your torso. When you step left, your right arm should move back with the elbow pointed away from you. The same goes for your left arm with your left leg.
 Get the step down before adding arm movements.


Step to the left with your left foot, dragging your right foot with it. Turn your right foot slightly inward and then put the ball of your foot on the ground. While doing this, bend your knees into a dip.
Bring your right foot to the right, but keep it turned left. While doing this, unbend your knees and let your body follow your right foot.
Quickly move your body through the center and to the left. Bring your left foot to the right. Dip your knees.
Step your left foot back to the left and unbend your knees.

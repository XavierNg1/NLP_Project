 Scales are most prevalent outdoors where they infest all species of trees, shrubs, perennial plants and annual plants. When the plants are small enough and infestation is not too severe, get rid of the scales in the same way as you would houseplants.Scrub the scales off with your nail or an old toothbrush.
Spray the plant with an insecticidal spray every four days or so.
 When the scale infestation is severe, use sharp hand pruners or loppers to trim off branches and leaves which hold high concentrations of these insects.


Make the pruning cut about 1/4-inch above a leaf or at the base of the branch.
Use a garden hose to spray off the pruners or loppers before using them on another plant to remove any scale insects that may be left on them., This is also commonly called summer oil or dormant oil, to kill any remaining scale insects. Spray the oil on the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems. There are various horticultural oil formulas on the market that are all equally good. They are commonly mixed at a rate of 2 to 4 teaspoons per gallon of water, but this varies.Read and follow the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations carefully. Shake the spray bottle vigorously to mix it initially and every few minutes while spraying to keep the oil mixed with the water.
 Spray the plants in early spring to kill any scale insects that have survived the winter before new growth starts.During the summer, spray the plants for scales in June, July and August but only if they return after the early spring treatment.


Horticultural oils work by smothering the scale insects that are on the plant when it is sprayed. The treatment may have to be repeated after a week or two.

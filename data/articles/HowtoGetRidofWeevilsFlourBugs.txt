 As soon as you bring flour home, seal it inside a freezer bag and put it in the freezer for 96 hours (four days).Remove and store as usual. The freezing process will kill off any eggs and weevils already present in the flour.;
, This will discourage weevil infestation.,, Leaving flour in the pantry too long will encourage pest infestation. The faster it is used, the fresher it is, and the fewer the chances for infestation.


Purchase only the amounts of flour that you'll use within a month or two. Any more than this and you risk weevil infestation.
Rotate older products to the front and newer ones to the back so that you're always using up older products first.
 You won't get much done if you're shrieking and acting all grossed out. The bugs will not bite, sting, or harm you.
 Throw away all food that is or might be contaminated. In addition to flour, be sure to check your sugar, grains, dried beans and legumes, and breakfast cereals for signs of weevils.



Remove shelf paper (if necessary).
Wipe all areas clean with soapy water. Get into all corners and crevices.

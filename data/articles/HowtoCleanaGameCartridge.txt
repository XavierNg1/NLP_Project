 Put multiple games through the console that you know worked and double check that they do work.
 You will need: Q-Tips or cotton swabs (Get plenty), Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol.
 This will prevent cross-contamination of the bottle. It also makes it easier to wet the swab if you start running out.
 The swab should be wet, but should not be dripping at all.
 You will not get the entire contact row the first time through. Focus on the bottom first, and then make your way up to the top.
,,, If it still doesn't work, repeat steps 5 and 6 again. Some games are dirtier than others. Make sure to get the top of the contacts (Part that is exposed) very well, this part makes the most contact, and is the one most exposed to the elements.

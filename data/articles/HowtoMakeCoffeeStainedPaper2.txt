 You can brew some fresh coffee in a coffee maker, or you can make a cup of instant coffee. If you are making instant coffee, plan on using 3 tablespoons of instant coffee to about 6 ounces (cc milliliters) of water.If the coffee is too dark, don't worry, you can always lighten it with more water.
The coffee can be cold as well.
 It would be best to work over a waterproof tablecloth. If you don't have one, set up two baking sheets. Make sure that they are clean.
 Use a wide paintbrush or foam brush to apply the coffee to the paper. Paint from side to side in rows using even strokes. Do not swirl the brush across the paper, and try not leave behind any white patches. You want it to be as even as possible.








The paper will get wet, but don't let it get too soggy., Carefully lift the paper up, and flip it over. Set it down onto a dry part of the tablecloth.If you were working on a baking sheet, set it down on the second, dry baking sheet.
 Use the same technique as before.Once again, don't let the paper get too soggy.
 Transfer the paper someplace where it won't be disturbed. Allow it to dry completely.This can take several hours to overnight.
 If the paper is still damp the next day, or if it looks wrinkled, you can iron it. Sandwich the paper between two thin sheets of fabric, such as tea towels or cotton muslin.Turn your iron on to the wool setting, and let it get warm. Pass the iron over the paper, then let the paper cool down.

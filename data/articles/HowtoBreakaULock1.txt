 A basic ballpoint pen is the best tool for opening a locked U-lock. Find a standard “stick” pen, usually the cheapest types of pens that have the ballpoint on one end, a small cap to cover the other end of the pen, and a separate cover that you put on the pen when not using it.Make sure to use a cheap pen, as opposed to a more fancy kind. You need to find a pen that has an end cap that pops off, rather than one that screws off or can’t be easily removed.;
, Use your fingernails to pry off the small cap on the end of the pen. Removing the cap will leave you with an open tube that is roughly the same diameter as a standard U-lock key., After you remove the cap, insert the end of the pen with the open tube into the keyhole of your U-lock. It should comfortably fit within the hole.If the tube of the pen doesn’t fit inside the keyhole, it won’t work to open the lock. Find a pen that fits inside keyhole after its cap has been removed.
 Hold the U-lock with your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, grip the ballpoint pen and twist it inside the lock while pushing firmly.


Use your wrist rather than your whole arm to get the energy needed to push and twist.
 Keep twisting the pen, shaking the bar of the U-lock a little bit to add pressure. You may have to do this anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes if it’s your first time using this method. Twist the pen until you feel or hear the lock unlock.If you are unsure of whether the lock has opened, pull at the bar of the U-lock to check.
If you are applying pressure, you should feel the lock open.
 Pull the ballpoint pen out from the keyhole, then lift up the top bar of the lock out of the U-shaped sides. You have successfully unlocked your U-lock!

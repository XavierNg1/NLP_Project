 You can launch the game from the Start menu or desktop, if you created a shortcut there during setup.
 Enter your username and password into the fields provided, and click “Sign in.”


After logging in, NFSW will initiate an update. As soon as NFSW has finished downloading and installing all the required updates from the Internet, a dialog box with a “Play” button will appear.
 Click on the “Play” button, and press “Enter” or any other key to start. This will load and display your NFSW profile details.


Click “Enter World” to enter the NFS World in Free Roam mode.
Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to tour the racing world to find races or other drivers.
 Finding other drivers is as simple as driving around the city. You can navigate your car by using the following keys: Up Arrow key to accelerate, Left and Right Arrow keys to steer left and right respectively, Down Arrow key to brake and reverse.
 The driver’s username will be displayed above the car.


Racing cars are identifiable through their flashy appearance.
 Right-click their username and select “Invite to Group.” A notification will appear on the Group Chat window (found at the bottom left of the screen) saying that the invite has been sent.


When the friend you requested accepts your request to enter your group, another notification will appear on the Group Chat window to confirm. You will then have formed your NFSW group!
To add another Driver to the group, repeat steps 4 to 6.

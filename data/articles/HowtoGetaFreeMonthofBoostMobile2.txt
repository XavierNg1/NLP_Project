 If you want to know the nearest participating outlet in your location, go to Boost Mobile’s website (http://www.boostmobile.com/) and enter your area’s zip code on the Store Locator text field on the upper-right section of the page.
 You can select any brand or model of unit you like from the list of available phones.
 After purchasing a Boost Mobile phone from the retailer, sign up for a monthly plan you’d like to subscribe from Boost Mobile’s Plan section (http://www.boostmobile.com/shop/plans/monthly-unlimited-select/).


You can choose between $40, $50, or $60 plans, with each having its own unlimited call, text, and mobile surfing features.
 After signing up for an unlimited plan, pay the full amount of the monthly charge for the plan you chose.
 The $60 worth of credits is equivalent to a month of free service.

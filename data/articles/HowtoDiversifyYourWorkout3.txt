 Yoga or pilates classes are great if you want to work a lot of muscle groups at once. You can sign up for yoga or pilates classes at your gym. If you don't have a gym membership, you can also look up yoga and pilates routines on YouTube - Yoga with Adriene and Yoga House are two great examples., If you are a runner, it can be tempting to only run or walk for your cardio. Switching up what sorts of cardio you do can help diversify your workout.For example, instead of only running, trying swimming or kickboxing or cycling. They are all cardio workouts and have the added benefit of helping you add muscle as well.
 Some gyms have exercise machines that are specifically designed to cross-train. They work out lots of different muscle groups at once, and often combine walking, stairs, and running. If you belong to a gym, ask a gym employee if there are cross-trainers in the gym, and if they could show you how to use them., Circuit training requires that you perform one movement on one machine as hard you can in a certain amount of time. Then you get a short break before you move to the next movement. Because circuit training utilizes a lot of different movements and equipment, it's an ideal way to diversify your workout through cross-training.

 To start, peel an avocado. In a bowl, mash the avocado into a fine paste. Beat in enough olive oil to get a spreadable texture. Wet your hair and then apply the avocado from the roots to the tips. Secure the mask with a shower cap and leave it in 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the cap and rinse the mask out.If you have colored hair, skip the olive oil. It can lighten highlights. Substitute olive oil for almond oil or jojoba oil.
 If you have thinner hair, opt for banana. To make the mask, blend a single banana in a blender until you have a thin, even mixture. Make sure all the chunks are gone. Moving from root to tip, apply the banana to your hair. Secure your mask with a towel or shower cap and let it sit on for 15 to 20 minutes. Then, rinse your mask out in the shower.If you want, add a tablespoon of honey to the mask for extra nourishment. Keep in mind, however, that honey can be difficult to wash out.
 Eggs can help strengthen and replenish hair, and make it extra shiny. Blend two eggs with four tablespoons of olive oil. Apply it to your hair and secure it with a shower cap. Let it sit on for 20 to 25 minutes before washing it out.Wash this mask out with cool or room temperature water only. Hot water can partially cook the eggs, making them stick to your hair.
 Yogurt is full of lactate acid, anti-fungal, and antibacterial properties. These can all strengthen hair. Whip one cup of plain yogurt and apply it to your hair. Work it in from the roots to the tips. Secure your mask with a plastic hair cap and let it sit for 20 minutes. Then, rinse out the mask and wash your hair with a mild shampoo.This mask works particularly well if your hair is dry over the summer months.

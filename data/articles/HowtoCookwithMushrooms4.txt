 You can find these at most grocery stores. They used to be more expensive but they are going down in price. An advantage of using these is you only need a very small amount to pack in a lot of flavor to a mushroom dish. These generally come in two varieties: Asian mushrooms (such as shiitake and wood ear) and Euro-American (morels, porcini, trumpet etc.).
These will last a year if kept in a tight, dry container.
Dried mushrooms are often used with cheaper fresh mushrooms to boost flavor.
 You will need to do this to use them. There are advantages to this. The mushrooms themselves will rehydrate quickly by soaking in water and the soaking liquid has lots of flavor and can be used in many different recipes.
Before you start doing anything else in a recipe that calls for using dried mushrooms, start rehydrating them.
Use room temperature water. Cover the mushrooms generously.
Thinly sliced mushrooms should only need to soak for about 1/2 an hour.
Whole cap or thickly sliced mushrooms might need to soak 8 hours or more.
After soaking them, rinse the mushrooms to remove any grit. One of the pitfalls of using dried mushrooms is many varieties have an unpleasant grit to them. Rinsing them after soaking will help to remove this grit.
 This is full of flavor and a wonderful addition to recipes which call for stock. If you don't want to use this right away, put it in a container and refrigerate it. It will keep for several days.
You can also freeze it for longer periods if necessary.
The remaining liquid will have lots of the grit from the mushrooms in it.
You will need to strain it before using it to avoid the grit getting into your dish.

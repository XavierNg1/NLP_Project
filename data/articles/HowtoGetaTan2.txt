 If you're very fair, tend to burn easily, or want to minimize the health risks, sun tanning or UV tanning beds might be exactly the wrong choice. You won't know you're burning until after you're burned and the damage is already done.
 There are a variety of products from companies such as Neutrogena, L'Oreal, Victoria's Secret, and many more, that will give you a smooth, even tan.


As per the instructions, apply the lotion or spray evenly, taking care to get all skin covered. The best lotions will be noncomedogenic, which means it won't clog your pores.
Unless you have unusually long arms or are exceedingly flexible, you'll want a friend to help you get your back covered.
 Visit a tanning salon, and let them do an all-over tan. In just a few minutes, they'll professionally apply a tanning mist over your entire body.
 Before you plunk down your cash, read the various reviews available on both product and on serviceâ€”watch out for spray-on tans that turn you orange.

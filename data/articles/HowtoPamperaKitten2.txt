 Once your kitten is dry, carefully place it on a mattress and gently pet and caress it.


Every kitten is different, so try to learn where it likes to be scratched and stroked.
 Carefully place your kitten on its bed and brush its hair with a special brush to remove tangles.
 Give your pampered pet a small bow, a toy or some other accessory. It would especially like a treat to eat.

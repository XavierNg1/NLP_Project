 It is easy to overextend yourself if you don’t set or maintain boundaries. Make sure coworkers understand your boundaries by communicating them clearly.


For example, some coworkers might assume that you’ll answer email at all hours. If you want to save emails for work hours, you need to convey that. If a coworker says, “I’ll email you a draft of the project tonight,” you can respond with, “I’ll be sure to look at your draft when I get to the office.”

, If your workload is becoming too burdensome, ask your supervisor to assign someone to helping you. You can also give suggestions about how to rearrange your workload to meet immediate obligations and prioritize other tasks.
 It is important to maintain certain boundaries so that that workplace remains professional and productive. Your company may have policies in place to establish certain boundaries, especially ones about workplace respect, technology use and so on.


If you’re in a management position, you can help develop these policies to ensure proper boundaries.
 Set boundaries with your time by having structure to your day. Bring an agenda to meetings so that the conversation will be productive for everyone. If you spend too much time answering emails, restrict yourself to checking email for 15-minute blocks a few times a day.
 It is inevitable that someone will cross a boundary that you’ve set. Consider how you will respond. Making an exception may be acceptable one time, but keep in mind that inconsistent boundaries will not be respected as much.

 zOMG is an MMO that Gaia has. You must collect rings,level up,and kill monsters for gold. Other events,such as seasonal events,can earn up to over 200k (200,000 Gold) and sometimes even millions. One of the best ways to earn gold on 'zOMG!' is to go for the Papa Saw quest in the Bassken Lake map. Join a full crew,and choose the level "Hard". Most of the time,Papa Saw regulars will be hanging out around asking for others to join or asking to join. Join them,and fight with them. With enough Fire Rain and buffs,each Papa Saw quest can earn up to at least 6k per time.

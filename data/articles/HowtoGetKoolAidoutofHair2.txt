 Use very hot water but be careful not to scald yourself. Boiling water is not recommended unless you are only need to remove Kool-Aid from the tips of your hair, rather than the hair near your scalp. The hair getting worked on needs to be partially damp, but not necessarily dripping wet.
 A toothpaste containing baking soda works best, but if that is not available, try using a standard non-whitening formula. Rub it thoroughly over the strands of hair that have been dyed, working it in.
 Toothpaste is fairly safe and will not cause long-term damage even if you miss some as you rinse, but it may make your hair feel sticky and will leave white flakes if allowed to dry. Rinse it out with warm water, scrubbing the dyed hair as you rinse.
 Too many washings in one day is not recommended, but you can repeat this procedure up to twice a day for one week, if necessary. Stop if your hair starts to look especially brittle or dry, though.

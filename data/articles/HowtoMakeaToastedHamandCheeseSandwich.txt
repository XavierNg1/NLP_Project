 the ingredients needed for this particular sandwich are:bread,Philadelphia cream, cheese and ham. also you will need these things:a toaster,knife and a plate. With these simple ingredients you will be ready to start making that sandwich.;
, Get your bread and take out two slices out of the bag. Then turn on your toaster and put the two bread slices in it for 2 minutes. After its done take them out and the idea is not to have them that crunchy, depending on how you like them.
 get your knife. Open the cream and get some cream and with the knife spread it on one bread slice. get some more cream and spread it on the other slice of bread.
 Get the cheese and put two slices on the other bread slice. Some people love putting different kinds of cheese but i put yellow cheese on it.
 Get your favorite drink, i prefer lemon ice tea and Enjoy!

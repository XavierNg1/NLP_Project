 If you have a sweet tooth, choose sugar, syrup, Nutella, and/or whipped cream. Spread your pancake with butter for a rich but simple meal. Consider ham, cheese, and other savory toppings for a heartier pancake experience.
 To cook bacon in the microwave, lay two paper towels on a plate. Place the bacon strips across the plate and add another paper towel on top. Blast your bacon for three and a half minutes and you've got a meaty pancake topping.

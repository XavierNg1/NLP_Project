 You will want to fill the container half way for a total of 1/2 gallon of warm water. Don’t worry about making the water very hot. It should still be cool enough to handle., Using whatever liquid dish soap you have handy, squeeze six drops of dish soap into the gallon jug. Gently roll your wrist to mix the soap into the water without making it foam.
 Measure out 2 ounces of rubbing alcohol. You can use an alcohol jigger for an accurate measurement. Add these two ounces of rubbing alcohol to the gallon jug.Rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol, can be hazardous. Take precautions when handling it. Avoid contact with skin by wearing gloves. Don't touch your face after handling rubbing alcohol. Wash your hands with a lot of soap and water., While the water is still warm, pour it generously over the ice which you would like to remove. The solution will break down the ice and make it easier to shovel., You will want to remove the ice safely and efficiently. This means getting the ice and snow out of the path for walking and driving without hurting yourself in the process.Use a lightweight snow shovel which is not too heavy for you.
Decide where you will pile the snow and ice before you start so that you don’t end up blocking a walking or driving path and needing to start over in that area.
Ideally, just push the snow and ice out of the way without lifting it.
If you do lift, keep your knees bent and back straight. Remember to do the lifting with your legs and only lift as high as necessary to move the ice to your pile. If you are turning, turn your whole body instead of twisting at the waist.

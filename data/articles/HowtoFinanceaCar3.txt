In general, interest rates offered by dealerships are higher than interest rates you can find directly from a lender. In many cases, smaller dealerships work with third party lenders to finance your vehicle. Because they play the middleman, they pass off the costs to you. Therefore, you may want to apply for a direct loan first and cut out the dealership middleman.In some cases, financing lenders like local banks and credit unions won’t take a chance on used cars. For used cars, most dealers will finance used cars they sell, regardless of its age. Therefore, you may want to apply for a dealer loan if a direct lender denies you financing.
 Bring interest rates from direct loan lenders, even if you plan on financing with the dealer. Dealers are more likely to offer lower interest rates, if you show them that you know what other lenders are offering. Make sure you research competitive interest rates based on your credit score.
 The larger the down payment, the less money you will have to finance and the less interest you’ll have to pay on that loan.

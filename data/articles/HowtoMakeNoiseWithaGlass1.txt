 The amount of water you place in the glass will affect the pitch of the sound that is created. The more water placed in the glass, the lower-pitched the sound. Conversely, the less water placed in the glass, the higher-pitch the sound.You may use other types of liquid in your wine glass to make music, but note that thicker liquids have a harder time creating music, and may alter the sound produced.;
, In order to create the friction needed to produce the “song,” your finger will need to be wet. This removes some of the oils from your fingers, allowing your finger to get the right “grip” on the glass rim.Wash our hands prior to dipping your finger in the water to attain an especially oil-free finger.
Dipping your finger in vinegar is also an effective way of clearing your finger of oils.
 While holding the glass from the bottom with your other hand, move your finger around the border of the glass. You want to reach a midway point between being able to move your finger smoothly around the rim, and the drag created by the friction of your finger.


Do not press too hard or too loose. You’ll either create too much friction, or not quite enough to produce the perfect pitch.
A slight change in the pressure you place on the rim of the wine glass can raise or lower the volume of the song., By filling multiple wine glasses with different amounts of liquid, you can produce a range of notes. Put on a little after dinner show by yourself, or invite the kids to make some music.


Wine glasses come in a variety of shapes, some thinner, and others squatter. The types of sounds produced by these glasses will differ from a standard glass, so try a variety of types.Wine glasses can also be played while partly submerged in water. This is called an inverted wineglass harp, and can allow you to play multiple notes easily with just one glass.

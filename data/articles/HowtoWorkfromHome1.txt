 Whether you're lucky enough to have a home office or just a desk in your house, you need to clear off an area that is meant only for working. You should have a desk that has only the things on it that you would keep in your desk at an office, and you should be working in a clean space just as you would in an office.


Things from the work space should not leave the work space. You shouldn't be scrambling to find your important papers and office supplies in your bedroom.
Ideally, your work space should have a door that you can shut.

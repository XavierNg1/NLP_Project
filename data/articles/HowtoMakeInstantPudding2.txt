 You can use a fork or whisk to mix everything together. Don't add the vanilla beans just yet; you still need to prepare them.
 Place a vanilla bean down on a cutting board, and slit it open lengthwise. Use the tip of your knife to scrape out the seeds. Do the same for the other bean.
 If you see any clumps of seeds, use a spoon to break them apart. This is your instant pudding mixture.
 Cut each scraped-out vanilla bean half into two or three pieces. Drop these pieces into a large mason jar.
 Close the jar tightly, and shake it to combine. The vanilla bean pieces will help release their flavor further into the mixture.
 When you want to make instant pudding, stir Â½ cup (96 grams) of the mixture into 2 cups (475 milliliters) of milk. Cook in a saucepan over high heat, stirring constantly. When it starts to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer. Keep stirring, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it thickens. Pour into a serving bowl, and let it set for 5 minutes. You can serve this hot or chilled.


If the vanilla beans get into the pudding, pick them out with a fork after you cook the pudding, and discard them.

 Just telling your friends that you have bipolar depression may leave them feeling a little lost. When you tell them, make sure you also give them some information about bipolar depression in general and how it affects you.Share facts and statistics with your friends. For example, let them know how many people in your age range have bipolar depression. The more your friends know about bipolar depression, the better they can support you.
Let your friends know how it personally feels for you to have bipolar depression. Explaining your experience will give them insight into you and the disease. For instance, you might say, “Some people become hyper-sexual when they are in a manic phase. I take more athletic risks like base jumping.”
Tell your friends about resources where they can find out more about bipolar depression, such as NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) or the American Mental Health Foundation.
 Your friends may have questions for you after you tell them about your bipolar depression. Answer them as honestly as you can. Answering the questions will help your friends understand bipolar depression and you better. It may also help you realize that you are more educated about bipolar depression than you realized.


For example, a friend might ask, “So, do you have to take medication every day?” You could answer, “I manage my bipolar with medication and therapy.”
If you don’t feel comfortable answering a particular question, then say so. You might say, “I don’t feel comfortable answering that one right now. Got any others?”
If you don’t know the answer to one of your friend’s question, you could say, “I don’t know offhand, but I’ll look it up.”

, When you tell your friends, you should also let them know that you will need their help to manage your bipolar depression.Some of your friends may ask you what they can do to help you without prompting. It’s also okay, though, for you to ask your friends for support.


Try saying, “I could really use your help managing my bipolar depression. Some days are better than others.”
Be specific about what will help. For instance, you might tell a friend in your class, “Could you pick up assignments for me if I ever need it?”
Let them know how not to support you, as well. For example, you might say, “Encouraging me to do reckless things when I seem manic doesn’t help me.”
Work with your friends to develop a list of things they can do, and make sure both of you keep copies in a handy place. This will be helpful in a crisis.

Allow the grill to heat up for about five minutes before proceeding. This will make the cleaning process easier. If there are any remaining traces of fat or food, scrape them off after heating the grill., Wait for the grill to cool off. Use wipes specifically designed for cleaning grills, which you can buy at a hardware store. Wipe down the grill's lid and interior to remove any dirt, debris, or stuck on food.

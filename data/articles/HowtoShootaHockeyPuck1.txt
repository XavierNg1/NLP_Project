 Put your non-dominant hand on the top of the stick and your dominant hand about halfway down the shaft or a foot below your non-dominant hand. This will help give you proper control and power.


The position of your fingers on the stick is not as important. Choose what is comfortable for you.;
, Your knees should be bent in an athletic stance and your body should be positioned at a 45 degree angle in relation to the net or wherever you are shooting.


It is important to be at the correct angle to the net so that the puck will be shot in the right direction.
 For the wrist shot, the puck should be positioned at your back foot. This will allow you to have more leverage and thus more power.


Do not put the puck so far back that it is uncomfortable. Try to get the puck as close to your back foot while still being in a comfortable position.
 Again, this will help you get more power in your shot and be a more stable shooter.
 Only raise the stick so that it makes at most a 10 degree angle to the ground.


The blade should rotate at most 45 degree angles backward.
 Sweep the puck forward while transferring your weight toward your front foot and rotating your body forward. Your hips and shoulders should turn toward your target


The rotation should be a quick turn but not so quick that it hurts your back or makes your shot unstable.



Your non-dominant hand should across and behind your hip when pulled backwards.
 At the point of release, turn your wrists at the point of release in order to turn the stick blade out and lift the puck.
 The height of the shot depends on how much you rotate your wrists and how high your follow-through is.

In order to shoot accurately, you must follow through correctly. After the shot, point the blade of the stick and angle your hips and shoulders to where you want the shot to go.

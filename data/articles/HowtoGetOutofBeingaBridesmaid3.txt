 No one can fault a mom from putting her children first!


Small children are always a great excuse. Claim that you are not comfortable leaving your baby or toddler with a babysitter. The bride-to-be probably does not want crying children getting in the way of planning for her special day. You could say, “I’m practicing attachment parenting with Emma and she has never been away from me for any considerable length of time. If I accepted your invitation to be in your wedding, I would have to bring Emma with me to the shower, bachelorette party, etc. I think we both know that would be a disaster!”

, Teens are demanding, busy, and often prone to getting in trouble. Explain to the bride-to-be that you need to keep a very close eye on your teen and don’t trust him to be left alone for long periods. You could say, “Zach has been making very poor choices lately, and I’m afraid of what could happen if I left him unsupervised while I was attending planning meetings for your wedding.”

, If you husband is the type who expects to come home from work and find dinner waiting on the table, period, serving as a bridesmaid could upset the family dynamic. Hopefully the bride-to-be will not want her upcoming marriage to ruin your existing marriage. Say something like, “I’ve been walking on eggshells lately with Rick. He is acting very needy, and I feel like I need to devote most of my time to him.”

, If you have a parent with an illness or disability, or who is in the early stages of dementia, the bride-to-be should understand the stresses you’re facing. Tell your friend, “My parents are not doing well. I’m the only person they trust, and I can’t guarantee they won’t have a crisis on the day of your bridal shower or wedding.”

 Finding your bliss is risky business because you can’t be sure where your journey will lead you. Your bliss may prompt you to quit your job, leave an unhappy relationship, or move across the country. Adopt an attitude of openness to experiences—especially those that frighten you.If an opportunity presents itself that remotely awakens your bliss, go for it. For example, a friend calls and asks if you want to join them on a road trip. Deep down, you want to go, but think of all the logical reasons you should stay. Finding your bliss is about taking that leap and making it happen—because it just may lead somewhere magical.
 Openness to experience is also about challenging yourself to broaden your knowledge or understanding of the world around you. You won’t be able to find your bliss if you only do things you’ve already done. Make a commitment to try one new thing daily or weekly.For instance, you might eat out at a new restaurant, read a book from an author you don’t usually like, or strike up a conversation with someone although you’re typically shy.
 You are better positioned to find your bliss when you have an open mind. So, don’t discount anything. If you see something interesting, find out more. If someone says something that sparks your interest, ask questions., When you open yourself up to new experiences, you must anticipate some of them being unfavorable. You might ask out someone interesting and get turned down. You might eat at a new restaurant and greatly dislike the food. Expect this and be okay with it. See every mistake or bad outcome simply as pushing you closer and closer to your bliss.


To truly experience bliss, make light of these disappointments. For example, if you are rejected by a potential date, you might think to yourself "Well, I know that wasn't my soulmate!" If you dislike the food at a restaurant, think to yourself "It was an interesting experience, but I certainly won't be dining here again."

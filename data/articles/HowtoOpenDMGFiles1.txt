 DMG files are Mac-format disk image files. They are most commonly used for installing applications. When you double-click the DMG file, a new Finder window will open showing the contents of the file.


If you are using Windows, click here.;
, Double-clicking the DMG will show all of the contents of the DMG image. These could be documents, pictures, programs, or any other type of file.
 If the DMG file contains application files, simply dragging them to your Applications folder should install them.


Some programs will have an installer that should be run instead of just dragging the files.
 Once you are done browsing the files or installing the program, you can unmount the disk image from your computer by right-clicking on it and selecting "Eject".


Make sure you right-click the virtual disk on your desktop, not the actual DMG file.
 As you download more and more programs, your old DMG files will begin to take up a significant amount of space. Drag your old DMG files to the Trash to get rid of them.

 You’ll need a large sharpening stone for these steps. Lightly coat the rough side of the stone with sharpening oil.
 Push the blade across the stone in a cutting motion. Raise the handle while moving the blade to sharpen all the way to the tip. After a few strokes, flip the blade over to the other side.


After you have a sharp edge on every part of the blade, repeat the sharpening on the fine side of the sharpening stone.
 Hold a piece of printer paper in your hand and cut down near where you’re holding with the knife. A properly sharpened blade should be able to easily slice the paper into ribbons.

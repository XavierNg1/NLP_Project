 When you're obedient in following the mandates of your faith it means that you're also being humble. You accept that your god is helping to direct your life and that you accept both the good and the bad that comes.


Try to avoid taking ownership of the things that happen in your life. When something good happens, remind yourself that it was through the grace of your Great Teacher. If something unhappy happens it is a learning experience brought about by Him or Her, too.
 Most faiths and religions have specific rules and regulations that a practitioner is required to follow. Committing to your faith means giving up control of your life (not in a bad way) and understanding that what happens is coming from your Holy Teacher.
 Again, because of the rules and regulations in different faiths there are going to be certain choices that will be difficult, because they will make you choose between a life that might be materially easier, but not spiritually acceptable. Obedience to your faith means choosing the latter path.


For example: such a choice could be sacrificing your career path, because it doesnâ€™t align with your beliefs.
It could also be something like taking significant time out of your day to incorporate prayer.
 Obedience to your faith is a personal thing. It means that you are in connection with your god and your faith and that can be wonderful.


It does not mean that you have carte blanche to criticize other people's beliefs or infringe on their way of living.

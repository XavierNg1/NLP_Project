 Pour only 1.5 cup of heavy cream and the candy corn pieces into a medium-sized skillet or saucepan, over medium heat. Use a wooden spoon to stir slowly until the cream resembles a light orange color and the candy corn melts.
 Shut the stovetop off and leave the cream to cool until it reaches room temperature. While it cools, the color of the cream will become more vibrant., When the cream is at room temperature, slowly pour in the rest of the heavy and all of the milk. Mix using a wooden spoon., Pour the cream mixture in a large, airtight container. Close it tightly with a lid. Place in the freezer to freeze for about three hours or even overnight, until the mixture chills fully.

While the cream mixture freezes, shake the container every hour to help the candy corn become loose.
 Following the ice cream machine's instructions, make the ice cream until it's creamy and rich. It will usually take about 20 minutes for the ice cream to form., Scoop the ice cream into a different large container, and close tightly with a lid. Place the ice cream back in the freezer to freeze for an additional two hours., Remove the ice cream from the freezer and have it soften before serving. Use an ice cream scoop to scoop the ice cream in a serving bowl. Garnish with extra candy corn and chocolate syrup if desired. Enjoy!

 It's important to cite your paraphrase in the text of the MLA paper, so that you give credit where credit is due. When paraphrasing a quote in MLA format, you just need the author's last name and page number, but you'll have to provide more information about the source in the "Works Cited" page at the end of your paper. Here's how to cite the paraphrase within the text of your MLA paper:Within the text: "Children should read more books"(Smith 46-47).
 If you're working in APA formatting, it's important to cite the quote within the actual text of the paper as well. To cite in APA format, you just have to refer to the author's last name and the date of publication. You'll provide more information about the source in your "References" page. Here's how you do it:"According to Smith (2007), children should read more books." or "Children should read more books"(Smith, 2007).

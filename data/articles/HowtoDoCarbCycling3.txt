 Carbohydrates have gotten a bad reputation in the last several years. Unfortunately, this bad reputation isn’t really deserved because carbohydrates play a huge role in keeping your body functioning and healthy. Restricting your carbohydrates over the long term can have negative effects on your body. Therefore, using carb cycling, you can give your body the carbs it needs to keep going while still losing weight.Carbohydrates are an essential fuel for your body. Without this fuel, your body slows down so that it can preserve energy.
For example, long-term carb restriction can cause the metabolism to actually slow down.
 Whether your goal is to gain muscle, to lose fat or both, many fitness professionals believe that carb cycling offers a good way to keep your body from plateauing. Thus, if you feel that you are having a more difficult time gaining muscle, or losing that last five pounds, a carb cycle may help get you over that plateau.This is because while you are essentially eating a low-carb diet, you are also “surprising” your body with a few days of high-carb intake. This prevents your metabolism from slowing down.
 On the days that you eat more carbs, you will also be eating more calories, and that is OK as long as your carbs are coming from healthy sources. This is because carbohydrates are simply naturally more calorie dense. On the days that you are eating low-carb, you will naturally eat fewer calories as long as you are sticking to healthy foods (e.g. lean meat, fish, and lots of leafy greens).This is especially important to understand if you are trying to lose weight because you may be worried that you are eating too many calories on your high-carb days. In general, if you are sticking to healthy high-carb meals with reasonable portion sizes, then those extra calories won’t be a problem.

 If you always do your homework and get decent grades, what's your mom's excuse for saying no? Exactly, she doesn't have one. Do your best in school and in your extracurricular activities so that your mom sees how much you deserve the treat you want.
 Take a bit off the load off your mom by helping her clean the house, do the dishes, mow the lawn, walk the dog, and all the other little things she does to keep the house running. If you're asking for something big, doing some extra chores doesn't hurt. Go above and beyond a few weeks before you pop the question.
 Being reliable is the key. If you deceive your mom and you're always late, she's not likely to give in when you want something. Do your best to get home when you say you will and be reliable in other ways. If you say you'll have your room clean by Saturday, have it done. If you say you'll feed the cat, do it without needing to be asked a second time. Your mom will notice how reliable you've been.
 Your mom will absolutely love it if you surprise her by taking over the kitchen and cooking something for her and the family. Get up early and cook some scrambled eggs and pancakes for breakfast, or use your free afternoon to bake up a cake or some cookies for everyone. It sounds weird but it really works.Just make sure you clean up afterward.
 Ask her about her day. She probably asks you about yours, so why not reverse it and see what happens? Your mom will be touched, and more likely to say yes. Take it to the next level by telling her about how things are going in your life and letting her in on what you've been thinking about. You will be shocked at how much more likely she'll be to let you start making more decisions on your own.

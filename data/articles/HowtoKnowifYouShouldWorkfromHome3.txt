 While working remotely has its perks, it also has some downfalls. When you work from home it is often difficult to establish and maintain boundaries between work time and the rest of your life. When work bleeds into non-work, or vice versa, it can be difficult to maintain boundaries and effectively complete tasks., While working from home may save you money on transportation, it also might mean that you are bearing the burden of other work-related costs such as electricity, office supplies, and even equipment. Carefully consider these expenses before deciding whether working from home is right for you. You might, however, be able to take a home office deduction on your taxes., Working from home most often means working alone. By doing so you are foregoing day-to-day, in-person contact with your co-workers. This can lead to isolation. The lack of contact also means you are missing out on valuable face time that can spawn creativity and boost productivity., Working from home means you will not have the benefit of onsite computer maintenance and information technology specialists that many brick and mortar offices provide employees. When you have a computer issue while working from home you may have to assess the problem and find a solution on your own., In order to successfully work from home, you will need to figure out ways to eliminate distractions. These can be as simple as that unfolded basket of laundry or as complicated as a crying child who interrupts an important conference call. Take all possible distractions into consideration before you ditch the office and take up business in your bedroom.

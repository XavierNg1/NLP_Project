 Drawing salve is an ointment that is used to treat different skin inflammations. Its main ingredients are ichthammol, arnica montana, phenyl alcohol and herbs such as Echinacea and calendula. It works by seeping into the tissue. Its most active ingredient, Ichthammol, can soften the skin by weakening it and increasing blood flow to the affected area. The increased blood flow results in the formation of pus around the foreign object. The pus and the foreign object are then ejected.


The drawing salve can normally work overnight but may also take as long as three days. This method is relatively painless.
 Instruct him to stay calm and tell him that the process is painless. Consider having someone hold the child while you apply the salve, as children tend to squirm.
 Prepare the necessary materials. You will need:


Cotton balls soaked in alcohol.
Band-aide.
Drawing salve.
 Clean the punctured area with cotton balls soaked in alcohol from the inner part of the wound to the outer part of the wound. This maneuver prevents dirt and other microorganisms from getting into the punctured wound. Let the wound air dry for about two minutes.
 Get the drawing salve and apply a small amount (about the size of your pointer finger) to the punctured area. Make sure to cover the entire punctured area.
 Get the band aid and put it over the drawing salve ointment and the punctured area. Wait for 24 hours. Instruct your child not to remove the band aid, even if it feels uncomfortable.


After 24 hours, the splinter is usually drawn out of the skin into the band aid.
Slowly remove the band aid and look for the splinter attached to it. If you see that the splinter is still in the skin, reapply the salve and place another band aid over the wound for 24 more hours.

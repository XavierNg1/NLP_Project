 When your partner steps on a tread and causes a squeak, look for a gap between the tread and riser or the tread and stringer. If you see a small one, worm a shim’s thinner edge in between the two parts.Use a hammer to gently tap the thicker end until the shim is firmly in place. Be careful to insert the shim only far enough to fill the existing gap. Avoid driving it in to the point that the thicker end begins to separate the stairs’ parts even more.
For extra security, apply carpenter glue to both sides of the shim before inserting.
A shim may also be referred to as a wedge.
 If you find that the gap under the tread stretches along the entire length of the riser or stringer, or almost the entire length, use carpenter glue or construction adhesive to fill the space. Tell your partner to step off of the tread. Insert the nozzle into the gap if you can. If not, draw a bead of glue along its length and then push the glue into the gap with any long object that is thin enough to fit into the gap.Carpenter glue and construction adhesive are different products. Carpenter glue typically works best for wood-on-wood projects. However, in this instance, construction adhesive is also suitable if your stairs are exposed to a lot of moisture, since its formula is more water-resistant than carpenter glue.Place a heavy object on top of the tread while the glue dries so it is flush against the stringer or riser underneath.
 If the stringer or riser has lost its original shape due to wear-and-tear or warping, give the tread a fresher piece of wood to rest on. Cut a wooden board to the length needed. Use carpenter glue or construction adhesive to line the side that will make contact with the tread. Place the board flat against the stringer or riser, with the top pressed flush against the tread. Then nail or screw the board into the stringer or riser.This method is only meant to eliminate gaps caused by slight warping or wear-and-tear, not to reinforce the strength of weak stairs.

 Just scribble! Get your creative juices flowing this way. You’ll actually start to observe how things come together, and you’ll start to develop a steady hand. This will also help you hone your creativity because you’ll be drawing all your own ideas.
 This is a great way to learn how things fit together and how to draw common objects. Try to draw the couch in your living room, or the tree in your back yard, or anything else. It’s probably best to start with objects rather than landscapes. Landscapes can be tough because you're dealing with perspective. However, it is completely up to you!

, Short lines make it much easier to draw straight lines, squares, and circles. It’s much more natural for us to draw using short lines. Just try drawing using tiny dashes and you’ll find that you have much more control over your pen or pencil.
 Try to see proportions everywhere. Compare the size of your fingers to the size of your hand, the size of your backpack to that fence off in the distance, etc. Start by drawing the simplest things you can think of, like a square house and a person standing next to it. Once you start to feel comfortable with basic proportions you can move on. , You don’t like snakes? Well, too bad! Drawing snakes is a great way to help you practice drawing parallel and concurrent lines more effectively. It’s a good way to free your hand. If you’re finding it really difficult, start by drawing circles next to each other in the shape of a snake. Make the first circle the largest, and then each one smaller after that. Now draw parallel lines on the top and bottoms of all these circles. That's the idea behind drawing a snake.

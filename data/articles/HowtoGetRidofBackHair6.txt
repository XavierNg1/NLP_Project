 A professional waxing will work more or less the same way as if you were doing it yourself or having a friend help you. The level of pain is likely to be roughly the same. Professionals may be able to work more quickly than amateur assistants and, depending the service you use, you may be in a more comfortable environment than you would be at home.


Back waxing fees will vary by location. $40-$70 for just the back is typical — costs will be higher if extra areas are waxed., This option uses a precisely-controlled medical laser to burn individual hair roots. Multiple treatments are usually needed over time to get permanent results. Some limited hair regrowth can occur over time, though multiple sessions make this less likely.This procedure tends to cost about $400-$500 per session.
One advantage of laser treatments is that they allow the option of "thinning out" patches of hair, rather than removing all of it., This option uses a small electrical probe to individually shock each hair follicle. Electrolysis is truly permanent — once each cell is treated, it is very rare that hair will regrow. However, since each hair follicle must be treated individually, it can be very time-consuming.


This procedure costs about $40 per treatment, but a large area like your back may require many treatments.

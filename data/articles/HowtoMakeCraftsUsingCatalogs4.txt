 You can use the images to mix and match ideas, to put together a book of wanted clothing or to simply inspire your own designing and sewing ideas., For this project, you will need pictures of clothes––lots of them. Go through catalogs and mark all of the pictures. Check each side of the page, to be sure you have the best image from the same page.

Shoe and accessory catalogs should be included in the catalogs you choose.
 Cut out both pieces of a suit, or if you're feeling very adventurous, cut off all the sleeves and cut off the pant legs, to allow you to create entirely new clothing styles.

You might want to cut out the heads of the models as well as their clothes.
, Find two or more pieces of paper. Fold them into a booklet shape, then staple or glue them together to create four or more pages. On the cover, put the picture of your favorite model with all their clothes on. On each page, trace the outline of a shirt-and-pants ensemble or of a person on which you can place the clothing. Or, you can add the clothing pieces in boxes, randomly or any other preferred way.,, For example, you might wish to be reminded as to why you've paired some items together, perhaps for a sewing project or items you'd like to find when out shopping., If you've made the booklet purse size, you can pop it in your bag when you head out shopping for new clothes.

 Start with firm, fresh garlic, since the plant develops a harsh, bitter taste as it ages. Peel the cloves and remove any green sprouts (another source of bitterness).


One easy way to peel garlic is to smash it with the side of a chef's knife, then pull off the loosened skin.;
, Chop the garlic as finely as possible with a large, sharp chef's knife.


If you have a zip-locked bag, a meat mallet, and a rolling pin, skip the chopping and scroll down to the end of this section.
 Sea salt or other coarse-grained salt helps grind the garlic into a paste, and draws out moisture for a softer, juicier result., Scrape the garlic into a small pile. Hold the blunt edge of your knife with both hands, pointing it away from you at a low angle, close to the cutting board. Scrape the knife over the garlic repeatedly until it forms a paste.Occasionally scrape the garlic back into a pile and mince briefly to remove large pieces.
 If you have the right tools, there's a faster way to turn garlic into a paste:Drop the peeled garlic and salt into a small plastic baggie. Seal the bag closed.
Crush the garlic lightly with a meat mallet, without tearing the bag.
Finish the job with a rolling pin. Periodically pick up the bag and squeeze the garlic to the bottom to ensure a smooth paste.
 Try the paste on garlic bread, toss onto pasta, or add to stir fries.


If you do have leftovers, store in the coldest part of your fridge. Discard after three days even if there are no obvious signs of spoilage.

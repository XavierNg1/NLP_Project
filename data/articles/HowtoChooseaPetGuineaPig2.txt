 Females tend to be more calm, while males tend to be more active.Other than this general difference, the sex you choose is basically a matter of preference.
 There are a wide variety of breeds of guinea pigs, each with a distinctive appearance.To narrow down the breeds, decide whether you would like a short-haired pig or a long-haired pig. This will help you narrow down your choices.


The American guinea pig is the most common breed. It has a short and smooth coat that is easy to care for.Getting a long-haired guinea pig will require a bit more grooming on your part. They need to be brushed regularly to avoid tangles and mattes in the coat.
If you are adopting a guinea pig from a rescue, you may not have much choice when it comes to breed. If the specific breed is important to you, you may need to go to a specialized breeder.
 For instance, if you already have a guinea pig, you need to make sure that your new and old guinea pig will not breed, although male and female guinea pigs usually get along really well. In addition, if you have several male guinea pigs in a cage already, it is not a good idea to introduce a female.This can lead to fighting between the males.

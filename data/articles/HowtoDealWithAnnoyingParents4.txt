 Whether you are dealing with your own parents, a spouse's parents, or the parents of one of your students, you may at some point be given unsolicited advice. If this happens, it's important to restrain your frustration and refrain from getting angry.


If you are getting unwanted advice from a spouse's parents, talk to your spouse. It's best if your spouse addresses his or her own parents, rather than you telling them to stop.Remember that unsolicited advice is, at heart, an effort at showing concern., If you're getting unwanted advice from your parents or from a student's parents, you may need to communicate (calmly) that you feel frustrated by the constant advice.


Politely tell the parent that you understand he means well, but that constantly giving unsolicited advice makes you feel threatened in some ways.Bring the subject up when you're both calm and when you both have time to sit and talk.
 Once you've addressed the unsolicited advice you've been getting, you'll need to make your request for the advice to stop.


Ask the parent to trust you and respect you enough to make your own decisions. Let him know that you share his concerns and will work toward the same goals, but that you need the freedom to do it in your own way.

 One of the most common uses is for friendship bracelets. From young kids to teenagers to adults, friendship bracelets are worn around the world, and they are commonly made form the simple box gimp stitch.


Make the gimp as long as it needs to be (use a measuring tape on your wrist and add an inch). Super glue or melt the ends together and then slip it around your wrist. You could also use metal clasps.
If you don't have super glue you can tie the ends together, or you can also use a match to melt the ends together.
 Add a keyring to one end of your gimp and you've got a keychain! Having a nicely stitched gimp as your keychain holder is a nice look, and since gimp lacing and the stitch itself are highly durable, it’s ideal for applications such as keeping your keys in place.


Add the key ring first, as you begin the stitch if your intent is to make a keychain.
You can make a keychain out of a gimp you’ve already woven- simply use a match to melt the ends of the two strands together around your keyring for a permanent connection. , A box gimp is ideal for making a long, sturdy lanyard. The gimp lacing can withstand being pummeled about on a lifeguard’s neck as he or she jumps in and out of the water. You'll need two extra long strands of gimp.
Attach the two pieces by tying, using superglue, or melting together to form the attachment to hang around your neck.
Attach whistle or other item in a similar fashion as a keyring to the other two ends.

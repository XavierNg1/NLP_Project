 The type of product used to remove the label will depend largely on the product you are removing the label from.


Hard surfaces are easier to remove labels from than clothing and furniture. When selecting your product, take into consideration any side effects. You can use chemical-based products with less risk on glass and washable surfaces, such as mason jars. Generally, try natural products for clothing and painted surfaces.
For example, do not spread peanut butter on your furniture because you’ll never get the grease out. But it’s great for clothing because you can work it into the glue and then machine wash any remaining residue.;
, Before you try applying product to it, see how much of the residue you can get off without taking that step.


First try lifting a corner with a fingernail and pulling the sticker off in one piece. If this doesn't work, soak it overnight in dish washing liquid.
If the sticker doesn't come off by itself, scrape with a metal sponge or knife. For persistent glue, try applying heat from a blow dryer.
Test a small spot first. In some cases, it may take some trial and error to find the right product for your particular label situation.
 Cut a piece of tape and connect both ends together to have the sticky side exposed.Slide 2 fingers into the space in between the connected tape ends, and press the tape against the sticker residue. This will work especially well for sticker residue on glass.
The masking tape will pull the sticky residue off. If using duct tape, take a small strip, about 3-8 inches of it, and stick it to whichever surface has the residue. Pull the tape up and lay it back down repeatedly until all residue is gone.
The tape is sticky, and the residue is sticky, meaning that the bond between the tape and the residue will be stronger than the bond between the residue and whatever surface you are trying to remove it from.

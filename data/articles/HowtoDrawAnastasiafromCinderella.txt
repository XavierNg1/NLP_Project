 Don't spend too much time on these, just dash them off, but make sure they're all connected to/overlapping one another.;
, Also draw two lines curving down and slightly outward from underneath the head for the neck.
 Make the top oval’s line curve into itself as shown to give it the appropriately fluffy effect.
 The first one should be large and directly below the head, to serve as the basis for the chest. Draw two more circles overlapping the first to form Anastasia's puffy sleeves. (Including her clothes on she's a fairly round character, so keep these shapes as full as you possibly can.)

, This should taper down for the waist. On both sides of this oval, draw two long, slender ovals for the arms--these should come out from the two previous small circles (sleeves).
 For Anastasia’s left hand draw a circle at the bottom of the arm oval. Then draw three small ovals out from the circle to represent the fingers, as shown.
 Anastasia has an astonished look on her face in most pictures of her (perhaps she's just learned that Prince Charming is in love with Cinderella?), so make her eyes and mouth big Os and her fist clenched in--disbelief? fury? You decide!

, Color in Anastasia and your drawing is completely done!

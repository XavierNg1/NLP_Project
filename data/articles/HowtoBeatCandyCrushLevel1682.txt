 At the beginning of the level, there are six candy time bombs on the board. All have their timers set to 13. This means you have 13 moves to take them out or they explode. Match them with similar-colored candies right away. Do not let them count down to zero, because it’s game over when they do.
 Two of the corners have chocolate wheels. They will start spreading chocolate as early as your second move. Break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board. Although the chocolate may take over some time bombs, it is not worth the trouble.
 This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move. Your focus should be on clearing the jellies.

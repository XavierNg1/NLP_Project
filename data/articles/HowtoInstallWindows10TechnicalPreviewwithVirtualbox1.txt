 If you are already signed up as a Windows Insider, you can skip this step. If you haven’t signed up as an Insider yet, you will need to do so before continuing to the next step. Visit the Windows Insider Program main page, and click the purple “Get Started” button. Follow the prompts to sign up.


If you already have an account with Microsoft (Hotmail, Live, Outlook, etc.) you can sign in with these. If not, you will be required to set up a new email account with them before continuing.;
, If you don’t already have VirtualBox downloaded, now would be the time to do that, and get it installed. Head to it’s VirtualBox official download page. Under the “VirtualBox platform packages” click the “VirtualBox 4.3.28 for Windows hosts” option. This should all be at the top of the page. Wait for it to finish downloading and follow the on-screen prompts to finish installation.
 Windows Insiders get access to updated versions of Windows 10 before they are released to the public. These are called “builds.” Head on over to the official Windows 10 Preview download page, and scroll down the page until you see a listing of languages. Choose your language and select either a 32-bit option or 64-bit from the drop-down menu that appears. This will depend on your PC hardware and is important, so make sure ahead of time that you know what you are currently running. You will notice that, under the “Editions” subheading, and to the right of each option, it will say the build number (e.g., Build 10130). Make your choice by clicking the blue “Download” button to the right of this. Wait for it to finish before continuing.


In order to know whether your current PC is either 32- or 64-bit, simply press and hold the Windows key and hit R. Enter “cmd” in the box and hit enter. A black window pops up; here, simply enter “echo %processor_architecture%” and hit Enter. If you see the number 64 in the results, then you are running a 64-bit processor. If not, then its 32-bit.

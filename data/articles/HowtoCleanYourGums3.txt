 Get a deep clean of your teeth and gums by getting scaling and polishing done through your dentist. Scaling and polishing is usually recommended if you have a buildup of plaque and tartar on your teeth and gums or if you are at risk of developing gum disease.During the cleaning, the dental hygienist will scrape away the plaque and tartar using special instruments, followed by a polish to remove marks or stains.
 Root planing is a deep cleaning that gets under your gums to remove bacteria from the roots of your teeth. It is often recommended if you have gum disease or other gum related issues.You will be put under local anaesthetic to numb your mouth during the cleaning. After the cleaning, you may feel pain and discomfort for 48 hours.
 Your dentist may recommend that you speak to a periodontist about periodontal surgery if you have severe gum disease and loose or infected teeth. Talk to a periodontist about this option if you have a tooth that is infected or your gums are swollen, irritated, or receding.During periodontal surgery, any affected teeth will be removed. The periodontist may put you on antibiotics after the surgery to prevent further infection.

, Log in under the admin user to the LinkStation’s configuration page.
 Click on “System” in the menu.
 Click on “Power Management” in the submenu.
 Under the Power Management page is the SleepTimer function. Here you can set up three different schedules when the LinkStation is running. Click on “Modify Settings.”

, You can set this to “Every day” or “Specific days of the week.”


If you choose the latter, you have to tick which days the schedule would be for.
 This is the time when the LinkStation will boot up and start running.
 This is the time when the LinkStation shuts down and turns off.


This should be set later than the wake-up time.
 Repeat steps 1 to 4 as needed.


Remember you have three slots to set three different schedules. Use these wisely and avoid overlapping them.
 Click on “Save” when you’re done.

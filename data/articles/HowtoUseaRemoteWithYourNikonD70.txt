 For the Nikon D70, it is an ML-L3 (or the ML-L1). There are also third party remotes that you can get.;
,, No reason to use the remote if you are holding the camera.
 Rotate the command dial (on the back of the camera) until the self timer symbol appears. This is a circle with a line through part of it.
,, Depending on if you chose to delay the activation, or not, your camera will take a picture.

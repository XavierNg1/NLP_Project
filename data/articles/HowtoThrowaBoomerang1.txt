 You can hold the boomerang on either arm -- the lift (leading) arm or the dingle (trailing) arm. Either way, make sure that the painted, curved side is always facing toward you and the flat side is facing away from you., The pinch grip involves "pinching" the boomerang between your thumb and index finger. You throw the boomerang by flicking your wrist backwards before snapping it forwards. This creates enough momentum to pull the boomerang out of your hand and create spin., This grip is similar to the pinch grip, except you wrap your index finger (or all four fingers) around the edge of the boomerang instead. Grip the boomerang as close to the bottom of the arm as possible, and as you throw, flick the boomerang with your index finger as if pulling a trigger. This helps to create spin.

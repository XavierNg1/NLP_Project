 The best pasta to use for this recipe is mostaccioli or penne.
 Rinse the tomatoes, cucumber, and onions. The olives do not need to be rinsed, as the oil gives them extra flavor. Prepare your ingredients in the following ways:


Cut and quarter enough cherry tomatoes to fill 2 cups (400 grams).
Cut a medium cucumber in half, lengthwise. Cut each half into slices.
Cut 4 green onions into slices.
Cut enough pitted kalamata olives to fill 1/3 cup (60 grams).
 Fill a jar with ½ cup (120 milliliters) of olive oil and ½ cup (120 milliliters) of lemon juice. Add 2 tablespoons of fresh basil, 2 tablespoons of fresh oregano, ¼ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Mince 4 cloves of garlic and add them to the jar too. Close the jar and shake it until the olive oil and lemon juice are no longer separated.


If you can't find fresh basil, use 2 teaspoons of dried basil instead.
If you can't find fresh oregano, use 2 teaspoons of dried oregano instead.
If you like anchovies, add 1 tablespoon of anchovy paste.
 You can use all of the dressing, or only part of it, depending on how moist or dry you like your salad. Keep in mind that the pasta will soak up some of the dressing.
 Use a large pair of salad tongs to do this. Toss it gently so that you don't break any of the pasta noodles.
 Cover the salad with some plastic cling wrap and leave it in the refrigerator.
 If you want, you can sprinkle it with some fresh oregano leaves. This is enough to make 12 to 16 side salads.

 The recipe will need to provide bake times for two cakes and you'll need two 8" or 9" round pans.


If you don't have two round pans and/or the recipe doesn't have bakes times for two cakes, carefully cut the cake in half with a cake leveler. If you don't have one, use a knife or something similar. Alternatively, cook the cakes separately, although this will take longer.

You can use frosting, whipped cream, preserves, jelly/jam, melted marshmallows and other sweet items to spread on the cake top as filling instead. Choose whatever goes well with the flavor and texture of the cake.
 Do so with care, making sure it's evenly placed.
 Use whatever frosting you prefer.


Alternatively, leave the cake unfrosted. The filling will already be rich enough and too much frosting can make the cake too rich to enjoy.
, Alternatively, wait until it's time to eat it, then cut and serve.

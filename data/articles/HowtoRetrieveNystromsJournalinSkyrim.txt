 The ruins can be found on the southwestern edge of the map. To get there, walk from the southernmost city of Falkreath for at least five minutes, traveling northeast up until you reach a large cave with wooden doors comes into sight (you can’t miss it.).;
, Approach the wooden doors and press the corresponding “Enter” button on your controller, as prompted on the game screen to go inside the cave.
 Upon entry you’ll find a ghost (a transparent-looking person, kind of what ghost trivially looks like) of a fallen Nightingale member standing just near the entrance staircase. Press the corresponding “Speak” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to talk to him, and he’ll tell you that the journal of an explorer named Nystrom can guide you towards exploring the Twilight Sepulcher.
 After talking to the sentinel, go to the leftmost side of the main hall and head behind the rocks you see in this clearly specified area of the hall. Behind these rocks is a skeleton lying on the ground. This are the remains of Nystrom.
 Press the designated “Search” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to search the skeleton remains. After searching, Nystrom’s Journal will be added to your item inventory, and you can either continue with your quest or complete it later.

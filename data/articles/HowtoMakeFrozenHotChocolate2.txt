 Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in a double boiler: fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, and set a glass, heat-safe bowl on top. Place the chocolate into the bowl, and stir it until it melts.
 Make sure that you are using pure, unsweetened cocoa powder. Save the remaining 2 teaspoons (8 grams) of sugar for later.


If you cannot find any, and only have hot chocolate mix on hand, use 2 teaspoons of hot chocolate mix and 1Â½ tablespoons (23 grams) of sugar instead., You can use any type of milk you want for this, although whole milk will give you the richest-tasting frozen hot chocolate. Do not pour in the rest of the milk just yet. If the mixture starts to turn solid, place the saucepan on the burner, and turn the heat to low. Continue stirring it until it melts again., If you placed the saucepan back on the burner during the last step, take it off before stirring the rest of the milk in. This should chill the mixture down.If the mixture is still warm, place it into the freezer for a few minutes until it turns cold. Do not let it freeze, however.
 Start at a slow speed to break up the ice, then finish it off with a high speed. Your frozen hot chocolate won't be perfectly smooth like a milkshake or smoothie; it will have a slight grainy texture to it.


Id your blender isn't very strong, use crushed ice instead.
 You can do this by hand with a whisk or with an electric mixer. You can also use a food processor fitted with whisks. Keep beating the sugar and cream until stiff peaks form., You can serve the frozen hot chocolate as is, or you can garnish it further with a drizzle of chocolate sauce, a sprinkle of chocolate curls, or a maraschino cherry.

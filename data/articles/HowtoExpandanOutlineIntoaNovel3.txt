 Start by creating a first draft of the novel. Use an element of your outline, such as a theme, a character, a setting, or a particular scene, to get started. Set up a writing area that is private in your home or in a quiet setting, such as a coffee shop or a shared work space. You may challenge yourself to write a certain number of words a day or to hit a certain page count. Try creating a writing schedule to help you get the draft done.


You may also remove any distractions in your area, such as people talking around you, social media, or your internet connection. Shut off your internet while you are writing and turn off your phone or switch it to silent.
 Once you have completed the draft, do not be afraid to get feedback on it from others. You may show the draft to a mentor, such as a writing teacher or professor. Or you may show the draft to friends or family. Be open to constructive criticism and listen to what others have to say.


You may take notes when you discuss the draft with others or have your reviewers write comments on your draft for you to read.
You may also ask your reviewers follow up questions to help you understand their feedback better. For example, you may ask, "What did you mean by this note here?" or "Can you explain how you want me to expand this scene?"

, Once you have received feedback on the draft, you should sit down and revise it. You may have your outline nearby for reference to make sure all the scenes listed in your outline are in the draft and to ensure your novel follows your outline. You should also apply feedback you receive from others to the draft to make it that much stronger.


You may try reading parts of the novel out loud to make sure the sentences flow well and have a distinct narrative voice. You may also read the novel to others and have them listen to the words to ensure the language is strong.

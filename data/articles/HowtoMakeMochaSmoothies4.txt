 Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of milk, 1/2 cup (148 g) of hazelnut-cocoa spread and 4 teaspoons of instant espresso powder. Place all of the ingredients in a blender and put the lid on it. Blend the ingredients for about 30 seconds, so they're smooth.You can use any type of milk you like. For example, try whole milk, almond milk, or soy milk.
 Pop 6 ice cubes out of a tray and add them to the blender. Put the lid on the blender and blitz the smoothies for about one minute, so the ice is totally blended.You can also make coffee ice cubes. Just pour coffee into an ice cream tray and freeze the coffee until it's frozen.
 Add 2 cups (220 g) of vanilla ice cream and put the lid on the blender. Finish blending the smoothies so the ice cream is completely incorporated. Remove the lid and pour the smoothies into 3 large glasses. Serve the smoothies before they begin to separate.You can garnish the hazelnut mocha smoothies with chocolate curls or just grated dark chocolate.

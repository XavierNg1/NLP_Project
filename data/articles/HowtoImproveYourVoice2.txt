 Speaking loudly and clearly is essential for stage actors. When you deliver your lines, make sure that you are speaking loudly enough that people will be able to hear what you are saying, even at the back of the theater. However, it is important to use your diaphragm to project rather than yelling. If you yell, then your throat will get sore and you may lose your voice.Take a deep breath into your diaphragm and then try practicing breathing out and saying “ha” at the same time. This will help you to identify your diaphragm. You should feel the breath coming from your abdomen and out through your mouth as you say “ha.” After you have mastered this, try speaking your lines using your diaphragmatic breath.
 Speaking your lines clearly is also important for a good acting voice. Make sure that you are enunciating each word of your lines so that people will understand what you are saying. To ensure that you are speaking as clearly as possible, open your mouth as wide as you can when you speak. This will help you to enunciate your lines., Emoting is also an important part of delivering your lines well.To emote, try to think about what your character’s emotions should look like.


For example, if you are saying something that makes the character feel sad, then you might slow down the pace of your lines slightly. You might even allow your voice to register the emotion of sadness more dramatically by speaking with a bit of a trembling voice.
Consider the appropriate emotion for each of your character’s lines to determine how your voice should sound when you speak them.

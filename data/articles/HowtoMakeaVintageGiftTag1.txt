 Whether you choose a piece of music or a vintage photograph, find the one piece of artwork that will serve as the main focal point of your tag.


Select artwork that can be cut and re-fashioned. A valuable or original, sentimental photograph that should not be cut or altered can be copied and printed, leaving the original intact.
Choose a focal point that has meaning to the recipient. Or, find something that provides a clue as to what is inside the package.;

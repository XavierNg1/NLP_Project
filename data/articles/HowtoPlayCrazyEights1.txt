 To win the game, you must get rid of all of the cards in your hand by matching them with the suit or number of the top card in the discard pile., Use a standard 52-card deck if there are five or less players. If you are playing with more than five players, combine two decks of cards.
 If there are three or more players, each player gets five cards. If there are only two players, each player gets seven cards.
 This pile is called the stock. Flip the top card over and place it to the side (face up) to start the discard pile. If the card is an 8, shuffle it back into the deck, and flip over another card.

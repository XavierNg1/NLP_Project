 Instead of completely altering the way you eat, substitute healthier choices in place of those that could raise your blood sugar.
 In particular, count the refined carbohydrates you're consuming, such as white flour baked products, sugary cereals and fried foods. Carbohydrates have a greater impact on your blood sugar levels than anything else because they break down into glucose, very quickly.
 The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates based on how much they raise blood sugar levels after consumption. Foods with a low GI rating are less likely to raise your blood sugar than those with a high rating.


Be aware that the glycemic index may not catch all sources of sugar beyond glucose. Other sugars, such as fructose and lactose, add to your blood sugar load.

 Make sure it's not too small.;
, Make one for each wish.
 It can be as simple as wishing to finish a report by Friday or as crazy as wishing to find $100,000 by tomorrow.
, See which ones came true and which ones you need to work on to make them true. Remove ones that came true or you know will never will.

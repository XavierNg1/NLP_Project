 Menstrual cups are made of silicone formed into a cup with holes around the rim and a small stem. Because they are reusable you won't need to pack around extra supplies or waste. Different brands are sized differently, but generally fall into the categories of small and large, or pre- and post-pregnancy. Wash your cup with unscented soap and water, then practice inserting the cup per package directions.


Note you can insert your menstrual cup before your period begins to avoid surprise bleeding.Menstrual cups are safe to use while sleeping, eliminating the need for potentially bulky pads.
Cups may be used for up to 10-12 hours at a stretch, making them a useful option on long hikes.
 Be careful to bury waste at least 200 feet from your camp, the trail, and any water sources to avoid contamination. Alternatively, if you are car camping or staying in a location with a composting toilet, the waste from your cup may simply be poured down the toilet., Bring along wet wipes to cleanse your hands, as well. Remember to wash your hands both before and after inserting the cup to avoid introducing bacteria that could cause infection.

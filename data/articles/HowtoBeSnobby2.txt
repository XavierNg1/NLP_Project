 Using every trick in the book, coerce those around you to only visit the spots you deem worthy of your presence. There are a lot of exceptional places to choose from but if you didn’t think of it, it’s not good enough.


Consider using tactics like pouting to manipulate those around you into caving in.
Throw out words like "Tacky" and "Gross" to convey your utter disdain.
 Whether a 5-star restaurant or a local coffee shop, you must have everything just so. You can’t imagine simply ordering straight from the menu without any substitutions or chef recommendations. Don’t hold back when ordering either. Ask the waiter where the ingredients were flown in from and when. You expect the most natural, organic and freshest at all times. Find out how the fish or steak will be prepared and insist it be to perfection.


If you don’t like something, send it back immediately.
Tell the staff you won’t pay for the meal if you are really feeling feisty. You shouldn’t have to fork over cash for something that was sub-par.
 Like all things in your life, your supermarket is just another extension of your awesomeness. Snobs don’t shop at places like Walmart. They prefer the niche supermarkets where employees are dressed to impressed and the floors sparkle. Only frequent a store where your ever whim can be catered to. This means, if they don’t have your favorite item, they’ll order it and deliver it to your front door. Anything less is unacceptable.

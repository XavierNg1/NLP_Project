 If you are looking to try a professional product on the cast aluminum, you can try a dissolver spray. Dissolver sprays can be found in the cleaning aisle of most hardware stores.Apply the dissolver spray on the item and let it sit for 30 minutes. It should help to loosen any residue or crud on the item. You can then use a non-abrasive pad or a soft-bristled brush on the item.
 If you have access to a self-cleaning oven, you can place the item in the oven and let it run through a shortened cycle for an hour. The high temperatures in the oven can help to reduce any organic residue to a powder that can then be rinsed off once the item is out of the oven.With this option, it is important that you remove any non-aluminum parts on the item as they can be damaged in the oven. Remove any steel or wood parts, such as handles and screws. If you cannot remove any non-aluminum parts on the item without damaging it, this option may not be a good one.
 Dilute in the mild detergent in water so it is not too harsh on the cast aluminum item. You can dip a soft-bristled toothbrush in the solution or a non-abrasive pad and use it to scrub off any residue or dirt on the item.

 No matter what kind of stone it has, you need to make sure it is not loose before you clean the piece. Take your finger or a hairpin (any small pointy object) and try to see if you can wiggle each stone around in its setting. If it does wiggle, then you can stick in thin paper inside it for a while.;
, If there is, DO NOT immerse in water. It will lose its foil.
 If your piece has small, foil-backed stones, you have to carefully wipe the tops of the stones with a damp cloth, being careful that no water seeps onto the mounting.
 Assuming that there are no foil-backs and the stones are all secure, you must still proceed with caution at this stage. Test the smallest end of the piece by immersing it in a solution of 1/2 cup of warm water, 2-3 drops of dishwashing soap, and 2 drops of household ammonia.
 Be careful not to let the water fly onto the rest of the piece.
 Is it shinier? Do the stones look all right? If so, you can immerse the entire piece and use a toothbrush to loosen the grime and rinse the piece under warm water. Repeat as needed and dry.

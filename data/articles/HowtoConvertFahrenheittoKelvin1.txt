 There are two ways that you can convert from Fahrenheit to Kelvin, and the first is a simple calculation that makes the conversion directly. The formula to use for this is K = (y °F + 459.67) x 5/9.For example, if you needed to convert 75 F to Kelvin, the formula would look like K = (75 °F + 459.67) x 5/9;
, On the Fahrenheit scale, absolute zero is -459.67 °F, which is equivalent to 0 K.Because the Kelvin scale does not contain negative numbers, you must first add 459.67 to any Fahrenheit number when you want to make the conversion to Kelvin.


In the example of converting 75 °F, the answer to the first step is 75 °F + 459.67 = 534.67

, Remember that 5/9 can also be written as 0.55, where 5 is a repeating decimal. The answer to that product is your temperature in Kelvin.


In the example of 75 °F, the answer to the second step is 5/9 x 534.67 = 297.0388, where 8 is a repeating decimal
The answer to (75 °F + 459.67) x 5/9 = 297.0388
Therefore 75 °F = 297.0388 K

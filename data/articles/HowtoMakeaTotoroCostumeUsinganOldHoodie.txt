 No matter how well you know how Totoro looks like, it helps to have a reference easily on hand. You can quickly find a picture by searching online and printing it off.;
, Cut out a round oval with a flat base from your white fleece. It should be as wide as your hoodie and be long enough to reach the bottom of your chest.
 Cut out seven of Totoro's signature grey markings using your grey fleece.
 Evenly space out the markings in two rows on the stomach piece. The bottom row should have four markings, and the top should have three. Refer to your picture if you are not sure where they should be placed. Once you are satisfied with the position, either sew or glue the markings in place.
 Center your completed stomach piece on your hoodie and pin so that it won't move. Try it on to see if the stomach piece is placed correctly. If you are satisfied, sew the stomach piece down, making sure you only sew through one side of the hoodie. Otherwise, you might sew your hoodie together by accident.
 Cut out four diamond shaped pieces from the grey fleece, making sure to leave at least .5 in (1 cm) of seam allowance. Sew two pieces together and turn right side out to create one ear. Make sure not to sew the base of the ear, or else you won't be able to turn it right side out to hide the seams. Repeat for the other ear.
 Totoro's ears stick straight up, so place a piece of cardboard inside each ear so they will stand up straight.
 Cut two slits in the top of your hood where you want the ears to be. Place the ears inside of these holes and sew shut.
 Cut out two white circles for Totoro's eyes, and two smaller black circles for his pupils. Cut out a black oval for his nose.
 Sew or glue the face pieces onto the front of your hood, using your picture as a reference.

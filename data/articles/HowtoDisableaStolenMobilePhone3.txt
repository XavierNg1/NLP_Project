 Most Windows Phones should have a remote tracking and disabling service automatically enabled, as long as they were linked to a Microsoft account. Start by visiting windowsphone.com on any computer.

You can try accessing the site from another smartphone or tablet, but there is no mobile website available, so the site may not be easy to use.
 Hover over the words "Explore My Phone" and the image of a smartphone. A small box of menu items should appear. Select "Find my Phone" from these options., Enter your Microsoft account information to log in or click "Can't sign in to your account?" if you've forgotten your password.

Do not try to sign in with a one-use code, as this code will be texted to your stolen phone.
 A map should appear showing the location of your phone, if it is turned on and has location data enabled. Several options should be available if the phone is turned on:Ring causes the device to ring even if the volume is turned off. This is mostly helpful for locating lost phones, not stolen ones.
Lock will protect the phone with a new password.
Erase will permanently wipe all personal data from your phone.

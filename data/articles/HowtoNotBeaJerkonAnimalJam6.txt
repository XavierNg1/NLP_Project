 Being famous may make fans really want to be friends with you. Read Part 4!

, Being famous or rarer than someone doesn't allow you to be mean to others. People won't support you and you will get no friends.
 If you think they are only interested in what you have, imagine situations where you can discover their true interest in you. As for example:


If, after a long time they've buddied you, they try to become close/ask for an item of yours, you should probably not give it to them. Most times, they will unbuddy and block you, and keep your item.Then, you can't say you got scammed, because it was your choice to send the item. Unless you like and believe them/would like to become close friends with them first, you should not give them your rare.
If you are a forgetful person, try to think of a way to remember things. Some people may try to trick you into thinking you've promised them something, mostly items. This is also relevant for other situations apart from Animal Jam!

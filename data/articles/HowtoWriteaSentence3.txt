 A compound sentence is made up of two simple sentences. The two simple sentences are joined by a comma (,) followed by one of seven words called coordinating conjunctions. The seven coordinating conjunctions are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. To help you remember, use the mnemonic FANBOYS. Here are some examples of compound sentences. Note the use of the coordinating conjunction.


He was happy, for he just passed his exam.
The road was long, and we could not see the end.
She was not wrong, nor was she entirely right.
She would have fallen, but Sally helped support her.
Deon is smart, or Deon is lucky.
I am eating steak, yet I really wanted lamb.
Jack was wet, so he changed his clothes.
 Begin by choosing a subject and a verb for the first part of the sentence, the same way you did while writing a simple sentence. Next, choose the appropriate coordinating conjunction based upon the meaning of the sentence. Finally, choose a related subject and verb for the second part of the compound sentence.


You may want to use "and" to express a continuing thought or meaning, or you can use "but" as part of an explanation. There are many possibilities.
 By writing compound sentences, you can greatly expand on the meaning of the sentence when compared to a simple sentence. Be sure to use the second part of the sentence to expand or elaborate upon the thought expressed in the first part.


Be careful not to overuse compound sentences, particularly those that use "and." They do not always indicate a clear relationship and may seem cluttered.

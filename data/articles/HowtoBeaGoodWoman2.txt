 Today, a good woman is someone who strives toward a balance between independence and helping others. It is hard to help others if you do not feel confident in your own abilities.
 A good person is someone who doesn’t spread gossip. You can be a better person by rising above drama and turning the conversation to a more positive subject.


A good woman will also try to stay positive in her life. Even a good woman needs to complain, but constant complaining is a sign of bigger personal issues that should be dealt with before you can think of other people.
 Calm and patient people are often seen as “good” because they may be a constant and positive presence during a crisis. You will be less prone to over-reaction and argument if you can be patient with others and yourself. , A good woman is often seen as strong because she keeps going during emotional and physical trials. You can build emotional resilience by valuing willpower, confidence and courage.
 All of these qualities are seen as desirable and positive in a woman; however, no human being is constantly virtuous. Recognize that just having a few of these qualities makes you a good woman and don’t be too hard on yourself if you falter.

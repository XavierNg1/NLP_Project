 If you don't have a tuner or any reference tones handy, it's still possible to get your guitar into Drop D tuning, provided that it's already well-tuned to standard tuning. For this reason, you'll once again want to begin with your guitar in standard tuning.
 Next, begin to lower the pitch of your sixth string (currently tuned to low E). As you do this, play its seventh fret with along with the fifth string (open). If your guitar was already well-tuned, your sixth string should be tuned to D as soon as the tone of its seventh fret perfectly matches the tone of the open fifth string (which is A).
 You can also tune your sixth string so that it matches the tone of the fourth string (currently tuned to D). However, if you do this, you'll need to keep in mind that your sixth string's tone will be exactly one octave beneath your fourth string's. Some guitarists find it a little more difficult to judge the difference between these two tones than it is to use the fifth string (A) to tune the sixth string.


Note that you don't have to commit to this method or the one above â€” it's perfectly acceptable to use both the fourth and fifth string to get the sixth tuned to D.

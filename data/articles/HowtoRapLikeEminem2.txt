 You may rap lyrics with a manic voice. You can rap fast when you want to impress someone, or you can rap slowly to make people understand what you want to say. You may rap different kinds of rap like: uplifting, funny or depressing songs. You should try to change your tone of voice too. It depends on what kind of songs you are rapping. Eminem uses this method and that's why he is so popular.;

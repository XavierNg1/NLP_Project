 Take off a battery terminal with your 10mm wrench to prevent getting shocked.;
, You’re looking for a black cover at the back of the engine held down by four bolt; it should have three lines going through it from left to right.
 You’re going to want to pop open the wire cover (a big black plastic case with wires going to it behind the ignition coils) with a flat head screwdriver. On you can see the wires you should inspect them for any breaks or cuts.









If you want to completely open the wire case, you may need to remove a bracket holding a power steering line in-place.
 All you need to do is squeeze the locking lever on the connection and wiggle it until it comes off. You’ll need to do third about four times.
 Two of the bolts are just regular ones, and the other two are special ones to be able to secure the cover and the coil. Once the bolts are removed just pull the coils out and put aside.
 You’ll notice that the coil is rather long, that’s because the top of the coil is not at the combustion chamber. So to remove the spark plug, you'll need your 5/8 inch spark plug socket, the ratchet that fits the socket size (probably a 3/8 inch drive ratchet) and your long extension. Put it in the hole and then turn counterclockwise until you can take the plug out.
 If you decide you can keep it, you should clean it up a bit with your steel wool, and check the clearance specification of where the spark is produced. (This can be found either in the owner’s manual or under the hood itself, and if not there then check the internet.)










, If not, bend it into place (the spec may vary by vehicle).
 Basically all you need to do is reverse the steps but you need to torque things dow; the spark plug should be torqued to about 13 foot-pounds. Everything else should just be hand tightened. Then you're done! You've now made your car run even better than before (hopefully).

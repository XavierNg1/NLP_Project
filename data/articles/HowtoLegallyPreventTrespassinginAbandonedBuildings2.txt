 If trespassers are a widespread problem in a neighborhood, asking the police to provide additional patrols might be your best option. The police have the resources and power to deter small time violators like trespassers in ways that passive deterrents cannot.


On the other hand, if trespassing is a problem mostly limited to your property, you probably won’t see many extra patrols coming your way. Police departments have a responsibility to patrol entire communities, and they can’t allow the needs of one person to outweigh the concerns of the community.
 If the police either can’t or won’t deter trespassers from your property, look into paying for private security. While the cost can be prohibitive, depending on what types of assets are located on your property, it might be worth it.


At $14 per hour, a dedicated security guard will cost more than $10,000 per month for 24 hour a day service. Patrols usually cost between 1/3 and ¼ the price of a dedicated guard., A security dog can provide a high level of protection for a low cost over the long term. The keen senses, instincts, and training of a security dog make them a better active protector than anything but a dedicated on-site guard.


However, that is balanced with unpredictability and a high up front cost—a trained security dog can easily cost $5,000 or more.
If you do choose to go this route, it is imperative to prominently post warnings about the guard dog.
In some larger cities, security dogs are available on a rental basis. Make sure any service you use is highly recommended, licensed, and insured.
 Security systems can be a great way to catch individuals in the act of trespassing, but even when notice of the security system is posted, they aren’t as good a deterrent as security patrols or guard dogs. The price of a security system is really going to depend on the size of the property, but packages for basic home monitoring systems average out at about $30.00 per month.

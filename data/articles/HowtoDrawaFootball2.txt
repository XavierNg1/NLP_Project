 The illustration here shows a rounded one, but footballs in real life tend to end in points.
 They should be mirror images of one another, as shown.
 Don't go beyond the lower line, though, or your football will look a bit unusual.
 Don't let it reach the two vertical rectangles!

, They can be as thick or thin as you like, but you probably don’t want to make them larger than the primary line if you’re going for a realistic look.
 Add more details if you want to, such as more lines to give it a weathered look, or even some players tossing it back and forth.
 Footballs mostly come in brown, but you might want to make yours the colors of your favorite team, or some sort of interesting pattern--that part is up to you!

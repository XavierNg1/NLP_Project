 The best way to find great 80s-style clothing is to find authentic clothing from the 80s. Thrift stores can be treasure troves for tacky, outdated styles, so they should be your first stop.
 You may be surprised about what people will keep stored in their attic or basement. Ask any family members or neighbors who were in their teens or early 20s in the 1980s (born in the mid 1960s) if they have any of their old clothes for you to borrow.
 A few iconic 80s items to look for specifically are Membersâ€™ Only jackets, parachute pants,acid washed or dyed jeans, shirts with large logos on them, miniskirts, leg warmers, stretch pants with stirrups, one-piece jumpers, and denim jackets.
 Mixing different materials was very popular in the 80s. Try to find clothing that is leather, denim, velvet, velour, or lace. Put together some visually contrasting materials.


Also look for bright colors and wacky prints.
Ask older people at the thrift store if they think that the items you have chosen seem like they are from the 1980s.

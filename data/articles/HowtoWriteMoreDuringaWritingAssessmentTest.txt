 Overreacting over a test can sometimes put you off. Try to relax and shrug it off before the examination starts.;
, Nothing is worse than not getting what you are told to write about. Don't feel embarrassed or scared to ask a question. People won't laugh.
 It is one of those things that teachers will tell you over and over again. Do it on a spare piece of paper. Don't do it on the day, if you already know what to write about.
 If you know what you're going to write about, the rest will be a lot easier. If you have to write about the future, start by saying something like 'It is <year> and things have changed, a lot. <Say what has changed, is it gotten futuristic and sci-fi? Or has it gone back in time?>'

, Don't overdo it with paragraphs though. Put the // symbol if you think there should be a paragraph where you have forgotten to put one.
 Also put how if you can. Normally put these in the first 2 or 3 paragraphs, but if necessary spread them out.
 Saying things like 'There was a crystal ball on the table' sounds a little boring. Things like 'There was a mysterious, glowing, crystal ball on the beautifully patterned table, covered by a square, dark red, piece of cloth.' makes it more interesting and puts up your grades a little. Don't overdo it though.
 It will make it look like you have written more, and more interesting. Also, instead of just putting 'said <name>'. Put things like shouted, exclaimed, interjected <name>. It will up your scores.
 Put in commas, these things, extra words. Make sure it still makes sense if you take the commas out though. Usually put descriptions or feeling in these.
 If in your story there is a bit like, ASAP, put in As Soon As Possible instead. Or if there is, Don't, They're and That's. Put Do not, They are, or That is instead.

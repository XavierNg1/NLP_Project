 Since disabilities are often misunderstood and stigmatized, it is more likely that you have very less confidence in yourself. Take up a task and excel in it. For example: If you are a student, spend plenty of time studying so you can do your best. You can also go for volunteering for any social cause or any big event. This will make you confident enough to face people and will create a good image of your among everyone!;
, Now you have got some base to start with! Even after this, if no one comes to talk to you, start a chat all by yourself! You can do it just by saying 'hi' or 'can i help you?' or 'What's up?'. Remember, you must be cheerful and confident enough just to speak out these words or use whatever channels of communication are available to you. If you can do that, you will almost certainly get a good response.
 Remember, if you are doing something good, you will be surely noticed! Outcome: You will get a friend and people will realize how good you are!

, This definitely helps disabled people have confidence. If you see someone being good at what they are doing, be the first to point out that! This will make people more eager to listen to you!

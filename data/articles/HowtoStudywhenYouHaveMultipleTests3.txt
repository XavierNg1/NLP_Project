 You might feel as though you've got a lot of information to keep track of, but it is starting to become scrambled. This is a sign that you should step back from studying. To keep your information straight, avoid studying for a different test right before you take another test.


For example, don't study for the British history test that you're worried about right before you take your Western Civilization exam. You might find that you are recalling information for the wrong course and can't remember the information you need.
 It's easy to feel overwhelmed by multiple tests. Remind yourself that once you finish the first exam, you only need to focus on a few more. If your tests are on different days, focus completely on that subject for the day. This will help you give attention to each exam. Once you've finished the exam, you can shift your attention to the next important test.


If your tests are on the same day, try to schedule a little bit of a break. Focus on the first exam, take a break, and then complete your other exam(s).
 If you have two or three tests, you might feel like you can't take a break from studying for something. Treat studying for different subjects as breaks. For example, you could study history for 45 minutes and then switch to studying algebra for 30 minutes. This will shift your mental focus and help you spend your study time more effectively.To give yourself the biggest mental break, you may want to alternate studying for a challenging subject with one that's easier for you.
 If you have 2 or 3 exams or finals scheduled for the same day, talk to one of your professors about arranging an alternate test date. While few instructors may agree to doing this for exams during the semester, your school might have a policy about offering a bye during finals week.To find out your school's policy, check the handbook, ask your advisor, or check with the academic office.

 If your company has an online account feature, it may be easy to set up automatic debit transfers on the website, but if it is not clear to you, a simple phone call will help you figure it out.


You may be able to set up the automatic bill pay over the phone, or they may be able to walk you through an online set up.
 Make sure that you do this for each company that you have to pay a bill too. It may be tedious and time consuming, but it will save you a lot of time later on, and will give you peace of mind.On your list of bills, be sure to make a note of when you set up bill pay for that bill, how you set it up, and who you spoke to on the phone (if anyone).
A week or so before your trip, take an hour or two to double check each account to make sure that the bill pay is set up correctly.
 If you are renting your home, you may be able to pay several months of your rent in advance so that you don’t have to worry about it getting paid on time while you are away. Many landlords are open to this, so get in touch with them.If your landlord doesn’t like this idea, then you might consider giving post-dated checks for your rent to a friend or family member who can then make the payments for you.
Your landlord might also be willing to come check on your apartment every once in a while to make sure that everything is in good running order. You could also ask a friend or neighbor to keep an eye on your home while you are away if you want.
 For the bills you have that remain the same each month, you can talk with them about paying the bill in advance, if you have the cash available to you.If you can afford to pay the bill far in advance, and the company allows it, you will have the peace of mind that the bill is taken care of.

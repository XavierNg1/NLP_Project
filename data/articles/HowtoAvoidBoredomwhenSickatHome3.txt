 Eating something warm can help ward off the chills and make you feel a little better inside. This will also distract you from your illness and help the time pass a little faster. Be sure not to overdo it with a large meal. Try small bites like:


Oatmeal
Chicken broth
Toast
Scrambled eggs
Saltine crackers

, Sit back and relax with a nice cup of herbal tea. This will preoccupy your time and offers many health benefits as well. Stay away from caffeinated teas as this may upset your stomach. Try these types of herbal teas:


Peppermint
Chamomile
Ginger
Rooibos
Rosehip

, When you are feeling sick, it is nice to have a treat to make you a little feel better. A piece of dark chocolate will distract you from your illness. A hot cup of cocoa is another way to pass the time and enjoy the health benefits that chocolate offers such as reduced blood pressure and improved heart health.

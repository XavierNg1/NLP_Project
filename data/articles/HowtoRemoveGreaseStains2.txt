 If you're working with an article of clothing, flip it inside out. Rub it in gently, using generous amounts of detergent. Let it sit for a few minutes.
 If you have a high-pressure washer, great. You can throw it in there and it'll do the job for you. If you don't, you'll have to improvise. You want a large amount of hot water tackling the stain with as much force as possible, literally blasting the stain away.









If you have a large tub and a powerful shower head, consider holding the material underneath it for 10-20 seconds, depending on the size of the stain.
If your faucets lack the adequate pressure, heat up a pan of water and do the job yourself. Place the material on the shower floor or in the bathtub, and rinse it with the high temp water, carefully pouring the heated water on the stain.
 If any grease is left, hopefully it's been brought to the surface and can be lifted out by a gentle pressing. Don't rub it back in! Simply dab at the stain, picking up the top levels of moisture. Blot on both sides.
 Apply the hot water in the same method, pretreat with a stain remover, and throw it in your washing machine.

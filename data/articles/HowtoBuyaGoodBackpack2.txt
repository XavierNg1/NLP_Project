 Many packs offer a hydration pouch system, which is a designated reservoir for water built into the pack. You can easily grab the sleeve when you get thirsty., Many packs designed for long hikes are top-loading. This is good for unloading a campsite. Other activities may require easier access to lunch or cameras. Some will offer side zippers to easily get to the main compartment.
 Multi-sized pockets on the outside and inside of your pack will make it easier to grab a protein bar, or camera to take that rare bird photo. Look for small pockets for your cellphone or GPS.Elasticized side pockets stretch to hold medium sized objects like tent poles or water bottles.
Hip-belt pockets are great for small items you want to get to quickly.
Shovel pockets can be used for larger items like a cover-up or what it was originally intended for - a snow shovel.
 External frames have outside attachments for things like sleeping bags. Find a thick, rain resistant covering for your sleeping bag. If you want extra protection, consider a cover for your entire bag. It will prevent rain from seeping through zippers.
 Some packs have a large pocket at the bottom suited perfectly for a sleeping bag. If you don’t want to put a sleeping bag there, it’s a good spot for jackets, clothes or blankets.
 If you want a removable day-pack for when you get to the campsite, look for multi-unit backpacks. Some of these can detach from the larger pack and be used around your waist for a quick hike up a small peak.

 It's recommended to use ground chuck that is about 85% lean. If you use this kind of hamburger meat, it will turn out perfect - moist and juicy, yet not too greasy.

, It's preferable to create and have hamburger patties that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick composed of 5 to 6 oz of hamburger meat. This seems to make for the perfect size. The diameter of the hamburger patties, if 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, should be a little larger than you prefer as it will shrink when you cook it. If you make it the size you like to eat it cooked, when composing the patty it will be way too small when it is done cooking.
 Not good. We don't want our hamburgers to look like those guys from The Hills Have Eyes, so we're going to make a nice little 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) indentation in the center of the burger. When it expands, it will be level again








, Turn your stove on medium heat. As soon as the oil is glistening, drop your patties in with the indentation side facing up. Something to watch out for here is over crowding the pan. We want to keep our hamburgers spread out evenly so they can cook evenly and not get stuck together.
 Just let them sit until they have reached the quality you desire. Rare, medium rare or well done. Whatever it is, just keep an eye so they don't get over cooked.
 The amount of time it will take to cook your hamburgers on a stove depends on how large you made the patties.









1 inch (2.5 cm) thick patties take about eight to twelve minutes to cook on average. One way to check on how far along your burgers are is to take the pointy end of a knife and cut a small slit, prodding the meat back to see the color of the inside.

 Telephone companies allow transfer of telephone lines from one place to another. What’s going to happen is that they’ll just transfer your existing line to the area where you’re moving to instead of creating a new telephone line. On the other hand, not all landlines can be transferred for these reasons:


The area you want your landline to be transferred is not covered by your telephone company. The telephone company may not have any existing service for the area where you want your phone to be transferred to.
The place you’re moving to is simply far away. Having your service transferred to a different state is just not that ideal.;
, The customer service will inform you if your telephone can be transferred. If it’s possible, you can start to request for a transfer of line. Just state the place where you want to move your existing service to and fill up some documents that may be required by your telephone company.
 This may take a few days or weeks depending where you want your line to be moved to and if there are any available slots in the systems where your service can be squeezed in.


Also, standard fees such as installation and relocation fees may apply depending on your service provider.

 Use strainers to minimize the chance of hair entering the drain. These strainers just fit over the drain and catch hair before it goes down to where you can't get it as easily. You can purchase strainers from a hardware store near you.However, you do need to clean out these strainers regularly to keep your shower draining properly.
 Run hot water down your drain every time you use the shower or bath. This process will allow fresh build-up to be washed away, reducing the chances of prolonged buildup sticking to your pipes., You can also use a baking soda flush once or month or so. Simply start by dumping a cup of baking soda down your drain. Follow that with a cup of boiling water. Doing so can help keep clogs from building up.

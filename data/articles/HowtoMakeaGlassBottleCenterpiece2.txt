 Line the bottom or entire bottle with sparkle by choosing something clear or glistening. Make sure the items can easily fit through the mouth of the bottle.
 For a more rugged appearance, rocks, stones or pebbles provide an authentic country house or farmhouse theme. Choose ones with interesting shapes, textures and colors.
 Before you add your flowering flourish, consider enhancing the bottle with separate petals or greenery.


Consider using silk or artificial flowers/petals/stems instead of real plants if you plan to use the bottle centerpiece for more than one evening.
 Another way to add interest is to drop chunks of lemon, mango or even small pieces of broccoli inside the bottle., Red Hots or any other small hard candies would suffice.


To match a holiday theme, one example would be to drop broken candy canes inside the bottle for a festive touch.
 Donâ€™t forget to add small shell pieces as well.

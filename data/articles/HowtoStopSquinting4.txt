 Be aware of what makes people squint and keep the lights dim until absolutely necessary. Walk your subjects through the lighting process so they have time to adjust by either covering their eyes until ready or keeping them shut until the exact moment you are ready to take their picture.


Provide them until the count of three to keep their eyes covered and then take their picture the second they open them so as to avoid the few moments their eyes’ natural squinting reaction.
 If you are in a studio shoot, tinker with the type of lights in combination with diffusion to help reduce the brightness while still accomplishing the look you are trying to achieve.Make sure to keep lights off until you are ready to test or shoot. Lights can get extremely hot depending on the type and studio.


Using stand-ins can help with any fatigue your subjects may endure when sitting in a bright studio.
 Not only does a flash provide additional light but certain photographic flashes can be set to help the eyes of your subject adjust to different lighting conditions by flashing multiple times.Moreover, flash can also be used in sunny days so as to prevent your subject from squinting.When using flash on a sunny day, ask your subject to sit with the sun behind them and use the flash to brighten up their face. If the sunlight requires a shutter speed faster than the sync speed of your flash, use a smaller aperture, fit an ND filter onto the lens, or use a flashgun’s high speed function. Timers are an effective tool in coordinating photography equipment with your flash. Some flashguns have a remote trigger function that allows you to fire more than one flashgun simultaneously.

 Ingo will try to keep you from getting inside position, but he won't be completely successful at it. When he gives up inside position, press 'A' for a burst of speed and speed past him on the inside track.
 He’ll turn red and scream about Ganondorf. Then, rather unfairly, he'll challenge you to a second race. If you win, you will get Epona.
 Ingo’s going to end up being a lot faster than last time, but there isn’t much you can do about it. Just give it your best and keep trying.


Once you get inside position, don't give it up. It'll take Ingo a lot of effort to pass you on the outside, so just remember to hold position and you should be fine.






Don't over-feed Epona with carrots right away. Although some people can beat Ingo without using very many carrots at all, it's best to use just a few. Don't use too many in the beginning or you won't have any left when you really need them — at the end of the race.
 He says that you can keep the horse, but you can’t leave the ranch. He shuts the gate and laughs like an idiot. Seems like all is lost, right? Wrong!

, Know that Ingo's locked the gate to the inside of the Lon Lon corral, you have two choices.


The hard way: Run straight at Ingo and jump the gate. It will have to be perfect though or else all you will end up doing is running into him.






The easy way: On the left side of the ranch there is a wall. Heading from the entrance towards the wall, run at an angle. It doesn’t have to be perfect, Epona can jump over it either way.
 Now you can enjoy all of the benefits that comes with having a horse. Mostly that includes being able to cross the world in about thirty seconds, rather than the three minutes it would take without her.


Epona isn’t an essential part of the game. You really don’t “need” her for anything, but she is really a big help, so try to get her if you can.

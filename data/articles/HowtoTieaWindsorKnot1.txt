 Observe what you're doing in the mirror to help you see what is happening as you tie the knot. You won't need the mirror once you've got the hang of the tying but initially it helps with getting the tie length correct, etc. Check that your shirt is buttoned to the top and stand the collar up before proceeding.






;
, One end of the tie should be considerably wider than the other (the general rule is that the wide end hangs twice as low as the narrow end). Place the wider end on the right, and about a foot (30cm) lower than the narrower side on the left.









If you are left handed, it's recommended that you switch the sides of the wide and narrow ends, as it is easiest for the dominant hand to work with the longest end. If so, reverse the instructions as you go!

, Create somewhat of an uneven "X", with the thinner side located on the bottom and the wider side on top.
 The top "V" from the "X" you created in the previous step and the collar of your shirt should make a loop. Cross the wide end of your tie under the thin end and through the loop.









Bring the wide end back down to where it was before you looped it through the upper "V".
,,, Take the wider end that you just pulled through the loop and put it through the loose knot.









Pull all the way through.
 Turn down the collar, making sure to do so neatly at the back where you can't see. Make any adjustments to ensure that the knot sits squarely in the middle of the collar and check that the tie reaches down to the waistband. Done.

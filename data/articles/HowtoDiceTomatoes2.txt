 Wash each Roma tomato under the faucet, turning it as necessary to wash the full surface and remove dirt and debris. If the Roma tomato has any stickers on it, make sure to remove these prior to dicing., Near the top of a Roma tomato, there is a small stem. Cut off the end of the tomato with the stem so you're left with one flat end.




Some people don't bother cutting off the stem, as it's so small it's largely unnoticeable. If you don't mind the tomato stem, you can skip this step.
 Cut the tomato length-wise to cut it in half. Cut it with one hand and hold it in place with the other. Try to keep the two halves of the tomato in roughly even sizes.
 Turn the two halves of your tomato sideways so you're cutting them length-wise. Make vertical cuts to cut the tomato into thin strips of roughly even sizes.




As Roma tomatoes are smaller than regular tomatoes, be careful when using your fingers to hold the tomato in place. Use only the tips of your fingers and be extra careful to keep your fingers away from the knife.
 Turn your strips sideways and make a series of cuts running across the strips length-wise. This should cut your Roma tomatoes into small cubes. When you're finished, you'll be left with a pile of diced Roma tomatoes.




Strive to keep your cuts the same length so your diced tomatoes are roughly the same size.

 Some people train proactively, getting their dog involved in training before a problem emerges. Others want to teach their dog advanced tricks. And there are plenty of us who first look to training when our dog starts having behavior issues.;
, Do you want a dog that knows basic obedience? Agility? To fix one specific problem? Your training selection should be based in part on your goals. Make sure that the training program can both solve your problem and leave you feeling satisfied.
 Do you want someone who emphasizes positive training? Someone with experience? Someone who specializes in aggression? Pick the personality of the trainer that you'd like and make sure to not sign up with anyone who makes you uncomfortable.
 Is he stubborn? Easy to frighten? Knowing his temperament can help you pick out the right person.
 There's no one he likes better, plus the process will not only improve your bond but it will also improve your status as the dog's leader.
 See how the trainer interacts with the students and their dogs. Make sure it's the kind of interaction you like.
 Make sure you have the training equipment you need. Stick to the plan.

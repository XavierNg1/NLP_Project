 Find the control panel that runs to the filter, and turn the valve until you hear the water going off.Generally, it's under a green panel in your yard.
 On the filter itself, you'll find a valve that you can turn to release the pressure. As you turn it, be aware that it will blow air and water out of the filter, so be careful.If it doesn't have a valve, just unscrew it slowly.
 Unscrew the filter housing from the pipes. It may be tight, but you just need to apply a little pressure. A large wrench can help you get it unscrewed because it will help you grip the filter better. Pull the filter out of the housing., Most filters are either a disc type or a mesh type. If it's a disc type, you'll need to unscrew the ends so you have enough space to get in between the discs a bit. Using a hose or a bucket of water, get the filter wet. Use a stiff nylon brush to scrub down the filter, adding water as needed to clean off the gunk. You can scrub inside and out., Before putting the filter back in, turn the water back on so you push out anything that might be in the pipe. After a few seconds, turn it back off. Screw the filter back into its housing., Shut off the pressure valve. Turn the water back on slowly, letting it run into the valve and the whole system. If you turn it on too fast, the water will push the air in the system ahead of itself, which can cause problems.

 Jar lids are slippery, and it can be difficult to get a good grip on them using your hands alone. Gripping the lid with something aside from your fingers can make it can make it much easier to successfully open a finicky jar. Grab one of the these items to help you get a grip:


A rubber jar opener
A rubber glove
A silicon pad
Grippy shelf liners
A wide rubber band;
, Place your palm on the top of the lid and apply pressure. Grasp the edges of the jar with your fingers. Use your other hand to hold the jar steady.
 Most jar lids open by twisting to the left (counterclockwise). Keep a firm grip on the jar to avoid spilling its contents. Alternatively, you can grip the lid firmly and apply force on the jar instead of the lid. If you're still having trouble opening the jar, move on to a method that breaks the seal.

 Choose someone that you’re close to that has a similar sense of humor, such as a parent, a teacher, a sibling, or a close friend. Avoid pranking someone that you don’t know very well. They may misunderstand your prank and think that you’re picking on them. Other people to avoid include:


A parent that’s stressed out and distracted
The new kid at your school
Someone that you don’t usually get along with;
, Find a pen and a piece of paper. Choose a comfortable, distraction-free place to sit and think.Next, write down any idea that comes into your head. Don’t worry about whether the idea is good or bad. Instead, focus on writing down as many ideas as possible.
 Your prank shouldn’t hurt anyone’s feelings or put anyone in danger.If so, it’s no longer a “harmless” prank. Some examples of dangerous or hurtful situations include:


Ruining a possession that matters a lot to someone
Involving sharp objects or fire in your prank
Making someone angry by scaring them
Putting them at risk for suffocation or hyperventilation by trapping them

, The best prank will be funny, harmless, and realistic to execute. Additionally, the joke should be big enough to be surprising, but not so big that they become suspicious.Choose ideas that:


Prank the person in their comfort zone, so that they’re not suspecting anything
Don’t require too much setup
Will be funny to you and to the person you prank

, Now that you’ve invented the perfect prank, make a plan. Carefully outline the plan on a piece of paper. Reread your plan several times, visualizing it as you read. This will help you spot any fatal flaws in your plan. For example:


If your plan involves a lot of balloons, make sure you have time to buy balloons.
If your friend isn’t feeling well, they may call in sick to work or school and miss your prank.
If your prank involves water and it’s cold outside, the water may freeze.

 After trapping the dragon named Odahviing in “The Fallen” mission, talk to him and he will fly you off to the Skuldafn temple where the portal to the Nordic afterlife can be found. Once you’re in the area, go through the portal to enter Sovngarde.;
, Once you get to Sovngarde, walk a little along the path to find a man standing between two large dragon bones. This is Tsun, the Nordic god of trials and the one guarding the entrance to the Hall of Valor.
 Talk to Tsun and he will ask you by what right are you asking for admittance to the hall. Select “By right of birth” from the list of options prompted on the screen, and he will respond that even though you are the Dragonborn, you still need to prove your worth by defeating him in a fight.
 The Nordic god inflicts terrible damage with his axe, making him difficult to defeat in a fair fight. In order to kill him easily, right after selecting your answer, go behind Tsun and wait for him to finish talking.


Once he draws his axe, quickly attack him from behind to perform a quick kill attack and instantly defeat Tsun.
 Tsun might not cross the stream and when the lightening hits him several times then he will grant you entrance.
 Once you’ve defeated Tsun, he will congratulate you in proving your worth. Walk up the path that goes beyond where Tsun is standing to enter the Hall of Valor.

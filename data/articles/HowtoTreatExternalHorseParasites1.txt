 A horse that has external parasites likely is irritated by them. In order to relieve any itching or pain, your horse will rub, bite, or scratch any areas that it can get to.Rubbing and biting areas of discomfort can lead to areas of hair loss, as well as open sores. If your horse has these issues, then there may be an underlying parasitic infection causing it.;
, Some parasites move from the outside of your horse into its inside, affecting your horses digestion and nutritional intake. For example, bots begin as eggs on the outside of a horse's body but develop inside the horse once the horse ingests them.Bots in the stomach will affect a horse's digestion, causing both diarrhea and loss of weight.
 Horses that have parasitic infections may have different personalities or behaviors than they usually do. These changes are caused by the discomfort or pain that is associated with the infection.If your normally calm horse becomes aggressive or scared all of a sudden it could be the sign it has a parasitic infection. However, it could be a sign of another illness, so have your horse checked out by a veterinarian if this occurs.
 Your horse may have a newly sensitive area that it does not want you to get close to. This area may just be tender due to itching, so the horse is protecting it, or it may be opened and infected.Tender areas may have been rubbed raw by the horse or they may be areas that the horse can't access but the parasites are breeding in.

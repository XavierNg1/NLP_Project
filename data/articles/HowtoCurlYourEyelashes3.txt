 Turn your sink’s tap on as hot as it will go, and run a toothbrush under the water to warm the bristles. Shake off the excess water, and dry the brush by pressing it into a clean towel.








Make sure that you’re using a clean, unused toothbrush to curl your lashes.
 When the toothbrush is warmed, gently brush it through your lashes. When you reach the end of your lashes, hold the brush back against your eyelid to curl the lashes.








Hold the brush back against your eyelid for at least 10 seconds to ensure that your lashes curl.
If your lashes don’t curl as much as you’d like, rewarm the toothbrush and repeat the process until you’re satisfied.
 Once your lashes are curled, it helps to coat them with mascara so the curl holds. Use a waterproof lengthening mascara, and apply it in two to three thin coats for the most natural, flattering look.

 Also begin to research a little bit about general spirits and demons. Know more about the paranormal in general.;
, Ask around town for areas that locals claim to be "haunted". Some friends in your own community may have had experiences.
 This may not apply to all situations, especially if you've already got permission (if it's a friend), but it's better to be safe than sorry. Be polite and professional (you don't want to come off as being crazy!)

, You can research as much as you like, but keep in mind that most disturbances originate from the location's history.
 What do you think the problem could be? Brainstorm with a couple of knowledgeable folks, whether in person or online. Use the case information to guide your search.
 Never investigate on your own. Spirits like to target those who seem vulnerable and weak.
 A check-list is located below.
 If there are particular locations where paranormal events seem to occur, leave a video camera (if you have one) recording in the location, or leave a couple of team members.
 Most groups will be glad to help, and will probably have more information to add about what could be causing it.

 Before you panic, try the methods listed for unclogging your outer or middle ear. Odds are, the problem isn't serious.
 If you can't clear up the issue on your own, and you feel like your hearing is diminished or fuzzy, contact a doctor. You might be suffering an inner ear problem that won't respond to home remedies and requires medical help.

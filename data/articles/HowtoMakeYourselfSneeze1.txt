, Capsicum is naturally derived from hot peppers, and is used in both medication and pepper spray. You can purchase a bottle of some capsicum extract or look for a product that contains it already. Donâ€™t apply the extract to the inside of your nose because it will burn. Instead, dab a cotton swab against the top of a capsicum extract bottle and hold the cotton swab in front of your nose. Inhale the scent of the capsicum through your nose.If you do not have capsicum extract, then you can also cut open a hot pepper, such as a jalapeno or chili, and dab the inside of it with a cotton swab. Then, inhale the scent of the capsicum through your nose.
 Sniffing a carbonated beverage, especially from a soda fountain, may be all the stimulation your nose needs to let loose a sneeze. Simply drinking a carbonated beverage may work, but you can also hold the cup right under your nose and inhale through your nose.This should cause you to sneeze.


Make sure that the soda is really fizzy. If it is flat, then there might not be enough bubbles to bring on a sneeze.

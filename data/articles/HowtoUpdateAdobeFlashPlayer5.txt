 If you run Adobe Flash on a Linux machine, you likely use a Mozilla plug-in for Flash. Check whether or not this plug-in needs an update by going to: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck/


Even though this plug-in was originally created for use with Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and other Internet browsers use this plug-in, as well. Therefore, even if you do not use Firefox as your browser, you can still check on the status of this plug-in using the same URL.
Scroll down to the plug-in labeled as "Shockwave Flash." If you need to update this plug-in, the status will be listed as "Outdated Version" and a yellow "Update" button will appear beside it.
 All you need to do is to click on the yellow "Update" button to begin the update. Follow any on-screen instructions to complete the installation.


This process should remove the installed plug-in if it is insecure and replace it with a safer, updated version that is downloaded from the Adobe website.
If asked whether or not you want any extra toolbars, un-check any of these extra features to prevent a delay in download time.
When asked if you agree to any terms or conditions, read those conditions and click on the "Agree and install now" option.
 After you get a message stating that your Flash player has updated, close your Internet browser completely. Open it back up again for the Flash player update to take effect.


The update may not take effect if you do not restart your browser.
To verify that the update worked correctly, revisit the plug-in check page. The button that previously read “Update” should be grayed out and the status should indicate that no further updates are needed.

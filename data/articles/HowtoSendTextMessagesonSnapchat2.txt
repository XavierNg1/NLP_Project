 You can send a direct text message to a Snapchat user from one of their stories. After they read the message, it will disappear.If a Snapchat user limits how they can be contacted in their Snapchat preferences, you won’t see the option to send them a chat in their story.
 The Stories page will appear. Stories that were updated most recently appear at the top of the “Recent Updates” list.
 As you view stories, look for a link at the bottom that says “Chat.” If you see that link, this means you’ll be able to send a text message from the story.
 Your phone’s keyboard will expand and you’ll see the text “Send a chat.”

, The text will disappear after this person reads it—keep that in mind as you compose your message.



If you want to view the message you just sent, swipe right until you reach the “Chat” screen, then swipe right on their name. The chat will appear.
If you want to save the message to your Memories (so you can read it later), tap and hold the message until you see the word “Saved” appear to its left. The recipient can do the same.
To view your Memories, swipe up on the camera screen.

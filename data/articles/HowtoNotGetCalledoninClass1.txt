 You want to try to sit in the teacher’s blind spot so they hopefully don’t notice you. Where you sit depends on the style of your classroom and your teacher. Try to sit in the edge of the classroom, out of the teacher’s main focus of vision. You can sit in the back to hopefully hide or the very front so the teacher possibly completely looks past you and forgets you are there.You can try to sit next to someone who answers a lot of questions to hopefully blend in next to them.;
, While the teacher is teaching, look toward them. Don’t look out the window, fidget, doodle, or text. At least look like you are paying attention to what they are saying. The teacher might find it disrespectful and think you are not paying attention if you seem distracted., When your teacher is scanning the room trying to decide who to call on, do not make direct eye contact with the teacher. However, don’t clearly avoid eye contact and definitely don’t look down. Look away for a second then look back at the teacher then look away again. Try to find a good balance between completely avoiding looking at your teacher and looking at them too much., Even if you aren’t confident and have no idea what the answer to the question is, pretend you do. Sit up straight and don’t look worried or nervous. Don’t look eager to answer the question, but don’t look like you clearly were not paying attention either. The teacher will likely call on someone who either seems overly confident or nervous.

 This popular download is very easy to install, but it asks you regularly to upgrade to a paid option. If you are easily annoyed by pop-ups, it is not the best option available for you.
 It is available for computers running Windows XP, Vista and 7.


Go to windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download to download it. If you are loyal to Microsoft products, then this will work. The disadvantages are that it is known to be slow and you need a Windows product key.

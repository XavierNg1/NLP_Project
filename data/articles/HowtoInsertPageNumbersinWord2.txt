 If you want a specific font on your page number, simply double click it. It should be highlighted in blue, like any other text you would highlight on Word. From there, simply adjust the font, color, and size normally. It will carry automatically through the entire document.
 If you want to start a page later in the document at "1," you'll need to break the page up. First, place your cursor at the beginning of the page you want to restart. Then:


Click "Page Layout" â†’ "Breaks" from the top bar.
Select "Next Page" under "Breaks."
Double click on the current page number.
Click on "Page Number," then "Format Page Numbers."
Select the bubble labeled "Start At," then select "1" to restart the page count at one., To do so, double-click again on your header or footer to bring up the correct menu. Then find the box labeled "Different First Page" and check it. Now, you can freely click on the first page number and delete it, keeping the rest of your numbers intact.


Many times, just clicking on the "Different First Page" button automatically erases the first page number.
Most presentations and papers don't need a first page number -- it's the first one, so of course it is "1."

, If you want to go the extra mile, double-click on the header or footer once again. Click "Page Numbers," then click "Format Page Numbers" under the menu that appears. From here, you can set different types of numbers, like Roman numerals or letters, as well as customize the basic appearance of numbers. It is not incredibly robust, but it works.
 The escape key will get you back to writing like normal, and you page numbers will format for you. You can now feel free to write away!

 Refrain from using obscenities on the global chat. Watch your language or other players may report you. Supercell will then review the report and ban you from the chat box.


Getting blocked though doesn’t entirely affect your gaming. You can still play the game normally, but you have to wait 24 hours before you’re allowed to post messages on the global chat.;
, This includes profanity, inappropriate messages, etc.
 Arranging your walls or decorations to look like something vulgar is also against the policies of the game. Other players may take a screenshot of your Clash of Clan village and send it to Supercell to be reviewed. If found to be offensive, you’ll be blocked from accessing your game account.
 Mobile emulators for PCs, like Genymotion or BlueStacks, are great tools for developing mobile-based applications on your desktop or laptop computer. But playing your Clash of Clans account on these applications will have your locked out by Supercell if their system detects your account being constantly logged in on a non-mobile device.
 If you’re a leader or a co-leader of a clan, avoid putting indecent descriptions of your group that other players will find offensive. If you do, your account will be permanently banned from the game (but your clan members won’t be). Write a friendly statement that clearly describes your clan and its members.
 Though it is tempting if you find it difficult to gain resources, but do not cheat by using hack tools and softwares. Also do not use automated bots to play the game for you; physically play the game instead.

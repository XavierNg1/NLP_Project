 If you feel hard done by but don't react to something, you are at risk of building up passive-aggressive responses to situations that bug you. For example, muttering under your breath "Damn these people, they are so rude. This is so unfair since I was here before them all!" doesn't change anything except your own blood pressure and creates a sense of victimization.;
, Servers are busy, rushed, and frequently stressed when there are many people behind the counter. In most cases, they are not standing there assessing who is in line when but they are busy getting on with serving, expecting their customers to be proactive in moving along the line to the front to get served in an orderly fashion. Again, if you think the servers are doing this on purpose, you're falling into a passive-aggressive trapped way of thinking.
 So now it's time to take action and restore your rightful place in that queue! When it is your turn, and that person presses past you to get served next, speak up. With a big smile on your face and in your voice, say "I believe it's my turn next." Avoid excusing yourself - you are stating a clear fact. Most people will demur and apologize. And if this person does not, it is no reflection on you but you will have instant rapport with the server and next service is definitely yours! See grumpy queue-pushers for what they are; grumpy, selfish and thoughtless. They are not in your sphere of control and it is not an issue of fairness; keep your sense of humor with you, not your sense of false injustices.

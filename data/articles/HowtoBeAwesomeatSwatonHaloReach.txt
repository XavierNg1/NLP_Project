 Overall it's a better weapon to use.;
, One shot to the head will end your enemy and save ammunition.
 It's easier to get a headshot if the gun is all ready at head level. When you are standing on level ground look at a teammate and put the crosshairs over their head. So when an enemy walks in a room, you only need to look right or left to kill them instead of split second adjusting. Some people put a dot on clear plastic and place it at the center of their TV.
 Doing this will help you hear footsteps, deep breathing and gunshots, which will tell you if an enemy is nearby.
 Many people have a lot of time to play Halo and rank up, but that doesn't mean they are all that good. They have only played longer than you have.

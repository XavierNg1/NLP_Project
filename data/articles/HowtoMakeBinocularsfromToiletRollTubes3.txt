 Gently press this against the edge of the other tube. Align both tubes together precisely; they are now forming the body of the binoculars.


Place a rubber band around both of the tubes to keep in place while they dry together.
 Run a line of glue along each flattened edge of the cork. Then insert the cork in the valley join of the two toilet roll tubes, at the end opposite to the cellophane lenses. Let dry.
 Cut the string/cord or other material long enough to go around the neck and hang freely. To attach:


Poke two holes through the side ends of the back of the binoculars.






Thread through one end of the string or cord and tie a knot to keep it intact. Do the same for the other side, completing the loop.
 It's now time to send your little explorer outside to go and spot wild animals or spy on the insect world!

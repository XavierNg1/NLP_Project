 Look for Japanese books, comic books, or newspapers. When you try to read in Japanese, you expose yourself to new words while strengthening your skills and encountering Japanese culture., Another fun way to expose yourself to Japanese is to watch Japanese movies. Movies can expose you to a wider range of terms (including slang) and provide some entertainment. You can even use English subtitles to help you understand the plot., Just like movies, listening to Japanese radio can be a good way to hear new words and sharpen your listening skills. Look for Japanese music with lyrics, or Japanese talk radio., If you have the opportunity to experience an immersion in the Japanese language, take it! Perhaps you can visit Japan, or even an authentic Japanese restaurant. This will enable you to speak to people in Japanese and watch them speak. There is really no better way to learn a new language.

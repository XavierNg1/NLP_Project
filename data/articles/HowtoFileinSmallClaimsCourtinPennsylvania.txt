The judge may announce her ruling in the courtroom immediately after you and the defendant have finished presenting your cases, or she may want to review the evidence and information filed and make a decision later. If she doesn't make it until later, you'll be informed of her decision within five days., If the judge ruled in your favor and the defendant did not appeal the judge's decision, you may collect the money you're owed.


The MDJ may set up a payment plan lasting up to 12 months for the defendant to pay.
After the ruling, the defendant has 30 days to appeal. If that 30 days passes and the defendant has not appealed, you may ask the MDJ to issue an Order of Execution. This permits the sheriff or constable to place a lien on any property the defendant owes to satisfy the debt.

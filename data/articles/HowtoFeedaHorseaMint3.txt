 Mint has anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties that will keep your horse healthy. The best way you can provide a steady supply of mint for your horse is to grow your own small herb garden.Plant mint seeds in a soil with pH of six or seven. Seeds should be placed 18 to 24 inches apart and planted in spring. Keep the soil moist and water as needed.


If you grow mint in a small garden that your horse can access, you won’t even have to feed it to your horse, and it can eat as much as it wants.
 You could also feed your horse mint along with another herb in order to make the other herb more palatable.


For example, if your horse needs to eat milk thistle but does not like the taste, you could feed it five or six leaves of mint along with the milk thistle. The next day, feed four or five leaves of mint along with the milk thistle. Gradually reduce the amount of mint leaves you give the horse and it will then be able to eat the milk thistle without the added mint.
 If you want to wean a horse off of its mother’s milk, feed the mare mint for about week. This will end milk production and help the weaning process along., Fill the bottle with water and let it sit overnight. Mint leaves have anti-itch and cooling properties. Spray the mint infusion on the horse’s legs, flank, and back to cool it down and keep bugs at bay during the hot summer months.


You could use dried or fresh mint for this infusion.

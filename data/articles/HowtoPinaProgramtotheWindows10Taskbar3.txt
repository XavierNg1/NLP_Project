 You can click/tap the File Explorer icon pinned to the Taskbar. You can also click/tap the Start button to open the “Start” menu, and then click/tap “File Explorer” in the left pane.
 Click/tap the C: drive to expand the directory tree of the C: drive. Then locate and click/tap the “Program Files” folder to see the list of programs or program folders.
 This will cause a context menu to pop up beside the program/app name .
 The list of options in the context menu is rather long, so look for the option “Pin to taskbar” and tap it. Doing so will pin the program/app to the Taskbar.

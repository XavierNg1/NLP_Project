 There are two basic factors to consider when purchasing an SD card for digital photography: capacity and speed. You will also need to be aware of the differences between the three main types of SD cards: SD (Secure Digital), SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity), and SDXC (Secure Digital Extended Capacity).


Standard SD cards can store up to 2 GB of data. SDHC cards can store up to 32 GB, but must be used in compatible devices. SDXC cards can store even more data, but like SDHC require a device that supports the format.
If you are serious about digital photography, you will want to pay close attention to the different speeds available for SD cards. DSLRs can capture a lot of data at once, and being able to write quickly to the SD card will help improve the shots you take. Amateur photographers can usually get away with using a Class 2 or 4 SD card, while professional photographers (especially sports photographers) will want a Class 6 or 10 card., Make sure that your device supports the type of SD card you are using. For example, if you are using an SDXC card, the camera will need to support that format.
 Usually you should be able to simply start using the SD card as soon as you insert it, but you may need to format it if you've been using it for other tasks. Formatting will erase all of the data on the SD card.


Note: If you insert an SDXC card into a camera that doesn't support it, you will be prompted to format. DO NOT do this, as the card will lose its expanded storage capability and will likely not work with any SDXC devices in the future.

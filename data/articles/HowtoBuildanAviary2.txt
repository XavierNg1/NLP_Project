If you use concrete as recommended, lay 12 inches (30.5 cm) for the foundation. You can add a layer of sand, gravel or pine to the concrete to sweep up with waste during cleaning.
You may also want to "plant" non-toxic foliage in the concrete while it's setting or at least leave enough space.
 Stone, metal, plastic or brick piping work, as well as treated lumber.



Parameters and wire spacing are dependent on the size of birds you want to house in the aviary.
You'll want to make sure the wire is heavy enough that your bird can't break it, usually 10-gauge or heavier.
 Whether you make the entrance or purchase a ready-made door, make sure it is a double-door to prevent escape.



At least one-third of the aviary should be enclosed. Fasten material--plastic, Plexiglas, cloth or hardwood--to two or three sides of the aviary and the roof.
You can also add insulation and a heater.


Add another layer of wiring or mesh to prevent predators from getting too close to your bird. A 1/2-inch-by-1/2-inch wire will thwart opossums, rats and cats. Even smaller wire can prevent snakes and mice from accessing the aviary.






If you set the aviary on the ground, you'll also want to make sure that other animals cannot dig to get inside. Digging 6 inches (15.2 cm) down and around the perimeter can help.
 Make sure perches are far enough from the edge of the aviary that it won't invite predators.

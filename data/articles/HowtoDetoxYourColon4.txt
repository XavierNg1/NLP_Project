 Colon therapists perform colonics, or colon irrigation procedures, at their offices each day. Colonics can be somewhat uncomfortable, but they can be very effective in detoxifying the colon. Make sure you go to a colon therapist who is trained in practicing safe and sanitary procedures.
 If you are having colon issues, ask your doctor about a colonic and what to expect. During a colonic the colon therapist gently inserts a tube in your rectum. The tube is attached to a pump that forces water or some other liquid into your large intestine. After your colon is saturated, the therapist removes the first tube and carefully inserts a new tube. The therapist will massage your abdomen to expel the water and waste from your colon.


The therapist may repeat the process to fully cleanse the bowels. Up to 16 gallons of water can be pumped and expelled during this procedure.
Subsequent procedures may involve water treated with probiotics, herbs, or coffee, which help extract things from your colon., The longer that stool stays in your colon, the more time your body has to re-absorb toxins. Many of the changes listed above should help you to have a daily bowel movement if this is not happening for you currently.


If you have improved your diet and tried other options to help and are still not going once a day, it is a good idea for you to visit your doctor for further evaluation and advice.
If you are having more than 2 bowel movements per day or your bowel movements are loose, consider consulting with a doctor before proceeding.

 Scallops cook fast, and taste best the moment they are done cooking. If you cook them first, then prepare the rest of your meal, the scallops may turn tough and chewy by the time you serve them.
 They are a tough patch on the side of the scallop, with the tissues running horizontally instead of vertically. If your scallops have this, simply pull them off with your thumb and forefinger.


The side-muscles are safe to eat, but they are very chewy.
 Place the scallops into a strainer or colander, and rinse them. Shake the water off, then gently pat them dry. If you don't dry the scallops, they will be too moist, and not fry properly.
 The pan is ready when the oil begins to smoke.
 Try to spread them around so that they lay across the pan in a single layer. Don't stir the scallops during these 30 seconds.
 Stir the scallops around until you can smell the garlic, then let them sit for another 30 seconds.
 Give the scallops a stir to mix in the wine and lemon juice, then let them come to a boil. Let the scallops cook like this for 30 seconds.


If you'd like to serve this as a pasta sauce, add 1Â½ cup (360 milliliters) of heavy cream along with the wine and lemon juice., Make sure the butter is cold and hard, and cut it into cubes. You'll need rely on the butter/s melting time for the next step., Give the dish a stir to help everything mix in.
 The longer they sit, the less fresh they will taste.

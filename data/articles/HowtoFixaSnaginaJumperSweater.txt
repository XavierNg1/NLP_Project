 A thread that has snagged will have pulled the material around it out of shape, so you'll need to gently stretch the jumper back into shape. Some of the yarn should retract into the sweater as you do this.;
,


If there is a loose thread left over, turn the jumper inside out and pull the thread back through to the reverse side, then try to smooth the snag out again.
Use a blunt needle to pull the thread through to the next stitch.
Keep pulling to the next part, dispersing the excess thread along the row.
Repeat this on the other side of the snag, carefully removing excess thread in the other direction.
 When you have gone all the way along both sides of the pulled thread, go over the row again, arranging the thread back into position.
 Turn it the right way and keep smoothing until you are satisfied with the how your jumper looks.

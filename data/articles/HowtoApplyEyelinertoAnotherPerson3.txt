 You will need to decide if you would like to use a felt tip pen, a sponge tip, or a long brush.


The felt tip pen is easiest to use for beginners, due to the lack of mess and the familiar format of using a pen.The sponge tip is great for intermediate users, due to the sturdiness of tip, yet similarity to the pen.
The long brush is best for those who are more advanced at applying makeup. It can be difficult to control the bristles but this is the best way to achieve fine lines., This can be done by spraying isopropyl alcohol onto the tip of the liquid eyeliner. Wait fifteen seconds or so for the alcohol to evaporate before applying to the client.
 Ask the client to close their eyes. Place your thumb on the clientâ€™s cheekbone and your pointer finger above the eyebrow. Gently stretch the skin so that it is not wrinkled or creased on the eyelid. Carefully draw a line, moving from the inner corner of the eye outward. This can be done in a single motion. You can also choose to stop and restart from where you left off, as long as you end up with an even, continuous line.


If done correctly, you should not need to re-apply liquid liner. It is not necessary to layer liquid liner to achieve a darker shade.
You may need to go back and fix mistakes where the line does not look even. You can compensate by filling in the line to make the eyeliner even, with no jagged parts.
 Concealer and a concealer brush will allow you to fix mistakes you may have made while drawing the line. Use the concealer to cover the parts that you would like to erase. This may require you to use a few layers of concealer to completely conceal the eyeliner, depending on how dark the color of the eyeliner is.


Be sure to blend the concealer into the rest of the makeup to prevent it from looking sloppy and the concealer from looking apparent to others.

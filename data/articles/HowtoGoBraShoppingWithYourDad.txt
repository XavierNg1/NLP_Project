 Really. Most women wear them, and most dads know that (though some are surprised to find out their little girls are growing up). There's no reason to be embarrassed, ashamed, or bothered by having to shop with your dad, any more than you would be shopping for socks. If you're still embarrassed, though, keep reading.;
, You needed some new socks anyway, right? Those will get you into the right vicinity, and they'll give you an easy, non-embarrassing reason to go that way.
 Don't just sit there in the car with the dreaded, awkward silence. Turn on the radio to a station that you and your dad both like and listen to. Start up a conversation about a common interest. Talk about something else instead of sitting there dreading the trip.
 This is the easiest way to go about your business. Suggest that he goes to a store or different department that he likes while you shop. Many dads will agree because they have no desire to wander around in the underwear section with their teenage daughters, anyway.
, Instead of going to the bras with frilly lace and pink and black sexy details, go for that plain white t-shirt or sports bra. They are usually more comfortable, cost less, and they are usually placed towards the front of stores that sell lingerie. It's much less awkward to buy a simple bra with a nice price in front of your dad than the sexy thong and padded push-up set. You'd buy a t-shirt in front of him, and this is practically a t-shirt, anyway.
 The awkward part is now behind you, so relax.

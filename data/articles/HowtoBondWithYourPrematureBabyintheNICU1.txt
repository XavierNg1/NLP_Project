 Some premature babies will just need more time for their lungs to mature, while others may suffer from more serious complications. The more that you know and understand about what your baby needs, the better you will be able to ensure he is receiving the treatment and care that is best for him.


Speak with neonatal nurses and technicians every time they make their rounds. Inquire about improvements or setbacks in your baby’s conditions. If you do not understand something, don’t be afraid to ask.
Find out when the NICU head doctor will be stopping by. Generally, head doctors stop by once or twice each day to check in on their patients. Sometimes, if you have a specific question about your baby’s condition or his treatments, the nursing staff may not have the answer for you. If you know when the head doctor will be making his rounds, you can make sure you are there during those times and you can ask to speak with him directly.;
, Depending on how premature you baby was, he can be in the NICU anywhere form a few days to several months. The NICU staff will be your baby’s full-time caregivers until he is released. Take the time to familiarize yourself with each staff member that will be caring for your baby. If you are comfortable with his caregivers, you will be more at ease knowing that he is in good hands during those times when you cannot be there.

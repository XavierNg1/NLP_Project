 Make sure to only place one value in each cell.

For example, if you need to find the harmonic mean of 10, 12, 16, and 8, you might type each of these values into a separate cell in the spreadsheet, cells A1-A4.
 The function is HARMEAN(number 1, ...).To select the function, begin typing “=HARMEAN” into a blank cell of the spreadsheet, then double-click on the function when it pops up.

For example, type “=HARMEAN” into cell A5 of your spreadsheet and double-click on the function.
 Hit the enter key. Excel will calculate the harmonic mean for you and display it in the spreadsheet.

For example, highlight cells A1-A4 of your spreadsheet and hit enter. Excel will calculate 10.78652 as the harmonic mean.

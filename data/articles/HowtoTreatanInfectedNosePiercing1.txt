 If you have just had your nose pierced, it's totally normal to have redness and some pain around the site of the piercing. However, look out for any of these symptoms:


Red, inflamed streaks or marks on the skin that radiate out from the piercing site.
Increased pain, redness, swelling, heat, or tenderness around the piercing site.
Yellow-green pus-like discharge coming from the piercing site. It's normal to see a bit of oozing or bleeding from the pierce, but be alert for pus combined with swelling and redness.
Swollen or tender lymph glands above or below the piercing.
Fever. If you're otherwise healthy (no cold or flu), and you develop a fever, this is cause for concern.;
, If you have any of the above symptoms and you have an infection, it's important to take care of it properly. Most infections of this nature are caused by Staphylococcusand can be quite dangerous if not addressed.


They will likely prescribe an antibiotic cream or tablets. Apply the cream topically or take the prescribed medication, usually for about ten days to two weeks.
Take the full course of antibiotics to prevent a recurrence of the infection.
 Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and antibacterial soap, scrub under your nails to remove any dirt and air-dry your hands.


Using a towel could cause your hands to be come un-hygienic again, even if the towel looks clean.
 This might seem like a good idea but there is the possibility you'll cause an abscess. Always leave the stud in unless your physician recommends you take it out.


Note that if you are having an allergic reaction rather than an infection, you'll want to remove the stud immediately. Signs of an allergic reaction include a burning sensation on the skin, an expanding wound, and/or a clear yellow discharge.

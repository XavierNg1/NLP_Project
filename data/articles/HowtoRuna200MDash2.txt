 Explode from the blocks as soon as you hear the bang. Reaction time is vital to any race, and is especially important to sprints, which are often decided by mere milliseconds.You might hear a second shot from the gun.

Keep your eyes trained toward the ground. Pump your legs hard and use your arms to power your acceleration., As you approach the 20-meter mark, begin to come into an upright position. You should be completely upright at 20 meters as you shift from accelerating to full speed running. By the time you reach 30 meters, you should be running at your maximum speed.

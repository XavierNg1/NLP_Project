 The technique for throwing the circle changeup is the same as the technique for the three-finger changeup; everything except for the grip. For this grip, place the ball in your palm and hold onto the ball with your pinkie, ring, and middle fingers. Your index finger and thumb should touch, or almost touch, forming a circle. In some versions of this grip, the circle is formed on the ball so you're still holding onto the ball somewhat. In others, the circle is formed on the side of the ball, so only the three end fingers are gripping it.








Once you've got the grip down, throw the ball with the same arm speed and arm slot you would use to throw a fastball.
As you throw the ball, the "circle" formed by your index finger and thumb should be facing the catcher.
 This is a great added technique if you want to add even more movement to your pitch. All you have to do is to pronate your throwing hand while you throw the pitch. This means that you should turn your hand over as if you were signaling "thumbs down" to the catcher.
 If you want to improve your changeup skills, then you should practice throwing your changeup during a long toss, which is anything beyond 90 feet (27.4Â m). You can also switch between throwing fastballs and changeups as you long toss for about ten throws for each type of pitch. This will get you used to switching between the two pitching styles.
 This is a great way to take some speed off of your changeup. Just shorten your stride by a few inches only and collapse just a bit on your back leg. This means that you should reduce the normal back-side leg movement that you use during your follow through. When you throw a change-up, that back leg shouldn't be as high as it would be when you're throwing a fast ball.

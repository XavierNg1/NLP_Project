 Do this in ascending order.;
,, Each time you reach a "0" in the ones place, start over counting down from "9" to "0" in the ones place and put the same number in the tens place as the number that is before it. For example, when you get down to "90", put a "9" in the tens place and a "9" in the ones place. The list is as follows:


09, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108...

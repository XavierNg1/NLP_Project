 These markings will be etched into the metal. If the jewelry has a clasp then the marks are probably on the back of the clasp. The jewelry might also have a small metal tag etched with marks hanging from the end. Lastly, search the largest parts of the jewelry.


If your jewelry doesn’t have any markings at all it’s probably not a precious metal.;
, Some coins and jewelry will have a stamp with the numbers “999”.This indicates that the jewelry is made of pure silver.If you see a stamp with the numbers “925” followed or preceded by the letter “S”, you have sterling silver. Sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver that’s mixed with another metal alloy, usually copper.For example, a stamp that says “S925” indicates that the jewelry is sterling silver.
Pure silver jewelry is rare as pure silver is soft and easily damaged., Platinum is a very rare and expensive metal. Therefore, all platinum jewelry will be marked to show authenticity. Look for the words “Platinum”, “PLAT”, or “PT” followed or preceded by the numbers “950” or “999”. These numbers refer to the purity of the platinum, with “999” as the most pure.For example, an authentic piece of platinum jewelry might have a stamp reading “PLAT999”.
 Most pure precious metals aren’t magnetic. Therefore, if you place a magnet near the jewelry, you shouldn’t see any movement at all. If you do, the metal isn’t pure silver or pure platinum.Some silver and platinum alloys are magnetic. Therefore, a lower quality silver or platinum piece of jewelry may be magnetic.
If you have a piece of jewelry with a stamp that’s attracted to a magnet, see a reputable jeweler to verify its authenticity.

 Whether your friends or family are near or far, whenever you need a positive, healthy distraction from upsetting thoughts, you can call them. You can even give your friend/relative a heads up that you are calling to get your mind off a specific topic - that way they don't inadvertently bring it up.


If your friends, parents, siblings, or other loved ones live nearby, set up a date to hang out with one another. Go on an outing together. See a movie, go bowling, go swimming, or participate in a shared hobby.
Not only will spending time with others make you happy, it can also prolong your life. Scientists are now comparing loneliness to the equivalent of using tobacco - it can be detrimental to both mental and physical health., When your friends or family are unavailable, it can be a great distraction to spend time with another companion, your pet. Dogs and cats, in particular, are linked to reduced depression and a longer life span. Plus, if you take your dog to the park, you can get much-needed physical activity by walking a few laps or throwing a Frisbee around.
 Visit a place that needs help and give your skills and time to a worthy cause. This will not only distract you, but can also help you to realize that there are people worse off than you, animals in need of your help and an environment that you can be helping to improve.


Volunteering also offers many health advantages. It can ward off loneliness and depression and make you feel more connected to your community. Research also demonstrates that people with purely altruistic reasons for volunteering (i.e. to help others rather than help themselves) live longer.

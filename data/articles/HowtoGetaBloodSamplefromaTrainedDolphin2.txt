 You can begin the sample procedure once dolphin is in position and fully relaxed, no tense flukes. Make sure that the entire blood sample kit is present with you.
, Once sample spot is found, rub three times, in a circular motion, with an alcohol swab.
,,


Once the needle is inserted, pull back the top of the needle (plunger portion) to draw blood inside of the capsule.
Once capsule is full, remove the needle and place the sample back into the kit.
,, After the procedure, tap twice with your hand on the dolphinsâ€™ fluke to signal the end of the sample taking and that the dolphin can return to its normal stationing position. If the procedure went well, reward the dolphin with reinforcement, i.e., food, toys, rub down, play, etc.

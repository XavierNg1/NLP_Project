 Some dogs may start eliminating inside the house due to medical issues. If your veterinarian has identified a medical condition that requires special treatment, medication, or other interventions, make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions.If your Pomeranian’s elimination problems are related to a medical condition, they will not improve until he is cured. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your Pomeranian’s condition worsens or does not improve despite treatment.
 Some dogs just don’t like to go outside when the weather is bad. You can help make the experience more tolerable for your dog by getting cold and/or wet weather gear for your dog. For example, if your dog does not like the feel of his paws in the snow, consider getting some boots for your dog to wear when you take him outside. Or, if your dog doesn’t like to get wet, consider getting him a raincoat to wear when it is raining., To make sure that your dog does not have to hold it for long periods of time, ask a friend or neighbor to come by and take your Pomeranian out or encourage him to use his puppy pad or litter box. If you are training your Pomeranian to go potty outside, forcing him to stay in the house for several hours will lead to messes because he will not be able to hold it for that long.Even if you are training your Pomeranian to use a puppy pad or litter box, he may need some guidance and encouragement to do so.


If you don’t know anyone who is willing or able to take your Pomeranian out for you during long periods away, consider hiring a pet sitter to stop by when you have a long day away from home.
 If your dog does not respond to your house training efforts and there is no medical reason for your dog’s issues, you may want to consider hiring a certified professional dog trainer to help you house train your Pomeranian.

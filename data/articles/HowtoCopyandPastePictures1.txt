 In order to copy an image, you'll need an image to copy. You can copy any image you find on the internet, as long as the website allows you to.


Google, Bing, and Yahoo! all have image searching tools that allow you to find a variety of images that match your search terms.;
, Oftentimes when you find an image online, you will see the thumbnail first. This is a smaller version of the original image, and copying this will result in copying the lower-quality version. Click the thumbnail to open the image so it's full-size.
 If you are using a Mac with a single button mouse, hold the Ctrl key and then click on the image.


Some websites don't allow you to right-click on them. If you want to bypass these restrictions, see this guide.
 Select "Copy image" or "Copy" from the right-click menu. This will copy the image file to your clipboard, allowing you to paste it elsewhere.


If you want to link to the image, such as in a Facebook post, select "Copy image URL" or "Copy image address" instead. This will not copy the image, but instead copy the address that links to the image. This will allow you to post the address elsewhere.
 Once the image is copied to your clipboard, you can paste it anywhere that allows you to paste images. This could be your word processor, an image editing program, your presentation, or more.


You can paste by right-clicking on the location you want to paste and selecting "Paste" from the menu, or you can press Ctrl + V on a PC or Command + V on a Mac.
If you are trying to add an image to your website, use the "Copy image URL" to link directly to the image, or download the image and upload it to your own web server.

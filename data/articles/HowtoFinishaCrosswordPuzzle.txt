 Then, you'll have a network of answers from which to work. Solve as many of the squares as you can from the network, and then start at the #1 box, across, then down. Fill in the word if it fits both directions. Then do the same with the next box until you fill in the words you are sure of. If unsure, write your potential letters very lightly inside the boxes. Continue like this, filling in words you are unsure of, but fit into the down and across boxes.;
, Now that you have a few letters pencilled in, a correct answer might just pop up in your memory. Ensure that the letters fit into the other numbered boxes as well. It is not a correct word, remember, unless it fits perfectly with every box number it touches.
 Now the fun begins as you start to find the letters for each remaining word.
 Often, this is key to puzzle solving. For example, if the theme clues are based on famous crossword puzzlers and you do not know much about it, look up "crosswords" on Wikipedia.
 There are only just so many syllables in the English language and only a few letters will work with both of the words that cross. Take guesses and see if they fit.
 Put these to memory.

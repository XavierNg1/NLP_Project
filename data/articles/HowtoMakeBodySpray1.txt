 Try to get a spray bottle that is made out of glass instead of plastic; essential oils can degrade plastic over time. If you really can't find one, then a high-quality plastic bottle will do.;
, Be sure to leave some room for your essential oils.If you can't find any distilled water, you can use filtered water instead. Do not use tap water, however.


If you have an unsteady hand, consider using a funnel to help you pour the water into the bottle.
 Start with 20 to 25 drops for every 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of water. You can use all one scent, or you can experiment with different combinations. For example, lavender and grapefruit will give you a nice, refreshing scent., Your body spray is now ready to use. Keep in mind that the oils and water will separate naturally over time, so you will need to shake the bottle each time before you use it.

 Just think about it. Ladies, who do you criticise mostly about clothing, weight, and makeup? Say no more.
 Sure, men look at figure, and clothing, but men primarily respond through their five senses. Men don't want to date the sexy girls on Playboy; in any case, men don't know how to react around beautiful sexy women anyway. So be at ease. Your nose is not out of shape; your bum is not as big as you see it in the mirror.
 It takes just a quick glance, maybe three seconds, for someone to evaluate you when you meet for the first time. In this short time, the other person forms an opinion about you based on your appearance, your body language, your demeanour, your mannerisms, and how you are dressed. Dress like a tart, thatâ€™s the impression he will have.

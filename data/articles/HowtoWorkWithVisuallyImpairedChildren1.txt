 This procedure will allow children to find learning the materials and supplies they need on a regular basis without having to constantly look for certain supplies.;
, Markers such as fluorescent stickers and ribbons can help children locate certain items or locations. For example, if a child needs help finding their locker in a school hallway, you can mark the locker with a bright fluorescent sticker.
 Visually impaired children may have difficulty avoiding certain hazards such as objects laying in the middle of the floor or open drawers and cabinets.


Keep doors, drawers, cabinets, and similar objects either completely closed or open at all times.
Encourage adults and children without visual impairments to keep rooms clean, and to store potentially hazardous objects such as balls, toys, and other learning aids away from floor traffic.
 Most children with visual impairments will require bright lights for an optimal learning experience.


Open windows to let in natural sunlight or place the children in a specific area of the room that receives the brightest light source.
 Some visually impaired children may have difficulty reading text and participating in other activities if they are located too far away from the learning materials.


Place visually impaired children near the front of the room during lectures, film presentations, and other activities.

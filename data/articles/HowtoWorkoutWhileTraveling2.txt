 Many effective workouts can be performed without equipment or special facilities. You can get a great workout without leaving your hotel room or guest quarters.


Use your body to create resistance. Do push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, strength training, jumping jacks, jogging in place, and other basic moves to work your muscle groups, stretch, and get your heartbeat up.
 With a little advance preparation or with the guide of a television or DVD exercise program, these types of exercise can often be performed in small, private spaces on the go.


Lay a towel on the floor of the hotel room and use it as a mat for yoga stretches such as downward dog, sun salutations, and other poses that will help relieve the tension from traveling while working your muscles and toning your core.



Improvise a Tae Bo routine in your room by alternating punches and kicks in the air with your hands and feet, keeping muscles contracted and moving deliberately as you listen to music or watch a television program. Jog in place or bounce backward and forward while punching to burn extra calories.
 Get creative by combining a variety of short exercises or physical activities that make you short of breath or give your muscles a workout. Improvise materials if necessary to perform strength training routines or resistance training without equipment if necessary.


Alternate stair climbing with lunges down the hallways, perform bicep curls with water bottles, or substitute a towel or article of clothing for a resistance band. Then try doing chair lifts, scissor kicks, and even jumping on the bed to get your heart rate up and your routine full of variety and fun.

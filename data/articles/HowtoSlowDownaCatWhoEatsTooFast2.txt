 If your cat eats too fast and vomits up her food or starts to show signs of digestive issues like bloating, you may want to adjust her feeding schedule. Instead of three big meals a day, try feeding your cat smaller portions five to six times a day for one to two weeks.


After one to two weeks, check to see if the new feeding schedule forces her to slow down when she eats. Smaller portions throughout the day will also help her digest her food properly and maintain an appetite for her next meal.
You can also put food in smaller dishes throughout your home so your cat has to move around to eat more food. This will make her treat feeding time more like a “hunt”, where she is mentally and physically stimulated, and force her to pace herself as she eats., If you have more than one cat at home, you may have an issue where one cat bullies another cat and eats the other cat’s food, or one cat hogs all the food when it comes time to eat. Avoid these issues by setting up more than one feeding station in your home, ideally in separate rooms or different areas of your home. This will force your cats to spread out when they eat and provide enough space for each cat to get enough food.Using multiple feeding stations along with smaller portions throughout the day for all the cats can help your cats slow down when they eat.
 If you try several of these steps and your cat still eats too fast but does not appear to be putting on any weight or cannot satisfy her appetite, your cat may have a medical issue that needs to be addressed. Take your cat to your vet for a checkup to ensure her overeating or fast eating are not a sign of a medical issue.

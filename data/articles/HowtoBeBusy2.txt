 Pass the time by playing an old school board game, like Monopoly or Clue, with a friend or sibling. If you’re looking for something a little different, go online and try out some of the many games available there. Everything from Scrabble and Tetris to role playing games like World of Warcraft are online, and you can play against opponents that live all over the world.


Master your favorite video game, if that's more your style.
Keep yourself busy with solo games like Sudoku, solitaire and crossword puzzles.
If you are looking for something a little more intense, give chess a try.
 Instead of texting or sending your friends instant messages via your computer or tablet, give them a call. A good chat with a friend will keep you occupied and raise your spirits. Call up your friends just to chat, or make plans to meet up with them later and hang out.


Plan some activities that you can all do together, like go to the movies, head to the mall, go bowling, visit the local skate park, check out a museum or just go on a walk together to catch up.
 Keep yourself busy by helping out around the house. Ask one of your parents to give you a list of chores that you can take care of each week. Consider working out a system with your parents so that you could get paid a small allowance for fulfilling your weekly "duties."


That way you’ll stay busy with chores and once you’re finished, you will have spending money to go do something fun!

, Write down a list of movies you’ve been wanting to see. If you can’t think of any, ask your friends and family members for recommendations. Go online and research the movie genres that you like and discover films to watch that way. Keep your list handy and work your way through the movies by watching them on Netflix or via iTunes.


Consider starting a blog of your movie reviews.
Invite friends over and watch movies together, then rate them and talk about them afterward.
Starting a group blog of movie reviews would also be fun.

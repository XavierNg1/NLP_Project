In the meantime, take steps to prevent you or anyone else from catching ringworm from your pet.If your pet’s hair becomes patchy, or you’ve noticed scratching more frequently than usual, get them to vet!

, Wear clothing with long sleeves and gloves when handling a pet that may be infected with ringworm. If your immune system is in any way compromised by illness or medication, do not handle the pet at all.If the vet reports that your pet does indeed have ringworm, be sure to have any other pets checked as well.
 Ringworm may be present on bits of your pet’s skin and hairs that are shed around your home.

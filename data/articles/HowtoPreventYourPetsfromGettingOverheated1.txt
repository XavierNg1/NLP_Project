 This is important for all pets regardless of whether they are kept indoors, outdoors, or spend time both inside and outside.


Put ice cubes in your pet's dish to keep the water cold.
Make sure tethered pets can reach the water dish.
Provide several filled water dishes for pets. This guarantees a supply of water even if a dish breaks or spills.;
, This allows them to get out of the sun's direct rays. Shaded spots are always cooler.
 Keep walks and exercise periods short to prevent pets from getting overheated.


Walk pets on grass or soil when possible. Paved sidewalks and asphalt roads can burn your pet's paws.
Walk and exercise pets in the morning or after sundown. This is when the temperature is coolest.
 Run the air-conditioner for pets in very hot weather even if you're at work. Run an electric fan if you don't have air-conditioning.



Brush or comb cats frequently to remove hair and cool them.
Shear dogs so their hair is about 1 inch (2.54 cm) long. Leaving hair that length makes you dog cooler yet still shields its skin from the sun's rays. Remember that pets can get sunburned, too.

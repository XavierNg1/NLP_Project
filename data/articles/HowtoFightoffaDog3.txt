 When you go for a walk in an area where dogs are often loose, plan ahead to bring something that can help in case of an attack. If a dog is acting aggressive or going to attack you, you can defend yourself and protect your body by placing an object between yourself and the attacking dog. The dog may even clamp down on the shielding object, and avoid harming you altogether.Having something with you like:


A sweater or jacket.
A book or newspaper.
A cane or umbrella.
A bicycle.
 In case you come across an aggressive dog that attacks you, it’s best to be prepared and capable of defending yourself. Pepper spray is available for this purpose, and a knife is certainly better than nothing.Also considering carrying a heavy walking stick that you can swing in self-defense.


If you have steel-toed boots or shoes, these can also be used in self-defense against a dog.
A firearm is the next step; a pistol can be conveniently carried if the law allows.
 If you don't carry a weapon, you can use something you find as a weapon tin case a dog attacks. A sturdy board, pole, or branch should be your first choice. If a dog is threatening you, point the stick at the dog to keep it at bay. Do not try to swing at the dog, as this may anger the animal and cause it to attack.


If no sticks or poles are around, rocks are the next best choice.
Even if there isn’t an aggressive dog nearby that could attack, if you’re in unfamiliar territory, it’s smart to be aware of your surroundings. Consider what objects you could use to defend yourself in the case of a dog attack.

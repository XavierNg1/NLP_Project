 Pour the vegetable oil into a small saucepan and set it on the stove over medium heat.


Allow it to heat for 30 to 60 seconds before continuing. The oil should become more fluid and easier to spread, but it should not get hot enough to produce smoke.
 Add the onion, garlic, and parsley to the hot oil. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.


When ready, both the onion and garlic should smell stronger and look lightly browned.
 Add the ketchup, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar, and black pepper to the contents of the saucepan. Stir or whisk to combine.
 Bring the contents of the saucepan to a steady simmer. Once the mixture starts to simmer, set your timer for 20 minutes and continue cooking the sauce.


Return to the sauce and stir it every few minutes. Doing so should help distribute the flavors evenly while preventing the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
 Remove the saucepan from the stove. Using an immersion blender, blend the sauce on high speed for 30 to 60 seconds, or until the solid pieces break down and the sauce turns into a thin puree.


If you do not have an immersion blender, pour the sauce into a standard blender and puree it that way.
For a thinner sauce, strain out the solid pieces instead of blending them down. Pour the sauce through a colander or sieve. Keep the liquid portion and discard the solid parts.
 Allow the sauce to cool at room temperature, then place it in a sealed glass or plastic container. Store the sauce in your refrigerator for one to two weeks.


Serve the sauce cold or at room temperature. If you plan to use it at room temperature, remove the amount you wish to use and set it aside on your kitchen counter for roughly 30 minutes.

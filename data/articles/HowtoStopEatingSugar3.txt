 This is a way to break deep-seated patterns by changing the perceptions of your subconscious. If you are unable to change your habits through your own will power, you can enlist the aid of a hypnotist. Hypnosis has been proven to be effective for some people dealing with addiction.
 Practices such as yoga or tai chi are extremely beneficial for those trying to change their diet. While these practices are physical and a great way to get exercise, they are also extremely mental and spiritual. By getting in touch with and learning to respect your body, you can make it much easier for yourself to kick a bad habit.
 If you're having a hard time figuring out how to change your diet to fit your lifestyle and come up with replacements for sugary foods, try talking to a nutritionist. A nutritionist can get you started on a diet plan that is right for your body and your lifestyle as well. It can be very hard to stay on track if you're constantly running around all day taking care of children or managing an office. Let a nutritionist do the nitty gritty work for you and help get you on the right eating path.
 Diet and exercise go hand in hand. Incorporate physical activity as a regular routine in your new lifestyle. You should get at least 30 minutes of cardio activity per day to support a healthy blood flow and maintain a healthy weight. Exercise also helps to relieve stress and other anxieties that may be causing you to turn to sugar as a crutch. Find the type of exercise that works for you and make it part of your lifestyle.

 When a recipe calls for milk, use fat-free skim milk, 2% milk, or 1% milk instead of whole milk. These milk varieties are specifically processed to reduce the fat content. Cream cheese, sour cream, yogurt, and cheese also come in low-fat varieties.It’s worth noting that low-fat dairy products may slightly alter the taste or consistency of your dishes.;
, Butter keeps baked goods moist and binds them together, but applesauce can serve the same function with less fat. Replace half of the butter with applesauce. If the recipe calls for ½ cup (118 ml) of butter, use ¼ cup (60 ml) butter and ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce.This works especially well in cakes, but can be used in most baked goods. Experiment with applesauce in your favorite baked goods and see if people who taste them can tell the difference.
 Pureed bananas, peaches, prunes, pumpkin, and squash can substitute for half of the butter in baked goods. Use ripe fruit so they are soft and sweet. Mash the fruit or use a blender or food processor to puree the fruit completely.This works best for rich baked goods like chocolate cake and spiced muffins. Experiment to see which fruit works best in the recipes you usually make.
Even if you only replace ¼ of the butter with fruit, you’ll reduce the fat and make your baked goods healthier.
 For each egg that a recipe calls for, mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water. Use a blend or coffee grinder to grind the flaxseed before you mix it with the water. Blend the mixture to produce a fluffy, sticky substance. Then stir the flaxseed mixture into the recipe when the egg is called for.Use in baked goods that can handle the nutty taste of flaxseed. Examples are pancakes, waffles, muffins, carrot cake, and oatmeal cookies.

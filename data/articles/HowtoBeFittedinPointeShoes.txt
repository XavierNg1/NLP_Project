, This may feel uncomfortable, but the shoe is required to fit just right in the length, to prevent blistering.
 If so, the pointe shoe is too narrow. If you can easily slip a finger underneath the drawstring, the shoe is too wide.
 There should be a small amount of fabric that you can pinch up at the heel(about 1/2 inch), although it should not be baggy.
,, If you feel your toes pushing at the end, the shoe is too short. If your toes are just touching, that should be fine. Get in to first position and do a plie, if your toes still are not crushed against the end, but just touch, the length is probably fine.
 If your foot slides down in the shoe, it isn't fitting you properly. You should be able to feel the support from the box when en pointe. Most stores will have a barre for support when you try the shoe.

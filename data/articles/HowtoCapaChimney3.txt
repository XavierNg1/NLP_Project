 Position the cap over the flue, centering it as well as you can, before sliding it in place over or inside the flue.


Remember that a single flue chimney with an extended flue will require a cap that slides over the top of the flue. A chimney without an extended flue will require a cap that slides inside the flue, instead.
 Place a sheet metal screw in each hole along the base of the cap and twist each one in place using a drill.


Match the screw size to the size of the holes in your chimney cap. Similarly, use the correct drill bit size for that screw.
Work carefully as you drill the screw in place. You will be drilling into the foundation of the chimney, and if you work too sloppily, you could end up damaging the masonry.
If you are not comfortable drilling into the chimney, use pressure screws or bolts instead of sheet metal screws.
Note that you will only fasten the cap from the outside when capping an extended flue. If capping a flush flue, you will need to fasten the cap to the inside of the chimney flue.
 Apply a thin line of silicone caulk to the entire perimeter of the chimney cap, filling in the seam.


This caulk will help keep more moisture out.

 Unlike punk skaters, hip-hop skaters like to stand out with bright clothing. You can wear a tee, skater shoes, or a snapback in a bright color. Some skaters wear a white tee to look cool and casual, and bring in their pop of color from their hat, shoes, or from their bling jewelry.Casual tees are really the best way to go with this look as you want to look chill and cool., With hip hop skaters, the pants really vary. Some skaters wear skinny jeans that are loose near the waist, showing off their boxers, while others wear baggy jeans. You can wear either of these to compliment other parts of your style to achieve that hip-hop look. Make sure whatever pants you choose allow you to do tricks and move around easily.
 A snapback is essential to completing a hip-hip skater look. You can find these in all different styles and brands, so choose the one that best suits your look. You can wear your snapback facing forwards or backwards, and can bling it out to add an extra edginess to your outfit., Hip-hop skaters like to compliment their style by adding a long, chain necklace to their outfit or rings with bling.

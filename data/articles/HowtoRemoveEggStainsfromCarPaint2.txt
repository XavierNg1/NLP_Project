 If the stain has had time to set up, soap and water may not work: sanding is your next best option. Make sure the area you're planning to sand is broad and flat and accessible enough to allow for a sanding motion. Wet the stain to prepare it.
 You should be sanding softly enough to spare your paint as much damage as possible. Pick a sandpaper with a higher grit (something in the 80-120 grit range) to avoid scratching the area further. High-grit sandpapers use a higher number of grains that are less coarse, making them perfect for smoothing and finishing jobs.Soak the sandpaper in water for a few hours (or overnight) to slightly soften the grit. Otherwise, the friction of the sandpaper is more likely to damage your car.
Cutting the sandpaper will create a smaller sanding surface, making you less likely to accidentally scrape other areas of paint.
Alternatively, a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser might do the trick. Its dense plastic surface works much like a fine, high-grit sandpaper, and it can be purchased in most supermarkets and convenience stores.
 Use small, gentle sanding motions. Try to coax the stain out with the sandpaper very gradually, and keep the sandpaper and stain wet. Sand until the stain is gone, but stop before you start taking off paint., Finish with a high-speed rotary polisher to remove any and all marks made by sanding. By doing this, you're effectively melting your clear coat around the stained area, blending it smooth.You can optionally apply a polish coat at this point. Use a pure polish on the buffed area to remove any unsightly swirl marks. If the egg damage is still not gone, you may have to do an area respray (spot-blending).
If you're not familiar with how to use a machine polisher or don't have access to one, take your car to a garage to be polished once you've removed the stain.

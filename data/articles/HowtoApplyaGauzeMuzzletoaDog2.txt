 Just as you would for a dog with a long snout, cut off a long strip of gauze bandage. Make sure it is long enough to wind several times around your dog’s head. Then form a loop in the middle and tie a slipknot for it., For pug-nosed dogs, you must be sure to place the loop’s slipknot under their chin. Come up on the dog from behind or the side, then slip it under their nose. Keep the knot turned toward the floor so that it easily slides under the dog’s chin.For longer snouts, the knot goes behind the ears.
 Once the loop is on the dog’s nose, slide it back toward the jawline. Then pull the slipknot tight enough to keep the dog’s mouth shut. Quickly pull the loose ends back and tie them behind the ears.Use a slipknot or bow so that the muzzle can be removed quickly.
 For pug-nosed dogs, it is important to take one loose end and feed it back through the gauze tied around the dog’s snout. Pull this loose end across your dog’s forehead. Then slide it under the tightened loop at the top, right by the nose.Feeding an end back through the loop keeps the muzzle from slipping off.
Keeping the muzzle on can be challenging on dogs with pug noses, and keeping it on is important.

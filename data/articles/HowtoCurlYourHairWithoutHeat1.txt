 Gently comb out any tangles. Pat your hair dry with a towel. Allow your hair to dry until it is just damp., Part your hair down the middle and braid the two sections tightly, then fasten the ends with a hair tie or rubber band.


For a more natural look, use your fingers to gently pull the braids apart, loosening them slightly.
For looser-looking waves, try using one single braid down the back rather than braiding two parts.
For tighter curls, separate your hair into three or four sections and braid each one. For thick hair, you may need to separate your hair into more than four sections.
 Wait several hours or go to bed with your hair in braids to allow the waves to set in., When your hair is dry or in the morning, remove the rubber bands and unbraid your hair. Gently run your fingers through your hair to create natural-looking waves.

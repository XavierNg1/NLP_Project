, Add a cup of drinking water for about four cups of vegetables. Pulse on and off frequently to avoid making veggie soup. You should have visible shreds of vegetable floating in water.


If you are using thick vegetables, you might want to cut them into smaller pieces before blending.
If the ratio of water to vegetable shreds is high, take some liquid out and strain out the solids, then add the strained vegetables back into the blender.
 When you have blended up a nice, non-soupy mix, use ice cube trays to freeze small portions of this vegetable blend. Freeze for at least 12 hours.
 Splitting a cube in half for smaller tanks is good, so you don't waste food. Stick a cube in shallow sand daily; it will melt and the crabs will be able to sift through the sand to find the food.

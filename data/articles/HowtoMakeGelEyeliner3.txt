 Fill a small saucepan halfway with water, and place a glass bowl or measuring cup in the pan. Add ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of grated beeswax and ½ teaspoon (2.25 g) of coconut oil to the glass bowl. Bring the water in the pan to a gentle boil over medium heat until the wax and oil melt, which should take 10 to 15 minutes.You can substitute grapeseed or sweet almond oil for the coconut oil if you prefer.
You can usually purchase beeswax at your local farmers' market, health food store, or organic grocery store.
 When the wax and oil are melted, remove the glass bowl from the double boiler. Add ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of activated charcoal powder to the bowl. Stir with a spoon until the charcoal is completely blended into the wax and oil., Once the charcoal is fully combined with the wax mixture, mix in ¼ teaspoon (1.25 ml) of distilled water. Whisk the mixture until the water is fully incorporated and a smooth gel forms.If you find that the ingredients are separating, mix in a capsule full of lecithin to help bind the eyeliner. You can find lecithin capsules with other supplements at the drugstore.
 When the gel liner is completely mixed, use a spoon to place it in a small container with a lid. Keep the liner in the refrigerator to help keep it fresh.Because there are no preservatives in the eye liner, you should throw it out after 3 to 4 weeks.
 For the best application, dip a small, narrow eyeliner brush into the liner. Apply the liner in as thin or thick a line as you’d like at your lash line.To remove the liner, apply some coconut oil to your eyes with a cotton ball. Wipe your eyes gently until all of the liner is removed.

 Create a flavorful waffle batter using basic ingredients and leftover sweet potato casserole. If your casserole is heavily spiced, you'll only need to add milk, eggs, butter, and baking powder. Cook the waffles on a hot waffle iron and serve them right away.You can top the waffles with chopped pecans or whipped cream.;
, Scoop all of your leftover casserole (including the pecans and marshmallows) into a mixing bowl. Stir it together until it's smooth and then beat in two eggs. Cook the casserole pancakes on a hot griddle and serve them with a drizzle of maple syrup.The mixture should resemble batter, but if it's still too thick, you could add a little milk to thin it out.
 To make six sweet potato casserole muffins, just mix 1 1⁄2 cups (300 g) of the casserole filling with a small package of cornbread mix, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk, 1 egg, and 1⁄4 cup (60 ml) vegetable oil. Divide the batter in a greased muffin tin and bake them for 15 to 20 minutes at 400 degrees F (204 C).You won't need additional sugar for these muffins since the casserole is already sweetened.
 Make a batch of your favorite oatmeal or porridge. Warm a small bowl of the leftover sweet potato casserole and stir it into the oatmeal. Stir the mixture well so the casserole combines with the oatmeal. Consider topping the oatmeal with:Chopped pecans
Mini-marshmallows
Granola
Maple syrup

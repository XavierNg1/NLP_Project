 It should contain a liquid soap, a wiper, a small brush and in some cases another brush with a longer handle. In many ways, these items are similar to what you use to clean your car, so if you cannot purchase a cleaning kit that is specifically designed for cleaning solar panels then you can substitute it with your car cleaning equipment instead.;
, The amount that needs to be mixed should be mentioned on the bottle of liquid soap. Usually it is about the same proportion that you use when cleaning your car.
 If you have the panels divided into smaller arrangements then you should be able to get the job done with a small handheld brush. However, for larger arrangements it can be difficult to reach the panels in the middle so you will need to use the brush with the longer handle.
 At times, the wiper is attached at the back of the brush. It is important that you don't allow the soap to dry on the solar panels since this will block the amount of sunlight that they can absorb and make them inefficient.
 Sometimes it can be difficult to reach all the panels while in other cases you may have certain stains such as the stains of bird droppings that can be very difficult to clean. It is better to hire a professional than to risk damaging your solar panels.

 However, many decent men out there may be struggling with feelings of doubt as to when he should make the big move.;
, There is no right or wrong time; it’s one of those “in-the-moment” experiences. The idea of having a perfectly organized when-and-where approach to kissing just defeats the whole purpose. It robs a couple of their enjoyment. A kiss should be magical and spontaneous, as unique as the two of you are.
 Most women have a natural fear about coming on too strong with a giant smooch of their own. So try to understand why most men feel nervous about their first kiss. Not every man is an expert when it comes to kissing. Men may be afraid themselves, of coming on too strong, seeming too aggressive or “forcing” the woman to kiss him. They want to create the perfect moment, the grand romance everyone dreams of.
 You can help him help him by displaying favorable body language. The more positive signals he gets, the more courage he will build. #Remember too that men are also stimulated by smells, not only perfume, but also natural body pheromones. Go easy on any superficial scents, and instead stick to shampoo and soap/lotion.
 Don’t talk if there’s the slightest chance he may kiss you. Just stare deep into his eyes until he gets the message. Now you can taste the magic of love.

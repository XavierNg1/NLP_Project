 Think of ideas for how you want to decorate your beer pong table. Talk to your roommates and think of something that represents the house or an inside joke that you all share. You can also add to the functionality of your pong table with the design by designating where each player should put their cups. You can do this by drawing or painting round circles that are the same size as the cups that you'll be putting out.


If you're designating where players put their cups, make sure to trace the top of the cup because your cups will need to fit next to one another when you play. If you trace the bottom of the cup, the circles will be too close together.
Good ideas for designs include a favorite sports team, the university that you attend, or the fraternity, sorority, or club that you all belong to.
 Purchase paint at a hardware store and use a flat brush to paint the surface of the table. Laying down a colored base coat may make whatever you're painting on top of it pop. Before painting on top of another layer of paint, make sure that it dries.


If you want more accurate straight lines, lay down painters tape in the places that you want to make your line.
Using a stencil is also another great idea to get more detailed images by using paint.
 Another idea is to allow your guests and party members to decorate the table over time. Start the fun by using some thick markers to draw all over the surface of the table. Encourage people at the party to join in and draw something of their own. Over time, your beer pong table should fill up and have a personality of its own.
 There are other ways that you can alter or change your beer pong table. One example is a group that used LED lights to illuminate their table during games.You can also engrave a wooden table, or can use graffiti paint to create a unique design or tag. Get creative and think of different methods that you can use to enhance the look of the table.

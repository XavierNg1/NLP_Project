 To avoid delays or complications, make sure to have your boarding pass and photo I.D. in hand when you get into the security line. It is best to be absolutely sure that you have both before reaching security in the event that one is missing or stuck at the bottom of your bag. In the U.S., acceptable forms of photo identification to use at the airport include:A valid driverâ€™s license
U.S. passport
Permanent resident card
U.S. military I.D.
Border crossing card
DHS trusted traveller card (e.g. Global Entry or NEXUS)

, To save time at the front of the line, loosen your belt and shoelaces so that you can remove them quickly to put into a bin at the X ray machine. Taking time to do this at the security check will slow down the process for yourself, and for those waiting behind you. If you are wearing a jacket or sweater, remove it before you reach the front of the line. , If you are bringing liquids on the plane in the U.S. (e.g. cough syrup or makeup remover), make sure that they are in containers smaller than 3.4 oz. (100 ml), in keeping with the TSA's regulations. Place liquids in a resealable bag no more than a quart (1.75 ml) large. Make sure that the bag is packed near the top of your carry-on so that you can quickly remove it to put into a bin at the security check.

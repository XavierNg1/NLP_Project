 The library is excellent for this. Try to go to a library where you aren't well known. Don't bring attention to yourself with your clothing or actions. Avoid leaving a trail for investigators. For instance, do not ask librarians where to find the book or search for it in the card catalogue. If you're serious about stealth, don't even check out the book. Just read it at the library. Another way, would be to obtain a digital copy of the book by searching it online in google and then buying an e-book version of it. Reading on your laptop or tablet helps to read in privacy too.;
, Hide it under your coat, in your pocket, or in a bag. Take it into a secure location where you know you will not be found or seen.
 Avoid the obvious, like underneath your pillow or in your hands. Sometimes burying it underneath clothing is effective if your dresser is never touched by others. If you share a room, make sure your roommate will not go through your stuff.
 Do it alone whenever possible. Read it in the bathroom, but remember not to stay locked in for too long. Read it outside, in empty parks or hiking trails. Make sure you always have an alibi.
 Drop it off as quietly and casually as possible. Act like it's an ordinary book. Place it face down on the counter, preferably underneath other books. Turn the spine away from others. You may want to stick around for a few minutes instead of suspiciously dashing away.
 Make sure no one else is in sight when you do this.
 Never quote the book or act knowledgeable about anything pertaining to it. This is often the hardest step because you will want to talk about your adventure. If you must talk about it, choose someone you trust or do it anonymously.

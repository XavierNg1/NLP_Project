 Many countries issue resident visas or permits to individuals who are willing to invest in the countryâ€™s economy, and those resident visas can make you eligible for citizenship after a few years. This can be an expensive route as the minimum investment amounts range from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars.For example, the United States requires an investment of $1 million (or $500,000 if you are investing in a high unemployment or rural area), and in return you receive a conditional permanent resident permit., This path to citizenship can take a long time, so research the amount of time that it will take you to become a citizen before you decide to invest.


For example, the United States and Belgium grant citizenship after five years of holding a resident permit of this type. However, Malta (whose minimum investment requirement is EUR 1 million) grants citizenship after only 1 year.
 Some states that grant investor visas also require that you remain a resident in that state before you can become a citizen. However, not all countries have residency requirements.


For example, Cyprus does not have a residency requirement but the United States does., Not all countries permit dual citizenship. You may be required to renounce your prior citizenship in order to acquire citizenship by investment. If that is the case, you cannot become a dual citizen in this way.

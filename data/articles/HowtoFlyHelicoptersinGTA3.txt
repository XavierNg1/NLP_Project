 You can get inside a helicopter the same way you get inside a car. Stand beside a helicopter and press the F button on your keyboard to board it.
 Press your finger and hold the W button on your keyboard, and the helicopter will take off. Keep your finger on this button until you reach the desired altitude.
 Use the number pad on the right hand of the area of the keyboard to go left (number 4 key) or right (number 6 key), forward (number 8 key) or backward (number 2 key). Steer the vehicle while keeping your finger pressed on the W button to keep moving without losing altitude.


You can also steer the helicopter by moving your mouse towards the direction you want to go.
 Aside from the left analog stick, you can make sudden left or right turns by pressing the Q or E keys, respectively, on your keyboard.
 Military and police helicopters are equipped with mounted firearms like machine guns and missiles. Just press the left button on your mouse to fire these weapons. You can adjust your aim by steering your vehicle with the mouse or number pad towards your target.
 Camera angles can be adjusted while in mid-air, switching from first, second, or third camera view. Just press the V key on your keyboard to change camera views.
 To land, press your finger and hold the S button on the keyboard to slowly descend the aircraft. As you descend, use the the mouse or number pad to steer and help you land the helicopter on the targeted spot.

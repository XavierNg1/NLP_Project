 Enlist the support of your family to make your home-based business work. Involve them in the planning and communicate with them about what you need. Continue to share home responsibilities with other family members. Make time for family activities by structuring your hours around them or limiting your work to specific days of the week., Whether you need to meet with clients, store materials or products or find a quiet place to think, you need a dedicated space in your home for your business. Your business space should be separate from the living areas where your family spends time. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself getting interrupted by your children, spouse, pets, laundry and other distractions. Also, your work will infringe on their activities. Keep out of each other’s way by keeping your work and family life separate., Invest in professional-looking brochures, business cards and stationery. Instead of printing them yourself on your home computer, have a professional service print them for you. Set up a dedicated phone line for your business. Answer the phone professionally, and don’t allow your children to answer your business line. When speaking with clients or customers, close the door if possible so household noises don’t interrupt the conversation.
 Being in one room or staring at your computer screen all day diminishes your creativity and dulls your mental sharpness. Plan to meet friends or business contacts for lunch. Attend seminars to learn something new. Meet clients in person.

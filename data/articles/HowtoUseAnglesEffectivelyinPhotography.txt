 Have some idea of what there is to see and think ahead.;
, Don't just shoot from one position and think that will do it. Try one angle or location, and move a few steps or yards and try it again. Don't expect one shot to do it.
 Look at photo ops and try to figure out how to enhance it with a different angle.
 If you put your 'cool shot' in the vastness of a bunch of other stuff, it won't be seen. Fill up your frame with what you are shooting.
 No, not with yourself, but with the composition of your shot. Just because you don't think it should work, doesn't mean it won't.
 You would be amazed at the different perspectives that can be found that way.

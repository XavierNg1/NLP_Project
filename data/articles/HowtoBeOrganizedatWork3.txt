 All the experts seem to agree on this one.While it may sound speedy or look cool on TV, multitasking is not efficient and can actually hurt your organizational effectiveness.Instead, devote your full attention to one task at a time, handle it, and move on to the next item on your list.
 Thankfully, most jobs don’t require scheduling everything in your day down to the minute. However, keeping a basic schedule of the highlights and most important tasks and events of your day can help keep you on task.


Set time limits for certain activities. Some tasks do not require set time limits, but others should have time parameters to boost your productivity. Think of tasks throughout your day that tend to take more time than necessary, and give them time limits in the future.
Budget extra time for other activities. Some tasks, as you’ve learned from experience, wind up usually taking more time than expected, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. For these types of activities, and for particularly important events and meetings, for example, budget extra time before and after.
 These can be effective tools when used sparingly. Some people like to set their alarms 10, 15, or 30 minutes ahead of time to give them advance warning or buffer time before an activity. You can also set reminder alerts.
 Ask yourself if postponing is absolutely necessary or if this urge is just an example of procrastination. If you sense the latter, don’t postpone—power through! However, in cases when postponing all or part of an activity is unavoidable, be sure to make note of where you left off, and reschedule with concrete plans. Alternatively, you might come up with a contingency plan. For example, if you have to cancel an in-person meeting, perhaps you can hold a conference call or web conference instead.

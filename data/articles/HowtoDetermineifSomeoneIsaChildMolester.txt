 This is the first sign. Molestation, by definition, is a deceptive behavior. Do you see any signs in the person that they are deceptive in any way? Does the subject's personality seem fake in any way? Is the subject a smooth talker who knows how to say all the right things to impress? Do they dodge telling the truth when one expects it or make excuses to put off doing so, giving a seemingly legitimate reason? Have you ever known this person to get caught in a lie? Are you suspicious about anything in the subject's life?;
, A pedophile by definition is attracted to children. Is the subject hanging around children when inappropriate to do so?

, Does the subject view children for their individuality and intellect? Or does the subject express interest in their bodies? Also take notice as to how the subject views adults.
, Observe if they are an obsessive person in general who does not want to part with another person.
 Take notice of this, especially if it is abnormal to do so in that type of relationship.
 All 50 US states and many other places around the world have sex offender registries. This will show if one whose address or zip code you know has been convicted of any sex offenses. At the same time, many child molesters have never been caught and are nor registered, or were convicted of offenses that occurred before the registry was established and are therefore not legally required to register. The registry can be a tool to help identify one as an offender. But the lack of one's presence on the registry does not mean the subject is in the clear.
 While one who simply cares about children is just that, a pedophile cares about oneself and any exposure they have to children is for the purpose of satisfying their own needs.

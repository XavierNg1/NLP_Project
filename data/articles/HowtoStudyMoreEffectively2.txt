 Long, extended study sessions with no breaks will not help you learn information effectively. To be an effective learner, you will need to take regular breaks as you work. Try studying in 30 minutes intervals, and taking a 5-10 minute break at the end of each interval., Use flash cards, mock quizzes, and practice exams to more effectively learn information. Taking a test helps you learn information better than simply re-reading the information. Try creating flash cards to quiz yourself. You can also create, or ask your instructor for, a mock quiz or practice exam., Some people retain information better if multiple senses are engaged in the study process. One way to incorporate multiple senses while studying is by reading your notes out loud as you rewrite them. This approach uses multiple senses and might help you retain information more effectively., Try using a song, acronym, or mnemonic device to help you remember information. For example, if you need to memorize the notes of the treble scale, EGBDF, you can assign the letters a set of words or phrase that is easy to remember, like, “every good boy does fine.”

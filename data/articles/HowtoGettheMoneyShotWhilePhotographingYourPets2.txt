 Once the animal is comfortable, engage him. Here are some ways of going about it. What you are hoping for is to get a curious head tilt from them.
 Softly, like a puppy, or however that particular species communicates with its young. Maybe, quiet little mews for cats to get their attention. Make a noise like a hamster if that is the pet you need a money shot of, or, a rabbit, a snake, a horse, or a chinchilla etc.


Don't do this non-stop. Remember how you relegate the kids to background noise when they won't be quiet? This is the same. They will quit responding to you if you do it all the time.
 They can also help getting the right directionality in your photos.
 There are many devices that you can use to get your pet's attention. Laptops, tablets, smart devices, and even cell phones.


Make sure that you have a good idea of what the response will be. If you are trying to get the money shot of someone else's pet, you don't want them to freak out all of a sudden because you hit one of their triggers!

 Trying to start with a sophisticated game implementing the whole thing at once will most likely end up being frustrating.
 Don't try to solve all problems at once. Instead, try dividing problems into smaller ones and so on until you get to manageable problems that you can tackle.
 Show what's finished to closed circuits of friends or family. Modify your design according to the feedback you take from reviewers.
 Do not make the mistake of changing models halfway unless it is absolutely necessary.
 Creating a game is not a one day/week job. Some games are not a one year job!

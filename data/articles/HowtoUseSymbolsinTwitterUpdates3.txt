 The at symbol is used to mention another Twitter user, or to reply to a Twitter user in a conversation.


Look within your Twitter time line for the name of another Twitter user, or perform a search for a specific user. A Twitter username is always preceded by the at symbol. For example, WikiHow's Twitter username will display as "@wikiHow."

, For example, if you want to share your favorite WikiHow article with your Twitter followers, mention "@wikiHow" within your Tweet.


If you want to reply directly to another user's Tweet, point to the Tweet with your cursor, then select "Reply." Twitter will automatically include that user's Twitter name preceded by the at symbol in your reply, or Twitter update.

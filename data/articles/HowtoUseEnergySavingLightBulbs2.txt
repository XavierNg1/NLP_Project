 They are compact in size and fit many small fixtures. Mostly you will use these in table lamps but can also put them in wall sconces and open overhead light fixtures. Many styles now have an “instant on” feature and you don’t have to wait for the bulb to warm up to become as bright as it is capable.


A reputable brand will give you around 8000 to 10,000 hours of usage compared to only 1000 in incandescent. These are terrific energy savers. You may save up to $103 over the life of the light bulb!;

 While there are a few third-party apps you can use to track a phone, downloading them is not recommended, so proceed with caution.


Most phone trackers are downloaded to the phone in question; they then upload data about that phone's calls, SMS messages, and more to an online server. You can access this information by logging into the app's server with a username/phone number and password.
 On iPhones, this is the "App Store" app usually found on the Home page; Android phones make use of the "Google Play" store.
 This should bring up a list of potential apps for you to use.


Android phones can use an app literally named "Spy Phone" by a company of the same name.The "SpyToMobile" app and the "SpyHuman" app are both cross-platform apps that will accomplish your goal.
Other possible search terms may include "phone tracker", "phone data tracker", etc.
 You'll need to create an account from within the app.


If you don't have permission from the owner of the phone to download the app, don't do it. Doing so may have serious legal consequences.
 This should open the app; you'll need to set up your options from here.
 These will vary depending on your app choice; however, any spy app will require you to enter an account username and password so that you can view the app's results online.
 Again, this will vary depending on which app you chose. You'll need to enter the phone number and/or username you registered with the app and your password.
 If your app is still installed on your target phone, you should see relatively recent results for the call log.

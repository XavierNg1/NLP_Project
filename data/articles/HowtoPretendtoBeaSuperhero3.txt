 Carry a wrench on you at all times. It is easily one of the most handy objects. You can sabotage machinery, terminate living beings with extreme precaution (or at least cause intolerable pain), fix machinery and become your neighborhood's super plumber. You'll drive Mario out of business and get the Princess for yourself.
 Practice throwing lasso. You'll be able to catch objects at distance including escaping criminals, kittens on trees and cans of beer. Actually don't perform the latter unless you're over 21. Or at least put on an innocent face

, It will hurt! You'll be the toughest guy around. Just watch your ammo and be careful.

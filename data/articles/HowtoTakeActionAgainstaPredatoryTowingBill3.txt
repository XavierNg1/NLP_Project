 If you are going to challenge a predatory towing bill, particularly in court, you will need to have some evidence. The best proof you can have to support yourself would be photographs of the scene where you parked. Return to the spot and look for signage. If there are no warning signs that prohibit parking, you may be able to get the court to rule in your favor on the ticket.When you take photographs, you need to get a wide enough shot to show that the whole block or parking lot is not marked. You also need to get close up shots of any signs that are in the area, so they are legible for the court.
 If someone was with you when your car was towed, you should ask that friend to testify. Review with your friend where you were parked and the facts of the situation. Try to get your friend to accompany you to court if you schedule a hearing.If nobody was with you when you parked, you may be able to find a witness who happens to be around when you return to the car. If you see a person there, try to get a name and telephone number so you can get back in touch. It may be uncomfortable to approach a stranger, but it could be worthwhile. Ask someone, “If I file a complaint in small claims court, would you be willing to come with me and testify that there are no parking signs here?”

, If your city or town has any anti-predatory towing regulations, you should print them out. Read through them and find whatever specific regulations you think would help your case. Make additional copies and take them with you when you attend the hearing in small claims court.You can probably expect the court to know the laws, but it would help to take a copy with you. If you want to introduce something into evidence, you will need a copy for the judge and a copy for the opposing party.

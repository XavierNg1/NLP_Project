 There are many products available over-the-counter at the pharmacy that claim to reduce the appearance or even remove scars. Whether these products will work for you, will depend on the type and severity of your scarring.


Though medical professionals may be skeptical about the success rates of such creams, many people have found products like Mederma and Vita-K to be effective.
Mederma works well for stretch marks and other types of scarring, if it is systematically applied 3 to 4 times a day, for up to six months. It works by softening and smoothing the scars, on the legs or any other area of the body., Silicone scar sheets are a great, innovative way to deal with scars, especially those that may look unsightly. The scar sheets are self-adhesive, so they will stick to your skin while the silicone technology works to hydrate, soften, and fade the scars. The silicone sheets are available for purchase over-the-counter or online and each box will usually provide an 8 to 12 week supply.


The silicone sheets have been proven effective in treating scars, but it will take time and patience to achieve noticeable results. The sheets must be worn over the scar every day, for 12 hours a day, over a 2 to 3 month period., Bleaching creams, such as those containing the ingredient hydroquinone, reduce the appearance of scars such as stretch marks and dark spots by targeting the hyperpigmentation, which causes dark brown, black, bright red or purple scars. These creams will effectively lighten the color of the scars, causing them to become less noticeable over time.


Be aware that hydroquinone-based creams, though effective, have been banned in the European Union as they are thought to contain carcinogenic properties and heighten the risk of skin cancer.Hydroquinone products are still available over-the-counter in the US, in concentrations up to 2%. Anything higher than that requires a prescription.

 Greenhouse floors should be made of concrete or gravel because many different pathogens can live in dirt for a very long time.
 In nurseries where trees are grown, all wooden parts of the building should be treated to prevent termites. This can be done using chemicals or old engine oil. Keeping the termites out will eliminate the possibility of them infecting nursery-grown plants.


You should also make sure that propagation structures used arenâ€™t made of wood.
 Substrates should be treated using a pasteurization process that involves either steam or sunlight. This keeps any harmful materials from making their way into the nursery from outside sources.


Systematic applications of fungicide and herbicides can also be used to keep harmful elements out.
 Nursery owners should avoid using water from nearby lakes, ponds, and streams unless it has been treated because it may otherwise harbor harmful substances.
 Overhead watering systems encourage the spread of waterborne diseases, such as Phytophthora, and make plants susceptible to other moisture-related ailments like powdery mildew. Therefore, watering your plants from up above should be avoided.

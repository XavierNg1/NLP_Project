 Have you always gravitated toward simple pieces or do you prefer to be avant-garde with your style? Do you tend to wear dressy or casual items? Do you like sharp, clean lines or loose and flowing ones? Patterns or solids? Every era has a vast array of styles – there is no “one” look for any decade. You can find something that represents your personality in any of them!


Stay true to what feels natural to you. You should feel like yourself in whatever you’re wearing, not like someone playing dress up.
Choose items that appeal to you rather than selecting pieces just because they "look retro."

, Experiment with anything that catches your eye, but whenever you find something that works really well for you, look for other items similar to it. For example, if you discover that loose and flowing 60s blouses look great on you, you could search for similar styles in different colors and other cuts.


As you discover additional pieces that are flattering, continue to add to your retro wardrobe and develop your own unique style.
Select vintage pieces that fit you well and highlight your best features.Whenever possible, try on a garment before buying it. Don’t be afraid to alter pieces that you really like so that they fit you perfectly., Instead of revamping your entire style and replacing your entire wardrobe, think about adding retro touches to clothing you already own. Try adding patches to your jeans, changing the buttons on a shirt, embellishing a jacket with fringe and so on. Get creative!


Try repurposing some of your current clothing with retro elements bought from a thrift store. For instance, you could sew a 60s style shirt collar onto a top you already own.
Give a modern outfit a little retro flair by adding vintage accessories to go with it.

 In order to enter cheats into the game, you'll need to open the GBA file with your emulator program.;
, This will open the "PokemonDarkRising1Complete.GBA" file in your emulator.


You can also click and drag the GBA file to your emulator's icon and drop it on top to open Pokémon Dark Rising. This is an ideal option if you haven't yet set your emulator as the default program for opening GBA files.
 Since the cheats you'll be using have the capacity to corrupt your save file if you save, you should not try to save your game while cheats are active.


If you do want to save your game, hold ⇧ Shift and tap F to save.
 This should be in the top left corner of most GBA emulators. Doing so will open the "Cheats" drop-down menu.
 This will open the CodeBreaker interface into which you will enter your cheats. You're now ready to cheat in Pokémon Dark Rising!


Note the location of the "GameShark" button here as well, since you'll be using it for some cheats.
 You'll need to enable a couple of cheats before entering the Gameshark interface. Pokémon Dark Rising cheats come in the form of developer codes, meaning that they affect the programming of the game itself.


Keep in mind that these cheats can potentially destroy your save file. Proceed with caution.
 This will enable most of the other cheats at your disposal. To enter Pokémon Dark Rising cheats into your emulator, copy each line of code like so, sans the quotation marks:"83005000 61A1" - first line. You'll need to tap ↵ Enter to move your cursor to the next line.
"83005002 0A35" - second line. You'll enter all subsequent cheats in this manner.
 This will activate your cheat.


You will have to click the "CodeBreaker" button again to re-open the interface.
 This will give your character an unending supply of currency:


"74000130 003F5"
"820257BC 423F"
"74000130 003FB"
"820257BE 000F"
Click "OK" when you're done entering this cheat.
 This will open the Gameshark menu. You'll enter the rest of your cheats in this menu.
 This enables a few potentially game-breaking cheats to work:


"72BC6DFB E9CA5465"
"A47FB2DC 1AF3CA86"

, These will significantly improve your Pokémon catch rate:


"82025840 0001"

, This will give you an unlimited amount of rare candies; to access these, you'll need to withdraw them from your Item Storage section on your character's PC."82025840 0044"

, Although you have unlimited funds, you'll be unable to spend them until you reach the PokeMart. Using Travel Through Walls will significantly expedite this process."509197D3 542975F4"
"78DA95DF 44018CB4"

, If you're traveling through walls to reach an advanced destination (e.g., the PokeMart), you're bound to run into high-level Pokemon; instead of trying to fight them, you can use specific codes to avoid them.

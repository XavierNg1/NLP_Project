 Simple and sophisticated, this drink was famously described by Ernest Hemingway. Quoth the American master: "Pour 1 jigger of absinthe into a champagne glass. Add iced champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.", The sazerac, created by Antoine Amédée Peychaud in the early 1800s, is one of the oldest known cocktails.Add a little absinthe to this stellar recipe to make it really stand out.


Add three dashes of absinthe to a bucket glass nearly filled with ice cubes. In a cocktail shaker with ice, mix vigorously:
2 ounces Osocalis brandy
¼ ounce simple syrup
2 dashes Peychaud’s bitters.


Pour contents of cocktail shaker into bucket glass. Stir lightly and wipe rim with lemon zest before adding it as a garnish. Finished.
 Using fresh lemon juice pairs nicely with the herbs in absinthe and the botanicals in gin. Try this interesting cocktail if you have fresh lemons, absinthe, and gin handy!


Mix the following vigorously in an ice-filled cocktail shaker and strain into a martini glass:
½ oz. absinthe
1 teaspoon caster sugar
¾ oz. lemon juice (juice 1/2 lemon)

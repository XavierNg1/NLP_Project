 (the solid part, not the threads);
, Mark that length on the drill bit by wrapping a piece of masking tape around it at that point.
 A pilot hole is a guide hole you drill in your lumber for the screws to follow. Drill the hole until the bottom of your masking tape touches the surface of your lumber.


Pilot holes are also useful for making sure your screw goes in at a level angle. And it helps prevent splitting if you have to drive a screw into a thin edge of lumber.
 This one should be the same diameter as the heads of your screws.
 Mark this drill bit to that length using your masking tape. This is unlikely to be more than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).
 Drill down until the bottom of the masking tape touches the surface of your lumber. Do your best to keep the wider hole centered on the narrower pilot hole.
, Twist it in by hand until it can stand on its own.
 Push firmly on the drill and use pulses to avoid stripping the screw. With the countersink hole in place, the screw should sink easily below the level of your lumber.

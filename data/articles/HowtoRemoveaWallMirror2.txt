 This method of removing the mirror involves removing the entire section of drywall that it is glued to. This is the quickest and safest method to choose if you are renovating the room anyway and plan on replacing the drywall.
 With another person holding the mirror steady, cut the drywall around the mirror on all sides using the saw. The cleaner and straighter your cuts, the easier the subsequent drywall repair will be.
 Once you have cut all the way around the mirror, lift the entire piece of drywall with the mirror attached out of the wall and set it aside.
 If you plan on saving the mirror for later use, you will still need to remove it from the drywall and glue. The easiest way to do this is to lay the mirror down outside, and then use a hose to soak the drywall with water. After a thorough soaking, the drywall will soften and you can scrape it away easily.

 This is just regular pizza dough which you can buy or make yourself. You can make the thickness whatever you want. You'll need to make the base about 30 centimeter (11.8Â in) in diameter.;
, This can be whatever you want but needs to have salmon, tomato sauce (mixed with tomato paste and herbs), and mozzarella cheese. You can have whatever else you want on the pizza. Try corn or, if you're feeling exotic, mangoes.
, Give the pizza a little time to cool off after you take it out of the oven. Five minutes will do. Slice the pizza into wedges according to how many people you are serving.

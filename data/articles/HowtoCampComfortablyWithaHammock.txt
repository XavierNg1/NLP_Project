 When most people think of hammocks, they think the fishnet kind or the rug with wood poles at the end. Those hammocks are bad. If you want real comfort don't go for them. Look for flexible, blanket-like hammocks that are made of cotton or spandex that can wrap around you with a foot extra. You want it longer than you are, and wider is better. They can be expensive, but they are very comfortable and worth the money.;
, They should come with a rope, but if they don't, you should buy some. There are strap kits available for trees so that you don't damage them by drilling in screws or having ropes strip the bark.


Figure out how high or low you want to be while laying in it. Then, because the hammock will stretch, put it up about two feet higher than you want.






Wrap the rope around the tree or attach it to the pole.






Bring the rope around the tree/pole to where the end is facing you.






Tie it in a sailor's knot, then come around the tree/pole again, and repeat the sailor's knot.
 Don't put your head at one end and feet at the other -- it's not comfortable and often hard on your back. Instead, stretch out at a diagonal or across the middle.

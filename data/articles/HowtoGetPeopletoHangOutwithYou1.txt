 People want to go where they know they’ll have a good time, so make your space the place they want to be. Have plenty of things for your guests to do. Don’t limit yourself on activities that you think will result in fun times.


Write down a list of ideas of fun things to do, or surf the web for interesting social activities. Store that list of activities in a place that's easily accessible for a rainy day. You never know when you'll need to host a day of fun.
Cater to your friends' interests. For example, if you know your friends love good food, consider having a themed dinner party.;
, Supply different types of party games designed for social interactions, like Twister. Keep refreshments such as drinks, snacks, and light appetizers readily available for your guests. Have a playlist of music ready to go for any social occasion, but encourage your friends to bring playlists of their own to share.


See if one or more of your friends wants to help with the party planning. That way, you can hang out while also planning a great social event.
Be inclusive when it comes to inviting people to the party. Since you want to find more people to hang out with, it's better to invite more people instead of being exclusive.
 Oftentimes, people are less likely to want to hang out if there’s no one taking the initiative to plan outings. Instead of waiting for people to call you, organize activities and outings that will interest your friends in participating.


Pick your friends’ brain and ask what they’re interested in doing. They may have recommendations for things to do. That can relieve the planning pressures.
When your friends see that you are taking their preferences into account, they'll be more likely to want to hang out in the future.

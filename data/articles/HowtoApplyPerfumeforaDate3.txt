 The most important opinion to consider in selecting a perfume is your own. Perfume is meant to make you feel attractive and confident, and if you don't like what you're wearing then you will probably feel self conscious. Consider owning multiple perfumes to suit your different moods and to give yourself the opportunity to change things up., Part of the point of wearing perfume on a date is to seem attractive to the other party. Although you might not know what scents he or she likes, you can always ask. In a more established relationship you should have an idea of their preferences. If you know that they hate the smell of oranges and lemon scented soaps, avoid citrusy smells.

Musk, oriental, and wood-based scents like sandalwood and patchouli will remain the longest.Citrus notes are the lightest and usually evaporate the fastest.

 Will it be fifth graders or generally lower school? A general group may be better if you own fewer Webkinz or if they have drastically different ages. A specific grade is good if you are teaching a small class. A grade one or two years younger than yours will be easiest to teach.;
, You could teach a class, but you could also have one of your older 'Kinz be a teacher.


You could also have an assistant teacher, especially for lower grades. She can grade papers and do general classroom tasks while the teacher teaches. This is great if both you and your friend want to be the teacher!
Designate substitute teachers as well. If you teacher is sick or takes a personal day (in other words, you lost her) she can step in to teach!

, A larger class will be harder to move around for field trips, but a smaller class may not be able to do some activities. Four to six Webkinz is a good class size.
 If it specializes in one thing, such as singing or medicine, reference that in the title if you like.
 You can collect things such as mini chalkboards/whiteboards, mini journals, pencil and colored pencil stubs, and boxes for desks. If you don't want to round this all up, you could buy a mini school kit to get you started.
 In the morning, take attendance and do the Pledge of Allegiance (or whatever your country's version is). Have snack and lunch. Teach different subjects, such as math, science, language arts, history/social studies, or anything you like!

,, They can have a desk or two if you like. Hopefully students don't have to visit their office too often!

, There could be a Physical Education class, and they could even have swimming lessons!

, They can have sports games against each other and hold events together!

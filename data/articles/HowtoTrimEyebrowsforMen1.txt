 Hot water opens your pores and will loosen hairs that are close to coming out. Take a shower as you normally would, or get a washcloth wet with hot water and press it against your eyebrows for two or three minutes.








If the washcloth gets cold before a few minutes is up, get it hot again.
When you’re in a time crunch, this is not absolutely necessary, but when you have time, it helps make the process work better.;
, Take an eyebrow comb (or a clean toothbrush) and comb the hair straight up. Start from the bridge of your nose and move outward until you reach the end of your eyebrow. Use the comb as necessary to hold the hair in that position when you trim the hairs.








In a pinch, you can use your finger to “comb” the eyebrow hairs upward, but a comb or toothbrush gets between the hairs and is much more effective.
 Look at your eyebrow and notice hairs that stick up higher than the rest of the eyebrow. Start at the outside end of the brow, and cut the long hairs along the top line of your eyebrow.








You want to use eyebrow or nail scissors because they are sharper and narrower than standard all-purpose scissors. Never use kitchen or craft scissors to cut your eyebrows.
 As a final check on overall eyebrow hair length, comb the hairs straight down. Check for hairs that are much longer than the overall length of the eyebrow. Carefully trim those long hairs so that they line up with the rest of the bottom of the eyebrow.

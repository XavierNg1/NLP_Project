 Fold a standard piece of printer paper (typically 8.5x11") in half the long way and crease. This should bring the two longer side together so that the edges touch.
 Open up the paper again and then fold the top two outer corners inwards so that they meet along the middle crease.
 Fold the point made in the previous step down to the crease so that the flaps are tucked under this fold. Make sure that this fold is very crisp. Now the paper should look somewhat like the back of an envelope.
 Fold the two top corners created in the previous step down to the center crease so that the points are about 2/3 of the way down the center crease of the flap.
 Fold up the point that has been covered in the previous step so that it secures the flaps against the crease.
 All the folds made in the previous steps should be facing outwards. The small triangular fold is now along what will later be the bottom of the plane.
 Fold both side flaps down to the bottom (that main center fold line) so that the long edge of the wings are perfectly aligned with the bottom of the airplane.
 Unfold the wings slightly so that they are perpendicular to the body of the airplane and form a flat surface next to each other.
 Start with a gentle toss to see how your plane glides through the air. Experiment with more aggressive throws to see how high and far your plane will travel.

 You can chop wood, and sell it for about 5-6 gold at most pubs and mills. Though it doesn't pay a lot, you get 2 wood every time you chop one log, so each cycle, you chop 3 logs, so you get 6 firewood each time., Sometimes, animals will carry a small amount of coin from their last kill, or you can sell the pelts and meat for about 10-30 coin depending on what kind of pelt it is (for example, wolf pelts are usually more than, say, fox pelts, because wolf pelts are larger).

Do not fast travel. Instead, walk everywhere. You will run into tons of animals whose pelts you can take.
Make sure to craft your pelts. Use the tanning racks to turn the pelts into leather; craft the leather into leather helmets at the forge; improve the leather helmets at the crafting table. You will get tons of money and level up really fast.
 If you bought a house, save them in your chest every time you kill a dragon (run between 190 to 390). They tend to add up or just save expensive armor and go out and look for more sell what you want to collect coins.

 If you are alone with a stranger, give her a brief smile or nod, and then return to what you are doing. This lets her know that you're friendly, and that you see her as a person instead of a potential victim.


Avoid startling her.
Keep a polite distance. There's no need to make a great deal out of assuaging her fears; a simple smile and nod can communicate that you aren't a threat to her safety.
 Friendly and open body language can help people recognize that you aren't a threat (and everyone may be more interested in talking to you).


Think about your facial expressions. Try giving a polite smile of acknowledgement to people who enter the room.
Don't narrow your eyes or glare at a woman, or anybody, for that matter. Try to keep your glance warm and pleasant.
 Of course women will be scared or dislike you if you're rude, sneaky, or simply act like you don't care. Try doing some random acts of kindness and making other people smile. Ask people about their day.
 Sometimes if you're incredibly formal and uptight, you can scare people off.


You don't have to wear your heart on your sleeve and start gushing on about your emotions, but try to be more casual.
You can practice being casual with your body language, language, and your facial expressions in front of a mirror so you'll know how it looks and feels.
 Don't be a bystander to sexist remarks or catcalls. A quick remark, or just being there to stand by the woman, can help women feel safer in your environment and around you. And if your dad or grandpa could see you, he'd probably be proud.


Saying "Hey man, that's not cool" or "knock it off" can be enough to diffuse many instances of casual sexism or harassment.
If you see catcalls, try asking the woman if she is okay. Or stand by in case she looks to you for help. The dynamic will usually change if an aggressive guy knows that another guy is watching his bad behavior.

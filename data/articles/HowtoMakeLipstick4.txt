 This method is a good one to use if you have several old lipsticks you'd like to repurpose into a new color. You can use lipsticks of the same shade, or create a new color by choosing several different shades.









Make sure that any lipstick you use has not expired. If it's older than two years, it's too old to use and should be discarded.
 Put the lipsticks in the microwave for 5 seconds on high. Allow them to melt, then mix them together with a plastic spoon or stirring rod to blend the colors.








Continue microwaving in 5-second intervals until blended.
Alternatively, you can melt the lipsticks together in a double-boiler instead of a microwave. Consider adding about 1 tsp (5 ml) of beeswax or petroleum jelly for every 4 inches (10 cm) of lipstick used, as doing so will add a moisturizing effect to the lipstick. Stir well until blended., When ready, pour the new shade of lipstick into a small cosmetic pot or tin. Allow the lipstick to cool and harden before use.









Apply the new lipstick using your finger or an applicator brush.

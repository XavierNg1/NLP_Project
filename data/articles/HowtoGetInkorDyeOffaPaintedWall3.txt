 The sooner you clean up an ink or dye stain, the easier it will be to remove. You may also be able to get away with an easy cleansing method like a damp cloth and water if you clean up ink and dye as soon as they get on your walls.If you didn’t notice the spill or waited to clean it, don’t worry! You can still remove the stain. It may just be a little harder to remove.
 You may want to test any cleaning option you plan to use on a discreet portion of your painted wall first to see if they cause any discoloration. This will give you a chance to see if the method works and whether or not it discolors the paint.


For example, you could try the cleaning option on an area that is behind a piece of furniture or near the floor.
 To reduce the chances that the cleaning product will mess up your paint, you can also confine the area that you clean to where the dye or ink has stained it. Unless the dye or ink is spread over a large area, this will require dabbing on the cleaning product or limiting your application of the product in other ways. Some things you can try include:


Using a cotton ball or cotton swab to dab on a cleaning product.
Cutting a magic eraser or sponge into small pieces for use on a small area.
Making small, precise movements with the cloth or sponge.
 If you do end up discoloring your paint in the process of removing the dye or ink, then you can always paint over the area to fix the discoloration. Find out the exact shade that was used to paint the wall and get a small can of this paint to touch up the area if it is discolored from the cleaning option you use.

 Collect dry small twigs, dried grass, dry moss, lichen, etc. for kindling. Also gather thin pieces of wood for when the kindling is burning well.
 Clear away flammable items and steer clear of tents, trees, etc.
, Keep striking until sparks from the stones hit the tinder and catch.
 This will help it to take hold.
 Once the kindling is burning nicely, add the first wood.

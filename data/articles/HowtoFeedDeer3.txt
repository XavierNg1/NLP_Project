 Feeding wildlife is often regulated by local laws and wildlife commissions, and the laws vary from state to state. Some states allow feeding between certain dates and prohibit it between other dates. Check online to find out your local laws. Some states also have laws that dictate how much you are allowed to feed deer., Many local wildlife organizations set up feeding sites for deer â€“ these are public places that deer come to feed. You can bring food to these sites to help feed deer without taking on the responsibility of feeding deer in your backyard. These organizations typically know the proper times to feed deer and the proper amount of food to put out at one time., If you plan to feed deer on your property, make sure you're feeding them the proper food, and not giving them too much of it. Set up feeders or troughs as far as possible from your home so that the deer don't come near your house.


Each deer should eat no more than 3-4 pounds of food per day.Try not to interact with the deer, as this can make them less fearful of humans, and more likely to become prey.

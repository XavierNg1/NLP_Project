High-frequency detectors are more sensitive to gold, but they are also more likely to give false positives when iron deposits are present.
Evaluate low-frequency detectors. Low-frequency detectors will tune out other metals and will find larger deposits at greater depths.
 These will adjust automatically according to the iron content in the rocks, and you won't have to constantly manually adjust the controls.
 This will help you to know precisely how far down you need to excavate.



Larger coils will find larger objects at greater depths, while smaller coils will find smaller objects at shallower depths.
Small coils are good for detecting deposits in bedrock while large coils are better at detecting nuggets buried in tailing piles.
Buy coils created for your model of metal detector. Coils are not interchangeable between models.
 A good pair of headphones will:


Muffle outside noise.
Enhance the faint sound made when nuggets are detected.
Possess a volume control mechanism.
Utilize mono or stereo sound depending on the sound output type of the detector.

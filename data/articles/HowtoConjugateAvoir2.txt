 In French, the imperfect tense is closest to what you would think of as basic past tense in English. Use "j'avais" to talk about something you had at some point in the past.The verb avoir is conjugated the same for the second-person singular pronoun tu. Don't slur the pronoun and the verb together in speech as you would for the first-person singular.
 When talking about a third person or an object, use this conjugation of the verb avoir. Pronounce this word "AH-vay," leaving the "t" at the end silent., If you want to talk about how you and someone else together had something in the past, you would say "nous avions," or "we had.", If you're addressing a group of people, you would use the second-person plural pronoun "vous." This pronoun also is appropriate in more formal situations, or if you're addressing an authority figure.Pronounce "vous aviez" as "voo ZAH-vee-yay," blending the pronoun and verb together with a strong Z sound between them.
 Conjugate avoir as avaient (pronounced "AH-vay") to talk about how the group had something in the past.Blend the pronoun and the verb together with a Z sound when you speak. Make sure it's a hard Z sound that wouldn't be confused with an S.
Because so many conjugations of avoir are pronounced the same way (AH-vay), pay close attention to spelling when you are writing.

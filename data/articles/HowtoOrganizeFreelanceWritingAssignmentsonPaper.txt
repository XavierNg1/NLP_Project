 Write this amount at the top of a sheet of paper.;
, Include what the assignment pays and when it's due. Leave plenty of space between assignments.
 Examples of parts of a freelance writing assignment might include making an outline for the article, researching at the library or on the Internet, setting up an interview, writing interview questions, transcribing notes and then finally writing the article itself.


You may want to break down the payment for each assignment by the number of parts it has to give each part a dollar value.
 Figure how many days out of the month are available to accomplish all the tasks you intend to get done and divide the number of tasks by the number of days. For example, if you have 60 tasks to accomplish in February, and you want to have your weekends free, you need to average 3 tasks per day to get everything done.
 You can prioritize your freelance writing assignments by how soon they're due to be completed, how much you'll earn for completing them, how important the client is in terms of earning future assignments or some combination of those factors. Divide the tasks into highest priority (must get done today), medium priority (need to get done soon) and lowest priority (little things that can wait or can fill spare moments).
 Make this list on a separate sheet of paper, grouped by highest, medium and lowest priority. Generally, you want to do the highest priority items first, but if you want to reserve some of those tasks for the time of day in which you're best at that task (or when the people you need to contact are most likely available), you can. As you complete a task, check it off and move on to another.


If you get stuck on a task, focus on another task on the list instead, preferably one of the same level of priority or the next lowest level. If not, choose a task that will help stimulate your creativity to let you finish the task you got stuck on.

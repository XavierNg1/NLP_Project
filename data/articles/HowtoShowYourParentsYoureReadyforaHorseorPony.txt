 You can do this in many ways. For example, your could get a loan pony and make sure you go every day and do all the jobs required to care for the pony properly on your own, even turn down friend's houses and parties for the horse, the horse comes first!;
, This shows a lot of responsibility, doing such thing as washing up your plate every day and offering to help around the house, and pitching in and doing cleaning without having to be asked to do it. If you have younger siblings, offer to help out with them too.
 If you really are horse crazy, then volunteer at your local riding school and help out there on weekends to get some experience. After being there for a few weeks, you could ask them to talk to your parents about how you are ready for a horse and how good you are handling horses.
 Read lots of books and then talk to your mum about the horses and how you would be able to tell if there was a problem with a horse. Talk about the care needs and what sorts of things a horse needs to stay healthy.
 During this ride, you could show them how good you are at riding and even get them wanting a pony too! if that's not possible, then just ask them to come and watch your riding lesson and show them what you can do. Even just a video of you doing a canter, hopping a fence, or riding a dressage test would be enough for your parents to tell if you are at the right standard to buy a horse.
 Show that you are mature about this aspect and offer to contribute whatever you're able to. Offer to do odd jobs in return for feed payment and check out insurance options with respect to veterinary care, just in case this is needed.

 If your oven doesn't have a broiler, turn the oven to 400 degrees.
 Use oven-safe bowls or ramekins, since the final step is to place the bowls in the oven. If you don't have oven-safe bowls or ramekins, ladle the soup into a casserole dish.
 Slice the French or Italian bread and toast it in the toaster until it is well done. Distribute toast slices across the surface of the soup.
 Put an equal amount of cheese on each piece of bread. Add more or less cheese depending on your tastes.
 Place the bowls, ramekins or casserole dish in the oven. Broil the soup until the cheese on the bread has melted and started to bubble and brown. Remove the soup from the oven and serve hot.

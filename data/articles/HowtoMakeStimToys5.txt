 Have enough water to almost fill the jar, and enough food coloring and glitter to fill the water. Be prepared to use the stove, as well, since you need to boil the water.


You can also add some lightweight decorations, such as metallic confetti, to the glitter jar. This can add some extra sparkles when you shake the jar.
If you or the recipient has poor coordination, this may not be the best choice for a stim toy, as a glass jar will break if dropped, and the hot water required in the project may melt a plastic jar.
 You can do this using a pot or a teakettle.
 Use caution - use potholders or oven mitts when handling the pot or kettle, and keep a distance from the pot or kettle and the water so that you don't risk burning yourself or splashing hot water on you.
 When adding in the food coloring, take care that you add enough to get the color of water that you want.
 Grab the glitter and glitter glue, and add it into the hot water. Use a spoon to stir it thoroughly.
 If you're putting any other decorations (i.e small plastic toys, glow sticks, seashells, etc.) into your glitter jar, put them in the glitter water.
 Put extra force into making sure the lid is closed. You can also glue the lid shut if you don't plan on reopening the jar at any point.
 To stim with the toy, shake the jar and watch the glitter swirl around. It's a very calming visual effect used by many people!

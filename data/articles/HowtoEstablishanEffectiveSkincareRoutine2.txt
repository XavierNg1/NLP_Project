Foaming cleansers come in gel, pump, and cream form.Be careful only to wash your face twice a day. Washing too often can actually cause your skin to produce more oil and pimples.

Salicylic acid
Sulfur
Alpha hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid or lactic acid
Retinoid
Witch hazel

, Using a heavy moisturizer might make your skin even oiler. To combat this, use a water or gel-based moisturizer instead. These are moisturizers where water is listed as the first or second ingredient., Clay masks are great for people with oily skin. Smear them on your face after cleansing, and leave them on for fifteen to twenty minutes before rinsing off. Apply moisturizer afterwards., Touching your face can transfer bacteria and dirt from your hands to your face. These can cause pimples. If you must touch your face, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm first.Never pick, squeeze or pop your pimples. It hurts more, looks worse, and eventually may leave behind an ugly scar.

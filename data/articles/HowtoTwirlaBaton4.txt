 The execution of this common spin begins with a horizontal twirl.


Stand tall with your feet in a Right T.
Grasp the baton with your right handâ€”point your thumb towards the ball. Extend your right arm and position the baton so that it is parallel to the ground.
Rotate the baton counter clockwise. Keeping the shaft parallel to the ground, point the ball to the left. Turn the baton so that the ball points directly away from you and simultaneously bring the tip underneath your forearm. Point the ball to the right. While you rotate the ball towards yourself, bring the ball over your forearm. Complete the horizontal circle by rotating the ball to the left.Complete 3 to 4 horizontal spins.
 Throughout the horizontal twirl, the turn of your wrist causes your palm to face up and down. When the ball points left your palm is down; when the ball points right, your palm is up. Just before the ball points to the right, open your hand to create a flat, steady surface. The baton will continue to spin in a counterclockwise circle on the top of your palm and fingers.


Keep your fingers flat and out of the way.
As the baton slows, subtly move your palm as though it were a teeter-totter.
 When the ball is just about to point to the right, close your hand around the baton. Secure the baton between your thumb and index finger. Complete another series of horizontal twirls.Try the Palm Spin with your left hand!

 Try to get something that matches the theme if there is one. Don't go all out and wear weird clothes you normally wouldn't wear. It's all about being you, matching, and having fun. Don't go in baggy sweatpants, but don't buy a mini-prom dress and throw on a pair of stilettos. Be comfy, but don't wear old dirty and ripped clothes.;

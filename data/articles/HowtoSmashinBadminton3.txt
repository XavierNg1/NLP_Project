 The backhand smash is an advanced, offensive strike that is one of the most difficult shots to return.The backhand smash is ideal for returns that send the shuttle high but relatively short. This shot gives your opponent little chance to react.Because this stroke is a little more difficult, make sure you’ve gotten the hang of the backhand stroke before attempting it.
To perform a backhand smash, it’s especially important to be able to switch to a backhand grip quickly and naturally., Get underneath and slightly behind the shuttle, as you would normally. Switch to a backhand grip and point your body at the back of the court.The faster you are able to switch your grip, the more power this smash will have.

Opposite of most other smashes in badminton, to get the most devastating smash, you’ll need your racket arm as close to your body as possible.
Much like other smashes, your non-racket arm should act as a counterbalance for your racket arm throughout this stroke., This should be a smooth, complete motion that extends through the point of contact until your arm is roughly straight. Upon contact, snap your wrist quickly in a flicking motion. Avoid gripping your racket too tightly for the best control.

As your racket approaches the shuttle, imagine the angle that will take it over the net with as little clearance as possible.
It’s very easy to lose your balance when performing the backhand smash. Remember to use your non-racket arm to stabilize yourself.

 This may include sophisticated pencil skirts, cowl neck sweaters, scoop-necked tops, and cashmere cardigans. You don't want to wear the same thing everyday, so make sure you have at least three bottoms (preferably skirts if you're a woman) and four or more tops.;
, Having an appropriate apparel selection doesn't have to cost you a fortune. Look in stores such as Sears, the Bay, and Winners. If you have the money to spend, look in stores such as Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue, Holt Renfrew, Neiman Marcus, Barneys, etc.
 If you're not expected to be running up and down staircases all day or teaching a gym class, feel free to wear them. But if you are, be prepared to have your heels snap or your feet ache.
 Having a large selection of suits available saves a lot in the long run. Ideally, one very nice, expensive suit and two cheaper, not-so-nice suits is perfect. Don't spend all your money on suits, and don't wear suits everyday -- wear suits to important meetings and interviews.
 Even if Fridays are "Dress Down Days", don't take advantage of said day. Taking advantage only makes you look sloppy and tacky. If you must, dress down by toning down the makeup and removing your pearl necklace, but don't go overboard by wearing light-wash, torn jeans and a tank.

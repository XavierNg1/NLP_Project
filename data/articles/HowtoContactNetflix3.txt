 If you're a member of the Twitterati, you may find that tweeting Netflix directly is the best way to get the answers you seek.


For customer support, use the Twitter handle @Netflixhelps. A Netflix staffer will be available to respond to your tweets from 6:00am to 9:00pm everyday, Pacific Standard Time.
For more general Netflix news and chats, you can use the Twitter handles @netflix for the U.S., @NetflixLAT for Latin America, @NetflixUK for the UK and Ireland, @NetflixBrasil for Brazil and @Netflix_CA for Canada.
 If you want, you can "like" the official Netflix page on Facebook.


You will not be able to send the company direct messages through this page, but you will be able to post comments on the company's updates.
Netflix are actually pretty good at replying to relevant questions such as "When will the new season of Dexter be available?" and providing information on upcoming releases, so contacting them this way is good for more casual queries.

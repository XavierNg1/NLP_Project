 Items such as coffee cups, cereal bowls, and lids from coffee cans or oatmeal containers work well as circle patterns.


If you can't find anything the right size, cut out your own paper circles using a compass and scissors.
 If you're using thick paint and want to go for a textured effect, dip the circular object directly in the paint and place it against the canvas.


Using a glass rim allows you to paint a thin circular line, instead of a solid circle.
 Place the object on a blank sheet of heavy-duty paper and trace around it. Cut this circle out carefully with a sharp pair of scissors, and you'll be left with a stencil.


Alternatively, use a drawing compass to create a circle of any size.
 This may sound strange, but a fresh piece of tape can damage your paper or canvas. First, stick a couple pieces of tape to a pair of jeans, then peel them off. Repeat several times until the tape is only barely sticky.


Other fabric works as well, but jeans are best.
 Place the paper stencil over your artwork, so the circular hole is exactly where you want to paint. Fasten the stencil using the special pieces of tape.
 Apply the paint with a large brush, using thin, even strokes and avoiding drips or spills. You may want to use a thinner brush for the outer rim of the circle.


Before you move on, step back a few steps to get a better view. Touch up the circle if you want more even coverage or a different brush stroke pattern.
 Slowly lift the tape to reduce the chance of tearing the tape or picking up paint. You can reuse this stencil, but you may need to prepare more "special tape."

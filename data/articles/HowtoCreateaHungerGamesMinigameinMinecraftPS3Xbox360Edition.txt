 For example, a desert offers no food and no shelter, so it would be a very quick game. However, if you have a jungle, players have loads of food and tons of hiding spots.;
, Also very important: a spawn point. To do this, place a couple of beds and have your "tributes" sleep in them. Bear in mind that you have to do this at night. Bonus: have a "Cornucopia" like they have in the book with chests with supplies in them.
 Make sure host privileges are on and make sure players cannot break or place blocks. Create boundaries, too. It does not matter what material they are made of, whatever looks cool. Make sure that they are high enough so that you can't jump off of a tree and escape to the other side.
 They won't be allowed to break anything, so they can't make their own tools or weapons. Make sure the weapons aren't too powerful. Iron swords and/or a bow and 64 arrows will do just fine.
 Change to survival. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor!

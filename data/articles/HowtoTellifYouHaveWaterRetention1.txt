 Have you suddenly gained a significant amount of weight â€” like more than five pounds in one day? While overeating and lack of exercise can produce weight gain over time, gaining several pounds overnight is a sure sign of water retention.


Check your weight at various times of day, keeping a record over a period of several days. If your weight fluctuates significantly over the course of one or a few days, these fluctuations are more likely due to water retention than to actual weight gain.Remember that for women, the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle can significantly impact water retention. If your waist has swollen a few days before your period, it's highly likely this swelling will disappear within a day or two of starting your cycle. Reevaluate toward the end of your period.;
, If you are normally a slim person, do you see less muscle definition? This is an additional sign of fluid accumulation., Remember that weight loss takes time; you will need to give this process several weeks. Trimming your caloric intake and upping your activity level should produce at least some weight loss; if it doesn't, water retention is a likely culprit.

 Quartz countertops look very similar to granite countertops. They're less prone to damage and may be cheaper and easier to install. If a granite countertop is out of your budget, look into the cost of installing a quartz countertop., Marble is a lot softer than granite, so it's less prone to scratches. This can allow you to save on costs of repairs longterm. Marble, however, does not look as similar to granite as some other options., Recycled glass is a cheaper option, and has a somewhat similar pattern to granite. If you have your heart set on a granite countertop, you can try recycled glass instead. Talk to a local contractor, or make a stop at your local hardware store, and see how much a recycled glass countertop would cost., If you love the look of granite, but a full granite installation is out of your budget, think about installing granite in key areas. You could, for example, have a granite kitchen island with laminate kitchen counters. This could save you some money while allowing you to have some attractive granite in your kitchen.
 If a granite countertop is not in your budget, go for a laminate countertop with a granite design. You can choose from among many laminate countertops with patterns similar to granite, allowing you to create the look of granite for less. This will also save you the effort of painting a laminate countertop yourself.

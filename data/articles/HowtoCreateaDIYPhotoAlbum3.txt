 Have at least 10 printed wallet size photos, 10 blank 3x5 index cards, a ribbon or binding material, a felt tip pen marker, and a hole puncher., Turn the blank index card so that it is on its longest side in landscape position.


The wallet sized photos will be placed portrait style on the cards.
Stick the photo to the right sides of your blank index cards.
 Use this space to write about the people in the photo, the date of the event, or just a title for the photo.
 Decorate the front with markers or keep the look sleek and clean by placing a simple monogram on it by using stencils for lettering.
 Place the hole at about Â½ an inch from the very bottom and very top of the book. Through those holes, thread a ribbon and tie it into a bow.

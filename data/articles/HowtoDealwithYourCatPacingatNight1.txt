 If your cat is pacing at night, the first step is to seek the advice of your vet. Your catâ€™s nighttime behavior could be the result of medical discomfort, so it is important to rule out significant health problems first., If your cat is not experiencing health problems, the night pacing is best treated with additional activity and stimulation. Make active playtime part of your before-bed routine. Aim to play with your cat for 30 minutes before you go to bed each night.You might try:

Dangling some string.
Tossing jingly balls for your cat to chase.
Dragging a ribbon on the floor.
 Another way to stimulate your cat and encourage restful nights is to alter your feeding schedule. Try feeding your cat their main meal within one hour of your bedtime. If your cat has a full belly, they may be more likely to rest well during the night.

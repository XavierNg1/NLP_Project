 Dry skin is often characterized as skin that has small pores, feels tight, and has a dull and rough complexion. You will also know if you have dry skin if your skin becomes very dry and even flakey during the winter months. This skin type is also prone to cracking, peeling, irritation, redness/dry patches, and itchiness., Oily skin is often characterized as skin that has enlarged pores, looks shiny from excess oil, and, when blotted with a tissue, significant oil residue is visible., Combination skin is a little more complicated because, as the name suggests, you tend to have both oily and dry or normal skin. Combination skin is often characterized as skin that has larger pores and more oil in the T-zone area, i.e., your forehead, nose, and chin. However, the other areas of your skin, like your cheeks and the sides of your face, have smaller pores and less oil., Sensitive skin is often characterized as skin that is easily irritated. Sensitive skin can become irritated from beauty products, being touched, hot water, alcohol consumption, or spicy foods. Because many things can irritate this skin type, redness, itching, and burning are characteristic of this skin type.

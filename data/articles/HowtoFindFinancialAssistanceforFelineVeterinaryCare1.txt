 If you’ve kept up with your veterinary expenses but are facing an unexpected cost, your vet may work with you to make your expenses more manageable. For instance, you may be able to pay off a large bill over the course of a few months.A vet who has cared for your cat before is more likely to offer this option.
It may help to propose a plan that would work best for you. For instance, ask “Would it be possible to make three monthly payments to cover this expense?”;
, In some cases, your vet may be willing to waive charges if you can perform services for their business in exchange. For instance, you may be able to walk dogs or clean kennels for a certain numbers of hours to cover a procedure you cannot afford.If you have a particular skill that may benefit your vet’s business, offer a specific exchange. For instance, if you are a web designer, offer to update their website.
 Getting a second opinion is often worthwhile, especially if your vet is unwilling to help you pay for the care your cat needs. While switching vets means you may have to pay an initial consultation fee, you may be able to find a vet that offers care at lower costs, or that recommends a less expensive form of care.Ask friends that have pets if they have a vet they'd recommend, and read online reviews of the vets in your area.
Call around and ask for quotes from a few different veterinary offices for an expensive treatment.
Consider going to a vet in a rural area. Often, vets in smaller towns charge less than vets in urban areas.

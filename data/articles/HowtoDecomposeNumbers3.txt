 You can combine both decomposition methods to break these types of equations apart into different forms.


This is easiest when used for simple addition equations, but it becomes less practical when used for long equations.
 Look at the equation and separate the numbers into separate "tens" and "ones" places. If necessary, you can further separate the "ones" by decomposing them into smaller chunks.



Example: Decompose and solve the equation: 31 + 84

You can decompose 31 into: 30 + 1
You can decompose 84 into: 80 + 4



, The equation can be rewritten so that each decomposed component stands separately, or you can combine certain decomposed components to help you make better sense of the equation as a whole.



Example: 31 + 84 = 30 + 1 + 80 + 4 = 30 + 80 + 5 = 100 + 10 + 5

, After rewriting the equation into a form that makes more sense to you, all you need to do is add up the numbers and find the sum.



Example: 100 + 10 + 5 = 115

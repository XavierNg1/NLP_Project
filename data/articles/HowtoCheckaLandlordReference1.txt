 As you are considering an apartment, ask the landlord if you can speak with the current tenant. If the tenant has already moved out, ask the landlord for a forwarding address or telephone number. It is helpful if you can ask the tenant about the apartment as well as some things about the landlord.Asking the prior tenant of the exact apartment you are considering will let you ask about the following topics:


the condition of the apartment
any problems with plumbing, heat or other utilities
the landlord’s responsiveness to any problems
noise or traffic problems;
, If you are renting a stand-alone house, this will not apply. But if you are considering an apartment in a large complex or apartment building, you should try to speak with other random tenants. Go to the building/complex toward the end of the day, and you should be able to meet people on their way home from work. Ask about their satisfaction in the building and their happiness with the landlord. Ask how long they have lived in the same place. (Tenants who stay for more than the first year’s lease are a good sign.), Go beyond the immediate apartment building and talk with people who live in the same area. Walk down the block at various times of the day, or over the weekend. Get a feel for the kind of activity that goes on. Talk to neighbors about the landlord. Ask them about the kind of people who live in the apartments there (whether they are friendly, busy, quiet, noisy, etc.). Try to find out about the stability of the neighborhood, which is an indication of the level of satisfaction with the landlord.

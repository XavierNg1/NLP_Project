 This second approach to folding a pizza is slightly different from the first approach, but the objective is still the same: to eat a folded pizza.
 If you want you can even give it an extra fold, so it's more like a pizza cylinder than a slice. Proceed by eating the folded pizza as you would eat a sandwich.

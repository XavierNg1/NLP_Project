 The top of the head should be facing down on the cutting board, and the stem of the lettuce will be facing up toward you. If you prefer your lettuce shredded finely, this can be easily done with any sharp chef's knife.
 Set your knife on the edge of the head and slice straight through it, to create thin slices. Cut the lettuce carefully, using long, firm strokes.
 Continue slicing until you reach the pale center of the head of lettuce. Stop slicing when you reach the core of the lettuce.
 Turn the head around and continue slicing on the other side until you reach the core. Stop cutting when you reach the core of the lettuce head.
 Lay the head of lettuce on its side and slice the top of the lettuce from the core, using a sharp chef's knife. Slice off any remaining green leaves, then remove the pale center of the lettuce and discard it.
 Take the pieces of lettuce that you just sliced, and fan them out on the cutting board. Spread the slices out so that they cover the entire surface of the board.
 Use a sharp chef's knife to cut through the lettuce in close rows, moving from left to right across the board. You now have a pile of lettuce strips.
 Turn the cutting board 90 degrees and cut through the lettuce in close rows from the new direction. This will result in a pile of small pieces of lettuce, like the leaves in a chopped salad.
 If you want even smaller pieces, turn the cutting board 90 degrees and slice through the pieces again. Continue turning and slicing the lettuce until it is as finely shredded and diced as you like.

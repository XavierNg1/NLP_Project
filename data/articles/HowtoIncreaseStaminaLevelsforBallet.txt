 Especially if it is warm, water is crucial for building stamina. Bring a bottle of water and maybe an energy drink and refill it during breaks. Ice is an idea if you know the weather is hot-warm water is not pleasant! Alternatively, ask if your dance school or theatre has a fridge you can keep your spare bottles in. If the answer is yes, name your bottle! Lots of people will take advantage of the fridge.;
, If it's going to be hot, packing a sweatshirt and a coat is unnecessary. If the weather's gonna be so-so, arriving in a vest top and shorts with just a leotard on underneath is plain stupid. Use common sense!

, Put on the air conditioning and open a window if it is too warm, if it's too cold turn up the heating. Don't be afraid to ask whoever owns the studio\dance school if they can change the temperature, most probably they'll agree.
 If you are male and is at the stage where you're lifting girls, exercise your arms and legs. If you are female and is at the stage where you're en pointe, keep your ankles strong.
 Nibbling on a lettuce leaf when everyone else is enjoying steak and chips will not particularly help you. Yes, watch your figure, but cutting out carbs and sweets is not right. On the other hand, if all you eat is chocolate, chips and burgers, something needs to change. Salad or veg is right for every meal (except breakfast, obviously) and balance out the chocolate mousse for pudding with an apple in it. A balanced diet is key.
 On the days you are not at a ballet lesson, build stamina by working through your syllabus each day, doing a set amount of jumps or a set amount of releves. Don't work too hard though, listen to your body.
 Even if it means skipping a ballet lesson or staying home from a party, do it. Rest is way more important than doing a hundred releves each day! If you really want to make it, get around eight hours of sleep each night. Of course, different bodies require different amounts of rest.

 Farms often attract starlings, but the birds can eat your livestock feed and spread disease to your animals. Using feed and feeding methods that do not attract starlings can help keep the birds off of your farm.


Provide either granular feed or large pellets (at least 0.5 inch in size) that are more difficult for starlings to eat.
Do not put animal feed directly on the ground.
Use bird-proof feeders. Many of these will make “clanging” noises periodically or have covers that birds cannot penetrate.
Feed animals in a covered area, such as a barn.
Feed animals in the evening or after dark.;
, If you use bird feeders to attract songbirds to your yard, you may be annoyed by starlings eating all of your bird feed and scaring off other birds.Place wide netting or a cage around feeders. Smaller songbirds will be able to penetrate the holes, but starlings will not.
Cut perches very short so that only smaller birds can perch on your feeders.
Try a feeder that requires birds to feed upside down: starlings do not like to eat upside down.
Do not put birdseed directly on the ground.
 Standing water should be drained or limited to depths containers in which the water level is at least six inches below the edge of the container and the depth of the water is at least three inches., Different types of spray that are safe for humans are available. This is a particularly good option if you have a crop that starlings like to eat, like grapes or berries.


Try spraying methyl anthranilate, a grape flavoring, on food sources.
Garlic oil may also deter starlings. Applying it to bird seed “bait” or spraying it on or around potential food sources may encourage them to relocate.

 Spin the wheel. If it wobbles or fails to spin freely, you may need to true the wheel. This can be difficult if you haven't done it before, but a bike shop will usually true your wheels for cheap.
 Squeeze the brake handles and make sure the cable moves. If it does not, your cable may be stuck in the cable housing, or the clamp in the handle may be loose.
 If you have caliper brakes, have a friend operate the brakes while you watch the caliper. If the brake cable moves but the end of the caliper does not, the cable may be broken inside the cable housing. The whole cable assembly will have to be replaced.

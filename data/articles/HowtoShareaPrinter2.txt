 In order to share a printer, it must be installed on the computer it is connected to. Most modern printers connect via USB and will install automatically when they are connected.
 You can access the Control Panel in Windows Vista by clicking the Start menu and selecting Control Panel.
 If your Control Panel is in Category view, click "Network and Internet", and then select "Network and Sharing Center".Click on "Network and Internet". If your Control Panel is in Icon view, click the "Network and Sharing Center" icon.
 Expand the "Printer Sharing" field and toggle printer sharing on. You can decide whether or not you want to enable password protection for your printer. If it is turned on, only users who have a user account on your computer will be able to access the printer.
 Now that file and printer sharing has been turned on, you will need to share the printer itself. To do this, go back to the Control Panel and open the Devices and Printers option. Right-click on the printer you want to share and click "Printer properties". Click the Sharing tab, and then check the "Share this printer" box.

 If you are an organized person, you might feel more comfortable by grouping your books based on category. Try devoting one shelf to each category. Here are some ideas:


Fiction
Non-Fiction, including dictionaries, research and reference materials, and textbooks.
Magazines

, You can alphabetize your books based on title, or on the author's last name. This will also make your books much easier to find.
 If you are more of a visual person, then consider organizing your books based on the color of the spine. Put all of the books with red spines together, and all of the books with blue spines together. Try to keep all of the warm colors (red, orange, and yellow) on one shelf, and all of the cool colors (green, blue, and purple) on another shelf., Books don't all have to be placed on the shelf in the traditional manner; you can also stack some books on top of each other creating small piles. This will help add some visual interest to your shelf and move the eye around., This will make your shelf appear more stable. If you keep other items on your shelves, consider grouping them the same way: larger items on the lower shelves and smaller items on the upper ones., Magazines are very floppy and flexible, and they don't stand up well on their own. Folders and baskets will keep them all together while adding visual interest to your bookshelf.
 If you have a gap between the last book and the wall of the shelf, try leaning that last book against the rest of the books. This will fill in the empty space without adding bulk. The sudden angle will also help keep the eye moving around.

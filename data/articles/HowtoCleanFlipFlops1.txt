 Choose a slightly-used sponge â€“ not the one you're going to use on your dishes. Soak the sponge in hot water, along with a bit of dish soap. Rub the flip flops vigorously to remove any grime or mud. If it's hard to remove: put on some gloves, and use a thin towel or napkin to help you get the mud off., If the flip flops are scratched or dented, you can mask the blemishes with shoeshine. If you find a product that is made for the material of your flip flops, you should be able to hide most of the damage. Try different shine products in order to see which you like best.


If you don't want to buy shoeshine, try learning to spit shine shoes.
 Find an old toothbrush, or a buy a very cheap new brush. Wet the toothbrush, then grind the bristles into a bar of soap. Then, start scrubbing away at your shoes. Make sure to get into all of the cracks!The toothbrush tactic works best on fuzzy flip flops. The bristles can work between the fuzz in a way that other cleaning products cannot.
 First, soak an old towel or dishrag in hot water. Use a bit of soap, if you like, although this is not necessary. Wipe the dirtiest spots with the towel, and remove as much as you can.

,, Take the icon over your image and see how large the brush is.
 The way the brush works is to remove pieces of the background within the brush circle that are the same (or similar) color as where the cursor is. Be sure that if parts of the image are of a similar color to the background to go around them.
, Change the brush size to an appropriate size for your image and start removing the remnants. Reduce the size increasingly as you clear more and more of the background.



One way you can do this is add another layer and fill it with black.
Move that layer beneath your image that you are removing the background from. If there is anything left, it should show now. You might also try another color if black doesn't work for another image.
 You will want to have a copy of your work before you do anything else with it.

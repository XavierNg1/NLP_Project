 In order to play this role, you will want to learn the environment and flank the enemy. You should not be near the main force but be flanking the sides.. Typically you will want cover like in the woods along a creek. You will want to stay out of open areas. After you have looked over your map (obtaining a map is easy, look at the field's website to see if they offer one or type in the location on Google Earth and print out the satellite view), you will want to get a few people in your squad (3-5 people will be good). If you have your own squad then that is even better.;
, Watch your footsteps, communications, and after every 5-10 steps stop and scan for enemies. Constantly be aware of your surrounding so you know what cover to go to in case of an ambush.
 If you have any type of communication with main force (through radio, phone, etc), let them know the position your about to assault so they do not fire upon you.

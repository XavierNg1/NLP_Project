, Redcurrants like mild sun. If you have fierce, hot sun, ensure that the afternoon positioning is dappled with shade.
 Till over the soil and add some fertilizer. Dig a hole in readiness for planting the redcurrant bush.
 Gently tease out the roots across the soil of the whole. Place well-conditioned soil over the top, and firm.


Given that redcurrants grow erect, they don't need support structures.






Space plants 120cm (3 to 4 feet) apart in rows.
 Redcurrants have a high need for potassium, so be sure to use fertilizer well endowed with potassium, such as seaweed fertilizers. Don't drown the roots; just keep them damp.


Water well until fruiting, then water less regularly to prepare the bush for winter.
Redcurrants appreciate mulching. The mulch helps to suppress weeds and improves water retention. It will also rot down to provide humus and improve the soil.
 Wait until you have large, firm red berries forming around mid-summer. Cut the whole bunch.
 If you have a free-standing redcurrant, prune it to form a strong, cup-shaped bush. Cut back the main branches about a third in the first winter's pruning. Remove any dead or damaged wood.


After the fruiting season ends, prune back the side shoots to five leaf nodes each.
Bear in mind that redcurrants fruit on the short spurs along older wood. Don't remove the older canes each year; instead, cut t them back like you would do with a rose bush.

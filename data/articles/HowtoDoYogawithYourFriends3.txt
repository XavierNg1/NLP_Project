 One way to make joining a class together easier is to pick someone who has a similar personality and who's hoping to get similar things from a yoga class. That way, you'll have an easier time agreeing on which class is best to take.However, having a similar personality isn't the only way to choose a yoga partner. You can also choose by who has similar exercise goals or pick someone who can get you excited about yoga and vice versa.
 Many gyms offer yoga classes, but you'll also find studios that are exclusively for yoga. Some yoga classes are even offered in places like parks or art museums. Check with your local gyms and yoga studios, and watch community boards to find places that offer classes.
 Even if you do find a friend with a similar personality, you're probably still going to need to make some compromises on what type of class you join together. Maybe they prefer a class with hip-hop music, and you like a quieter venue. Perhaps you can switch off. Alternatively, if you're not into the philosophical side of yoga and they prefers an instructor who focuses on that, just learn to tune out what you don't need.You may also need to compromise on time and location.
 One of the benefits of joining with a friend is you can be each other's accountability partners. That is, if you don't show up to class, your friend will notice. In fact, you can have a deal to check up on each other when either one of you doesn't show., If you're both new to yoga, you may find the practice harder than expected. However, don't be too quick to give it up. You'll likely find that you adapt quickly. Plus, you'll begin to notice changes in your body, such as becoming more flexible.

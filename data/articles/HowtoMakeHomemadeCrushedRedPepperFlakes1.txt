 With a whole family of peppers you can pick, base your decision on how hot of a pepper you can handle. Pepper hotness is measured by Scoville units--the higher the Scoville unit, the hotter the pepper. For example, a sweet bell pepper has zero Scoville units whereas the mighty Habanero pepper ranges from 100,000 to 350,000. The hottest pepper on the scale is the Trinidad Scorpion Butch at 1,463,700.


Assess your overall needs. If you're creating the crushed pepper for home use and you like them hot, go for the hottest pepper you can find. However, if you're giving the flakes to friends, you may want to go with something a little tamer.






Test the pepper before you make the crushed flake batch. What may be considered to be hot to some may not be to others. Or, you may not like the taste of certain peppers.

 Although the easiest way is to dry the peppers in the oven, you could also sun dry them, especially if you live in an arid climate.
 Then, slice the peppers by simply splitting them in half. Don't remove the seeds.
 Line the peppers side by side and avoid clumping them together; otherwise, they wonâ€™t dry properly.
 To be sure they get enough time to dry, set a timer. Once six hours have passed by, turn off the oven and allow the dried peppers to remain in the oven overnight, so they will continue to dry and dehydrate.
 The next day, place the dried peppers in a food processor or crush them by hand. Only crush peppers by hand if you're wearing gloves and you're crushing the peppers while they're inside a plastic bag. Otherwise, stick with the food processor.
 Serve the crushed peppers in a food shaker such as a pepper shaker.

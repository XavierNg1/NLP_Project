 Sometimes when you're writing a date, you also want to include the day of the week that date falls on. As with the months of the year, the days of the week are not capitalized in Spanish as they are in English.Sunday is domingo.
Monday is lunes.
Tuesday is martes.
Wednesday is miércoles.
Thursday is jueves.
Friday is viernes.
Saturday is sábado.
 When you're writing about a particular date, or especially about several dates, you may find it more convenient to use other words such as "today" or "tomorrow." These words make your writing seem more natural and easy to understand.For "today," write "hoy." Yesterday is ayer, while "tomorrow" in Spanish is "mañana."
The word for "week" in Spanish is "semana." If you want to write "the weekend," you would write "el fin de semana." Refer to "this week" as "esta semana" and "last week" as "la semana pasada." If you want to write about "next week," use the phrase "la semana que viene," which literally translated means "the week that comes."

, When you're writing about a date, you also might find it relevant to talk about the season in which that date falls. Keep in mind that south of the equator, the seasons are the opposite of those north of the equator.Write "la primavera" to refer to spring.
Use "el verano" to write about the summer.
Write "el otoño" when writing about autumn.
Use "el invierno" when you're writing about winter.
 The question "¿Cuál es la fecha de hoy?" is used when you need to know what the date is. For example, if you were writing a story in Spanish, you might need to have a character ask the date.You can also ask "¿Qué día es hoy?" You typically use this question, which means "what day is today?", when you want to know what day of the week it is. But it also can be used in some circumstances to ask for the date, similarly to English.

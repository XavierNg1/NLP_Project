, Look closely. Do you see any bubbles forming on the shell? To see the best reaction place your face above the egg.
 Carefully pour the old vinegar down the drain and cover the egg with fresh vinegar. But remember, use a strainer to catch the egg so it does not fall down the drain. Place the glass with the vinegar and egg in a safe place for 1 day- Don't disturb the egg, but pay close attention the bubbles forming on the surface of the shell (or what's left of it).
 The egg now looks translucent because the outside shell is gone! The only thing that remains is the delicate membrane of the egg!

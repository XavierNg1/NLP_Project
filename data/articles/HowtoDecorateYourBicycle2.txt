 Outdoor-use stickers, such as those designed for bikes or skateboards, are a great way to personalize your bike and come in many different designs and colors. Although you can use regular stickers, dirt and moisture will quickly break them down.To make sure your sticker will be placed the way you want it to be, consider marking where you’d like it with a pencil before application.
Many skate and bike shops sell these stickers, but you can also find them online through popular vendors such as Amazon, and online bike specialty stores.
 Instead of placing a few stickers on the sissy bar, get creative! Decorate your handlebars, handle grips, and even your spokes with stickers.If you don’t like the color of your bike, you can cover the frame entirely with overlapping stickers.
If you are a fan of patterns, you can place stickers at predetermined spots throughout the frame of your bike to create patterns.
 Get creative with the themes and colors of your stickers. Pair cartoon characters with earthy tones, and combine characters from your childhood with brand stickers. Pairing standard-use stickers with outdoor-use stickers could help the standard stickers last longer.

When choosing sticker pairs, opt for things you love. If you are a fan of both Hello Kitty and the Simpsons, for instance, you could create a small scene with these characters.
 Using washi tape or other stickers, layer to completely cover up your bike frame instead of painting it another color.To help your washi tape last longer, apply a coat of polyurethane or other sealant. This will ward against weather damage and peeling.
If washi tape is too expensive to cover your bike completely, you can also use patterned  duct tape. There are countless patterns and colors to choose from.

 You want to be the last one standing. When you touch a circle, do not over-reach; you never know how long you will have to wait before moving a given body part, so make sure that you are comfortable in your pose.


Keep your legs planted firmly, if possible, and do not spread them too widely.
Stay close to your center of mass. Do not lean too far in any direction; make your movements close to your torso, and assess your balance before you definitively place your hand onto a spot.
 When you place your hand or foot on a color, choose the circle that is closest to your opponent. Over time, this will reduce the number of circles that he can easily reach.









Be careful not to physically push another player off the mat. Use the space that your body takes up to block your opponent's own movements.
 If you can take up a lot of space, retain your balance, and outlast the other players, you may be able to keep the game going until everyone else loses their balance.









Be patient, be a good sport, and have fun. Twister doesn't need to be about winning--it can be a great opportunity to laugh at yourself!

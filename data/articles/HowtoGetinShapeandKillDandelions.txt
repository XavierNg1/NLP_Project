 You want a long slender tool with two prongs on it. Failing that, use a long, slender but sturdy, screwdriver. Just be aware that it won't be as efficient.;
, You want clothes that you aren't afraid to get dirty, but are comfortable and non-restrictive.
, It's good to pick one that has a lot of dandelions to start with, so you can get a good idea of what the finished product will look like, quicker.
 You will be moving your legs back and forth looking for new dandelions to kill and this is part of the exercising.
 You may need to move it around until you find the root that you are trying to cut in half.
 If it resists, take the tool to it again, until you find the root that needs to be cut.
 Turn from left to right, alternating your hands while using the tool.
 Stretching is very good for you.
, Once you have done that, grab a handful of dandelions and see what comes up. If nothing does, do it some more. Once you have cleared away the main ones, the others will be easier to get out. Tugging on the dandelions is also a good strength and arm builder.

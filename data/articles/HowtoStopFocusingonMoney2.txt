 There are many living creatures in your life that can help you become more mindful. Children and pets, particularly, are often able to help people focus their thoughts, become more aware of themselves, and live in the moment.For instance, you might nuzzle your cat. Feel its fur against your hand or face. Listen to its heartbeat or its gentle purring. Notice the way each strand of fur pushes against your hand as you stroke it.
Spending time with your child or pet can help you discover life’s simple joys and stop focusing on money.
 Exercise for at least 2.5 hours each week. When exercising, feel each movement of your body and lose yourself in the action of swimming, biking, or running. Exercising can help you reduce stress, help you have a more positive outlook, and remove or reduce your focus on money.Be gentle with yourself. Do not push yourself beyond what you are capable of.
 Being outdoors, in general, can keep you from focusing on money. Instead, you’ll be focusing on the grandeur of the great outdoors. For instance, you might enjoy taking your dog to the park. Some people enjoy canoeing on lakes and rivers. Others enjoy hiking in the mountains. At the very least, visit your city park., Spend time attuning each of your five senses as you walk. Start with your eyes. Look closely at each leaf, rock, and root, appreciating the complexity of their design. Then, feel the wind on your hair and face. If you brush branches aside to walk your path, gently rub them, enjoying the texture.Feel the forward movement of your body as you set one foot in front of the other.
Listen to the sound of birds and other woodland creatures, as well as your own rhythmic inhalation and exhalation as you walk.

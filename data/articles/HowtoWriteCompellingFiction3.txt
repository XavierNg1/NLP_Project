 Create the setting, introduce the main characters, and introduce the conflict. Remember that the setting sets the mood for the story, so think carefully about what you want to use.
 All characters should be introduced in the first third of the book.
 What happens to create further conflict? Maybe the main character runs into obstacles, such as not being able to see his significant other for various reasons. Maybe another person enters the relationship, creating a love triangle. How do other characters help or hurt the main character’s journey?

, Is she taking a trip to figure things out? Is she trying to get in contact with her significant other? Is she searching for clues to solve a murder mystery?

, The story should be mainly action or dialogue, for the most part. The setting is important, but it can drag down the story if you include too much about it in your writing.
 Decide how you will transition to it. The conflict should be coming to a head; that is, it is moving to the forefront of the novel.


Maybe the protagonist has to choose between staying with her significant other or moving on to start a new life for herself because her significant other has set an ultimatum.
Maybe the protagonist is on a high speed chase trying to catch a murderer.
 The resolution is how the conflict is resolved. The story doesn’t need to have all the loose ends tied up (some writers like leaving a bit of ambiguity), but you do need to have some resolution by the end of the story.
 Look for typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentences. Also look for plot holes (places where there are mistakes in the plot), awkward transitions, and boring parts. Try to fix as much as you can.
 Ask for feedback, and take it to heart. If several people say one part is boring, you may need to cut it, even if it’s your favorite part.


Of course, in the end, it’s your decision, but usually, if several people say something is wrong, you need to do something to fix it.

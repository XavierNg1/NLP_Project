 You are the keeper of your own mind. Don't let one person's opinion get you down. It's just one person saying something silly! Say to yourself: "I'm confident."


It's hard work, but changing the voices in your head is a big step in feeling good. Think about what you think. Try to purposefully change the train of thought so you don't validate the attacker's ideas. Practice reciting positive statements like "I am successful" or "I am happy."
Tell yourself you are ok how you are!

, Tell the attacker he or she is being rude. Sometimes keeping it straight is the best approach. Some people make comments without realizing how inappropriate hey are. An objective comment on the person's hurtful words might even open the other person's eyes. You will feel like the better person when you stand up for yourself.


For example, you may want to say "That wasn't a very nice thing to say."

, It doesn't take a lot to come up with nasty words. Just remember you are being the mature person. Stand tall.


Adults shouldn't be making insults to their friends, family or co-workers.

 As mentioned in the first method, it is always best to use the accessories that came in the package with your Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone.


This second method applies to those times when you don’t have an adapter with you.
 If you’re using a laptop, it would be best if it is plugged into an outlet. Connecting it to a power supply ensures that it has enough battery itself to charge your Galaxy Note.


The computer needs to be kept on during the charging process. Also, it should not be in stand-by, asleep, or hibernation mode during charging.
 Attach the USB cord that’s specifically compatible with Samsung Galaxy Note to an open USB port on your PC or laptop.


If you’re using a PC, the USB port can be found in front or at the back of the CPU.
If you’re charging with a laptop, the USB ports are usually at the sides.
Double-check the battery indicator on the Note to make sure it is charging.
 There’s no sense in keeping it plugged in longer than necessary as it can be harmful to your smartphone’s battery by shortening its life.

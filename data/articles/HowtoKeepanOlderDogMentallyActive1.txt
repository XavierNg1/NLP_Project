 Dogs that are left alone all the time will not be able to stay mentally healthy. A dog that does not have a lot of social interaction can lose its mental acuity because it doesn't exercise its brain. Dogs are meant to have social interaction, as they are pack animals, and they need it to avoid becoming sad, lonely, and destructive.Interaction can come in a lot of forms. It could mean taking your dog for a walk, playing catch, or simply giving it love and attention.
The interaction doesn't have to always come from you. If you know you are going to be gone all day, for example, you can take your dog to a doggy daycare. This will give your dog lots of interaction.
Some dogs benefit from living in a household with multiple dogs. Having more than one dog at home can give your dog lots of positive interaction while you are away.;

Even common games, such as tug-o-war or catch, can give it a lot of stimulation and keep it mentally active.

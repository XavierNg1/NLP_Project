 Consistency is key when it comes to building a successful fitness routine. If you’re like most people, your chances of remaining consistent increase when you don’t have to go out of your way. Experts recommend morning workouts because motivation wanes as the day goes on. But, for best results, exercise at the time that’s most convenient for you.The most convenient time for you might be when you first wake each morning, on your lunch break at work, or in the evenings when your workout buddy is available. Pick a time and stick to it.
 The location of your gym is also important for helping you stay motivated to exercise. If your gym is far away or not easily accessible, you will come up with more excuses not to go. For this reason, go to a gym close by home or work.
 Visiting your gym is about improving your physical fitness and enhancing your relationship with your body. Yet, so many people fill their minds with comparisons about how they measure up to others. Comparisons only decrease your motivation for working out. Bring awareness to your tendency to compare and stop it now.Set a personal goal to stop comparing at the start of the week. Write it down on a piece of paper and drop it in your gym bag. Then, when you catch yourself comparing, say something positive about yourself like “I am so much better at Pilates than when I first started.” Do this repeatedly until you start focusing on yourself and not on others.
 If you’re pushing yourself too hard, you can start resenting the very idea of going to the gym. Notice when you need a break and give yourself permission to take one. Besides, pushing yourself too hard won’t necessarily lead to better results. In fact, going overboard can result in injuries or self-defeating behaviors that set back your progress.

 Use a spray bottle from a department store or drug store. Add one cup of water to the spray bottle. Make sure the bottle is big enough. As you'll be adding dye, leave a little headspace when you're done adding water., Use a fabric paint in your chosen color. Add three tablespoons of the paint to your spray bottle.If you want a less vibrant color, however, experiment with adding less paint. Only adding one to two tablespoons of fabric paint will create a pastel shade.
 Give the bottle a good shake. For about 30 to 60 seconds, shake the bottle to mix the paint and water. Keep shaking until you have a uniform mixture that's one solid color.Make sure the cap is on tight before you begin shaking. You do not want to end up getting dye on your clothing or hands.

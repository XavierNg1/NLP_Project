 Cut the metal mesh into the desired shape using wire cutters. This mesh will serve as the framework for your sculpture. It will hold the wet concrete in place until it dries.Use a metal mesh that is heavy enough to hold its own shape.
 If you are unable to manipulate the mesh into your desired shape, try wrapping the mesh around something hard, like cardboard or styrofoam, to form the desired shape of the sculpture., Mix the concrete mix and water in a large bucket or wheelbarrow. Use a concrete stirrer, hoe, or drill bit to stir the concrete until it is thoroughly mixed. Most 80 pound (36 kg) bags of concrete require three quarts (2.8 liters) of water. The mixture should be a thick, oatmeal-like consistency.Read the instructions on the bag of concrete before mixing the concrete and water. The instructions will provide clear ratios of water to concrete.
Concrete that is too runny is easier to pour but less durable and more likely to break over time.
Add more water to your concrete mixture if the mixture is solid and crumbly., Using a metal trowel, or another hand tool, apply the concrete to the wire mesh. Apply the concrete in thin layers. Add more layers until you achieve your desired shape., The concrete will be dry to the touch within 24 hours. However, you should allow the concrete to cure for seven days. Avoid touching or moving the sculpture during this time.

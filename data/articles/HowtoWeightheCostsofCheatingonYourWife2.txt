 It is often hard to see past the pleasure and excitement of an affair. People who cheat are often plagued with guilt. This guilt can have a severe impact on your life and how you treat your family members. Often, the guilt can even lead to other issues like depression, anxiety, and paranoia that your wife is cheating., Your new partner might also deal with guilt. An extramarital affair is usually a very surface level love. Eventually, you or your lover will want more out of the relationship. This will either take your affair to an even greater level of complexity or it will end the affair. There is also a chance that the guilt will drive the other person to confess the affair to your wife or someone else.Consider what you would do if your new partner said they wanted more and were telling your wife whether you wanted them to or not.
 Keep in mind that, depending upon the circumstances of your affair, there may be a risk of getting your lover pregnant. Consider this risk carefully. If you already have a family, this could mean that you would be juggling two families.


If you are not interested in having a child with your lover (and pregnancy is a possibility), use proper protection.
Realize that you could contract an STD and pass that along to your wife.
 Hotel rooms, secret cell phone accounts, and extra dates with your lover are expenses that you might incur during an affair. If you arenâ€™t careful, these expenses could also be used against you in a divorce case to help determine a settlement or alimony amount to be paid to your spouse. They also leave a paper trail that can get you caught in your affair., Many people cheat on their wives as an escape from rough patches in the marriage. This might feel good at the time, but it will not fix the problems in the long run. When the affair ends, you will still be faced with the same marital problems as before, except now they will be compounded with the problems created by the affair.

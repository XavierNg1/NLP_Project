 The actual tool may have a slightly different name depending on the program you are using, but it should be similar to those listed here and recognized for its purpose of allowing you to resize your image.
 Similar to editing an image's size using HTML code, you will use the Image Resize Dialog Box to enter in selected values for your image height and width.


Decrease the width. You can usually do this with pixels, percentage or inches (centimeters). By decreasing the width and leaving the height at default, you will make a picture skinnier. Conversely, you can allow the width to remain the same and increase the height.

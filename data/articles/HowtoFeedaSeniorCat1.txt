 As a cat ages, it's important that it gets good quality food that supports its health. A food that in high in animal protein and provides all necessary vitamins and minerals is key. You can assess the quality of a cat food by looking at the ingredient list and making sure that the first few ingredients are all animal tissue or animal byproducts.It's also a good idea to look for a certification stamp from a governing body, such as the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). This means that the food meets minimum nutritional standards.;
, There are special foods that are produced with the the dietary needs of older cats in mind. They have different levels of nutrients than foods made for kittens or adult cats. If you have a senior cat, consider feeding it one of these special diets.Not all foods made for older cats are the same. Some are higher in calories and are made for cats that are not eating enough. Some are lower in calories and are made for cats that are eating too many calories in old age. Some have added vitamins and minerals that should help with age related health issues.
Because of all of the variation in senior foods, it's important to know what your cat's health issues are and to look closely at the packaging of foods you are considering.
 One of the easiest ways to choose a new food for your senior cat is to ask your veterinarian for suggestions. The veterinarian knows your cat and its dietary needs, so they can steer you towards a food that will fulfill those needs.In some cases, your veterinary office will sell food for cats. If this is the case, and your veterinarian suggests the food they are selling, just double check with the veterinarian that your cat actually needs this food and make sure the price is within your budget.

, The target grid is the upright grid in between the 2 players., Press the letter key first, then the number key, then "Fire/Enter." A red light will flash to show your missile has been launched.

If you hit an enemy vessel, the game reports, "Radar confirms hit at," followed by the coordinate you entered. Replace the white peg on your target grid with a red peg; your opponent will mark the hit on his or her ship at that coordinate with a red peg.
If there is no enemy vessel at that coordinate, the game reports, "Radar confirms miss at," followed by the coordinate. Leave the white peg in place.
Keep an accurate record of your shots so that you can figure out where your opponent's ships are placed. If you should fire onto a space where you previously recorded a hit, the game will record the second shot to that location as a miss.
When all the spaces a ship occupies on the board record a hit, the game will report the ship as sunk. For example, when your Battleship takes a hit to each of its 4 spaces, the game will report, "Target neutralized ï¿½ battleship sunk." (You then have option to whine as in the TV commercial: "You sank my battleship!")

, At this point, the game announces, "Enemy fleet destroyed. Congratulations, Admiral."

After reaching cruising speeds of about 90 KIAS and about 2500 RPM a HASEL check is required.
A hassle check consists of a few steps to be safe while in flight and making sure a pilot can follow through with their intentions. check for H-eight, A-rea, S-ecurity, E-ngine, L-ookout. Including 2 clearing turns.;
,, (seatbelts/shoulder harnesses, fuel shut-off value, & fuel mixture),,,

Pull back on controls (nose up) to maintain altitude.
 During turn move flaps to 20 degrees.

Pull back on controls (nose up) to maintain altitude.


Pull back on controls (nose up) to maintain altitude.


While in flight the left hand controls the airspeed and the right hand controls the altitude.
Movements are exaggerated (e.g. turns, rudder, etc.)
Slow flight is usually around 55 KIAS and the slow flight signs are low airspeed, unresponsive aileron and possibly stall horn.

Progressively begin nose up attitude (flare) and wait for stall.
To recover from stall, immediately add power and pull up nose (to level plane) simultaneously. Carb heat cold and slowly/incrementally return flaps to 0 degrees.


Carb heat cold.

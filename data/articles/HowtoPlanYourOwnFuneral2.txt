 Ask to see a written casket price list at each funeral home. Then, ask to see the actual caskets on display. Compare the list to the display models. If you don’t see the particular model that you are interested in, request a visual of some sort. Caskets can vary widely in terms of materials and cost, so it is best to shop around a bit.Some caskets are made of wood while others are constructed from fiberglass, plastic, fiberboard, cardboard, or metal. The interiors vary widely as well. Some caskets have basic fabric patterns while others display a velvet or silk.
A standard casket will cost you upwards of $2,000 with some specialty ones selling for over $10,000.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guarantees that your funeral home will allow you to use any previously purchased casket for your funeral. So, don’t feel pressured to purchase everything at one time in one place.
 Most cemeteries make you purchase a liner of some sort. A quality liner will keep the grave from sinking and caving in. You can often buy a liner at the funeral home, but you should feel free to shop around as well for the best price. Be aware that the liners are often not customizable., Consider whether you would like a single-depth space (to fit one person) or a double-depth space (designed for two). You can also investigate getting a spot within a family plot or starting a family plot yourself. Expect to pay somewhere between $200-$5,000 for a single-depth plot.You will also want to ask the funeral home about the cost of grave digging and cemetery care as well. Many cemeteries will keep an account in place for long-term care.
 Most cemeteries will have regulations regarding the types of markers they allow. Ask about these restrictions and then start to shop around. A traditional granite headstone can cost you upwards of $1,000. Expect to pay a premium for additional customized options or expensive stone types.

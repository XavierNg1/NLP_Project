 If you haven't, make a card for each one and slip in a 'friendship token'. You can make a friendship token by cutting out a piece of colored card and writing your bear's name on and who it's from. You can add decoration too. e.g. To Millie, merry Christmas, love from Tracey.;
, Put it in the stocking when they go to bed or put it under the tree.
 About 1 hour - 5 minutes earlier will do. This way, you have time to read them a story and let them have a glass of milk before bed. You can also put stuff in their stocking if you use them.

 Kinetic friction, or the friction of an object in motion, is equal to the coefficient of friction multiplied by the normal force of an object. In equation format, that looks like: f = μ * N


In this equation, f stands for friction, μ refers to the coefficient of friction, and N refers to the normal force of the object.
A "coefficient of friction" is the ratio between frictional resistance to normal force, which is responsible for pressing the two opposing surfaces together.
 If you have a value for the kinetic friction of an object, as well as that object's coefficient of friction, you can calculate the normal force by using the formula: N = f / μ


Both sides of the original equation were divided by μ, thereby isolating normal force on one side while accounting for the coefficient of friction and kinetic friction on the opposite side.

Example: Find the normal force of a block when the coefficient of friction is 0.4 and the amount of kinetic friction itself is 40 N.
 This is essentially all you need to do to find the value of the normal force.



Example: N = f / μ = 40 / 0.4 = 100

, If desired, you can check your answer by plugging it back into the original equation for kinetic friction. Otherwise, you have completed the problem.



Example: The normal force is 100.0 N.

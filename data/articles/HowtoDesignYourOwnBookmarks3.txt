 For this bookmark, you’ll need a felt, hot glue or fabric glue, a variety of colored paperclips, a variety of buttons, and ribbon in colors of your choice.
 Since buttons come in so many shapes, sizes, and designs, you can be creative and make bookmarks that fit your unique style. Match your colored paperclip to the button of your choice.Make sure that if you’re using a large button that you also use large or extra large paperclips or else the paperclip will slip off the book’s pages.
 The small rectangles should be no longer than the back of the button. Put a small dollop of glue on the back of the button and adhere the paperclip to the glue. Cover the still wet glue with the small felt cutout to ensure a smooth back finish.
 Ribbon should measure 4 in/10.16 cm long and 1 in/2.54 cm wide. Choose an assortment of 2-3 colors per paperclip to make this paperclip extra bright and fun. Simply tie the ribbon of choice to the end of the paperclip in small, tight knots.

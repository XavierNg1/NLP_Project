 It's a good idea to set some type of a reminder for yourself. This will also help you be less of a victim to waiting around for the radio show.
 Most DJs have Myspace.com pages, facebook.com pages or pages and emails accessible from the station's website.


Send a polite email or message telling them how much you love the station, that they're your favorite DJ. Most all DJs have egos so play up to it.
You may not increase your chances of winning but it certainly doesn't hurt.
 Most stations have limits to how many times you can win in a 30 day period. Don't call to win the sausage sampler if you know AC/DC tickets are going on sale soon!

, Just call in to chat up the DJ. Ask when they will be giving away the prize you want to win. Some DJs may not mind sharing the info. Just be nice.
 Lots of times these stations will ask music related questions. Look for websites that will quiz you on your music trivia.

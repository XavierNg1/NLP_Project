 Alternatively, you can use the shadow of a fixed object. Nearly any object will work, but the taller the object is, the easier it will be to see the movement of its shadow, and the narrower the tip of the object is, the more accurate the reading will be. Make sure the shadow is cast on a level, brush-free spot.;
, Try to make the mark as small as possible so as to pinpoint the shadow's tip, but make sure you can identify the mark later.
 The shadow tip will move mostly from west to east in a curved line.
 It will likely move only a short distance.
 This is an approximate east-west line.
 You are now facing mostly toward true north, regardless of where you are in the world. The illustration shows that the sun and marker at Points 1 is what is happening for Step 2. At Points 2, it shows what is happening for Step 4. This method is based on the fact that the sun moves across the sky from East to West.

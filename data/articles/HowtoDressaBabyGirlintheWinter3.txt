 It may be tempting to swaddle your baby in multiple blankets to make sure she stays warm all night, but over bundling has been directly linked in an increased risk of SIDS. Your baby will be fine all night in a one-piece fleece pajama sleeper with nothing underneath.
 Newborns should never sleep with loose blankets, as it can be a suffocation risk. Instead, swaddle your baby in a light swaddle blanket made of cotton or muslin.


Wearable blankets, which are sleeveless sacks that zip up the front and are worn over sleepers, are also good options for keeping your baby safe and warm.
 Check your baby’s temperature in the morning as well as the temperature of the room in the night to see if adding a blanket or blanket sleeper will help your child.


The optimal room temperature for a sleeping infant is between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but this varies with each child. Check your baby’s underarms to see if they are too hot or too cold and adjust their sleeping conditions accordingly.

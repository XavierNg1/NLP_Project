 Keep your sore throat lubricated by drinking lots of water throughout the day. Prevent dehydration by sipping water. Have at least eight to ten glasses of water a day.You can add slices of lemon, lime, or cucumber to the water to give it some natural flavor.
 Add moisture to the air around you to ease throat irritation. Use a cool-mist humidifier in your room. Clean it regularly so bacteria and mold does not develop in the humidifier., Give your body the time and energy it needs to fight off the throat infection. Stay in bed and rest. Do not do any strenuous activity or stay up too late at night.You may distract yourself in bed by reading a book or watching television.
 Cigarette smoke can make your throat infection worse. Cut back on smoking or quit smoking. Stay away from areas where there is cigarette smoke.Air pollution like smog can also make your throat infection worse. If you live in a highly populated city with smog, stay inside during the hottest time of the day, as this is often when air pollution is at its worst.

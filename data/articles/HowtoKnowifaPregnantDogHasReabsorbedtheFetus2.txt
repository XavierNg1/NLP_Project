 After your dog reabsorbs a fetus it should be looked at by a veterinarian. The veterinarian can assess the dog's health, as well as the health of any additional fetus'.Your dog may need to be kept under observation to make sure that it can successfully carry the remaining fetus'.There are a variety of reasons that your dog may have miscarried. A veterinarian may be able to figure out the reason why.
In some cases, a miscarriage occurs due to a infectious disease. Your veterinarian may need to do biological tests to confirm what type of infection caused the miscarriage. If this is the case with your dog, it will need veterinary care to recover from the infection., There are many reasons that your dog may miscarry that you have no control over. For example, many miscarriages are due to hormonal imbalances in the dog's system or infectious diseases that have gone undiagnosed. Keep this in mind when dealing with your dog and coming to grips with the loss of a potential puppy. The miscarriage is not your fault or the fault of your dog.
 Even if your dog has reabsorbed a fetus, there still may be additional developing fetus' that need to be cared for. In order for your dog to successfully carry these puppies to term, you need to continue proper care for the dog.


This includes feeding your pregnant dog properly, getting it proper healthcare, and preparing properly for labor and delivery.

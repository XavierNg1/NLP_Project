 This ship is hidden in the fog at the southeast corner of the map, but despite the intimidating feeling around it, this is the easiest of the Legendary Ships to defeat.
 This is usually behind HMS Prince, since it has a devastating broadside attack with cannons.
 Do so once you successfully position your ship behind it.


Once the health of HMS Prince reaches 25% and it is flaming, it will start attacking with its rear cannons. If you have gotten up behind the ship quick enough, you should have plenty of life to endure the rear cannons until you are able to sink it.
The reward for defeating the HMS Prince is 20,000R.

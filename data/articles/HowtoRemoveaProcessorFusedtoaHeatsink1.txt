 The processor should easily come off the heat sink. Using a razor blade or prying tool, or placing force on it, may damage the processor.;
, Be careful and try not to bend the pins. Do not apply too much force.
 This option will not damage the processor.
 Gently floss the area between the processor and the heat sink, starting at any corner where the floss is able to penetrate.


If the floss is flat, hold it flat against the heatsink and slowly work it down between the CPU and heatsink. Having the heatsink facing you will give you the best leverage.
 As you go along the processor, go back and forth while gently applying force in the direction away from the corner where you started. It may be difficult at times, but it will go through.

 This is available in larger opening sizes as well from most sewing and craft stores. Most will have canvas webbing with drawn-on patterns to guide your color choices.


If you buy a kit, it'll show and/or give you everything you need. Just follow the directions on the box when it comes to choosing a hook and fabric.;
, The size you choose will depend on your webbing. If you can, be e-co friendly by using recycled fabrics such as old clothing. Cut them into strips that are a maximum of 1/2" (1.25 cm) in width and 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) in length. Keeping the lengths uniform results in a smooth "pile" for your rug.









Trimming later is time consuming and more difficult than cutting to uniform length at this point. Once you cut one, just use it as a prototype and match the rest.
 That is, of course, if the canvas didn't come with a pattern on it already. Permanent markers work well for this; just take care not to get marker on any surface underneath the canvas.









Having a pattern isn't necessary. If you'd like to create an abstract masterpiece, go right ahead! It'll be just as beautiful.
 In a couple of hours, you'll have a new rug all your own. Ta da! No glue, sewing machine, or real skill required.

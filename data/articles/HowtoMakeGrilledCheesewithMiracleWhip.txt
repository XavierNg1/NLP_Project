 For starters, it is important to use the correct bread. Grilled cheese lends itself well to white bread. In this case any old white bread will do. Wheat, rye, and pumpernickel do not work as well due to their heavier flavor.;
, Apply butter to both sides of each piece of bread. This will help to add flavor, plus also toast the bread and keep it from burning.
 Next, add the cheese. Feel free to experiment, but American seems to be the cheese of choice. Cooper is less common, but much more tasty. Be sure to apply approximately five or six slices in-between the bread. The cheese should be approximately half an inch thick or so.
 Once you have cheese on the bread, add a big glob of Miracle Whip on top. This is the special ingredient. It will really add something to set it apart from other grilled cheese sandwiches. Apply about two tablespoons.
 Once the sandwich is assembled the grilling can begin. In a skillet, place three tablespoons of butter and heat on low. Brown the sandwich on both sides. Make sure the cheese is gooey and yummy.

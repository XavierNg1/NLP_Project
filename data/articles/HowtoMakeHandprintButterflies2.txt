 They can be the same color or different colors. These sheets will eventually make your butterfly's wings, so pick a nice color.
 You can keep your fingers closed or have them open.
 Keep the paper folded when you cut. This way, you will have a total of four hands when you are done.
 Take two hands and hold them so that the palms touch and the thumbs point upward. Glue them together along the palm. Repeat for the second set of hands. You've just finished your wings.









Angle the hands slightly to make a V shape at the thumbs.
 Turn one set of wings over so that the thumbs point down. Overlap the two wing sets in the middle, then glue them together. The thumbs on the top set should point up. The thumbs on the bottom set should point down.
 Glue it between the wings.If you want a fuzzy body, glue down a row of black or brown pompoms between the wings instead.
 Bend a black pipe cleaner into a V shape. Curl the ends, then glue the antenna to the top of the butterfly's body.








If you can't find any pipe cleaners, cut a V out of black paper, then glue it to the top of the body instead., Glue down gems, sequins, or buttons onto the wings.You can also decorate the wings with glitter glue instead. Here are some more ideas:









Glue tiny googly eyes to the head.
Decorate the wings with foam stickers.
Paint designs onto the butterfly using craft paint.
 Once it's dry, you can hang it up on your wall or in your window.

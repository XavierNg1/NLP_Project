 Birds are a pleasure to be around. If you want to


Hop around on two feet, like a little bird does.
Sing pretty melodies. Learn a real bird song, and sing that.
Bathe yourself in a little bowl, like a bird bath. Shake off the water.
Fly around the yard (running), flapping your wings very fast.
Peck at your food fast. Eat little bites of nuts, raisins, or old crusty bread.
 Eagles are hunters, and they're smart and very large birds that are magnificent to watch. If you want to pretend to be an eagle:


Build a nest on a tall perch for your eggs. Use blankets or twigs.
Climb up somewhere high and look down over everything. Eagle's like to have the right positioning.
Keep a look out for prey, like rodents.
Circle around above your prey and wait for it to make a mistake.
Swoop down and make the kill when the time is right.
Lead with your talons, which are sharp claws on the feet.
Make a "screech" sound like an eagle's cry.
Feed your babies back at your nest.
 Chickens are one of the most important parts of any barnyard. They make eggs and help to eat weeds. They're fun to pretend to be, too:


Hold your arms by your sides like the T-Rex
Flap your arms up and down to look like wings
Take long funny strides, like you've been riding a horse.
Move your neck forward and back as you walk, like a chicken does.
Make a little nest in the yard of sticks and grass.
Lay an egg and protect it, or pretend a little ball is your egg and sit on it.
Make little "buck-buck" "buck-buck" sounds, like chickens.
You could also be a rooster and crow in the early morning to trumpet the day.
Eat some corn, some oatmeal, or some green vegetables for a snack.

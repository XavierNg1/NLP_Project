 Whether you have a warm or cool skin tone, choose an ash light brown dye if you've just bleached your hair. The cool ash tones will counteract the warmth of your newly-bleached bright orange hair. To reach a cool light brown hair color, you will need to leave the mixture on your hair longer than if you’re trying to achieve a warm light brown shade., Separate your hair into the four quadrants again and start applying the mixture on the first quadrant. Use the applicator that came with the dye to “paint” the mixture on from root to tip. Make sure you saturate the hair. Continue until all of your hair is saturated with the dye., After applying the dye, you will be able to see the color develop – your hair will go from orange, to golden brown, to neutral, and finally to ash. There is no exact science here, so you’ll have to watch carefully and rinse when you’ve reached your ideal shade. If you are trying to achieve a warm shade, you will rinse it out sooner than if you want a cool shade. The longer you leave the dye on, the cooler the shade will be.Check the dye's instructions for maximum set time. It's usually 30 minutes. Dyes stop developing after the max time elapses. Leaving it on past that time will not change anything., Continually check your hair in the mirror as the color develops. When you've reached your desired shade, rinse the dye out. When you do this is entirely up to you, and depends on what you're trying to achieve.

 Using a marker, make a thin and long rectangular shape across the central front portion of the pumpkin.

, Place the pumpkin on a surface covered widely with newspaper (to protect the surface from being sprayed with paint). Using the silver or gray spray paint, spray the whole pumpkin to cover. Leave to dry.


Once dried, outline the Cylon helmet design above the eye hole region.






Using black paint, fill in the helmet outline.






Painting the whole pumpkin is optional. If you choose to leave the pumpkin unsprayed, instead of using black paint, simply mark out the helmet outline and file down the helmet area using a microplane. This will create a relief design. See the alternative method below for more details.

However, when you're not going to be able to get back to your farm for an extended period of time, you might think there's no point in plowing your fields since you can't plant on them.;
, Your neighbors can't fertilize fallow land, but they can fertilize plowed plots even if they haven't been planted yet. And when you do return to plant on them, your crops will be instantly fertilized. Also, it's important to pass this information along too. If your friends have to spend some time away from their farm, you want to be able to earn your coins fertilizing their plots as well.
 And, of course, it's easy for your friends to forget to send gifts to you. Even if you don't necessarily need any of the items that you receive as gifts, you can always sell them for some extra coins, so you'll want to remind your neighbors to keep sending them if they've been neglecting this aspect of the game. And the best way to remind them to send gifts your way is to remember to send gifts to them.
 Some of these bonuses are as small as 50 coins, and it may seem like more trouble than it's worth to peruse your news feed to find them all. But these small bonuses add up fast. You'll be missing out on a lot of you don't take advantage of as many as you can find.

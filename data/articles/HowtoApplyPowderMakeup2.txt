If your skin is very dark, you can use vibrant reds, apricots, and berries as your blush. These colors look bold when in a compact, but they will blend in well when brushed onto your skinMany different colors work well with medium skin. Apricot, taupe, bronze, and coral are examples of the most popular blushes for medium skin.
Fair, pale skin looks best when paired with classic pink blush., Start with a clean makeup brush, preferably a blush brush. Blush most often comes in the form of a pressed powder compact. However, loose pigment used as blush has been gaining in popularity. Keep in mind that you want only the slightest hint of color; avoid overloading your brush.


For pressed powder, run your brush lightly across the compact once or twice. Flick your wrist with the brush over the pressed powder to remove any excess if necessary.
For loose pigment, start by placing the lid of its container flat on the table with the inside facing up. Shake a tiny bit of powder onto the inside of the lid. Dip your brush into it and tap against the edge of the container to remove excess., Many people struggle with blush placement, and applying blush to a relaxed face can be a gamble. Smiling will make the apples of your cheeks prominent and easy to brush blush onto without overdoing it., Dot the tiniest bit of blush onto the apples of your cheeks. Make buffing motions with your brush to blend your blush's edges. Try to work it back slightly towards your temples, following your cheekbones.

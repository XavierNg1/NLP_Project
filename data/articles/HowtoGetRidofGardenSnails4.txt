 Ducks and chickens will hunt and eat snails and other small creatures in your garden. They'll even provide a free fertilizer for you.
 Coffee grounds will dry out the soil and snails don't like travelling on dry ground.
 Snails will eat the pellets and therefore die from poisoning, just be aware that these are poisonous to wildlife and your pets as well.
 Snails have difficulty travelling across sand/bark and tend not to try unless they are desperate.
 Salt is highly dangerous to snails and can kill them but it isn't a good idea to scatter it near plants or on a place where you are going to grow some plants.
 Birds, toads and even some types of snakes will feed on snails (mostly birds).
 A great, natural solution to get rid of not only snails but other creatures as well.

 Family time can have a good story, and this is a good way to do it.;
, Old pictures can help you remember what you did in the past. Such as a vacation several years before. You may remember!

, Any game can work. Here are the two types of games:


Board games: Any board game is for several players, like Sorry!, Trouble, or anything else.
Video games: Can be for the whole family. The Wii, like Wii Sports, Wii Play, or anything can work, as they can have up to four players.
Card games also work, like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Pok√©mon card games.
 This is a good way to test the whole family's singing skills.
 Any movie can work. Some movies are for fun, while some are action. It's your choice!

, Cheer for your team!

, Check for some music videos, or any funny, popular ones.

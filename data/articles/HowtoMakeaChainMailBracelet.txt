 These are listed in the "Things You'll Need" section below. You can make the entire bracelet with a single color ring, or use two colors. In this article, the center color is red and the edge color is blue.
 To open a ring, grasp each end with pliers and twist them in opposite directions, as shown in the image.
 Then close the open ring by twisting the ends back together. This unit is called a chainlet. Make sure that the ends close together tightly. There shouldn't be a gap, and the ends shouldn't overlap.
 The center ring should go behind the top two rings and in front of the bottom two rings. You may need to flip the corner rings over to get this arrangement right, but it's very important that they are arranged this way.
, Place it between the chainlets.
, Don't let the rings from the previous step fall off. This step is tricky!
, The two chainlets are now attached.
 Then attach them together until you have a long enough bracelet to fit your wrist.

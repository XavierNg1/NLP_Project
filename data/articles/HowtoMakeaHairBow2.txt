 Make the first rectangle 9 1⁄2 inches (24.1 cm) wide and 10 1⁄2 inches (26.7 cm) long; this will be the main part of the bow. Make the second rectangle 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) wide and 3 1⁄2 inches (8.9 cm) long; this will be the middle piece that cinches the bow into shape.
 Make sure the "right" side of the fabric, the side on which the pattern is brighter, is facing in. Only the "wrong" side of the fabric, the side on which the pattern is muted, should be visible.
 You can use a sewing machine or make the stitch by hand. Only sew the long edge, opposite the fold; leave the two short ends of the fabric open. You now have an inside-out rectangular tube with a seam down the longer side.
 Reverse it so that the bright side of the fabric is facing out. Lay the piece of fabric flat on the table and position it so that the seam runs down the middle of the tube, rather than the side.


Make sure the seam is directly in the center of the fabric by using a ruler or measuring tape to measure the fabric on either side of the seam. The sides should be equal.
Position the fabric so that the seam is on the top part of the tube, rather than the bottom part lying flat against the table.
 Using your sewing machine or working by hand, make a zig-zag stitch or a straight stitch along the unsewn, unfolded edges of the fabric. You now no longer have a tube, but a folded and sewn square. Reverse the fabric so that the new seam is facing inside.

 Use this measurement to measure out two wood supports that will sit at a diagonal angle from the wall to the shelf board.


Cut the wood supports at diagonals each end, one for the wall and one for the shelf.






If preferred, cut a single but much wider wood support that will only be attached to the middle of the windowsill shelf.
 Screw the wood supports to the wall.
 Rest the shelf board on the windowsill and on the wood supports. Nail, screw or glue in place.
 Press on it gently to check that it's firmly in place before kitty uses it. Then encourage him to give it a trial run. A few treats left on the windowsill can help to tempt your cat into place.

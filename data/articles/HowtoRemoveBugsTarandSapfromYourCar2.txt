 Sap tends build up into a thick, hard layer if you don't clean it off regularly. If your car tends to pick up a lot of sap, plan to clean it off every other week or so - more often in the summer, when it's more concentrated and will smear more easily. This will keep you from having a tougher job on your hands down the line.
 You can also apply a sap remover product from your auto supply store, but rubbing alcohol works just as well. Let the towel sit on the sappy area for at least 10 minutes. The alcohol will begin to break down and soften the hard sap.
 Use a microfiber cloth to rub off the softened sap. If the sap won't budge, you'll need to soak it again for another 10-20 minutes. Keep soaking and rubbing the sap until it's removed from your car's exterior.


If the sap is difficult to remove, cover it with WD-40, which should help it loosen up. Don't use WD-40 on your windows, though.






Don't use a scrubbing sponge or any other rough material to scrub the sap from your car's body, because the paint will likely come off with the sap.
 If dried sap won't come off your windows, use a box cutter blade to carefully scrape it off. Don't use this method to remove sap from other parts of your car., After the sap has been removed, it's a good idea to wash your car to get rid of any residue. Little bits of leftover sap could dry elsewhere on your car, leaving you to deal with the problem all over again.

 Tuck a plain, button-down white blouse into a knee-length, tweed cargo skirt for a professional look, or mix things up with a ruffled white shirt and a glossy satin cargo skirt for a night out.
 A bold floral print looks feminine and soft, adding a fashionable amount of contrast to a stiff wool or tweed cargo skirt.
 If you want to dress up a plain tank top or camisole, match it with a satin cargo skirt and a fitted cardigan. Cardigans are a sophisticated type of outerwear that usually offer a touch of class to any outfit.
 Skirts made of heavy materials are more likely to keep you warm than thinner materials, like satin. Wearing leggings can further prevent your legs from getting cold, as well.
 Flats can work with dressy cargo skirts as well as casual cargos, but the most casual flats may not look right. Instead of natural canvas styles, stick with leather designs.
 Low, strappy heels look especially nice with a satin cargo skirt for a night out, but other designs may work, as well.
 Heavy materials, like wool or twill, coordinate well with knee-high or over-the-knee boots. Flat riding boots are more practical and may look a little more casual, while heeled boots can take your outfit up a notch.
 To add structure and style to your ensemble, tie a leather belt around your natural waist, over your top. A belt emphasizes your waist, thereby accentuating your curves and preventing your body from looking too boxy.
 Look at bold pieces, like large necklaces with colored gemstone beads or chunky bangle bracelets. Avoid dainty jewelry, since this look may still be too casual to work well with extremely elegant pieces. Conversely, you should also avoid the natural pieces you wear with your casual skirt, since the casualness of these pieces may also clash.

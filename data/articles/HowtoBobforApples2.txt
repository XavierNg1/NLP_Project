 Select apples with long stems so that you are easily able to tie a string to the stem. Make a double knot and be sure the string is tied tightly., Each player should have an apple that rests at chin-height, so you may want to measure your players before hanging the apples., You can hang the apples from a tree branch or a swing set. A clothesline may even work if it is high enough above the playerâ€™s heads. Hang the apples so they dangle in front of each player., You cannot use your hands, so be sure each player keeps their hands behind their back. Attempt to bite the apple while it dangles on the string. This is harder than it seems, as the apple will swing around while you are attempting to nab it., The first person to grab the apple in their teeth is the winner. You could hand out prizes such as candy, bubbles, or chalk.

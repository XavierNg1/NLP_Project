 Here's a list of examples:


Update your Add-ons and Mods to the game. Chances are some of them are out of date.
Beef up on your strategy. Read ahead for the upcoming boss fights so you'll be prepared when you reach them.
Look for a guild to join. Try the WoW Realm Forums as many of the realms have a recruiting sticky.
Read up on strategy for your class.
Consider a new talent build, you can find talent calculators online. Make a list of the stats of all your equipment, add-ons, enchantments, and talents. Mathematically calculate the optimum combination.
Read some "lore" or work on your backstory.
Listen to some podcasts about World of Warcraft .
Draw your character. Create real and absurd situations for your character to be in. You can even create comics if you think you're good at it.
Sleep. This way you are well rested when WoW Realms come back up.
Try a different RPG game. Who knows? You might find a new addiction.
Play World of Warcraft private servers. However, know that World of Warcraft "private servers" are against the policy and, if others find out that you've played on a private server, this can even get you banned on the official server.
Watch World of Warcraft videos on Youtube.com. Some of them are actually entertaining to watch. One of them that is commonly known throughout World of Warcraft is about a guy named Leroy Jenkins. Watch it, if you are an experienced player of WoW it will be much more enjoyable!;

Download some music to listen to during the next big boss fight. Good music can help a lot of things for most people.
Go for a walk. Have you breathed some fresh air lately?
Go on wikiHow and edit something. Maybe you can use your vast WoW knowledge and skills to improve the articles in this category?
Hang out with your friends. Like Blizzard says, "Bring your friends to Azeroth, but don't forget to go outside Azeroth with them as well."

 This will help give your lashes some length and volume. You aren't using any mascara for this, so unless you prime your lashes, they will be the same length and thickness., Choose a short, stable candle, such as a pillar candle or a tea light. Because you are dealing with fire, it might be a good idea to work over a sink, or to have a cup of water nearby.
 You want to hold it close enough so that the cream softens, but not so close that it starts to smoke or burn. You don't need to hold the pencil too long over the flameâ€”a few seconds will do., Be sure to color all around the spoolie brush. This is now your "colored" mascara., Starting at the base of your lashes, gently wiggle the spoolie back-and-forth while pulling it upwards.
 Be sure to heat up your pencil liner, and color in your spoolie brush again. This way, you won't risk having one set of eyelashes brighter than the other.

 Rituals are important to a happy, married life. Find ways to spend time together one-on-one throughout the week.


Rituals can be anything meaningful to you and your partner. Going out to dinner once a week, watching a particular show together, taking long walks, and other activities you enjoy as a couple can serve as rituals.It's important to maintain some kind of a schedule. Obviously, things get busy and sometimes you might miss a dinner here and there. However, having a set day of the week or set time of day for one another can help assure you two don't miss each other in the shuffle., Sex is important to a romantic relationship. Maintaining a healthy sex life longterm is vital to getting along with your spouse.


If you and your partner have different sex drives, there are ways to compromise. This does not simply mean having sex more or less based on someone's needs, but you can explore fantasies, varying levels of foreplay, role play, and other means to get you and your spouse on the same level.If sex is becoming a problem, you see a couple's therapist to see if there are any underlying issues affecting your sex drive., It's important to have some shared values as a couple. While you may not agree on everything, you should have certain shared values. You can work together on what your goals are for the relationship, the future, and career. Establishing values together as a couple can strengthen a relationship and assure a positive future., The healthiest, happiest couples have individual lives apart from one another. You cannot rely on your partner to meet all your needs all the time. Even while striving to spend time with one another, find activities you enjoy doing alone or with other people as well. Join a book club. Have a weekly bar night with just friends. Get involved in a craft. A little space is important for a healthy romantic relationship.

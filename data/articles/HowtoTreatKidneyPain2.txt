, Severe kidney pain that occurs all of a sudden can be a sign of a serious medical condition like a blood clot or bleeding in your kidney. Call emergency services or visit the Emergency Department at your local hospital, even if you have no other symptoms., Often, your regular doctor can treat your kidney pain if it’s due to a common infection or kidney stones. Other causes, however, may require help from a specialist like a urologist or a nephrologist. You may even need to see a surgeon. Ask your doctor for the appropriate referral.
 Prepare to have a number of tests done when you visit your doctor or go to the hospital. It’s likely that they will take a blood test and urine sample. Depending on what your doctor thinks might be causing your kidney pain, they may suggest you have an ultrasound, x-ray, CT, or MRI. Ask your doctor any questions you have about the tests.

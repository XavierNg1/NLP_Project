 You must attend and make sure to show up on time, but don't expect to see creditors there. They are invited to attend but often do not do so. Answer truthfully all questions posed to you by the trustee. They use standard questions with a few variations based on the information you filed.


Filers are asked to state their name, address, and Social Security number and to affirm that they have read, signed, and understood the petition. You'll be asked if there are any errors or omissions, if you have listed all assets and creditors, if you've filed bankruptcy before, and whether you have additional sources of domestic-support.
 This is a different class from the credit-counseling course you took when you submitted your paperwork. You must complete this additional course through a trustee-approved, debtor-education agency. It will cost about $30. This course should be completed after your case is filed and within 45 days of the creditors meeting. If you do not do this, you risk having your case dismissed. Submit a certificate of completion as instructed in your correspondence.
 This correspondence is typically received a minimum of 61 days after you have your meeting with your creditors.

;
, You need to put a Lord Krishna statue or image in the center of the altar in a large deep container. Arrange a puja plate with water to sprinkle, kumkum, sandalwood, incense, aarti lamp and flowers and put it at the side.
 Make a ghee or sesame oil diya (lamp) and place it there, without burning it.
 Take more water and say "Om anantaya namaha" and drink. Last mantra "Om Govindaya namaha" and drink, then put water on both hands and dry it.
 Dry the murti (statue) and put that bowl at side on other table. Place the food, flowers, water and ghee diya next to it after abhishekam (the bath)

, Begin chanting the prayer shubham karoti kalyanam and light the diya. Then say gurur brahma gurur vishnu.... then, you chant any Krishna bhajan that you like and offer an incense stick 7 times in a circular clockwise motion. Then the arti lamp with 1 or 5 wicks, and then offer the chamara wisk to scare flies, so that Lord would be comfortable.
 Blow the conch shell and ask forgiveness for doing wrong or forgetting something during puja. You can leave there the offerings of fruits, water, flowers and rice and later eat them and use them (never waste it or throw it) or you can say namaskar to Lord and distribute to the devotees, saying jai mahaprasada or jai jinendra.

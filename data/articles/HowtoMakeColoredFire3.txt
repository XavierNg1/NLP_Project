 Place a heatproof bowl over a pot of water that’s simmering on medium on the stove. Add several pieces of paraffin wax and allow them to heat until they’re completely melted.You can use blocks of canning wax from the grocery store or stubs from old candles for the wax.
Don’t melt the wax over an open flame or you may start a fire.
 Once the wax is fully melted, remove it from the double boiler. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 g) of the chemical, and mix well until it is fully incorporated into the wax., After you’ve mixed the chemical into the wax, let it cool for 5 to 10 minutes. While it is still liquid, pour it into paper cupcake wrappers to form the cakes.You can also use small paper cups to form the wax cakes.
 Once the paraffin wax is in the paper cupcake wrappers, let them sit out until the wax solidifies again. It should only take about an hour for them to fully set., When the wax cakes are set, peel one out of its paper wrapper. Throw it onto the hottest part of a burning fire, and as the wax melts, the flames will change color.You can add more than one wax cake with different chemicals to the fire at a time, but toss them on different parts of the fire.
The wax cakes work well in a campfire or a fireplace.

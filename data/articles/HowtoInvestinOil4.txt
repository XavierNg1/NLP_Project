 If you’re a novice at investing, then buying stock is probably the easiest way to invest in oil. There aren’t complex accounting rules like there are with MLPs.


You can also easily resell your stock if you want to. By contrast, you might struggle to sell your portion of a master limited partnership.
MLPs also have complicated tax reporting requirements, which might require the help of a tax professional., The oil industry often has wild price swings, which affect smaller companies more than larger ones.If you’re risk averse, then investing in large oil company stock is often a safer investment than buying into an MLP or ETF.
 An exchange traded fund can invest in more than just futures contracts. They also might own stock in many individual oil companies.For this reason, they are more diversified and can weather ups and downs.


For example, if you put all of your money into one oil company’s stock, then you could lose a lot of money if an oil spill damages that company’s reputation. Because an ETF owns stock in multiple oil companies, you hedge against any disaster.
 ETFs are not ideal if you intend to hold onto the investment for a long time. Instead, they are probably ideal for someone looking to trade within 30 days of purchase., Only a professional advisor can discuss your investment goals and steer you toward the right investment. Even if you don’t have a lot of money, you can find a financial advisor to help you. Look in the following places:

 Depending on how large or high you made the basket, allow for approximately one foot (30.5cm) of hose to remain to create the handle with.
 Start where you want the handle to begin and twist the hose around so it is facing the exact other side of the basket.
 The loop should resemble a basket handle. Secure the bottom portion of the hose along the other side of the basket top.
 Consider placing a twist tie toward the end of the hose to avoid having the hose's mouth snag on items.
 Carry it out to its new spot in the garden and place items, plants or whatever else inside it.

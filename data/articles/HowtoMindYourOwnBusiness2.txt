 If there’s a conversation, meeting, or exclusive event to which you have not been invited, it’s best not to interrupt or intervene. Stay away or walk away.


While being excluded can feel hurtful, it’s important to recognize that there may be good reasons why something is not your business.
 It’s tempting to weigh in when you see something that doesn’t mesh with your own daily practices or lifestyle choices. However, doing so implies that you know better. People are not likely to take kindly to your intervention unless they’re explicitly seeking it.If you find yourself wanting to confer nuggets of wisdom, remind yourself that everyone is entitled to make their own choices and that the way they choose to live their life does not affect you.
Part of this is respecting others’ choices and space. If you’re at another person’s house, don’t assume that they should live as you do. Let them practice their habits and norms without intervention.
 It’s natural to make judgements, so it’s important to be aware of and curb the downsides of that instinct. When it comes to minding your business, avoiding snap judgements means foregoing the assumption that you fully understand a situation. Give everyone involved the benefit of the doubt until you do., Minding your business does not mean that you should not offer love and support to others. It simply means that you should not assume to the role of fixer for their problems, which usually only complicates a matter instead of solving it.For instance, if your brother is getting a divorce, it’s not wise to try and play marriage counselor. However, offering him your comfort and company or taking care of his kids from time to time will help him out without contributing to the stress or drama of the situation.

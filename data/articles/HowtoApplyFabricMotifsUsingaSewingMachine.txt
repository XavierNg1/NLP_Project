 This is an important requirement as it ensures that you will be able to get the maximum visibility when moving over the application of the motif.;
, If it doesn't matter that it shows, or if it forms part of the design to have the thread showing, be sure to select thread that matches the motif. If you want the stitches to be invisible, however, use clear monofilament thread on top and a thread that matches the background fabric in the bobbin:


For lighter shades (whites, creams, beige, etc.), use clear monofilament thread.
For darker shades (blues, greens, blacks, etc.), use smoke-coloured monofilament thread.
 The stitching is dependent on your design and wishes. Here are some hints:


Naive style: use zigzag stitch set narrow and open
Neat satin stitch: use zigzag stitch set close
Blind hem stitch: use this set with a very reduced length and width. If you want to use this stitch but your machine doesn't have it, resort to using the narrow open zigzag stitch style instead.
 The same goes for when you complete the stitching, to finish off.
 If you haven't done this before, try a test piece first, using a scrap rather than a motif. Do this until you feel comfortable with the method of application. Once you feel ready, go for it!

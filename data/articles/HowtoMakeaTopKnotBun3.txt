 Pull back your hair into a high ponytail. If it helps, you can brush your hair back so that your hair is smooth and bump-free., Poke your hair through a hair donut and pull it all the way to the base of your ponytail. If you donâ€™t have a hair donut, you can also take a clean tube sock, cut off the top of the tube sock so you get a three inch or so (7.62 cm or so) band of sock, then pull the loop of sock through your ponytail until it reaches the base.








You should be able to find a hair donut at beauty supply stores.
 Take your ponytail and hold it straight up in the air with one hand. With the other, take a comb and backcomb through your hair, starting at the midsection of your hair and combing down to the base.








Teasing your hair gives it the volume to completely cover the donut.
 Take your teased hair and start to wrap it clockwise around the hair donut to completely cover it. When you reach the tips of your hair, tuck the tips under the donut.
 Use several bobby pins to pin your hair around the hair donut and secure it in place. Spritz the bun with hairspray to prevent flyaways and to give the style extra hold.

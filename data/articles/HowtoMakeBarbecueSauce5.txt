 Pork spareribs are simply delicious, especially when smothered in a homemade barbecue sauce. All you need to do is baste the ribs generously with sauce during the last hour of cooking, then serve with more sauce when they're done! Some homemade coleslaw also compliments this dish nicely.
 Your homemade barbecue sauce makes a great marinade for chicken wings, breasts and drumsticks. Simply place the chicken pieces in a glass dish or bowl and cover generously with the sauce. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for several hours, or overnight. Cook in the oven, grill or on the barbecue.
 Your homemade barbecue sauce can really spice up traditional sloppy joes, taking comfort food to a whole new level. Just add your sauce to the ground beef as it cooks, then serve over a white hamburger bun and add more sauce, if desired.
 You can add a little excitement to your homemade pizza by substituting regular tomato sauce for barbecue sauce. Some good topping combos include shredded chicken breast, red onion, mozzarella cheese and freshly chopped cilantro.
 You can jazz up your homemade barbecue sauce by adding just once or two additional ingredients. For a spicy barbecue sauce, add a dash of Tabasco and some diced jalapeno peppers.

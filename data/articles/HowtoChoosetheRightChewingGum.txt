 Are you diabetic? If so, sugarless gum may be for you.;
, Even if you're not diabetic, sugar can still be harmful to your health. Does diabetes run in your family? Does sugar make you hyper? If so, you should avoid sugar as much as possible.
 Do you have a history of many tooth cavities, or want to avoid them? Again, sugarless gum may be for you.
 Have you had allergic reactions to artificial sweeteners? If so, and you also want to avoid sugar, so you must decide: How bad is your reaction to artificial sweeteners, compared to wanting to avoid cavities, etc. You may decide to avoid gum altogether.
 If you have a history of smoking, and want to stop, you might want to try a type of nicotine gum. This can help you in quitting smoking.
 If you wear dentures or braces, and regular gum sticks to them, consider trying gum specially made for them, as they are less sticky.
 Sugarless gum isn't for you then, instead go for gum with sugar, but limit your chewing and brush after chewing.

 Open up your binder or turn it all the way inside out when you want to pull out an existing spine label. Then turn the binder upside down so that the opening of the plastic is on the bottom.


If your spine label is small, thin, and loose enough, it may easily fall right out when the binder is turned upside down.
You can also use a ruler in the same way as you did to open up the plastic before inserting. Do this if you find that the existing label is stuck to the plastic or to the inside surface of the binder.
 Slide a thin post-it note between your label and the binder, with the sticky side facing the label. Press firmly to make sure it sticks, then pull the label out using the post-it as a pull tab.If you don’t have a thin sized post-it note, just cut a strip off of a larger one, making sure that the strip has one sticky end.
Pull very gently on the post-it, as you don’t want it to simply come off your label instead of bring it out. If it seems like the label is stuck in the plastic, make sure you have your binder open or inside out, and slide in a ruler if you can to loosen it.
 Avoid the problem of not being able to get a spine label out by making a pull tab for any new one you put in. Just fold over a small piece of tape and attach it to the top of the label before you put it in.Use clear tape to create the pull tab. Fold a piece over so that only part of the sticky side stays uncovered. Stick this part to the top and back of the label so that the tab sits just outside of the plastic cover on the spine.
To remove your label, just pull on the tab and the whole label will slide right out.

 Older women in your family know exactly what you are going through. If you haven't already done so, let them know that you got your period. It may feel awkward to talk about this, but remember this is a normal part of growing up.


Your female family members care about you and are there to help you through this time in your life. They will have good advice and can help you get all of the period supplies that you need.
Ask about their experiences of dealing with their period when they were younger., A health care professional is the best place to ask questions and learn about your period. You might wonder if what you are experiencing is normal. Some girls feel more comfortable talking to a doctor than a family member.


If you have not started your period, your doctor can give you a physical exam and estimate when you may start.
Talk about any of your worries or concerns. For example, if your period is erratic (doesn't come regularly), heavy, or causes you pain, it is a good idea to talk this sort of problem through with someone who has answers.
Make list of questions that you would like to ask and take your list with you to your doctor's appointment. This will help you remember your questions if you get nervous.
 Your family or doctor will not be with you when you are at school. Think about a female teacher, school nurse, or guidance counselor that you feel comfortable with. This person can be a resource for you if you need some help while you are at school.It is important for you to identify this person before you need any help so you will know exactly where to go.
Your parent could send a note to this person that lets them know that you have started your period and may come to them if you need some assistance while you are at school.

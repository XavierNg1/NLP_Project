 This can get a little messy (especially if there are children around), so lay down some newspapers, put away any objects you don't want to get gooey, and grab your essentials. You'll need:


A small natural object (shell, leaf, bone, etc.)
Petroleum jelly
Plaster of Paris
Water
Small disposable dish or Tupperware container (such as a margarine tub);
, Any object from nature works -- shells, leafs, and animal bones are all good choices. If you do choose a leaf, make sure it's not dry and crackly. It must also fit in your container!

, This will keep the object from sticking to the plaster when you try to remove it. Coat it thoroughly!

, Follow the directions on the plaster of Paris packaging. Mix them together thoroughly and let the concoction sit for a few minutes without stirring.


You should need about 2x more water than plaster, but you can adjust the ratio as you see fit.
 Be careful not to push too hard! Now your part is done; all it has to do is dry. Set it aside and revisit it tomorrow; drying will take at least one day.
 After you've waited 24 hours, pop your natural item out of the plaster of Paris and voila! There's your fossil! It's just like a shell was enveloped in soil for thousands of years, disintegrated, and left behind this image.

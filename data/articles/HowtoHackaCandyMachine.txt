 Use strong double stick tape to attach the coin to the knob. If the tape is strong enough, the coin won't drop or be pulled off as intended, so it can be reused for multiple pieces of candy.;
, This will only work on a low-quality machine or a machine that has not been properly put together, so just try this once and move on if it doesn't work.Put your coin in the slot, and turn the knob very slowly. Listen for a click as the machine releases a piece of candy, then turn the knob back to its original position.If the machine's wheels are misaligned, the coin will still be there, so you can repeat this motion.
 You'll need the smallest one you can find, or a similar thin, rigid object such as a file or large paper clip. Stick the tool into the top of the slot, where the coin would normally fall when the knob is rotated. Probe around for a small plastic catch and push it upward. This should let you rotate the knob without putting in a coin., If your candy machine is the type that lets you pick up candy with a claw, you typically get several tries per coin, but only until you earn one item. If you catch the item before it hits the bottom of the dispenser, the machine won't detect the item, and will give you the maximum number of tries before you need to put in another coin.

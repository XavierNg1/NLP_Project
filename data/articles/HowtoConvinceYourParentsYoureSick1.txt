 If you’re actually sick but your parents are skeptical, the best way to convince them is to concretely show how sick you are. By being forthcoming with your symptoms, you show that you have nothing to hide, making them more likely to trust you. You don’t want to emphasize on them too much, just make your parents aware.


For example, if you’ve had to wake up in the middle of the night to vomit, it’s important to mention that.;
, It’s tempting to make your symptoms sound worse than they are if you want to be convincing. It might work, but if it doesn’t, your parents will be hesitant to believe you’re actually sick. Be upfront and honest, don’t try to fake anything.


For instance, don’t try to force your scratchy throat into sounding more serious. If you’re having trouble swallowing, simply tell your parents. Since you’ll likely be avoiding food anyway, they’ll be more inclined to believe you.
 If your parents aren’t easily convinced, they’ll try and get you to double back on your words. They might try and trap you or make you slip up. If you’re sick enough to need to skip a particular event, stay confident in that fact. If they see that you don’t back down and are secure in what you say, they’ll be more likely to believe you.


If you’re intent on missing a family gathering, you might want to specify that not only are you feeling ill, you’d rather not get anyone sick. If you’re particularly contagious, your parents will understand.

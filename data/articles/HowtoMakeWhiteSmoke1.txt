 For this experiment, you will need a large bucket. You will need water. You will need a lighter, a pack of matches, or a fire igniter. Finally, you will need 5-10 pieces of plain printer paper.;
, Fill your large bucket with water and place it outside. Make sure it is not located near wood, paper or dry grass. For example, a driveway, parking lot, or gravel alley may be the most fire safe place to complete this experiment.
 Roll several pieces of white computer paper as tightly as you can into a single tube. If you wish, you may secure them at one end with a rubber band a quarter of the way down the tube.For peak scientific precision, use a pencil to mark the quarter and halfway points along the tube. This will show you how much of the tube to burn.
 Hold your paper tube by its rubber-banded end over the bucket of water. Light the end that is furthest from you. You should see flame, but no smoke. Allow it to burn into a quarter or a half of the paper has burned away, then gently blow it out.Watch out for stray bits of paper. If you see any, stamp on them or drip water on them so that no fires start.
 After you have blown out the fire, your tube should give off white smoke for a minute or so. The white smoke is the result of burning cellulose that releases water droplets and unburned fuel from the paper.
 You may burn it and blow it out until you are satisfied. Do not burn the paper once you can no longer hold it above the rubber band. Drop the paper in the water bucket before it gets too close to your hand.


Make sure to soak the paper in water when you're done with it to avoid starting a fire.
To produce black smoke, burn the end with the rubber band. It will smell horrible.

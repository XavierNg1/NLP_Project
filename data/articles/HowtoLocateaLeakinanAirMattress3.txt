 You should do this with the mattress still fully inflated.Even a pinhole can become visible when a mattress is inflated.
Do this in an area where you have plenty of light.
Do this systematically. First, inspect the top of the mattress, then the sides, than the underside.
Make sure you visually inspect the seams of the mattress, as this is a common area for tears.
 Often, you may feel the escaping air "brush" against your skin. br>


You can wet your hand with cold water first. Escaping air will increase the evaporation rate from your skin and make it feel colder.
Pass your hand slowly along the surface of the mattress. If you move too quickly, you might not pick up on the subtle sensation of escaping air.
 Move your head along the surface with your ear near the mattress.Your ear is more sensitive to feeling escaping air. Escaping air will also make a hissing sound.
Listening for escaping air is more effective in finding large holes or leaks rather than small ones.
Listen especially carefully around the seams of the mattress, as this is the most common area for leaks.
 You will then be able to locate the leak when you go to patch it.


Some manufacturers will provide instructions on how to patch a leak. Others will ask that you send the mattress to them for repair.
Don't attempt to patch your mattress without proper instructions from the manufacturer. Different materials may require different methods.
Once you locate one leak, inspect the rest of the mattress. There may be more than one hole or tear contributing to the problem.

 For this method, you need to get vitamin C in the form of a pill, capsule, or powder. You also need to get a bottle of your favorite shampoo, a comb, a towel, and a shower cap.


If you have capsule pills, you should pop them open to get the vitamin C powder out of them. If you have the pill, you need to grind them into a powder. You can do this by hand or with a grinder or blender., You need to mix the vitamin C with your shampoo. Measure 1 tablespoon of the vitamin C in a non metal bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of your shampoo. Mix them together, forming a paste. If the paste is too thin, add in more vitamin C until you get a thicker paste.If you have long or thick hair, you may need to double or triple the recipe. You will need enough to completely saturate your hair with the mixture.
 Sit in the bathroom with a towel around your neck. Wet your hair thoroughly with warm water and ring out the excess. Take the paste and start lathering your hair from root to tip. Use the comb to help the paste get to all the parts of your hair. Once you are sure that you have covered all of your hair, put your hair into a shower cap. Let it sit for an hour.If your hair is long, clip it up before you put on the shower cap so your hair will stay up.
 After the hour has past, rinse your hair completely to remove all the lather from your hair. Let it dry. Once it is completely dry, condition your hair with a deep conditioning treatment to help put back some of the moisture that was removed during the process. If you still have some black left, redo this process a few days later. Once you get all the black removed, you can dye it the brown shade of your choosing.


Make sure you give your hair some time to recuperate before you try it again. The acid in the vitamin C makes your hair susceptible to damage, so waiting will allow your hair time to regain its natural oils before you start again.

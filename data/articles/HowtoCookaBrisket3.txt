 Remove and discard the "fat cap" from the brisket with a chef's knife.
 Use a sharp chef's knife to carve the brisket while it is still warm. You need to cut against the grain of the meat, not with the grain.
 You can pour the juices from the roasting pan into a small gravy dish. The juice should be poured over the brisket a few slices at a time for serving.
 Leftover brisket will keep in the refrigerator for several days. You can also place cooled slices of brisket in a freezer bag and keep the meet for 2 - 3 months.

 Fluttershy always looks out for those who need her, and she is never, ever mean to anyone. Compliment your friends on things they do well, and even if they don't do it well, don't insult them. Babysit or pet sit; looking out for those who are small is important. If kids or animals drive you crazy, or if you are impatient, maybe you should try another pony.
 Fluttershy can be quite the fury, but it takes a lot to make her mad. Don't lose your patience, just breathe deep, count to ten, and imagine a beautiful forest. Try to remain graceful and serene, unless someone bullies your friends and they need your help!

, Fluttershy loves nature and flowers, and gardening is great. Know your backyard, look for berries, and learn the names of trees. Try to keep pets. If you can't, volunteer at an animal shelter so you can be around them more.
 She is quite a quiet type, so speak softly. Also, use words such as "oh my", "oh dear", or "lovely". Avoid expletives and inappropriate language at all times. And watch where you step. You will not be known as clumsy, and looking at the floor also adds to the "quiet" image.
 Try lilac eyeshadow and mascara for long eyelashes and wide eyes. Butterfly or flower accessories are good and observe Kawaii and more girl fashion closely. Ballet flats, little sweaters, and flowing skirts are all brilliant.
 She is like that but doesn't be annoying. Don't become someone you are not. Be yourself with just a hint of inspiration.

 You will need about 5 coins to start but it is very easy. First go to the southeast part of the mining area in Varrock. Once you’ve picked all the redberries off the two bushes, switch worlds. Return and repeat until your inventory is full. Then go to the bank in east Varrock and bank all your redberries. Keep doing that until you have 100-1000 redberries. When you’re satisfied, go to Draynor Village, take out all of your money and as many redberries as you can (not noted), and go to Aggie the witch (the building next to the wise old man’s house). Right click on Aggie the witch and click make-dyes. Repeat until all your redberries are dyes. Bank you dyes and repeat the whole process again if desired. You can sell the dyes at the Grand Exchange for about 1000 coins apiece.
 One steel bar can make 15 nails, and one nail sells for 34 gp at the Grand Exchange. But turning a bar into nails, you can increase its value to 510 coins. Since members use steel nails to make the majority of the things in their houses, nails always sell quickly.
 Get grapes and sell them in the Grand Exchange for around 1,200gp each. Cooked apples are around 200gp. To get more money, you have to bring a bucket with you. Make apple pies (all of the ingredients are in the guild) and sell them raw for around 1k each

 Make a batch of cupcakes with white icing, and use a different colored icing to pipe the person's name on them, with one letter on each cupcake. Arrange the cupcakes in order and use them as the centerpiece at a birthday party.
 For a fun summer treat, skip the traditional icing and use ice cream instead. Let the ice cream soften in the container for a few minutes, then use a knife to spread it onto the cupcakes, just like you would for icing. Serve immediately.
 Use pretzel halves and chocolate candies to create miniature butterflies on cupcakes. After you've baked and iced the cupcakes, use a line of candies to make the butterfly's body, then stick two pretzel "wings" on either side.
 Draw hearts, flowers or other designs on pieces of thick paper, then cut them out and tape them to the top section of toothpicks. Stick them in the cupcakes to serve as festive "flags."

, Experiment with different tips and icing stiffness! Try techniques such as roses, borders, swirls, loops, and flowers.

 Every song has a beat, or a steady pulse. As you listen to the song, tap your toes or snap your fingers along to the beat.Let's use Old McDonald as an example. As you listen to or sing the song, you would tap your toes at the words "Old" + "Mc" + "Don-" + "ald" + "Had" + "A" + "Farm" "(rest)".
Remember, beats are grouped into measures. The time signature at the start of the piece determines how many beats appear in each measure and which type of note receives the beat. Sometimes a note falls on the beat, other times a rest lands on the beat., Measures, or bars, group beats together. Each measure contains the same number of beats. As you listen to the song, keep your ear tuned to the start of a new measure, or bar. This is usually indicated by a strong emphasis on a note (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 | ). The emphasis is usually something you "feel."

"Old" + "Mc" + "Don-" + "ald" | "Had" + "A" + "Farm" + "(rest)" |
On a musical score, a single vertical line separates one measure from another.
If the time signature changes in the middle of the song, the number of beats in each bar will change too., Once you've divided the beats into even measures, count the number of beats between each set of bars. This number will be the top number of the time signature.


In Old McDonald, there are four beats per measure.
 Figuring out the bottom number requires some guess work. Base your guess on the speed of the song's beats. If the beats seem slow, the bottom number is probably "2". If the beats seem fast, the bottom number is likely "8". If the beats seem to pass at a medium speed (60 beats per minute), the bottom number is probably "4".


In Old McDonald, the beats pass at a medium rate. The bottom number is "4".

 Grenades are usually readily available on most levels and areas, and they re-spawn quickly as well. Plasma grenades are the ideal choice for grenade jumpers as frag grenades are harder to throw and jump off since they 'bounce' away from you, although it is still possible to use them. Avoid using spike grenades as the explosive spikes they shoot will probably kill you rather than boost you.;
, Containers or walls are a good size to practice grenade jumping on as they are too high to reach with jumping alone, but can easily be reached with a grenade jump.
 again, this is easier with a plasma grenade since it doesn't 'bounce' away like a frag grenade. However, you can use a frag grenade if you aim it carefully so that it stops moving where you need to jump from at the object's base.
 Do not jump too late and don't jump too early - doing this will most likely result in your death as you'll be too close to the grenade's blast radius to survive. However, if you manage to time your jump correctly, then the blast from the grenade's explosion will catapult you upwards rather than kill you.
 the ledge or area you were trying to reach with the grenade jump) and land your grenade jump. Congrats! You just grenade jumped!

, The first few times you may find yourself getting blown to bits or not jumping high enough. But practice grenade jumping enough, you'll find it easier and easier to do. Practicing works exceptionally well if you are trying to master frag-grenade jumping, as you won't have to rely on plasma grenades alone to grenade jump.

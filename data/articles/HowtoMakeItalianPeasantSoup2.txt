 Open two 15-ounce (425 g) cans of cannellini beans and dump them into a mesh strainer. Rinse the beans with cold water and measure out 1 1/2 cups (425 g) of the beans. Put these into a small prep bowl and mash them with a fork.Set the mashed and remaining beans aside while you saute the vegetables.
 Pour 1 teaspoon of the extra-virgin olive oil into a Dutch oven or soup pot. Turn the heat on to medium. Cut one medium onion in half and then slice it. Add the sliced onion to the pot and saute it for 2 to 3 minutes. Shred half a head of Savoy cabbage (so you have 4 cups or 400 g) and add it to the pot. Stir in 3 cloves of minced garlic and saute the mixture for another 2 to 3 minutes.The cabbage will wilt and the garlic should become fragrant.
 Pour in three 14.5 ounce (428 ml) cans of vegetable broth. Add the mashed beans and the reserved whole beans. Turn the heat up to medium-high, so the soup begins to bubble gently. Turn the heat back down to medium-low and simmer the soup for 10 to 12 minutes.Prop a lid on the pot, so only a little steam escapes.
Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.
 Get out eight pieces of day-old whole-wheat country bread. They should each be about 1/2-inch (12 mm) thick. Toast the bread under a broiler or in a toaster. Immediately rub half of a garlic clove over each piece of toast.You could also use a rustic white bread or large baguette.
 When you're ready to serve the soup, place a piece of garlic toast into each serving bowl. Pour soup over the toast and sprinkle each bowl with some grated fontina or Parmesan cheese. Drizzle just a little of the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over each bowl and serve the soup right away.To get eight servings of soup, you'll need 1 cup (108 g) of grated fontina cheese or Â½ cup (50 g) of shredded Parmesan cheese.

 Ensure that your hands are wet, but never dripping, at all times. This is to avoid the rice sticking on your fingers and palms.;
, Cover the nori sheet, placed on a bamboo sheet, and spread the rice evenly.
 Fold the other half of the bamboo sheet over the rice and flip the sushi upside down.


The rice part should now be on the bamboo sheet and the nori facing you.
 Use a very small amount of wasabi in a horizontal line in the center of the nori sheet.



Lay the cucumber strips on top of the wasabi line in a row.
Layer half of the salmon on top of the cucumber.
Add two slices of avocado last.
 Place your thumbs over the side of the bamboo mat closest to you, and your fingers on the toppings to keep them in place. Roll the sushi over to cover the toppings and then continue to roll.
 Use the prawns, the rest of the avocado and salmon, and sea bass to layer a colorful presentation.
 Cover the sushi roll with your bamboo mat. Gently press down to allow the toppings to "stick" on the rice.
 Wet a sharp knife and use one quick, but sharp motion to cut the sushi in half. Place the two halves alongside each other and cut them into four pieces.


Using straight and quick cuts will give you, not only perfect slices, but also won't dull into and snag the nori. Snagging the nori while cutting will flop the roll and tumble the fillings and rice.
 Put your sushi onto a serving plate and add a very small amount of wasabi onto the top of each small roll.
 Place a slice of radish on top of the wasabi and garnish with salmon, tobiko roe and a sprinkle of watercress. Serve with soy sauce on the side.

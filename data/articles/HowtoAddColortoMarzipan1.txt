 Make or use pre-made marzipan. Portion off the amount of marzipan you want to color.Allow the marzipan to come to room temperature so the texture is soft and workable.Knead a few drops of corn syrup into the dough if it still seems stiff.Divide the marzipan based on the number of colors you will be using.;
, Use food coloring paste for darker colors or food coloring liquid for lighter colors., Since mixing color into marzipan is a hands-on process, you will want to take measures so that the food coloring does not stain your handsor clothes.Put on disposable food preparation gloves.
If you prefer working without gloves, use a dab of shortening on your hands. Shortening will keep your hands moist and also helps prevent the dye from staining your skin.Wear an apron or smock to protect your clothing.
 For deep or dark colors, add powdered food coloring in with the liquid or paste so that the marzipan does not become sticky and difficult to work with., You can always add more coloring if desired.You can experiment with achieving different hues by adding dabs of multiple colors., Continue kneading until the color is consistent and free from streaks.If the color is darker or richer than you want it to be, you can add more marzipan to lessen the hueâ€™s intensity.If you are using food coloring paste, its color may shift as it dries, so mix it into the marzipan at least 15 minutes before settling on the final color., You can smooth out any cracks that form in the marzipan by rubbing a little bit of water on them., Dip a paintbrush into the food coloring liquid or paste. Use your paintbrush to apply bold definition to the exterior of the marzipan.For example, paint markings onto petals or leaves.
You can use a toothpick instead of a paintbrush to get thin details like veining.

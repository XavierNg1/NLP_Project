 Before you get over-excited make sure you have the funds. There is nothing sadder than making plans before the cash can come to the party.;
, A lot of Australia can be surfed. Some of it's crowded though while other parts are shark havens. Then again, a lot of it's deserted, so you're just going to have to ask around and trust the locals. Good spots include:


Gold Coast (but crowded)
South Stradbroke Island
Bells Beach Victoria
Byron Bay
Sydney (the surf city in Australia).
 There is some great surf here, especially in the Eastern Cape province.


Try Jeffrey's Bay.
 If you don't already live or frequent this state, it's the state for surfing. The water tends to be cold and crowded but it's good surfing all the same.


Try Malibu, Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay and Steamer Lane.
 Bali has excellent waves, especially around the Bukit Peninsular. A major drawback though is the crowd likely to be sharing the beach with you, including people touting their wares.
 There are some good surf beaches around Joaquina Beach and Santa Catarina island.
 It has great beaches in many places. You may have difficulties getting around though, so be prepared for rough roads.
 Hawaii is well known for its great surfing beaches. The best beaches depend on the type of waves you're after. Good beaches include Sunset Beach, Pipeline, Waimea, Ala Moana, etc.
 Within any destination in any country, there will be better places to surf and not-so-great places to surf. Some of this will depend on the season, some on the nature of the sea, and some on whatever is happening with the local tourist industry. It pays to do very localized research once you've chosen a location so that you can find the best waves, at the best time of year, and try your absolute best to avoid the crowds.

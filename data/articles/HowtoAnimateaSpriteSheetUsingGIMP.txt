 PortableApps has a no-fuss, no-muss package that won't leave a mess in your hard drive.;
, Find a series of sprites that will make sense when viewed in sequence(usually a running animation).
 Make the selection only as big as it needs to be. You can change the size of the image later if necessary.
 Then press Ctrl+Shift+V to paste to a new image.
 You want to get rid of that or it'll look silly. First click the background color using the Select By Color tool, then press Delete. You should just have your sprite on a grey checkerboard(representing transparency).
 Copy and make sure that your working image is the one selected before using Paste As New Layer from the Edit menu.
 When you're satisfied with what you have, Pick Export from the File menu and save your animation as a GIF file.
 Then you will see another dialog box with more options. Change the Delay Between Frames option to your liking. A lower option means less delay between the display of each layer. Change the "Frame Disposal" option to "One Frame per Layer (replace)".

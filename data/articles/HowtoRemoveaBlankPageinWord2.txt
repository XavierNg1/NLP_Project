 Undeletable blank pages can occur in documents that end with tables. The table’s position requires Word to store the document’s formatting data in an empty paragraph just beneath the table.You can’t delete this paragraph, but you can reduce it to remove the blank page.


Try this method if you’re using a Word template (e.g., resumes, charts, pamphlets), as these typically contain tables.
 If you don’t see the tab at the top of the screen, click somewhere in the text just above the blank page and it should appear.
 The table settings will appear in the top bar.
, This will make a bunch of paragraph symbols (¶) appear on your page. Here’s how:Windows: Ctrl+⇧ Shift+8

Mac: ⌘ Cmd+8


, If you see more than one ¶, use your mouse to select them all., Now that the paragraph marker is selected, it’s time to change its font size.
 The box contains a number (e.g. 12), and is just beside the name of the font (e.g. Times New Roman).
 This will reduce the size of the hidden paragraph so it doesn’t require its own entire blank page. The blank page should disappear immediately.
 Now you can make those markers invisible again. Click the ¶ icon or use one of these keyboard shortcuts:


Windows: Ctrl+⇧ Shift+8

Mac: ⌘ Cmd+8

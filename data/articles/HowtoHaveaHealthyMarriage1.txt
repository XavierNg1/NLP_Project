 Intimacy does not just mean the sexual connection you have with your partner. You should communicate with your partner on how you define intimacy.This will help disperse miscommunication and help promote a more peaceful and respectful relationship.;
, Have a conversation about all the different types of intimacy you feel is in your relationship. Some may include:


Emotional (how you communicate feelings)
Sexual (the chemistry between you and your partner)
Intellectual (the exchange of thoughts and ideas between you and your partner).
 For example, consider:


How do you value the intellectual intimacy you have with your partner? Does your partner value intellect in the same way? If not, how does that make you feel?
How do you value the sexual intimacy you have with your partner? Does your partner value sexual intimacy in the same way? If not, how does that make you feel?
How do you value emotional intimacy you have with your partner? Does your partner value your feelings, or emotional intimacy, in the same way? If not, how does this make you feel?

, Intimacy, like many things in life, is a constant work in progress. To build a healthy relationship, be aware of how intimacy affects your daily life. Consider writing a diary or have daily conversations about intimacy. Consider answering the questions:


Has my partner met my intellectual needs today? How has he/hasnâ€™t he?
Has my partner met my sexual needs lately? If not, how can I discuss this with her in a respectful manner?
Do I feel safe sharing my feelings openly with my partner? Why or why not? Is this problematic?

 A shared printer is a printer that is connected to one of the computers on your network, and then made available to others. The computer that the printer is connected to must be powered on in order to print to it. Almost any printer can be shared on the network.
 Follow the steps in the first section to install the USB printer as you normally would.


The computer that you install the printer on will need to be powered on whenever another computer on the network wants to print to it.
 Select System Preferences.
 This lets you change the sharing settings for your computer.
 This will allow OS X to share connected printers with other computers.
 The printer will now be accessible to other computers on the network.
 You will need to add the printer on the second computer so that it can be selected when printing.
 This will show you a list of your currently connected printers.
 This will allow you to add more printers.
 If you are trying to connect to a printer shared from a Windows computer, click the "Windows" tab.
 Your network printer will be installed on the second computer, and you will be able to select it from the print menu in any program. The computer that the printer is connected to must be turned on and logged in.

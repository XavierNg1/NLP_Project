 The tiny grains of table salt clump tumble quickly out of the shaker, easily over-salting the dish. The larger crystals of kosher salt are much easier to control. You will need a larger volume to get the same flavor, since kosher salt is more loosely packed.Stick to table salt for baking. You need small crystals to dissolve in dough., When sprinkling on salt, hold your fingers about 10 inches (25cm) above the food. The salt will spread more evenly across the dish. Your guests will appreciate the lack of salty clumps., Salt a little at the time, every time you add a new (non-salty) ingredient. Taste frequently to keep track of how the flavor is developing. It's much easier to adjust halfway through the process than five minutes before serving time.
 Remember that the soup you're seasoning will be a lot stronger after the water's boiled away for half an hour. Go light on the salt at first, and add more to taste once the soup is closer to its final volume.

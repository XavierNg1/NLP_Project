  The elastic won't dye, but everything else will. You should get four to six pairs of underpants per package. 


Check your size before purchasing. Consider going one size larger in case they shrink.
Pre-wash the underwear and remove any stickers.;
, You can buy the soda ash at a craft store. Soda ash helps the dye to work better. Soak all the clothes for at least 20 minutes, and stir. You can also add a little salt. When you are ready to dye, squeeze out the water.
 Get everything handy to dye. If you want the same results each time, use measuring cups. The other items needed are listed in Things You'll Need below.
 Procion is one good choice but other brands of dye will do. If you want, you can buy pre-mixed dyes.


Remember the rules: Red and blue make purple, yellow and blue make green and red and yellow make orange. If you mix, say red and green, you will get a funky brown.
 For example, a spiral can be made by making a circle twisted in the middle. There are many ideas for folds, tying, and wrapping; experiment a little to find the designs that you like the most.
  This technique uses very little water. Think of it as just a puddle of color. Separate the folds and add more dye if you want more color, otherwise there could be too much white left after dyeing.
 You can use a dye in concentrated form or sprinkle the dry power for intense color. Allow the dyed underwear to sit in plastic bags or glass jars until all of the dye is absorbed into the cloth. 


Follow the package instructions for the particular dye you've chosen.
 Rinse in flowing water until all the excess dye is washed out.
 Wash using a gentle hand wash cycle. Use a very mild soap. 

, When dried, you will have some great new underwear.

 Under running tap water, lightly rinse the entire batch to allow any dirt particles to wash off. It's easier to do everything at once instead of one at a time.;
, Pat the fruit dry with paper towels to soak up any excess water.
 Position the strawberries horizontally and slice the tops off with a sharp knife, so that you end up with a clean and flat top.
 You can leave them whole, but cutting them will allow the maximum amount of flavor to soak in.
 The most basic and easiest approach is to use two tablespoons of sugar per pound (450g) of strawberries.For variations, try one of the following suggestions:


1/2 cup simple syrup for 2 cups strawberries2 tablespoons Cointreau and 2 tablespoons icing sugar (sifted) for 2 cups strawberries1/4 cup honey and 4 tablespoons orange flavored liqueur for 2 pints (2 cups whole) strawberries., Prepare your mixture in a separate bowl before adding the strawberries.
 Add the strawberries to the marinade bowl. Make sure the fruit is fully covered in the mixture.
 Leave it alone at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes.
 Having the strawberries soak in the flavors, especially a honey or orange liqueur, already makes them sweet to enjoy by themselves. The syrup that forms will make them a dessert in their own right.
 Enhance your favorite desserts such as ice cream, cheesecake, or dessert pies. (You may need to drain off some of the syrup, depending on what you're adding the strawberries to.)

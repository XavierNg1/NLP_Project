 Use the vinegar and water solutions in the proportions above and a clean rag. Dip the rag in the solution in the bucket and wring it out entirely so it is only a damp. Rub the floor with the damp rag, working in sections. Wet the rag as often as needed as you cover the floor.Alternatively, clean using the vinegar in the spray bottle and a clean rag. Spray the vinegar and water solution on the floor and wipe it up with your rag.
Dry the floor as you go with a clean rag.
 Spray a solution of white vinegar and water in the ratios above on tough, sticky messes. Next, scrub the mess with a scrubbing sponge. Only use a semi-abrasive pad. Finally, wipe up the mess with warm water and dry the floor completely with a clean rag.
 Add 3 teaspoons (14.786 mL) of white vinegar to every 16 ounces (473.176 mL) of distilled water you use in your steam mop. Trigger the steam infrequently to prevent getting your floor too wet. If possible, lift the mop off the floor when you trigger the steam so it just lightly wets the cleaning cloth. Wipe any moisture off the floor with a clean towel or rag after steam cleaning your hardwood floor.

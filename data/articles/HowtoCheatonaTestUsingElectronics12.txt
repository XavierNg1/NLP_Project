 This involves wearing a tiny micro earpiece that sits hidden inside the ear-channel. This will wirelessly connect to an inductive transmitter which is hidden on your person somewhere, usually a neckloop to be worn under the clothes or even a bluetooth pen or stylish glasses! The inductive transmitter will in turn connect to a mobile phone or MP3 player in your pocket.


Like the MP3 player method above, you can record information and play it back to yourself, the difference being there is no wired earphone, if you go for the bluetooth option then the connection is completely wireless and undetectable. The other option is to make a call before you enter your exam, then communicate with someone via the earpiece and a microphone that is built into the inductive transmitter.

 Communication is key in any successful relationship. We have all heard this several times through life but this is a statement that applies more than the average clich√©. When the lines of communication are not kept open, you will find yourself in a situation where you may have feelings of mistrust and resentment. As human beings with different outlooks and personalities, it is easy to misconstrue the message that we are getting from another person. It is also just as easy for another to mistake your good intentions for something else. These pent up feelings and grudges are not productive in the workplace. The lack of communication is often the number one culprit in the failure to complete projects.
 When addressing any work-related issue, you want to take care not to be confrontational, as that in turn causes the other person to become defensive. Make a suggestion or offer a solution as opposed to simply telling them what they are doing wrong. It is not a character flaw to make a mistake. In other words, do not attack the character of your coworker. Make a suggestion about how the job can be made easier. Remember, it is not always what you say but how you say it.
 If you are in a position of leadership, or just working with a great coworker, let him know that his efforts are appreciated and that you recognize that they have done a superb job playing a key role in the success of the group or organization. Praise is always well received, and often appreciated when coupled with constructive criticism.

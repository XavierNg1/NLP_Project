 This works best if you have no products in your hair. The hair should have been washed today or yesterday.


If fresh from the shower, wait until your hair mostly dries, about 15–20 minutes (30–45 minutes for thick hair). You may use a blow dryer to speed this up.
If your hair is dry, mist it with a spray bottle full of water. Do not soak your hair, but move hair with your fingers to distribute an even layer of mist throughout.;
, If your hair is severely tangled, comb it now. You will not be brushing or combing it after the scrunching. If your hair is mostly fine, skip this step, since combing can make it harder to scrunch.
 Sit down, bend over at your waist, and pull all your hair forward. Stay in this position, with your hair hanging towards the floor.


If you get dizzy at any point, sit up slowly.
 Once your hair is slightly damp, cup the ends of your hair in your palm and move your hand upward while gripping the hair tighter as you go along. Hold it there for a few moments, then gently let it fall as though you're curling your hair with an iron. Repeat, squeezing sections all over your head until your hair feels dry.


If you'd like, you can add hairspray to keep the shape.
 Shake your hair and flip it back while sitting up again. If necessary, squeeze waves of hair at their roots and scrunch all the hair into place. Do not comb or brush the hair.


If your hair begins to flatten during the day, lightly mist sections with water, bend over, and scrunch again to refresh the waves.

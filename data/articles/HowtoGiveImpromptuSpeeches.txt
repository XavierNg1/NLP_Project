 By definition, impromptu speeches happen without warning, but the very nature of your initial invitation (before the impromptu invitation) may give you a chance to think ahead. There are three common impromptu speeches: birthdays, toasts, and "vote of thanks".;
, Even impromptu speeches rarely come with no warning. Even if you only have 2-3 minutes, write 3 points on the back of a napkin, written large, so you can read it while standing. You should feel you can confidently speak on each point for at least one minute, from experience. If not, you have picked the wrong three points.
 "I'm glad we're all gathered here today, even if Gillian did spring this speech thing on me..."

, Make it relevant. A builder talking to doctors may seem to have little common ground, until you point out that both professions have to deal with problems and people, e.g. "You know, we have a lot in common. Every day I'm dealing with troublesome inanimate objects which I call carpentry but you call patients." "And there is nothing more satisfying than fixing some slippery sucker with a nail gun." The audience has now warmed to your theme!

, Or, you might spend 2 minutes exploring it and 2 minutes debunking it.
 In a moment a tweet, video or other medium can send your statement viral. A reputation takes years to earn and milliseconds to burn.
, Return to acknowledge the audience, organisation, or key person/s at the event. If you have contrasted your experience with that of the audience, allow yourself to come of "just-so" slightly worse, as this humility will endear you to your audience. You want to finish with a bang, not a whimper and sometimes speeches have a "natural stop point" even if this leaves some things unsaid.

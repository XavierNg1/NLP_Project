 It might seem hurtful and mean, but it is necessary in order to make people underestimate you. Try to twist the truth instead of changing the truth completely, so you'll feel better about lying.
 Don't tell them what you do in your free time or anything else that will make them suspicious. Try not to host parties or invite people over unless you really trust them not to let the cat out of the bag. If possible, go somewhere private and secluded in order to be yourself.
 Doing so will press you to act innocent and make people think that you're not as useless and incapable as you seem.

 By pouring the water first, you avoid the risk of concentrated phenyle solution splashing back on you. You can use hot or cold water. Tap water is acceptable to use.
 One benefit to black phenyle as a disinfectant is that you only need a small amount. A ratio falling between 1:256 and 1:64 black phenyle to water is appropriate. Pour the phenyle into the water.You will only need to add between 4 milliliters (0.14  fl oz) and 15 mL of black phenyle solution to 1 L of water to have the desired disinfecting properties.
 The solution should have a cloudy white color. After stirring for ten to twenty seconds, let the solution sit. After approximately five minutes, stir the solution again and it is ready to use.

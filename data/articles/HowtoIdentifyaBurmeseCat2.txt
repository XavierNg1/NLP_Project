 Burmese cats are generally healthy, though they might be prone to gingivitis. They might also be predisposed to an inheritable condition known as hypokalemia, or low potassium. This condition causes weakness in the skeleton. It could cause localized weakness or fragility (for instance, weakness in the cat’s back or limbs), or it might be throughout the whole skeleton.Cats with hypokalaemia will require potassium supplements.
Your breeder should screen for this test before you obtain the cat from them.

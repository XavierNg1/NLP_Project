 Look for Memopal from the Start menu under “All Programs,” and click on it.
 Click on the Dashboard tab on Memopal to go to the Dashboard view.
 You can only share one file at a time, since each public link to be generated can only refer to a single file.
 Do this by dragging and dropping the file on the application interface. The file will be uploaded to Memopal, and a public link will be generated for it. A small window will appear with the file’s public link or URL.
 Click on the “Copy” link, and then the close button, to copy the public link to your clipboard. You can now paste this on your email or IM clients, or post it on Facebook or Twitter. Anyone who has access to this link can now access your file.


To download the file, enter the public link on the address bar. The file’s page will load. Once it loads completely, click on the “Download” button to download the file.

 If you use a conversion website you'll need to upload the video first. Even if the conversion website doesn't have a size limitation (and many do), the upload process alone could take hours. If you have a long video file to convert, consider using Handbrake or VLC.
 Popular conversion sites include:


video.online-convert.com
files-conversion.com
zamzar.com

, Click the button to select a file on your computer. Some sites may allow you to select files stored in Dropbox or Google Drive.


The upload process may take a long time to complete.
 Most conversion sites allow you to select from a variety of outputs. Make sure that you have "MP4" selected.
 Once you have uploaded the video, you'll need to wait for it to convert. The time it takes to convert varies from site to site. The size of the video will affect conversion times. You'll either be shown or emailed a download link when it's finished.

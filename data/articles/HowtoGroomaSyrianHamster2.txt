 Making a container of chinchilla sand available to your hamster will help keep it clean and groomed. This product is readily available at pet supply stores., A bowl made of a hamster-safe material such as terra cotta is ideal. Place enough chinchilla sand in the bowl so that it is about one-half to three-quarters full. That way, your hamster will be able to easily climb in and out of the bowl., Your hamster should be able to freely access the bowl of chinchilla sand, and it is perfectly safe to leave the bowl in its cage. Setting the bowl near the hamsterâ€™s exercise wheel can encourage it to use the sand., Many hamsters will roll around in the chinchilla sand, using it as a dust bath. This will keep their fur clean and free of greasy buildup. Some hamsters may use the sand bowl as a litterbox. Otherwise, it is fine to reuse the sand as long as it is not soiled.

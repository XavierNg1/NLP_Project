 Make sure you're buying your produce from a reputable seller such as a registered organic grocer or an organic farm/collective food box deliverer.;
, The great thing about making your own baby food is that you can make a large enough quantity to last multiple meals. Buy some small storage containers as well as a blender or hand whisk. You'll also need pots and pans to cook the food.
 You can do this easily by washing your containers and equipment as usual, then boiling them in a pan on the stove. Ensure that your containers and equipment are heat-safe; even plastic that doesn't appear warped can release toxins. Dry everything thoroughly and put it all together in a large, clean container.
 For a fast cooking time, chop everything into small bits. Simply cook them in boiling water on top of the stove or in the microwave. Once they are soft, remove them from the heat and water. Allow them to cool for a short period of time.
 Use either approach depending on you baby's age and preference; young babies should eat very smooth foods, while older babies can have food with more texture and lumps.
 You may want to cut off a piece and cook it in a separate dish if the main part of the meat is covered in herbs, spices etc. Once it's cooked, chop it into small bits and blend it with water.
 Many fruits such as bananas do not need to be cooked and can simply be blended or hand-mashed as is.


Be aware that banana and raw apple can turn brown quickly.
 Dispose of any uneaten leftovers from your baby's bowl. To prevent wastage, store just a small amount of food in separate, small containers; aim for one serve each. Keep them in the freezer for up to two months or the fridge 24 hours.

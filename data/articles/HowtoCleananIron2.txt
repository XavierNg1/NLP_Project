 You will heat this mixture on the stove over medium heat. Heat until the salt is dissolved, but avoid letting the vinegar come to a boil.








Unfortunately, the smell will probably be strong, but it will be a good cleaner for the iron.
 Leave the hot vinegar to cool down some. You want it to be warm, but not scalding hot.


Wear dish gloves to protect your hands from the smell of the vinegar.
 You will use the mixture to clean the plate of the iron by rubbing the cooled mixture on the bottom of the iron.








You can also use a soft brush to do this, unless you have a teflon coated iron as the brush may scratch the coating. Avoid using a wire brush as this will ruin the ironâ€™s plate.
This is a great way to get rid of scorch marks on the iron.
 After you are finished cleaning, you should remove any of the residue that might be leftover from the mixture. You can do this by dipping a clean rag into some white vinegar and gently cleaning the plate of the iron again.









After that, you can turn the iron on and run it over a piece of old, but clean cloth. This will help burn off any residue that might be left.

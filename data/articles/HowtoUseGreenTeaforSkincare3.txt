 You can purchase topical creams made with green tea formulas over-the-counter. These formulas may slow down the aging of skin. However, like most commercial antioxidant creams, it’s unclear how active the green tea polyphenols remain once the formula is exposed to air. Each product is different and they come in a wide range of potencies.Use the cream consistently – once or twice per day for several weeks – then evaluate your skin for the product’s effectiveness.Apply it after cleansing and toning your skin and before your moisturizer.
 The green tea itself doesn’t block UV rays, but because it neutralizes free radicals and reduces inflammation, it works hand-in-hand with sunscreen to enhance sun protection.

Apply the green tea formula before applying sunscreen.
Use a sunscreen that is zinc oxide-based to avoid chemical reactions between the two substances.
 Because the benefits of green tea are so well-documented, green tea has become a very popular ingredient in a variety of skin-care products. Face masks, scrubs, packs, eye compresses and bath soaks are all popular green tea products that may provide skin benefits.

Consuming green tea and applying the fresh, organic leaves topically are the most effective ways to use green tea for skin-care, but commercially available products are worth exploring.
If you find a product that seems to really work for you, incorporate it into your green tea skin-care routine, along with drinking it and using the leaves topically.

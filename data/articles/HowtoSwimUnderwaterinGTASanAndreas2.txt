 Head to any beach area found on the outer edges of the San Andreas map. This is the best place to practice your character’s swimming skill.


You can also do this on swimming pools found on various places in Las Venturas or in small lakes in the wilderness of San Fierro.
 Once you find a body of water, press the arrow keys on your Xbox controller to walk towards it (or jump). Once your character reaches a specific depth of water (at least above the waist), he will start swimming and will not drown like in the previous versions of the game.
 While your character is swimming, press the “B” button on the Xbox controller and your character will dive underwater. While submerged, press the arrow buttons toward the direction you want to go and your character will swim underwater.


Once your character dives underwater, a light blue life bar will appear on the top right-hand corner of the game screen. This is your oxygen level, indicating the time you can remain submerged.
 Always check your oxygen level. If it’s getting too low, resurface by releasing the “B” button.


If you remain underwater after the light blue bar has been emptied out, your character will drown.

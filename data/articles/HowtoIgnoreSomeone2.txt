 Using your phone will also help you ignore almost anyone. There are a few things you can do to ignore someone with your phone. First, you can just use the phone to look busy whenever you see that person. Talk to someone else on the phone, laughing wildly, or look engrossed in an intense text-message exchange with someone you actually want to talk to.


Change your phone number so the person can't call or text you.
Block that person's number from your phone so you can't receive messages from them.
Set an alarm on your phone to ring when you know you're near that person, so you can pick it up and pretend to be talking to someone.
 Invest in some headphones, and wear them at all times when you're alone, even if you're not listening to music. When you see that person, blast your music to deafening volumes and bounce your head to the beat, so you look completely absorbed in your tunes, with absolutely no time to waste on the person you're trying to ignore.


If you want to be really annoying, you can even close your eyes and sing along to the music, giving the person you're ignoring almost no chance to talk to you.
 Ignoring someone online is even easier than ignoring them in person because you don't have to physically avoid them. To ignore someone online, just make sure to avoid any of that person's emails, Facebook posts or messages, Twitter feeds, or any other attempts to contact you online.


Block that person from any of your social networks. Make sure he has no way of reaching out to you online.
Change your email address and other usernames if you have to. That person should have no way of contacting you online.

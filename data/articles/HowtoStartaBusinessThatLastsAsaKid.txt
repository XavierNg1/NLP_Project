 Think, "What am I good at? Do I make things well? Am I hard working?" Think of a product, a service, or a need that someone must fill.;
, Make it small, but allow yourself to work with it.
, How much do other people providing that service charge?

, If low on money from your idea, then use word of mouth by telling your parents to tell your friend's parents. Your friend's parents will tell other people until a lot of people know about your business. If you still have money, print fliers and banners.
 I sell at weekly markets, and that's where I advertise. If one of your parents owns a shop at the mall, see if they will allow you to sell in front of it for a price, or if they will let you use one day a week also for a price

, Price your services accordingly. Don't be outrageous. If you see someone doing the same service as you, check their prices and go a little lower than that at first. When you gain experience you can raise the price. Let's say you made everything for 10.00, then you want to make 5.00 profit and want to make more for 10.00. Then you would price it at 25.00.
 Make money and remember to keep some profit to buy more of your product, get more of your invention, or enhance your service. Goodbye and good luck! May the money be with you!

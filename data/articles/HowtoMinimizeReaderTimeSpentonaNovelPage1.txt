 Dialogue reads quickly, as it is usually short. It is also easier to read visually, as it is spaced out on the page more.


Plus, it’s easy for readers to skip over unnecessary words like “she said.”;
, You can use an occasional larger word, but don’t make it every other word. You don’t want your reader being confused all the time or having to stop to look up too many words.
 Long sentences require more attention and may even force your reader to re-read the page. It is easier to take in a whole sentence all at once if it is short.


For instance, saying, “Katy, who usually ate bananas at breakfast, decided she wanted a bigger meal to share with her friends before she went out to run errands” could be broken up into smaller sentences like “Katy usually ate bananas at breakfast. Today, though, she decided to make a bigger meal to share with her friends. Plus, it would keep her fueled through her errands.” Essentially, keep it to one big idea per sentence.
 Action passages tend to keep the reader more engaged than paragraphs of description. This does not mean that you should cut description out entirely, but you should consider limiting the amount of description you use and increasing the action of your story.

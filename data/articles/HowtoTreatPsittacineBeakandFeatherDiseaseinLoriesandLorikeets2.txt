 Do this as soon as you detect symptoms of PBFD. Maintain enough distance from healthy birds to prevent the spread of the virus through airborne dander. Keep the birds isolated for two months or as long as it takes to get them tested twice., In some cases, nutritional supplements can suppress the virus and allow your bird to live a long, healthy life. Typical regimens consist of vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. Ask your vet for specific recommendations and dosages.

If your bird appears to make a recovery, don't assume they're cured. They'll always be infected and should be kept away from other birds., Illness and feather loss can lower a bird's body temperature to dangerously low levels. Purchase an infrared light and a thermometer from your local pet store. Place the light one one side of the cage, so your bird can get to close to it and move away as needed. Maintain the temperature at 25–35 °C (77–95 °F) 24 hours a day., Because birds with PBFD have weakened immune symptoms, they can die from secondary infections if they're not treated promptly and aggressively. As soon as you see the telltale symptoms, contact your vet. Only they can make the proper diagnosis and prescribe the right treatments., If your bird's PBFD causes their beak to grow too long, it can affect their ability to eat. Don't try to trim the beak yourself. Take your bird to your vet for a safe and humane procedure.

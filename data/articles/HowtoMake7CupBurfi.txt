 First add the besan and ghee and stir till sweet aroma of ghee-fried besan comes removing the raw smell of besan. Then add the rest of the ingredients: cashew nut powder, grated coconut. Pour the milk and sugar. Place the kadai on high flame and also make sure that you check the time!;
, With a slotted ladle, keep stirring to mix in the flour well with all the ingredients. Remember the flame is high, so you have to keep stirring constantly to prevent the mixture from burning at the bottom.
 After 10 minutes, reduce the flame to low and continue stirring. You will find bubbles coming up and the mixture starts pulling away from the sides.


After 10 minutes, the batter consistency is thick and you can see the bottom.
 Immediately pour the batter on the greased plate. Holding on the sides of the plate so that you don't burn yourself, gently pat the plate on the floor. This way your mix gets spread evenly. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes, then with a greased knife make marks either as diamond or square.

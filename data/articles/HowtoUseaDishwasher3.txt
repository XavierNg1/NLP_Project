 To start, you want to scrub off the exterior of your dishwasher. This will remove things like spilled food and fingerprints. Plastic dishwashers should be wiped down with a sponge and soapy water. Stainless steel dishwashers should be wiped down using glass cleaner.If you're using glass cleaner, do not spray it directly on the dishwasher. Moisture can cause harm to electronic coils. Apply the glass cleaner to a paper towel or a rag first and then use that to wipe off smudges, spills, and fingerprints.
 Dishwashers have built-in filters that should be cleaned regularly to keep the dishwasher running smoothly. The filter is found on the bottom rack and can be easily pulled out. For precise instructions on removing your filter, refer to your dishwasher's instruction manual. Clean the filter in your sink. Use a sponge or the spray setting on your faucet to clean out food and debris stuck in the filter. When you're done, put the filter back in place.If you notice anything grainy, like coffee grounds, these can be cleaned out using a small brush.
 Take out any removable parts of your dishwasher, such as utensil holders. Transfer them to the sink and rinse out any stuck on food using tap water.If accessories are only mildly dirty, you may be able to remove foods with running water alone. You may need to use a brush or sponge to remove foods from very dirty filters.
 Before cleaning the tub, use paper towels to remove food scraps, dirt, and debris from the bottom of the dishwasher. Then, set a cup of white vinegar on the top rack of the dishwasher. Make sure the cup you use is dishwasher safe. Run a full cycle with the cup in place. This should clean and deodorize your dishwasher's interior.Wipe down the interior of the dishwasher with a paper towel after running a cleaning cycle.

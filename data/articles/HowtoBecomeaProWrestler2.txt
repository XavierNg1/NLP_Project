Most independent promotions have several wrestlers that are willing to train new wrestlers, but this training will most likely not come for free. It is not uncommon for a wrestling gym to charge over $100 per session.
Travel your state and find a wrestler that fits the style you want to wrestle in. Try to talk to the promoter of the company and let him/her know that you are interested in becoming a wrestler. Some promoters are nicer than others. While pro-wrestling can seem to be just like any other community-theatre, many "insiders" are not fond of letting new people into the business.

If you are rejected, take it in stride. Continue coming to shows or perhaps ask to help with the technical aspects of running the show or working on the security team. As wrestlers and promoters get to know you, they will be more open to talking and allowing you to train.

 Just because someone leaves something somewhere doesn't mean they've intended to rid themselves of it.


However, if someone intentionally abandons most kinds of personal property, they lose ownership of it. This must be a deliberate act.
In many states, a previous owner may come back and reclaim even intentionally abandoned property within a certain period of time.In the case of intangible property such as intellectual property, generally a period of time must pass during which the registered owner does nothing to control the property or limit access to it before it's considered abandoned., Typically the owner of the building or land where the property is left has a claim to the property that beats everyone but the true owner, even if you found it.


For example, if you find a wallet on a street, you may be entitled to keep it. If, however, you find that wallet in a coffee shop, the owner of the coffee shop may have a better claim to the wallet than you do. However, the original owner of the wallet always has the superior claim, and provided the wallet included some sort of ID, you could track down the original owner fairly easily., In some circumstances, you may be required by law to store the property for a period of time before you can claim it as your own.


For example, if tenants leave personal property behind after an eviction, landlords typically are required to store the property for a period of time and notify the former tenants that the property is being kept. If the former tenants return to reclaim their property, the landlord can charge them reasonable storage fees.The amount of time property must be held varies among states, but typically is less than a month. After that period passes, the landlord is free to sell the property, throw it away, or keep it for himself., If the true owner never reclaims the property, you are free to take it.

 Nearly everyone uses the arrow, which is insta-death, and if you are still you are an easy target. Keep on the move!;
, This will make you a harder target.
 You only have one shot with your arrow, make it count!

, If you "misfire" when you use your arrow, you'll have to kill someone with the sword to get it back. Try shooting bats in Survival or a moving mob.

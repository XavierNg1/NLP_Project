 Leave it on the side to allow the mixture to soften.;
, Let the mixture cool down before adding the yeast mixture to it.
, Add the rest of the liquid and continue to knead. You will know when the dough kneaded enough when long strands start to show.
 Thoroughly rinse out the bowl used and add the sesame oil to it. Put the dough back in the bowl and gently rub the dough around to give the outer portion a thin layer oil "bath".
 Place the bowl in a warm room for about an hour. Wait until the dough rises to double in size.


You can develop the flavor of the dough by placing it in the refrigerator for at least three to six hours.
Bring the flavor out even more by gently pushing the dough back down and allow it to rise again.
,, Fold the char siu and food coloring in.
 Cut 3" squares out of them to make 12 individual papers. Spray a light coat of non-stick cooking spray on one side of them.
 Divide it into 12 pieces and roll each piece into a ball.
 Make sure that the dough is thin in height, but keep the center area on the bulk side.



Have the dough slightly cupped in your hand, as if you're carrying a baby bird.
Add a few tablespoons of the filling in the center of the dough circle.
Make "pie-like" edges on the dough, by pinching the edges with your forefinger and thumb of the other hand.
 Be sure to continue pinching the edges together and twist them at the same time.
,, Be sure to leave the wax paper on them. Arrange them so there is at least 2 inches (5.1Â cm) apart from each paper.
 Place a tea towel over the manapua below the lid if you're using a metal steamer, as this will catch any steam from above.

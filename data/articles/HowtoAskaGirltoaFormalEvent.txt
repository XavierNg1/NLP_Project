 Has she already been asked by someone else? Did she specifically mention that it would be fun to go with you? Whether she's actually told you she'd like to go with you (which sure makes things easier) or you tell your friend to ask his friend to ask her friend to ask her sister to ask her, or you even 'hypothetically' ask her yourself.;
, Think of the asking as merely letting her know that you'd like to go with her. This way, you'll be saved immense trouble - not to mention embarrassment - if she says no.
 Where? When? How? Who?

,


It shows this is important to you and she'll be flattered;
Less time for her to say 'yes' to someone else;
She - and you - will have more time to plan an outfit;
Less time for you to fret she will turn you down;
Less time for her to fret that no one will ask her, resulting in her getting desperate and saying yes to anyone/asking someone herself; and
More time for you to show that you care about her.
 If you followed step #1 she should have said yes - be happy. Don't look at the ground and allow awkward silences! Smile. Stand up straight and look her in the eyes. You have the best date to the event ever, and she should know that!

, A single chocolate bar is better than a dozen corny jokes. Also, don't get her something she'll just be bothered by and want to throw away.


Just do it dude

 This article will assume a fruit salad of seedless grapes, apples, bananas, pineapples, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and watermelon.;
, For melons use a melon baller - the pieces are more uniform. A small ice cream scoop will work as well.
 The apple goes in last. Set all fruit aside - put it in the refrigerator on paper plates covered in plastic wrap or something, it doesn't matter. Whatever you want to do, just get it out of the way and in a suitable place.
 Lay the watermelon on its side and see where it settles. This will be your base. Cut at the opposite side, the side facing up, about an inch or two down. Cut in a zig-zag pattern all the way around the watermelon. Remove the piece you cut off and set it rind-side-down on the table or whatever you're cutting on.
 Scoop out as much of the watermelon's flesh as you possibly can. It's kind of like gutting a pumpkin, but it smells better and you can eat the bits that are too pathetically small to be included in your salad.
 One to put the watermelon balls in and the other to drain the melon every so often. They don't call it watermelon for nothing, you know. Once you've scooped out all the melon balls you can from the watermelon, turn to that bit you cut off back in step four and repeat the process. Now you have a watermelon container for your fruit salad!

, - and use the little watermelon piece from step four as a lid.
, Fruit salad can get a little messy. Afterwards, transfer the remaining fruit salad into some Tupperware and discard the watermelon bowl. It won't keep very well and you can't eat it, so what's the point of letting it stay in your refrigerator?

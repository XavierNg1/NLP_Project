 One of the first symptoms of pregnancy is exhaustion, caused by a rapid increase in the hormone progesterone. Progesterone is vital for a healthy pregnancy, but causes sleepiness for almost every pregnant woman.You may find that your typical seven hours of sleep at night is no longer sufficient. Make rest a priority, especially during your first trimester.


Go to bed earlier at night, or set your alarm a bit later in the morning. Better yet, do both: pregnant women sometimes need up to three more hours of sleep than they did prior to pregnancy.Take power naps during the day. When you are on break at work, get a quick ten minute doze to help recharge your batteries., your activity levels, such as household chores, to a lower level than before you were pregnant. Ask a spouse, relative, friend, or even a hired helper for assistance.


While pregnant, your body goes through so many metabolic changes and does so much work each day that it is almost as if you are running a daily marathon!Keep this in mind when you feel like you're being lazy.
 If it is at all possible, cancel plans for social activities and reduce your schedule at work. In most cases, the fatigue lifts a bit after the first trimester, and you will be able to resume many of your activities at that time.


Ask for vacation time or a reduced workweek for a few weeks if you find that your fatigue interferes with your ability to work.
 One cause of pregnancy fatigue is restlessness at night and the inability to fall into a deep sleep. But exercising every day can help you to sleep more deeply and have more restorative rest. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day.


Even if all you do is go for a walk, swim, or do some yoga, daily exercise will also help increase your circulation and keep your muscles toned. This may also help you with the birthing process.

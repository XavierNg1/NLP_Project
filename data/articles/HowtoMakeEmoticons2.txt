 Any illustration program will work, though you may find more useful tools in more powerful programs. For this guide, simply using Paint will be fine.
 Once your new file is open, click on the Image menu and select Attributes. Set the image size to 60 x 60 pixels. This will leave you with a small square of canvas. Don’t worry, you’ll be zooming in to do the actual drawing.
 Highlight Custom and select a zoom level that works well for you. You’ll want to be able to adjust each individual pixel, so at least 400% is recommended.
 All emoticons have a head. The most common style is a black outline with a yellow inside, though you can choose any color you please.


To choose your colors, left-click on the color you want the outline to be, and right-click on the color you want the fill to be.
Use the Ellipse tool to draw the head. Choose a thin line so that the image doesn’t look to blocky. Hold down the Shift key while dragging the Ellipse tool to create a perfect circle.
 Once the head is made, start designing some eyes. You can use the Ellipse tool to make circle eyes, or the Line tool to make Xs or winks.


Add a smaller circle to the larger eye circle to create pupils.
 Paint has a basic Curve tool that will allow you to draw a straight line and then bend it. Use this to make ) or S shapes. Use the Line tool to make | or / mouths.
 You can personalize your emoticon more by adding glasses, hats, hair, jewelry, or any other accessories you can think of.
 Once you are finished with the emoticon, save it as a .GIF file. This will make it small and easy to upload. You can then add the emoticon to your emails or blog posts.

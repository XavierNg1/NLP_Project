 The target of your joke has to be funny to your audience, or you'll be facing a stone-faced crowd. Don't plan to target high school girls if you're trying to make a room full of them laugh. Tread carefully if you're targeting a political or celebrity figure in his or her hometown. A joke that would be hilarious to one group of people might cause another group to start throwing rotten vegetables.
 Telling a long story that takes more than a minute or two will likely bore your audience. Practice telling shorter jokes so you can get a sense for how to best deliver them before you move on to telling full-blown stories. Remember that the best jokes aren't always the smartest, most detailed jokes; you've got to hit people in the funny bone.


Watch the people you're talking to. If you see their eyes start to wander, wrap up the joke.
You can tell more than one joke in a row if the first one gets some laughs. Build on the energy you created.
 If you've got a big grin on your face when you're telling a joke, people will get distracted. Plus, smiling at your own joke sort of gives away the ending before you have a chance to get there. Instead, keep a straight face, make eye contact, and deliver the joke as if you were saying something as mundane as "I'm going to the store for a gallon of milk." Your delivery is as important to the humor of your joke as the content.
 After you deliver the setup of your joke, pause for a moment before giving the punch line. This gives people the chance to ponder and guess for a moment before you surprise them with your hilarious insight. Don't wait too long, though, or the energy of the joke will die.

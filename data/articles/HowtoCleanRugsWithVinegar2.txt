 Steam cleaning solutions can be expensive and are typically made of harsh chemicals.


Fill the steam cleaner's tank with full-strength vinegar. If the steam cleaner has a dedicated tank for the cleaning solution, use full-strength vinegar instead of the commercial steam cleaning solution.
Substitute vinegar for the steam cleaning solution. If the cleanser is combined with hot water in a single tank in the steam cleaner, use vinegar instead of the cleanser. Whatever the amount of cleanser recommended, substitute the same amount of vinegar. If the manual indicates 4 ounces (113.4 g) of cleaning solution, use 4 ounces (113.4 g) of vinegar.
 Operate the steam cleaning machine as directed. The rug (and room) may smell like vinegar during cleaning. Once the rug is dry, the smell will dissipate.

 Try to find words with those letter in them. See how they turn out in different positions in the words, beginning, middle or end.
 But remember not to trust your inner ear for the accuracy of these sounds. It's better to record your voice while saying these words and comparing them later to actual pronunciation.
 Repeating those letter alone all the time might leave you with a sore throat since you're not used to it. Take your time and proceed slowly.
 Learning how to speak by reading gets you used to these letters faster and gives you much less stress than when saying them alone.

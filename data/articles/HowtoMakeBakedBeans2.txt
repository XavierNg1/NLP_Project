 Submerge the beans in plenty of cold water - about three times the volume of the beans. Let the beans soak in the refrigerator overnight. The beans will absorb water overnight, increasing in volume substantially.


If you don't have time to let the beans soak overnight, soften the beans quickly in the oven. Heat your oven to 325 degrees. Add your dry beans, submerged in plenty of water, to a pot with a tight fitting lid. Cook the pot in the oven until your beans are soft - about 90 minutes - 2 hours.
 Simmer the beans until soft - about 1 - 2 hours. Optionally, add 2 teaspoons salt. Sufficiently softened beans should be able to be easily crushed in your fingers.
 The leftover water can be added to the beans during the baked beans while they're cooking to prevent them from drying out. Since the water carries the flavor of the beans, it will taste better than ordinary water when added., Since canned beans often come packed in a bit of sauce, you may need to add slightly more barbecue sauce, molasses, etc. to compensate for the beans' relative dryness. Use common sense - a long as you check the beans periodically as they're cooking, it's hard to accidentally let your beans dry out.

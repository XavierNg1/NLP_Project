 These should curve to accommodate the shape of Peter's face, and will help you in the process of drawing his features.;
, Draw a squarish rectangle for the torso and another, more elongated rectangle for the lower body, with straight lines for the hands and legs and small circles for joints. Draw triangles for hands and feet.


No need for these basic shapes to take up too much time, just try to show essentially where Peter's appendages will go. Remember to keep things in proportion!

, Define his face more and add in an elfish ear. Follow the illustration for guidance.
 Sketch the eyes, nose, and mouth following the guidelines. Make eyebrows above the eyes. Add the hair and the pointy hat with a feather and carefully erase the guidelines.


The eyes especially might look a little unnatural (even maniacal) at this point, but that's okay; Peter ought to look a little crazed, considering, and the eyes are hardly the focus of the whole drawing.
 Draw a long shirt with leaf-like short sleeves and triangular ends over the waist. Tie it with a thin belt at the waist and add a small dagger tied to it, for his battles with Captain Hook. Make tights for the legs and baggy shoes for the feet.
 Try to draw a modulate line--a line that is sometimes thick and sometimes thin. This will make your drawing look much better.
 Look at the illustration for reference.


Here is shown Peter's traditional Disney coloring, but you can make him look however you'd like.

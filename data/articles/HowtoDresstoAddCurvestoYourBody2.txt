 Opt for a short length or peplum (a form-fitted skirt with a small puff on the hips), a knee-length for a neutral and preppy look, or go full retro with a calf-length skirt. Full skirts add volume to the hips, while drawing attention to a narrow waist.Just think of 1950's skirts and you'll be able to select the right one.
If it's a longer skirt, you could even wear layers, such as petticoats made of tulle, underneath to increase the fullness.
 Choose a pencil skirt that's made of fabric that clings to the body to get instant curves. A wide waistband also helps by creating an illusion of movement from waist to hip.


A pencil shirt should sit at your natural waist, about two inches above your belly button. Any lower and you risk unflattering flaring of the fabric along your hips. The skirt should extend to just about an inch or two above the knee., Choose a wider belt (3-6 inches in width), often called a corselet, which is specifically designed to minimize the waist. Wearing the right belt can break up the straight lines associated with a boxy or boyish figure.


If you have a narrower frame, a wide belt may appear overpowering. Instead, opt for a slim belt worn over matching apparel. A dark brown leather belt worn over a chocolate sweater dress, for example.
 Wearing a high-waisted garment creates the illusion of a smaller waist while elongating the leg line. Jeans and skirts both come in high-waisted options and benefit greatly from tailoring to ensure the proper fit.High-waisted pants with wide legs are particularly good at providing figure balance with a slimmer torso.

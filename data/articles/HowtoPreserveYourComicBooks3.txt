 If your comics have been exposed to extreme cold or heat, expect the pages and/or spine to be brittle.Give them time to warm up or cool down, as needed, before reading. This will reduce the chance of tearing the pages or cracking the spines when you open them.
 Never read your comics under a direct source of light. Prevent the pages from fading by keeping them out of the sun.When indoors, only read them by covered lamps., Remove any dirt or grime that may blemish the pages. Dry your hands thoroughly to prevent water damage. Even then, be aware that your skin’s natural oils may smear the pages. Do not pinch the pages between your fingers., Don’t set yourself up for disaster. Refrain from eating, drinking, and smoking while reading. Eliminate the risk of smudging your pages with chocolate, spilling coffee over them, or turning them yellow and stinking them up thanks to smoke., Lay the spine flat along your open hand. Open the book just enough so you can read what is inside. Avoid clutching the book by its covers, which may crease the comic., If you are concerned about maintaining the value of your book for resale purposes, accept what damages have already occurred. Do not use tape or glue to fix tears or weak spines, since these will be regarded as further blemishes on top of the natural wear-and-tear.However, if you have no intention of ever reselling it and instead want to ensure that it holds up for multiple rereadings, go right ahead.

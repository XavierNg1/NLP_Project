,,, This will remove your browsing history (sites visited), cookies, and cached sites from Safari.


Safari will still auto-suggest websites as you enter into the search bar, but will not autocomplete the text based on your past searches (until new data is generated).
You will lose auto-completed forms and logins after clearing data until they are refilled/saved.
If you are signed in to iCloud on your phone, this will also clear history for other devices signed into your iCloud account.

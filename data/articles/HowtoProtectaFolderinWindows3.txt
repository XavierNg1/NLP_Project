 7-zip is one of the most popular free options available. This guide will be based on using 7-Zip.
 Select the folder that you want to password protect. Right-click and select 7-Zip from the menu. From the second menu, select “Add to archive…” This will open 7-Zip.
 You can rename the file that will be created. Choose .zip from the “Archive format” menu if you want the folder to be compatible on systems without 7-Zip installed.
 On the right side of the 7-Zip window, there will be two fields to enter and confirm a password for the file. You can also select your form of encryption, and whether or not you want the names of the files encrypted as well.


Check the box Encrypt File Names as that will lock the Folder; otherwise if unchecked, you will be locking the individual files within. You do not want this, as a hacker for example will see all files in those folders to further motivate access. Click OK when you are done.
 Creating a compressed file will leave you with two copies of your data: the original and the compressed file. Delete or move the original so that it cannot be accessed.

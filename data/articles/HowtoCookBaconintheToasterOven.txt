 To start, take out a baking sheet that will fit in your toaster oven. Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil. This will make clean up easier afterwards, as you can simply remove the foil and discard it.If you don't have aluminum foil, you can use parchment paper instead.;
, Keep the bacon separated. It should not be touching or overlapping. Lie the bacon flat on the bacon sheet so it cooks completely.Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw bacon.
 You should find a sheet pan that fits on the bottom of your toaster oven. If any bacon drips during the cooking process, a sheet pan will catch this. It is easier to remove the pan and clean it than clean the bottom of a toaster oven., Allow the toaster oven to heat completely before adding your bacon. Usually, a light goes on or off to indicate the oven is done heating.
 Keep an eye on the bacon while it cooks. It usually takes between 10 to 15 minutes, but thinner bacon may cook quicker. Bacon will curl and crisp slightly just before it's done.For crispier bacon, cook your bacon longer.
 After your bacon is cooked to your desired crispness, remove it from the toaster oven. Place some paper towels on a plate. Remove your bacon with a spatula and transfer it to the paper towels. These will remove any excess grease. Allow the bacon to cool for a few minutes before eating., If you do not eat all your bacon, you can store it for later. Place the bacon in a plastic container. Then, place the container in the freezer., Bacon thaws easily in the microwave. Once you're ready to eat your leftover bacon, put it on a microwave safe plate. Heat it up for 20 to 30 seconds., Bacon may lose some flavor after being stored. If your bacon's taste seems off, add some salt and pepper to taste.

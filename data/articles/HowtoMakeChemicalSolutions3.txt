 When diluting solutions, you must know the concentration of the working stock and the final concentration that you want your solution to have. This method is useful for diluting highly concentrated solutions into less concentrated solutions.For example: Make 75 mLs of a 1.5 M stock of NaCl from a working stock of 5 M. The working stock is at a concentration of 5 M and you want to dilute to a final concentration of 1.5 M.
 You must also define the total volume of the solution you want to make. You will calculate the amount of working solution that needs to be added in order to dilute it to the final concentration and volume.For example: Make 75 mLs of a 1.5 M stock of NaCl from a working stock of 5 M. For this example, you want a final volume of 75 mLs of solution.
 To determine the amount of working stock that needs to be diluted, you use the formula V1C1=V2C2; V1 is volume of the working stock and C1 is the concentration of the working stock; V2 is the desired final volume and C2 is the desired final concentration of the solution.To calculate the volume of the working stock needed, the equation gets rearranged to solve for V1: V1 = (V2C2)/C1

For example: Make 75 mLs of a 1.5 M stock of NaCl from a working stock of 5 M.
V1 = (V2C2)/C1 = (0.075 L * 1.5 M)/5M = 0.0225 L.
Convert L back to mL by multiplying by 1000: 22.5 mL.
 When diluting the stock solution, you need to make sure that you dilute to your final volume. By subtracting the volume of the stock solution to be added you will make sure the dilution is done properly.


For example: You want a final volume of 75 mLs and will be adding 22.5 mL of the stock solution. Therefore, 75 â€“ 22.5 = 52.5 mLs. This volume is the amount of dilution solution you will use.
 Using a graduated cylinder (measuring equipment for volumes), measure out the volume of the stock solution and then mix it with the volume of the dilution solution.


For example: Measure 22.5 mLs of the stock 5 M solution of NaCl and dilute it with 52.5 mLs of water. Stir to mix.
Label the container with both the concentration and the compound: 1.5 M NaCl.
Remember, if you are diluting an acid with water, always add the acid to the water.

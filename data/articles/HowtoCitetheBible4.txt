 There are certain times when you should use underline and italics when referring to the Bible, and other times when you should refrain from doing so.


When you refer to the Bible itself throughout your paper or presentation, you should not set it apart in any way except by capitalizing the word Bible or capitalizing the book you are referring to, such as Matthew, Mark, or Luke.
When you refer to a specific edition of the Bible, italicize the title like other books. For example, The NIV Study Bible.
 Using Scripture verses in your paper does not warrant the need to cite the Bible as a source on your bibliography. However, referencing specific notes or commentary within a specific study Bible does. List specific study Bibles like other books on your works cited page. Include title, edition, publisher, location, and year.
 When you reference specific passages in the Bible, use the abbreviation given for the book. For example, instead of "Matthew 5:16," you would write "Matt. 5:16." Find the appropriate abbreviations for books of the Bible by using a guide provided in many Bibles or by searching online.
 Some traditional writing uses Roman numerals for books: II John. Instead of Roman numerals, stick to the Arabic form: 2 John.
 Most research papers stick with one translation of the Bible (e.g., New Living Translation, New International Version, English Standard Version). Simply reference this in your first citation and leave it out of the others. However, if you are constantly changing from one translation to another, include the translation in every reference.

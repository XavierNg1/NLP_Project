 Place them in a sink full of warm water mixed with a few drops of dishwashing liquid to soak.
 Load a 1-liter spray bottle with 4 tablespoons (56.7 g) of baking soda and fill the rest with water. Shake the spray bottle to moisten and dissolve the baking soda.
 Spray the interior of a cold oven, focusing on the charred and stained areas, until the carbon is completely saturated.


For particularly dirty ovens, increase the ratio of baking powder to water so that you have more of a paste than a liquid. Spread the paste all over the charred areas.
 After an hour, test to area to see if the charred part has loosened.


If it's still hard as a rock, douse it again with baking soda solution and allow it to sit for another hour.
If it's loose enough to chip off, proceed to the next step.
 The type of scraper you would use to chip ice and snow off your windshield works well. Keep scraping until most of the carbon is gone.


Wear rubber gloves if you don't want your hands to get black from the soot.
Spray the area with more baking soda solution as you go to make the loosening process easier.
Sweep out the debris you chipped off. Use a small brush and dustpan.
 Allow it to soak in for an additional hour, then use a scrubber to remove the remaining carbon.
 At this point the interior of your oven should be clean. If caked-on carbon remains, try the following alternative methods:


Use an industrial-strength oven cleaner. These contain chemicals that may be harmful to breathe, so use with caution. They typically instruct you to let the solution soak into the charred sections and then scrub out the oven.
Use ammonia. Pour it on the caked-on areas and let it sit for thirty minutes before scrubbing it off with a scrubber and then wiping with a damp sponge.
 Scrub the oven racks in the soapy water. Rinse them off and dry them, then replace them in the oven.

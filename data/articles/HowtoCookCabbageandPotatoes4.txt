 Rinse the cabbage under cool, running water and discard the tough outer leaves. Chop the cabbage into bite-sized pieces.


Slice the cabbage into halves lengthwise, and cut each half in lengthwise halves again to form quarters.
Cut a wedge around the hard core of the cabbage to remove it.
Slice each quarter into 1-inch (2.5-cm) crosswise ribbons, and rough chop each ribbon into smaller pieces to form bite-sized chunks.
 Rinse the potatoes under cool, running water and pat dry with paper towels.


For this recipe, new potatoes are already small enough to cook fully, so they do not need to be cut into smaller pieces.
If using red new potatoes, only scrub the skins with your fingers, not a vegetable brush. These skins are fairly thin, so scrubbing with a vegetable brush will cause the skins to flake off.
 Add these ingredients to the slow cooker and toss together to disperse evenly.


You may want to spray the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or use a special slow cooker liner before adding the ingredients. Otherwise, some of the cabbage and onion may stick to the bottom and sides of the appliance.
 Spread the potatoes out over the cabbage and onions in a single layer.


Season with salt and pepper, if desired.
Do not stir the contents of the slow cooker at this point.
 The cabbage should cook down completely and may even look brown. The potatoes should be tender enough to pierce with a fork.


Do not remove the lid as you cook the cabbage and potatoes. A slow cooker relies on the build-up of heat to cook the contents evenly. If you remove the lid too often during the cooking process, too much of this heat could escape, and the cooking time might be thrown off.
 Once done, spoon the cabbage and potatoes into individual cooking dishes and enjoy.

 Make a big circle with guidelines (vertical for the nose and mouth and horizontal for eyes). It doesn't have to be perfectly round, but try to replicate the image to the right as effectively as you can.;
, Connect it to the head at the section where the point would be, creating a shape that resembles a salt shaker.
 Draw two tubular shapes on the teardrop's end with a flat, long oval shape at each end. These will be the clown's big, goofy shoes.
 Draw two curved, tubular shapes on each side of the teardrop shape under the head. At the ends of each tubular shape, add a circle. These will be the hands.
 Don't exaggerate them too much unless you're going for a "scary clown" kind of look; just make arched eyebrows, rosy cheeks, and a wide-smiling mouth.
 Put in big ears and two curly tufts of hair behind the ears. Add the clown's clothing and cane, giving him a jumpsuit with cuffs and a couple of buttons and a bow-tie to complete the outfit.


His shoes can be two colors, separated with a line as seen here, or you can make them all one shade if you prefer.
 Add any details you've forgotten, but try to keep it simple, especially if you're a beginner.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes alternately from a thick to thin line. This will make your drawing look better and a bit more professional.
 Follow the illustration for reference if you wish.

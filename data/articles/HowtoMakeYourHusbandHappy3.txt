 A picture is truly worth a thousand words, and framing a picture of you and your husband is a great way to show him how much you care. Alternately, you can make a collage of your last vacation together or simply of your favorite moments throughout the years to remind him of all the good times you have had together.
 Coupon books are a great (and inexpensive!) way to show someone that you love them. Get creative and give your hubby coupons for romantic activities that can be redeemed at any time. Some ideas include:


Massages.
Intimate activities.
His favorite home-cooked meal.
Control of the television.
A trip to his favorite restaurant.
Passes to get out of doing chores.
 Food can truly nourish the soul, and putting a lot of effort into a home-cooked meal can really show someone how much you love them. Take the time to make your hubby's favorite dish or dessert every once in a while. Make it a surprise to add an extra element of romance.
 Take the time to make a playlist of your hubby's favorite songs or find new songs that you think he will like. You can also make a playlist of love songs that you have listened to at one time or another during your relationship.


Give it to your hubby in cute wrapping paper with a little note explaining the significance of the playlist to you.
Alternately, stick it in his car CD player and set it so that it will play the next time he turns on his car. This sneaky addition will have your hubby smiling and soon as he buckles his seat belt.
 Collect something from a place in nature that is special to you. This can be a rock in the shape of a heart, a shell from the beach, or even a tree branch from your favorite hike. Let your hubby know that this token from nature reminds you of him.

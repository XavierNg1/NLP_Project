 Lost or abandoned cats who still hold any domesticated characteristics will most likely be a stray. Depending on the degree range, a cat will quickly approach a human who offers food or be afraid, but will show a small interest over time.;
, Feral cats have lived a huge part of their lives in the outdoor world and have no domesticated habits. These cats will shun humans however they can.
 Feral cats tend to create groups of their own, also known as colonies, while stray cats will roam and live by themselves.
 Feral cats will stray away from body communication, especially the eyes. Stray cats will be more apt to look directly at humans. Hissing, striking, and growling are common defense tactics used by feral cats, while strays tend to be more quiet in defending themselves, from small meows to low hissing., Both stray and feral cats tend to hang out where food can easily be found: near dumpsters, restaurants, abandoned structures, or under porches. Because strays retain some domesticated behavior, they can been seen more often during the day. Feral cats, on the other hand, are nocturnal and tend to come out of their hiding places for food runs during the night.

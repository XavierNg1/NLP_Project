 Ease a trowel around the edges of the pot. If it is planted in the ground, dig a wide circle around the plant. You do not want to touch the roots. Lift the plant up, and with your fingers, remove the large dirt clumps around the plant.Do not pull or yank the plant out.
 With a gentle stream of water, wash off dirt from the plant. You can use your fingers to gently ease clumps away. Pat your plant dry with a paper towel.
 Do not wait for it to lose its moisture. Place it on a scale. The scale should be able to read measurements as small as milligrams. Record the weight., Return it to its hole, and cover with fresh soil. If you are potting your plants, place some potting soil in the bottom of a pot before putting the plant back in. Cover with fresh potting soil, leaving an inch between the soil and the lip of the pot.Water the plant to replace any lost moisture.
 You should not weigh your plants often as this can harm the plant by slowing its growth or killing it. As long as you are gentle and do not touch its roots, you may be able to safely remove and weigh the plant a few times, but exercise extreme caution when doing so.
 After you have a second measurement, use the growth rate formula to calculate the daily average growth rate. The equation for this growth rate is (W2âˆ’W1)T{\displaystyle {\frac {(W2-W1)}{T}}}where W1=first weight, S2=second weight, and T equals the number of days between each.

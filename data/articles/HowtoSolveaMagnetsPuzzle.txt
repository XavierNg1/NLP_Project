 All dominoes with both ends in that row or column must be magnets. We can't determine the polarity yet. In these diagrams, an open circle represents a magnet that is not neutral, but whose polarity is unknown.
 This net charge must come from those dominoes that are oriented perpendicular to that row or column. This method also works for groups of rows. In the example, the bottom two rows have a net charge of -2 and there are two vertical dominoes connecting this region to the top 6 rows. Both of those then must be charged and must have the positive pole on the top., Also mark the other end of any neutral domino as neutral., If all of them have already been identified, mark all remaining cells in that row or column as charged. If all but one have been identified, mark all dominoes parallel to the row or column as charged. No magnetic monopoles allowed! If one end of a magnet is charged, then the other end is as well. Label these accordingly.,,, Its status can be found by observing the parity of the total number of charged cells in that row or column. Since the fifth row has a total charge of 3, it the charges must be in one vertical and one horizontal domino. The remaining vertical domino must be neutral. Since the charge is unbalanced, the polarity of some other magnets can also be determined., As parts of the puzzle become solved, other deductions work. For example, the left three columns have a net charge of +1. Initially there were two horizontal dominoes that could contain the positive charge, but now one of them is adjacent to another positive charge., Try to deduce the charge of the remaining dominoes., If both ends of a domino are adjacent to the same charge, or if one side is adjacent to both charges, then it must be neutral., In this case, the left side now solves easily, while the right side requires observing that whichever of the upper two dominoes is charged forces it's column to have 3 negative and 2 positive charges.

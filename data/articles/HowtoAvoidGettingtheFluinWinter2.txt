 If possible, avoid being around someone who has the flu. Stay away from sick friends or neighbors until they’re well. Stay out of crowds during the peak of flu season, in possible – being in public transportation, auditoriums, and places where people congregate make it easy for flu to spread.Stay home from work or school if you’re sick so you don’t contaminate others. You can return to school or work 24 hours after your fever returns to normal, but continue to practice good hand washing hygiene.
 If someone in your household is sick, consider sleeping in a different room from them if you usually share a bedroom. Be sure to wash your hands after you interact with them, and clean any cups, cutlery, or dishes they use thoroughly.


People can still be contagious for up to a week after they’re feeling better., Use disinfecting sprays or wipes to clean surfaces that can harbor flu germs.Clean your bathrooms, bedroom surfaces, wood and glass tables, office desks, and other areas that you use or touch often. Keep a container of disinfecting wipes at your office, and wipe down your desk, phone, and keyboard every morning before you start work.
 Phones harbor many germs because you use them so often and they sit around in lots of places, exposed to viruses. Use a disinfecting wipe or slightly soapy rag to carefully clean your phone every other day during flu season.


Of course, do not submerge your phone in water.
 Because you will be washing your hands more frequently, you will need to change your communal towels more often so that they do not remain damp and become a vector for disease. Replace the towel every couple days or if it is damp when you go to reuse it. Keep hand towels separate so that each family member has their own towel.

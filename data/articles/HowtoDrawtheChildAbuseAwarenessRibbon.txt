 Draw a loop lightly with a pencil; the proportions don't have to be exact. Keep in mind that this doesn't have to be the perfect loop.;
, Use your pencil to make the single line turn into a full ribbon.


Complete the loop by taking the second line all the way around.
 Now is the time to erase any defects in your sketch to make your ribbon look smooth and clean; fix any overlapping lines

, Make the two lines of each side meet at the top while darkening them (Refer to image). The ribbon should now have the appearance of being twisted.
 Begin to shade the top part of the ribbon that hasn't been darkened yet, then darken the lines around it.


Consider darkening the entire ribbon once more if it appears too light.
 Add a "slogan" or phrase of some sort to present your cause. Phrases such as Â "Prevent Child Abuse", "Keep Kids Safe"; "Child Abuse Must End"; "Stop Child Abuse", and "Child Abuse Awareness" are handy examples as to what you may decide upon.
 The Child Abuse Awareness ribbon is widely/famously known as the "Blue Ribbon". To finish off your awareness ribbon, color it in any dark shade of blue (Examples found in the image below). The ribbon is usually colored one of these following types of the color blue: Blue, Navy, Denim, Admiral, Cobalt, Berry, and Navy Blue.

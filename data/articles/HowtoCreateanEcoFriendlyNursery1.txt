Consider purchasing a crib made with recycled wood or certified natural wood to be sure your baby‘s crib is not painted with a harmful varnish. Furthermore, cribs fashioned from natural or recycled woods benefit our environment and allow the consumer to obtain a quality product.
Shop early on in your pregnancy to allow enough time for the crib to be constructed and shipped.;
, Mattresses made with artificial materials can release toxins over time. For the most part, brand new babies spend most of the hours in their day sleeping. They spend a great deal of time in the crib, so it makes sense to safeguard where they sleep.
 Bedding made from natural, organic fabrics is much gentler on baby’s newborn skin.


Consider purchasing 100% cotton bedding items or wool instead of polyester.
Look for fabrics that were made using natural dyes as well; doing so will protect your baby from harmful chemicals and allergens that can irritate baby’s skin. If you have chosen a traditional crib mattress, be sure that you use an organic mattress pad and sheet set. Organic cotton covers and sheets paired with a wool mattress topper will protect your baby from toxins, moisture and allergens.

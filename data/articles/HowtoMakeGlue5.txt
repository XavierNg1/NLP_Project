 Mix ingredients together well in a small bowl, and give the mixture 2 minutes to sit. The protein in the milk will clump together into small white lumps. And the chemical reaction will turn the protein of the milk into lumps or curds. The liquid that remains is called whey. 







, Put a paper towel over the top of a cup with a large mouth. Push down the paper towel in the middle so that it caves in. Then take your rubber band and put it around the top of the cup and paper towel to hold your paper towel strainer in place.








Choose a larger cup that you can pour the whole mixture of the curds and whey onto. Or pour the mixture onto the strainer, wait for it to strain and then pour on the rest., Carefully pour the curds and whey on top of the paper towel. The whey will drain into the cup while the curds will stay on the top of the paper towel.









Leave the curds and whey on the paper towel strainer for about 5 minutes to give it time to strain., Scoop the curds off of the top of the strainer and onto two paper towels. Press down on the curds so that all of the liquid whey is squeezed out. You want to make sure that you get out all of the whey to make the glue.
 In another small bowl, add the curds, water, and baking soda. Stir the mixture together well. You will be able to hear the sound of bubbles popping if you listen closely because the reaction of the baking soda with the curds creates carbon dioxide.








If the mixture does not have the consistency of glue, add more water to the mixture by the teaspoon until it is the correct consistency.

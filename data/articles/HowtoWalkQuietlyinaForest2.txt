 This method is used to stalk animals, allowing the hunter to get very close to his prey without being heard. It is usually only done for brief periods of time, because you will need to move very slowly.When lifting your foot, point your toes at the ground. You will be less likely to snag your foot on foliage as you raise it.
When putting your foot on the ground, connect the outer edge first, then roll the rest of the foot down until the sole touches the ground.
 If you are walking with a partner or a group, everyone should match their walking pace. When they put their left foot down, put your left foot down, and the same with your right. This way, the sound of your footsteps won't stand out over theirs., Native Americans wore soft-soled moccasins while hunting, because it helped muffle foot noises when hunting. Walking barefoot, or in a shoe that allows you to flex your foot, will allow you to feel the surface of the ground more accurately and avoid potential pitfalls like snapping twigs.If you must wear boots, wear the lightest and softest ones possible.
Walking barefoot is the most quiet choice, but is usually too painful over rough terrain for most people.
Kevlar toe socks are the rugged, outdoor version of the flexible running sock that is very similar to going barefoot.

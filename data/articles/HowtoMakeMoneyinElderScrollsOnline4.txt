 Design your main character to kill, kill, kill. Have it loot and gather everything, but craft nothing except provisions. Have it take the two "Chef" skills to maximize its Provisioning output, which it sells for cash. Take only those skills that help your main character kill.


Have your main character carry all Provisioning ingredients, cook them at any cook fires found, and sell whatever the main character doesn't need.
 Put everything in your bank that your main character gathers (not including items that they will use to craft into Provisions or needs to equip).
 Create additional characters specifically to craft: an alchemist/enchanter, enchanter/woodworker, woodworker/clothier, clothier/smith. Skip whichever crafts your killing character needs least (e.g., no smith for mages, no clothier for tanks).
 Have the crafting characters withdraw their relevant materials from the bank (reagents to alchemists, etc.), and store them in their own inventories, to keep the bank slots available.
 Have the crafting characters research, disassemble, create, etc. all craft-appropriate items.
 Have the crafter of an item stick it in the bank, for another character of the same craft to withdraw and disassemble. You earn more inspiration points from disassembling someone else's products than you do from disassembling something you made yourself, so this is the best way to increase your skills in order to make higher quality items.
 Once you can make items of reasonable quality. Distribute them to your main character for that character to sell. You can also trade with other players for items that you need.

 If you have placed your pillow in a pillowcase or sham, take this off now. Some pillows come with additional zip-on cases that should also be removed and washed separately from the body of the pillow.;
, Don’t worry - it is perfectly safe to wash pillows (even down pillows) in the washing machine. Try to wash at least two at once so that the washer is balanced and the pillows don’t get thrown around so much.
 For a regular wash job, add a cup/scoop of your regular washing detergent. To get your pillows ultra white, add the following in addition to the detergent: 1 cup of powdered dishwasher detergent, the recommended amount of bleach, and ½ a cup of borax., Adjust the settings on your washer so that it runs with hot water and goes through a 2nd rinse cycle. Use the "bulky/large" cycle if it is available on you washer. Then, let it work its magic!

, Place your pillows in the dryer and adjust the settings; if your pillows are feather-filled, put your dryer on the "air"/"fluff"/"no heat" setting. For synthetic pillows, switch your dryer to low heat.
 Take two tennis balls and put them in separate clean, white socks. Throw these in the dryer with your pillows to fluff them and help decrease their drying time. Then start your dryer!

, When your dryer has finished its cycle, remove the pillows and feel them, checking for dampness. Smell the pillows to check for moisture in the center. If your pillows don’t feel quite dry, repeat the drying process and check them again a second time. Otherwise, your pillows are clean and ready!

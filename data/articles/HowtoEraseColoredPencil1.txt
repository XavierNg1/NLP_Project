 A colored pencil eraser can be bought at most stores: dollar stores, an arts and crafts store, etc.


You should not need to pay more than about five dollars for a colored pencil eraser.
A colored pencil eraser should work on all types and brands of colored pencil.;
, It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing can cause streaking. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture.


Rub gently in a small circle to test. If you notice streaking, rub more gently. If you notice streaking, consider trying another method.
Try to choose a peripheral spot to test the eraser. If it does smear or streak, you do not want it to ruin the central part of your image.
 Rub gently; colored-in portions of paper are more fragile than paper you've simply written on.


Be careful, colored pencil erasers are somewhat more firm than normal erasers. They have a rough, coarse feel to them and can tear paper.
Be patient and continue to rub gently, checking your progress every few seconds. It may take some time to fully erase the colored pencil. If you get impatient and try to rub more vigorously to speed up the process, you are likely to rip the paper.

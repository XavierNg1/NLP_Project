 Compliment him frequently on the things you like about him. When he does something kind of special for you, acknowledge that you appreciate him. Be positive and encouraging of your man’s goals. Being positive and loving is important for maintaining a successful relationship.For example, you can give him a small unexpected gift or send him a random, loving text. Something simple like this will let him know that you appreciate him.;
, Showing an interest in your man's life can also help to deepen your emotional bond with him. Ask him about his job, his friends, and his family. Ask genuine questions, not snooping ones. Cultivate a habit of sharing things with one another. It will help you express more feelings and desires in your relationship.For example, ask him, “How did your presentation at work go? I know you were working really hard on it!”
Do not ask about where he was and who he was with every time he goes out. These kinds of questions seem more like interrogation.
 Give your partner the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he is trying to be the best boyfriend or husband he can be. Assuming that he’s cheating on you will hurt your relationship because your suspicions will undermine the trust you’ve worked hard to build. Try to trust him, even if you are concerned., Happy couples are often light and playful with one another. Make it a priority to laugh it off more. Go see a silly movie with your man, or tell him something about him that makes you smile.Part of lightening up is not smothering your man. Don’t ask him where he is all the time or demand to know how he spent every minute of his day. Even if you feel insecure about your relationship, lightening up will benefit your relationship and show him that you trust him.

 If you'll be canning fresh fruit (like plums or peaches) and want a sweet syrup to pour in the jars, make a simple syrup. You can create a thick, sweet syrup or a light, thin syrup. Just place the sugar and water in a pot and heat it over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. To make:Heavy syrup: use 4 1/4 cups of sugar (900 g) and 4 1/4 cups (1 liter) of water to make 7 cups (2.27 kg) of syrup
Medium syrup: use 3 1/4 cups (650 g) of sugar and 5 cups (1.2 liters) of water to make 7 cups (2.27 kg)syrup
Light syrup: use 2 1/4 cups (450 g) of sugar and 5 1/4 cups (1.25 liters) of water to make 6 1/2 cups (2.1 kg) syrup

, For spiced preserved fruit, add a little ground cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, or star anise. For slightly savory flavorings, you can add fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme, basil or a few dried bay leaves.You can add the dried herbs or spices to the syrup itself or place the fresh sprigs directly into the jars.
 Place the fruit you'd like to preserve into your sterilized jars. Follow your recipe to prepare the fruit. Pour the simple syrup over the fruit in the jars until it comes 1/2-inch (12 mm) from the top. Apply warm lids and screw on the bands until they're fingertip tight. Process the jars in a water bath for 10 minutes.You can store properly canned fruit in simple syrup for up to one year.

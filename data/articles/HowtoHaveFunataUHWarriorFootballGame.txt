 If it's a popular or important game, some lots fill up as early as noon. Games start anywhere between 5:30 and 6:30 pm.;
, This is to create streamers and confetti; the seats and floors are usually covered with it at the end of the game, not to mention the field can be drizzled with newspaper, depending on the wind and the amount of confetti is being thrown. More confetti is made when UH plays a rival team.
 The University of Hawaii Warriors are known for their "Ha'a" or ritual dance before every game. Before kick off, the national anthem and the state song, "Hawai'i Pono'i", is sung.
 Also, periodically throughout the game, there's a color race game on the screen. People usually pick their color (red, blue, green, or yellow) and see if their color circle wins. This is just fun among fans, but actually the winning color represents the color section of the stadium and determines a random seat number for a prize.
 The wave usually takes place during time-outs and other "time killer" breaks. They start out from the sidelines, where people can encourage others to join and continue at least halfway to two thirds around the stadium before it dies out. The wave is repeated until the game resumes or if people seem uninterested at the time.
 You may see streams of people start walking out during the 4th quarter, especially when the point spreader is high. If you didn't catch the "Ha'a" before the game, the Warriors usually repeat it after the game as well.

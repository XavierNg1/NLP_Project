 You can practice this faith anyway you want. There is no prescribed ritual in Hinduism or any particular way to worship God. Our scriptures clearly state that while God is one, he has many forms and one can worship him in any way and in any religion.;
, It depends on which God gives you peace. If Krishna gives you peace, then worship Krishna, if Shiva gives you peace, then worship Shiva! It is your decision. You may even worship God in Himself like the Brahmo Samajis or Arya Samajis, if you wish. It is all up to you.
 You may perform puja for Him, or you may worship Him in your way. Call upon him even when you are not in distress.
 The Bhagvad Gita and the Upanishads are good examples. But remember though, that while some scriptures show God commanding people to kill, this is not a justification of murder. Hinduism is a religion of peace. What God is trying to say is that you should kill the Devil inside you and become righteous.
 Reincarnation is one, and it has also been proven scientifically. Hindus believe that a person is born again and again after death, and to escape this cycle one must attain moksha (salvation). Some people say that to attain moksha you must leave your family. This is not true. You can attain salvation, even if you are a family man, but you must overcome the sins - Kaam (lust), krodh (anger), lobh (greed), maya (illusion or attachment to worldly things and relations) and abhimaan (ego). If you do not overcome these you cannot attain salvation.
 God is All-Forgiving and All-Merciful.
 Hinduism is not a special-class religion. It is equal to all other religions be it Islam, Baha'i Faith, Christianity, Buddhism or any other faith. Respect others and their point of view.
 Remember, animal sacrifice is a heretic's act and has no place in Hinduism, though some Hindus still practice it. Do not consume beef, for cow is considered sacred. In fact, it is better to avoid meat of the larger animals, or even better, eat no meat at all.

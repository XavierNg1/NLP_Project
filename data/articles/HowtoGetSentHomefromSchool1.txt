 You'll want to choose something that is common, but something that most people would be embarrassed to admit. This will give more credibility to your story, as your school nurse or office worker will think it unlikely that you would admit to something embarrassing if it weren't necessary.Some examples include:


DiarrheaBad gas;
, You'll have to convince your teacher to tell her that you aren't feeling well, but before you do, make your story more believable by going to the bathroom several times. Space out your bathroom breaks by about 20 to 30 minutes, and if your teacher questions you, tell her that you've been feeling, "A little funny."

, After making a few trips to the bathroom, you're ready to talk to your teacher about getting sent home. Be sure that you are appropriately embarrassed about your condition and try to talk to your teacher one-on-one. Don't come right out and admit that you have diarrhea or gas. Instead, describe it in a different way, like:


"I've been having to go to the bathroom a lot today and my tummy's really upset. I keep having to go and it's really bad. I just want to lay down for a little bit."
"I'm sorry I keep having to go to the bathroom. I'm really embarrassed, but I keep passing gas. It's really bad and I don't want anyone to laugh at me."

, You'll likely have to jump through one more hoop before you are sent home. The last obstacle before you get sent home will likely be your school nurse or an office worker. As long as you don't change your story and continue being embarrassed about your condition, you'll likely be sent home before too long.


Stress the fact that your stomach is upset and that you want to lay down for a little while.
You may want to get a false scent that imitates bad gas and spritz some of this around you when no one is looking. These kind of sprays can be bought at novelty stores, magic shops, and online.

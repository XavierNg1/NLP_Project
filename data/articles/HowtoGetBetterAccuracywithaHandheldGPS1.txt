 Since antenna positioning is very important for accuracy it is good to be sure about what type of antenna you have. There are commonly two types - patch and quadrifilar helix antennas. The first one is built into the device and the other one is external. Remember to always point your antenna (regardless the type) towards the sky. , Since GPS depends on satellite data itâ€™s best to make sure nothing obstructs the signal between them. When trying to get a lock on your position with your GPS receiver be sure to stay away from trees, buildings, and other natural or man-made obstructions that can reflect or block the signal, thus degrading accuracy. The goal is to both be in view of as many satellites at once as possible and to get a clear signal.
 GPS antennas may have different designs that can give you better signal from their certain positioning. Chances are you have a patch antenna in your GPS receiver (you can confirm it using a manual).Holding your GPS flat with a patch antenna will give you the best signal.
 Hold your GPS erect if you have quadrifilar helix antenna.
 Even if you are standing in an open spot your own body may block the signal, so elevating your device to a shoulder height will give you better accuracy.
 When you are in an open field and have your GPS positioned properly the only other thing you can do to improve accuracy is to turn and face different directions in order to increase the number of satellites in view. The more satellites 'see' your device the better and faster your GPS will provide position information.

 Physically covering the bruise with clothing may also help. Consider the location of the bruise and check your wardrobe to see what clothing and accessories you have that might help you to cover it up.


If the bruise is on your arm or leg, then wearing a long sleeved shirt or pants is an easy way to cover it up. However, this is not always possible, especially in hot weather.
If the bruise is near your hairline or on your forehead, then wearing a scarf, headband, or hat may provide coverage.
If the bruise is on your eye or near the bridge of your nose, then wearing a pair of sunglasses or your prescription glasses may help., Keep in mind that this will not cover the bruise, but it may help to draw peopleâ€™s attention away from it.


For example, you could apply some black eye liner with a couple of layers of mascara to create a dramatic eye look, or opt for a bright red lipstick to draw attention to your lips instead.
 If you have some really long dangly earrings or a statement necklace, then this might be the day to wear them. Putting on some interesting accessories will not cover the bruise, but it can help to pull the focus away from it.


For example, if you have some large hoop earrings or a necklace with a large pendant, then these might help to distract away from the bruise.

 Blend together until they form a well-combined powder.
 Using a funnel to assist pouring, tip the mixture into the container or containers. Depending on the sizes of your containers, you might make one large container or up to 15 small containers. Leave a small space from the top, for adding the last ingredients (if using).
 If you prefer other toppings, add those instead. If you'd rather it were all powder, simply fill to the top of the container with powder.
 Make sure it fits properly.
 Add the name as well, and any other embellishment.


Add a separate label on the back with the ingredients and instructions for preparation. A "made on" date is useful, and a suggestion to consume within 6 months.

Preparation: Add 1.5 tablespoons of powder to 8 ounces (225ml) of hot water or milk. Stir to combine. Add toppings. Enjoy!

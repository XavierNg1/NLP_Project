Use old or cheap eyeshadow.
For shimmery lip gloss, use a shimmer eyeshadow or add clear shimmery eyeshadow to your other color.
Don't be shy with colors. Using greens, blues, and yellows is really fun, and you can wear them on Halloween, for parties, and even just to mix it up.
 More eyeshadow means more color.
 Melt until runny and stir about every 10 to 15 seconds to evenly distribute color.
Â You can use old lip balm containers, plastic jewelry boxes, pretty much anything that is clean, food-safe and easy to store. Let the lip gloss harden before applying.

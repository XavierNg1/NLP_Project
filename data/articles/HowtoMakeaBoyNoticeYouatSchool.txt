 Most of the time if you are not happy or confident, your feelings will show. Look in a mirror and smile at yourself and make different faces. Smile around him and be with friends, so you look like you have a life outside of trying to get the attention of guys. You don't have to ignore him completely, but don't get obsessive, either.;
, Walk with your shoulders loosely relaxed. Swing your hips but only a little, otherwise it will give the guy the idea that you're trying too hard.
 Maybe you'll get a compliment back. If you don't brush it off. Most likely he is not interested, because for in most cases, guys will look for every opportunity to compliment a girl who they are into.
 This will let him know that you are comfortable doing things for him, and usually this starts conversations. Don't become the "guy" in the relationship though. If he is not sure enough of himself to do the same back, like pick up a book you dropped in the hallway, then don't try. Or at least, give him a year or two to "man up".
 Make sure you laugh at his jokes, just not all of them or else he might think that you're trying too hard. Ask him about his interests and what he likes to do for fun.
 Talk to other boys, and act independent and confident. Boys go crazy when they like you and you flirt with other boys!

, If he really likes you he won't need the sexy side of you all the time. Make yourself stand out, but not so much that he will think you're way out of your comfort zone and trying too hard. If he likes what you think is inappropriate or extremely uncomfortable to you, he's not good for you.
 Just keep on being yourself. Remember, there's someone out there that's absolutely amazing and will love you for who you are, and if you keep on looking, you will find him.

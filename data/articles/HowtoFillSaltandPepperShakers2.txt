 This may seem basic but it's actually subject to considerable controversy and depends on your preferences:


Some say that salt needs the container with less holes but larger ones, because it's the bigger grain to get through the holes. Others prefer the salt to have more holes but smaller because it allows for more of the seasoning to flavor the dish.
Some say that pepper needs to container with larger and more holes because it's a bigger grain that is harder to shake through.
The answer probably falls into a gray area––it depends on the size of the grains (really finely ground or chunkier), family/restaurant preference and the tradition you've been raised with. Complicating the answer is the fact that there seem to be different standards in different countries. Go with the flow that works best for you!

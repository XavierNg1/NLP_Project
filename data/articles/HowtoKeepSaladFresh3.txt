 For the most part, other types of salads can be prepared ahead of time. Place the prepared ingredients into an airtight plastic container and seal it well. You will not need to make any other special storage preparations to keep various other salad types fresh.


Other types of salad you may consider saving include egg salad, potato salad, pasta salad, chicken salad, and tuna salad.
Food tends to spoil faster when exposed to air, so an airtight seal is essential if you really want to keep your salads both fresh and safe to eat.
 All pre-cooked ingredients will need to be refrigerated in their airtight containers.


Since most other salad types include pre-cooked ingredient, most will also need to be refrigerated.
Bacteria is more likely to grow in food that sits out at room temperature. As such, refrigeration preserves the freshness of your food while also keeping it sanitary.
 You can usually preserve most types of salads longer if you add any dressing before you serve the salad instead of adding it before you store it. This is especially true of mayonnaise-based dressings.
 Even after the dressing has been added, most salads can stay fresh and edible in the refrigerator for several days. As a general rule, a salad only stays fresh for as long as its fastest spoiling ingredient stays fresh.


Egg salad, potato salad, tuna salad, chicken salad, and mayonnaise-based pasta salad can last three to five days if stored in the refrigerator. Discard the egg salad if it is left out at room temperature for more than two hours or if it develops an "off" smell.Pasta salad with a non-mayonnaise dressing can stay fresh for five to seven days.

Try eyeshadow colors in purple, plum, wine, red-brown, and pink. Use your darkest shade at the outside corner and crease, and blend it into your lightest color at the inner corner.
Pair these eyeshadow colors with a dark brown eyeliner rather than black to make the colors pop., Bring out the blue flecks in your grey eyes by contrasting blue tones as you would with blue eyes. Use eyeshadows and eyeliner in shades of bronze, copper, brown, salmon, etc.


Try dabbing a little bit of light, shimmery blue or a lighter shade of the gold or orange tones you use on the rest of the eyelid to the inner corner of the eyes. This will help draw attention to the blue present in your irises., Use colors in the same tones as your own grey irises to make them look like a lighter shade of grey. Keep makeup grayscale to downplay the same hue in your eyes.


Try out charcoal or black in the outer corner and crease of your eye and blend it with grey on the eyelid and light silver in the inner corners for a classic charcoal smoky eye.
Use a nude lip color so as not to detract from the grey theme of this eye makeup.You can also play up lighter grey eyes with darker gradients of any color. Try a dark brown or mauve to contrast with lighter greys in the irises.

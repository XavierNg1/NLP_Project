Consider the practice problem:3 + 5 =

Place your fingers in the "3" position. (Remember, you are using your right hand only in this exercise.)

Starting with "1", count to "5"; putting down one finger every time you say a number.

When you say "1", you place your fingers into the "4" position.
When you say "2", you place your fingers into the "5" position.
Continue until you say "5", your fingers should be in the "8" position.

3 + 5 = 8

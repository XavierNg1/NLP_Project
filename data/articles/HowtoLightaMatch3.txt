 As a general rule, fire burns best when it can travel uphill.This is true even on a very small scale. Holding a lit match so that it points very slightly towards the floor will give it a gentle uphill path to travel as it consumes the matchstick.


This keeps the flame burning bright without having it travel towards your fingers too fast. You can always adjust the angle of the match upward to slow down the flame if you need more time.
 If you want to get a big flame on your match as quickly as possible, try dipping the matchstick downward for just a second or two. The flame should travel up the stick fairly quickly, giving you a larger flame. However, this flame will also be hotter and closer to your fingers, so be very careful with it.


Try to avoid pointing the matchstick directly downward. This will make the flame jump up the stick toward your fingers and is a great way to get burnt.
 Holding the matchstick upwards will make it hard for it to consume the fuel in the matchstick. The flame will shrink and burn more slowly. Over time, it will either travel gradually down toward your fingers or go out on its own.
 Be careful for breezes if you are lighting your match outdoors. These can blow your match out after it's lit, wasting your match. You may want to move to a place with no breeze or wait for the wind to die down before you attempt to light the match.









If you have to light a match in the wind, a good trick is to shield the flame by putting your body and hands between it and the wind.

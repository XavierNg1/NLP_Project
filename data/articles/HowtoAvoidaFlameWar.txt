 In most instances, this is all that is needed, but if you are dealing with a flamer, things will begin to escalate. The would-be flamer is likely to seize on the issue, and refuse to let go of the matter. If he or she wants to argue about the finer points, or wants to enlarge the scope of a disagreement, proceed carefully.



 ;
, Don't be afraid to seek guidance from trusted members of your internet community before responding. Know all you can about the situation. And know that you are right before defending yourself.
,, Phrase your answer plainly and dispassionately. Your flamer is probably very emotional about this issue and perhaps about life in general. He is hoping you will respond in an emotional way. Don't do it. Avoid sarcasm, and don't be mean. Your goal is to cool down the situation, not to incite further hard feelings.
 In other words, take swift action. Once.
 Do not feel the need to explain your motives, the full background of position and your right to be a part of the community, and your entire life history. A flamer will demand all of that from you and more. Don't get sucked in. If he writes to you to seek more information, just refer him back to your original note and say that is all you have to say on the matter. What a flamer wants is not resolution of the issue, but rather, a fight. Don't entertain this kind of conversation. Don't play that game.

 Use your file explorer to navigate to the folder containing the presentation file you’re trying to open.;
, The basic idea behind this method is to move the file from a possibly corrupt drive onto a working one. If the presentation is already on a USB drive, you’ll be copying it to your computer’s hard drive. If the presentation file is on your computer’s hard drive, you’ll be copying it to a USB drive.
 This can be any location on the second storage device, as you just need to move it from one drive to the other.
 This will copy the file from one drive to the other.


If the file doesn’t allow you to copy it, the file or the drive itself may be corrupt.
 After copying the file, try to run it from its new location on the second drive. If the original location was corrupt, you may be able to open it properly now.
 If the file opens fine from the new location, you’ll want to try to fix any disk errors in the original location.


Windows - Open your Computer/This PC window and right-click on the disk that was giving you problems. Select “Properties,” click the “Tools” tab, and then click “Check now” in the “Error-checking” section. Check both boxes and click “Start.”
Mac - Open the Disk Utility program from the Utilities folder. Select the problematic disk from the left menu, then click “First Aid.” Wait for the scan to complete.

 You can minimize the appearance of scratches in glass tabletops or cabinet doors by buffing a scratch removal compound into them. Make this compound by mixing together 2 tablespoons (30 ml) each of jeweler's rouge (can be purchased from a jeweler), glycerin (can be purchase from a pharmacy), and tap water. Stir these ingredients together in a small bowl.
 Use a soft cloth to gently rub the compound over the scratch using smooth, circular motions. Do this for about 30 seconds, and then allow the compound to dry into the scratch for another 30 seconds.
 You can wash the compound away using mild soap and water. Note that the scratch will begin to reappear in the glass after about 6 months, after which you can reapply the compound if desired.

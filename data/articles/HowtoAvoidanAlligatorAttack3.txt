 If you find yourself in a situation where you need to get away from an aggressive alligator or you’re being chased by an alligator, run away from it at a 45-degree angle. This way, the alligator would have to make a conscious decision to move its thousand-pound body in another direction, which is no easy task, in order to continue chasing you.


It is commonly believed that you should run in a zig-zag motion to escape the alligator’s field of vision. This tactic allows the alligator to keep you in view, if only intermittently, and continue the hunt., If an alligator clamps down on you, a loved one, or a pet, you may be able to make them release their clutch by poking them in the eye. This should only be done if there’s no way to avoid the attack. In most cases, alligators who have clamped down will not release their prey, but this tactic has been shown to be effective., Alligators prefer small, easy to manage food sources, so lots of movement will discourage them from continuing their efforts. Swing your limbs, wriggle your body, and keep moving until they move on. The harder you fight the less interested the alligator will become., Like the thrashing movements, loud sounds also discourage alligators from continuing their attacks. Noises may attract other alligators who will compete for their meal, so alligators will likely seek a less noisy food source. Additionally, this will likely attract the attention of others who can help you or call for assistance from others., If an alligator injures you, always seek treatment from a professional. Even if you don’t think the injury was severe, a serious infection can develop if alligator bites are left untreated. In most cases, you’ll need to complete a course of antibiotics, and you will likely need stitches.

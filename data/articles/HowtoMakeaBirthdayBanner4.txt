 You can find colorful butcher paper online, in teacher supply stores, and in certain university/college art stores. Regular arts and crafts stores may not sell butcher paper.


You can also use fabric instead, but you may want to hem the edges so that they do not fray.
White butcher paper may seem plain, but it will give you a nice canvas to work on.
 Draw lightly with the pencil so that you can erase the marks easier later on. This will help ensure that your words are straight and not crooked.
 You don't have to get the font right at this pointâ€”just try to get the rough shape and size. This will help you position the stencils later on. Again, remember to draw lightly so that the pencil does not show through the paint.
 Some stencils will have a sticky back and will stay put while you paint. If your stencil moves around too much, tape the edges down using painter's tape.
 You can use a foam brush or a stencil brush to apply the paint. Apply the paint using a light, tapping motion. Try not to apply too much paint at once; you can always apply another coat or two. If you apply too much paint at once, the paint may leak under the stencil and create puddles.


If you are painting on fabric, use fabric paint instead.
 You may want to start out by painting every other letter first, then going back and painting the missing letters. This will give the paint time to dry, and you won't have to worry about accidentally touching and smearing wet paint.
 Depending on what type of paint you used, this can take anywhere between 20 minutes to 2 hours. Hang your banner up by either taping or tacking it to the wall.

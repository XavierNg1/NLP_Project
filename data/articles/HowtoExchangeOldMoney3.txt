 Sometimes a new government or central bank takes over and phases out an old currency. Other times, a merger with another currency replaces another. The most common example of the latter is the Euro replacing Francs, Lira, German Marks and other European currencies.


Most countries that went to the Euro set a final date to exchange old currency. For the first countries that made the change, such as France and Germany, the final date was in 2012. This means that after this point, old Francs are just paper with no value for exchange., If you are in the currency's home country, it should not be hard to swap the old currency for a new one. Follow the same steps in method 1 at this point. However, if you are not located in the currency's home country, you will have to call banks to see if they can make the exchange.
 If you are making the swap outside the home country for that currency, find the best exchange rate and check on the fees. Since few financial institutions will have the new notes on hand, a bank will often require you to change the money into dollars or a common currency. Every institution will use a slightly different exchange rate so call around to find the best one.
 The actual exchange process is very simple. The bank will simply take in your old notes and issue new ones. If you are exchanging a foreign currency for dollars, the bank should also provide a receipt that includes the exchange rate used and any fees.

 If your divorce is simple and uncontested, you may not need an attorney. However, you should consult with an attorney if you have children, own joint property, or if your spouse is contesting the divorce.


In most circumstances, you and your spouse must be separated for 12 months before you can file for divorce.
The complaint form includes a line for returning to your former name if you want to do so.
Neither spouse can force the other to change names.
You can amend your documents up to 30 days before your hearing is scheduled if you neglected to include name change information when you filed., Depending on the circumstances of your marriage and divorce, you may have to attach additional documents to your complaint to prove statements you've made in your complaint.


You also are responsible for serving the complaint on your spouse. Your county clerk has forms for service of process.
If you do not know your spouse's whereabouts, the clerk can assist you with other methods that provide notice of the complaint.
 If your spouse does not answer your complaint within 30 days (extended to 60 days if he lives outside the state of Maryland, or 90 days if he lives in another country), you can request a default ruling in your favor. Otherwise you must request a hearing.
 The judge will ask if you want to return to a former name. If you do, the judge will include this order in your final divorce decree.


In your Judgment of Absolute Divorce, the judge will specify that one or both spouses is returning to a former name. The name must be one you’ve actually used in the past, not a new name.
 Once your divorce is finalized, you must show a certified copy of the decree to get your name changed on any government-issued documents such as your Social Security card or your driver’s license.

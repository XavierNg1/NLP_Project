 Try to leave no more than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of space between the guacamole and the bowl's rim.;
, This will make it easier to spread the sour cream on top—and scrape the sour cream off later.
 Keep adding the sour cream until you can't see the guacamole anymore. The sour cream will create a "seal" between the guacamole the air and keep it from turning brown., Smooth it out until it is pressed flat against the sour cream. Wrap the excess plastic wrap against the sides of the bowl to improve the seal. This will help keep the sour cream itself fresh.
 It will taste better if you eat it later that day, but the guacamole can stay fresh for up to three days.


When you are ready to eat the guacamole, scrape the soul cream off, or stir it in for a creamier dip.

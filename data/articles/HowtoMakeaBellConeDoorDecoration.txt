, Before beginning to add the bells, wrap a ring of flexible wire around the foam, about three quarters of the way up. Twist at the back and form a loop to hang the finished wreath from. The bells will be added working around this wire, simply shift them around it as you proceed.
 Slip a florist's pin through the bell's little loop and push into the Styrofoam. The first bell should dangle straight out of the tip straight, while the next bells can be angled around and face sideways.
 Aligned with the tip bell, have one row go straight up to the top of the Styrofoam with all the bells facing straight ahead. For the remaining bells, continue each row out to the sides and work your way to the top. The bells should appear to be flowing or cascading down as a pretty bunch.
 Slip a little wire through the knot base and pin to the top of the Styrofoam. Also glue into place, to ensure that it doesn't flop about.

 Hypertonic fluid replacement drinks contain more sugar, so they are ideal for replenishing fluids and calories following a heavy workout. A hypertonic drink is one that has more salt than normal cells, so it will draw water out of those cells with osmosis.These drinks can also be helpful for restoring energy during and after a long-distance run, such as a marathon. However due to the higher concentration of sugar the water in these drinks is not as easily absorbed and are best used in combination with an isotonic drink to rehydrate and refuel after a workout.Hypertonic drinks can also be useful as part of a weight gain regimen, but make sure that you also add more calories from food. They are especially useful for gaining weight because they supply more calories and carbohydrates.

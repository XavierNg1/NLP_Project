 Fill a bucket or spray bottle with one part water to one part white vinegar. Leave the solution on the grout for five minutes. Scrub the grout with a narrow scrub brush or stiff toothbrush. Rinse the area clean with warm water.Vinegar is acid-based, so make sure to do a small test area first to make sure the solution doesn’t affect your surrounding tile.
Optionally, apply a paste of baking soda and water to the grout before dousing it with the vinegar solution. The combination will bubble up. Then scrub and rinse.

You may want to check if your brand of tile is compatible with using a steam cleaner first.For example, steam cleaners are not recommended for ceramic tile., If all else fails, use a sharp-edged tool to scrape away the caulk. Clean the area with a solution of three parts water to one part bleach, and let it dry. Use mildew-resistant caulk to discourage future mold. Make sure to seal the grout correctly so that organic growth won’t re-enter.If you think the mold may have gotten underneath tiling or otherwise penetrated the structure of the room, you may want to renovate and re-tile the area.

 You can create an ombre look with eye makeup without using any eye shadow. Begin by using white eyeliner at the corners of your eyes on your bottom lids. Extend the eyeliner to almost the halfway across your lids.








You can also use a different, light tint if you wish.
 It is your choice whether you use two or three separate eyeliners for this look. If you use two, use a brighter shade and extend it from almost halfway to the end of your bottom lids. Or, you can use a light colored eyeliner and extend it from almost hallway to near the ends of your eyelids.








Light blue pairs nicely with the white eyeliner.
 If you’re using three colors, finish off with the brightest or deepest shade of eyeliner. Extend it from the point where your last color finishes off and bring it to the end of your eyelids. Or, you can extend the eyeliner to a cat eye.
 The ombre eyeliner is more apparent if you do not wear heavy mascara. It looks best with bare eyelashes. If that doesn’t work for you, you can use clear or brown mascara. Do not use too many coats of mascara. One coat of mascara is enough.

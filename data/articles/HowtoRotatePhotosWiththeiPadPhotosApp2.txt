 In addition to correctly orienting your picture, Photos will also rotate the image just a few degrees to straighten its composition. Keep in mind that this process may also crop your photo slightly. A minor tilt in a picture can dramatically affect its quality.
 Touch the triangle over "Reset." Drag your finger left or right over the dial, and the picture will tilt in your chosen direction. Lift your finger to stop adjustments., Your edits will be saved. If you want to start over and straighten it differently, press "Reset" under the dial. If at any point you change your mind about editing the photo, simply tap "Cancel" to exit.

 If your hair is fine or damaged, select a heat setting under 200 degrees. If your hair is curly or thick, select a heat setting between 300 and 400 degrees. As you go, you can gauge how well your initial temperature selection is working, and make adjustments accordingly. Never go above 400 degrees., Separate a section about 1 or two inches wide, and 1 to 1.5 centimeters deep.Comb it out and mist it lightly with hairspray, going from root to end. Hold the section of hair by the tip, keeping it taught.
 There are a few different ways to do this.


If you are using spring curling tongs and want to achieve a bouncy curl, clip the tongs close to the roots and slide them gently down to the tip, holding them horizontally. Roll up until the whole hair segment is wrapped around the barrel.
If you are using spring curling tongs and want loose waves, clip the tongs an inch or two above the ends of your hair, holding them in a vertical position, and roll up. Varying the direction in which you curl will help to create a more natural look.If you are using clipless tongs, start at the roots of your hair. Hold the tongs vertically, and wrap your hair around them in a spiral from base to tip., The amount of time you need will vary depending on how thick your hair is, and how much definition you want in your curls. If you are unsure, start at 10 and see how it looks. You can always go back and hold for longer, but you canâ€™t un-burn your hair.
 Use a bobby pin to clip the curl onto your head. This will keep it out of your way, and help it hold its shape once you unpin it. Repeat this process until all of your hair is curled, then carefully unpin your hair.
 If your curls look a little too perfect, fingercomb your hair gently to break up any unwanted ringlets. If you want a slightly mussed look, flip your hair forward and then back. You may need to do this a couple times if you have thick hair, or if you applied a little too much product.

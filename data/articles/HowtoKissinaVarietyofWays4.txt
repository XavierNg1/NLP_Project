 The foot kiss is both an erotic and a romantic gesture. Before you begin, make sure you have your partner's consent, because some people are weird about their feet. Next, make sure your partner's feet are clean and ready to be kissed. Begin by gently sucking the toes and then lightly kissing the foot.

While you kiss your partner's foot, give her a gentle foot massage at the same time.






Lightly blow on your partner's toes.






Don't kiss your partner's feet if he wore sneakers or close-toed shoes all day because his feet could be sweaty and damp. The best time to do this is after he is freshly showered.






If you know that your partner plans on kissing your feet, keep your toenails neatly trimmed and manicured.
 This is not an erotic kiss, but is meant to show your affection, or even to say goodnight to your loved one. Simply brush your lips lightly on the crown of your loved one's head. You can even push your loved one's hair back for effect.
 This one is simple. Rub noses with your partner and don't forget to smile.
 This is a great way to greet your partner or to say goodbye. Just gently kiss your partner on his cheek.
 Move your face close to your partner's until your eyelashes are touching. Then, bat your eyelashes at the same time.

 The standard rotisserie chicken is 2 pounds (0.91Â kg) with a seasoned skin, which will need to be peeled. You will also need to shred it.To do so, start by removing the wings and legs by cutting through the joints with a knife and then pulling them off. Peel off the skin from each piece as you go.
Use a knife to run down the center along the breast bone to remove the breast meat.
Try to get as much meat off the back as you can.
When shredding, use either your fingers and hands or one hand and a fork. If the meat gets stuck in the fork, gently pull it off.
 Dice the onion and green pepper, and mince the garlic. Place them all in a 3-quart casserole dish with enough water to coat the bottom of the dish. Microwave on high for 3-4 minutes, stirring once halfway through.


To dice a green pepper, first cut off the top and bottom ends before standing it up and making a cut down one side. Next, lay the pepper on its side, slide your knife in the opening and, while turning the pepper, cut between the pepper and the core/seeds. Discard the core, and cut the pepper in half. Take one half, holding it flat, and cut it into thin slices. Keeping the slices in a row, turn them perpendicularly and again cut thin slices, forming dice. Do the same for the other half., Toss in the shredded chicken, Rotel, tomato sauce, kidney beans, chili powder, salt and paprika. Microwave everything on high for 25-30 minutes. When done, make sure you use hot pads while removing the casserole dish from the microwave as it will be very hot.


Make sure you stir the chili frequently while it's cooking. Microwaves cook quickly but very unevenly, even those that rotate.
To give it a bit more punch, try crushing up some tortilla chips and throwing them on top, along with a dollop of sour cream and a squeeze of lime juice.

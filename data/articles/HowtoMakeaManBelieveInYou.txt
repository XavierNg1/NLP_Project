 Positive thinking, leads to positive speaking, leads to positive actions!;
, Don't expect him to trust you with him when there is no need/reason to.
 Make him feel like he is the most important person to you at the moment!

, Be likable - it actually helps build credibility and makes anyone warm to what you're saying.


Say a funny joke and get him on your side before you start your story.
It starts with how confident you are with you knowledge and he will feel the confidence!

, Men are driven by facts, while women are driven by feels: if you need a man to believe you, you have to create evidence of your statements!


Research the subject matter you want him to believe. Come up with logical knowledge that will spark a conversation he had no clue of!
Learn to empathize with his facts but always counter act your viewpoint in a subtle way.
 Give him an example of who, what, when, why, and how. Remember, the why is the most important out of the all the other facts!

, You can not rely on others to help you be the best you, you have to do it yourself!

, Be reasonable with him and if it doesn't work out, it was not meant to be!


Trust that if he doesn't believe you, someone else will.
 Think in his shoes before you think in yours, to help him see where you're coming from. Know that you a bringing something new in his scope of work so be patient to 'get it'Â !

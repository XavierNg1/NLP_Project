 It is a simple and complex task. Being saved means accepting that you are a sinner, and that your sin separates us from being in communion with God. However, God sent his son Jesus (John 3:16) to the earth, in human form, and lived a perfect life, was killed people just like us, and rose on the third day so that we may have life, and life more abundantly with God. We enter in to a relationship with God once we become saved. (If you wanting to get saved please call the nearest Southern Baptist Church and try to get in contact with a pastor or deacon.);
, There are programs that they offer like Sunday School, and Bible studies to help you further your knowledge about God, Jesus, the Bible, and living a holy lifestyle.
 Learn that God is in control of all circumstances. Even when things go bad, pray and believe.
 The significance in this is that we are sinners, but when we get saved and we go below the water, God washes our sins away and we are risen from death (death is the penalty because of our sin) into a new life with Christ.
 Even Baptist believe differently in their churches. The main thing is is to live how Christ lived and try to be like Him. Learn the Word and decide what you believe and why. Grow Strong in God and be fruitful.

 Take your boat to areas that would be suitable for grouper, like near coral reefs or underwater cliffs. When you begin to troll, make sure you are doing so off the rocks or your line might get snagged. Aim for the sandy areas around the rocks or areas where you think grouper are swimming.


Large amounts of grouper live in the Bahamas, Gulf of Mexico, South Carolina, and Florida.Circle back to areas where you felt bites, as these are likely fish prone areas.If an area is unsuccessful, change locations.
 Keep a steady speed as you troll the area.Going faster than 12 knots may cause your lure or bait to get dislodged from your line.When using live baits, make sure that you are trolling at lower speeds., As you begin to move your boat, the line will straighten out. Counting to ten will let the bait reach the bottom of the water. Your bait should be bumping on the bottom periodically, but not getting hung up on anything.


You can use artificial or live bait while you troll.
Check your line often if you are using bait to make sure that it hasn't become dislodged.
 Lock your reel and wait for a bite on your line. When you feel a bite, make sure to reel as hard as you can and raise your rod. You'll see the tip of your rod bend significantly when you've hooked a fish. Your rod should naturally bend by rubbing against the bottom of the ocean.


The momentum of your boat will help you pull grouper out of rocks or reefs if it tries to escape.

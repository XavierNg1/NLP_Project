 The process of shaving will go more smoothly if your skin is soft, supple and warm. Either shave in the shower or get your armpits wet with warm water before you begin.


If you tend to get ingrown hairs, exfoliate your skin with a body scrub, too.If you have very sensitive skin, do the process at night to give your skin chance to rest overnight.;
, Raise it high over your head to make sure the armpit skin is nice and taut. This will prevent you from getting cuts or razor burn.
 If you don't use shaving cream or body wash, you could end up getting razor burn, so don't skip this important step.









In a pinch, you can use plain bar soap. Work it up into a lather before you apply it.
Or try shampoo or conditioner, if you don't have anything else on hand.
 Using a dull or rusty razor has more than one drawback. You won't get a close shave, you're more likely to get nicked, and you could even end up with an ingrown hair or an infection. Make sure the razor is in good condition.
 Everyone's hair grows a little differently under the armpit. Yours might all grow in one direction, or it might sprout in many different directions. Make an effort to shave against the direction of growth for a cleaner shave. Carefully shave away the hair, wetting the razor in between strokes if necessary.
 Wash away the excess shaving cream and check your armpit to make sure the hair has been removed. Do a touch-up if necessary, then repeat the process on the other side.
 Shaving may leave tiny nicks in your skin, so give them a chance to heal before you apply a product. If you put deodorant on right away, it could sting or cause a rash.

 Print out an image of the first potential element of your sleeve, such as a design drafted by your artist. Hang it next to your bed, above your alarm clock, on the refrigerator, or another location where you’ll see it multiple times a day. Keep the image posted for a few weeks before you decide to get it tattooed on your body.If you can go a few weeks or a couple of months living with the image without getting sick of it, it’s more likely you’ll actually enjoy it being a permanent part of your body.
 Before starting your sleeve, double check your job’s dress code and consider the clothing typically worn by people in your field of work. In general, companies across industries are more accepting of tattoos than they’ve been in the past.However, it’s better to be on the safe side and make sure your new ink won’t have an impact on your present or future job prospects.If you’re worried about the potential professional consequences of a large-scale tattoo, try starting on your upper arm and working toward half sleeve coverage.
 If you’re eager to start your sleeve but have a limited budget, you might want to take the time to save up some money for a quality tattoo. Your work of art is a major investment and will be a permanent part of your body. Some full sleeves add up to thousands of dollars spent over the course of years, and it’ll be worth it in the long run to invest in quality artistry.Depending on the size of your sleeve’s first piece, be prepared to spend at least $100 (U.S.) before tip. That amount will increase for larger pieces with finer details or more colors. As for gratuity, you should tip your artist 20%, especially if you intend on working with them on later additions.

 The pairing is one that is unique to the Tarpon area of Florida. Greek salad with potato salad makes quite the tasty combination.Here's what you'll need:


For the potato salad:

2.5 lbs. red skin potatoes
2 green onions, diced
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
Salt and pepper, to taste


For the Greek salad:

1 head Romaine lettuce, chopped
1 bell pepper, diced
1 cucumber, diced
2 tomatoes, diced
1 cooked beet, diced
1 pepperoncini, sliced
Kalamata olives to taste
Olive oil to taste
fresh cracked pepper, to taste



, Boil a large pot of salted water. While you wait for it to boil, dice up your potatoes into one-inch cubes. Cook them for about 12-15 minutes, or until they feel tender when you poke them with a fork.Be sure to salt the water liberally so that the potatoes receive some seasoning as they cook.
After the potatoes have been boiled, drain the water and set the potatoes aside so that they can cool completely before proceeding to the next steps.
 When the potatoes are completely cooled down, mix them with the mayonnaise and green onions. Taste the mixture and add salt and pepper according to your preference.When the potato salad is mixed and seasoned to perfection, place it in the refrigerator to allow it to cool for at least another hour.
This potato salad makes about 6 servings and will act as the topping or side to the Greek salad described in the next step.
 Place the chopped romaine in a large serving bowl. Top the lettuce with green onions, kalamata olives, pepperoncini, beets, tomatoes, cucumber, and bell peppers.Serve the potato salad on the bottom of the Greek salad, on the top, or on the side.
Sprinkle the salad with feta cheese and fresh cracked pepper.
Top it all with a drizzle of olive oil.

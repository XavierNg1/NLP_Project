 If you have Bermuda grass, that is the kind of EZ seed you need. Don't buy the grass seeds that are different from your grass. It can mess up your grass, which will make your grass ultimately end up looking weird.;
, Do this if you have the EZ grass seed and it matches your grass correctly. You are obviously not going to just pour the EZ seed all over your yard. Here are some things you will possibly need:


EZ Seeds
Shovel
Water
Gloves
Fertilizer

, You will need to put on your gloves before starting.
 Make sure the area is completely dirt afterwards.
 Be careful not to pour too much seed, as this will do nothing extra for your yard.
 This will help your seeds grow more efficiently.
 Water the seeds everyday and add on more seeds if needed.

, These represent from which color tees golfers can tee off. Champion male golfers may tee off from black tees, while the average male golfer may tee off from white tees, women will tee off from red tees and junior golfers from green tees.

Next to the tee colors will be a set of numbers, these represent the course and slope ratings. They allow golfers of different abilities to play together in a more equal environment; this is referred to as handicapping a golfer.
The course rating tells you what the total par is from the corresponding set of tees. The slope rating is based around an average of 113. If the slope rating is lower than 113, you are playing an easier course, if it is more than 113, you are playing a more difficult course. The course difficulty is determined by the amount and type of obstacles each hole contains.
 The par tells you how many shots it should take the golfer to put his ball in each specific hole. The par varies depending on the hole and its difficulty, with easier holes having a lower par and more difficult holes having a higher par.
, If a player achieves a hole-in-one, write a "1" in the space provided for that golfer.
 The total par tells gives you the figure for all the pars in the course added together. In order to find out the total par if you only played 9 holes, you will need to add up the pars for each of the holes you played to get the total.
 The golfer that received the lowest total score has won the game.
 For example, if a golfer hit 4 strokes over the par, this would be written as "+4." There is typically a space to input this number in the far right hand column for each golfer.

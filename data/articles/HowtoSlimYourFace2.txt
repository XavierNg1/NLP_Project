 You can also create the illusion of a slimmer face by using makeup. To do so, you can start by slimming down your nose. Use a powder darker than your natural skin tone, as well as a concealer that is a few shades lighter than your regular tone. You will also need two small brushes.Draw a thin line on either side of your nose with the dark concealer using a makeup brush.
Draw a line going down the bridge of your nose with the concealer. Then, draw several small lines between your eyebrows.
Take another brush and blend the makeup into your skin. This should result in a slimmer looking nose.
 You can also sharpen your jawline using makeup, which may give your face a slimmer look overall. You will need powder slightly darker than your regular skin tone, as well as a brush to blend the powder into your face.To start, rub the powder along your jawline using your brush. This will create a shadowy look, making your jawline look thinner and more defined.
Keep blending until your jawline looks natural. Make sure to blend the powder into your remaining makeup so the contrast is not jarring.
 Highlighting your cheeks may also help your face have a slimmer appearance. To do so, you'll need a powder darker than your regular skin tone, highlighter slightly brighter than your natural tone, blush, and a blending brush.Taking the darker powder, draw a line along your cheekbone. Use your brush to blend this line.
Then, apply some blush along the line. Blend this blush in the same direction.
Above your blush, add your highlighter and blend.

 Beano is an over-the-counter medication that contains a natural enzyme to prevent bloating and gas caused by fiber intake. Beano works to reduce the amount of gas the fiber you eat releases, cutting down on the amount of gas you release after a meal.In several studies, Beano has been shown to be effective at alleviating bloating and gas after a fiber heavy meal., Daily use of fiber supplements like Metamucil or Konsyl can be a very effective way to maintain a healthy fiber intake. However, the best way to receive fiber is always through food first. You should check with your doctor before you add fiber supplements to your diet, especially if you are taking other medication that could interact with these supplements.Start with a small amount of fiber supplements so your body has time to adjust and you do not get too bloated or gassy. Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day.
Fiber supplements can decrease your body’s ability to absorb certain medications, like aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin) and carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol). These supplements can also reduce your blood sugar levels. Your doctor may need to adjust your medications or your insulin if you have diabetes and want to take fiber supplements.
 Bouts of excessive bloating, belching, and gas often resolve on their own, or they will lessen as your body adjusts to your fiber intake. But you should talk to your doctor if your symptoms don’t improve or you experience severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, unintended weight loss, or chest pain.These symptoms could be signs of an underlying digestive condition or intestinal issue.

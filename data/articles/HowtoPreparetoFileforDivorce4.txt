 Most states have a minimum residency requirement for people who want to file for divorce. If you've lived in the same place for six months or longer, you can probably file for divorce in your county, even if your spouse does not live there.


If you haven't lived in the same place for long, you may have to first file for separation and then file for divorce after you've met the residency requirements of your state. In most cases you must file in the state where you live, even if you got married in a different state.
Exceptions may be made for same-sex couples who got married in a state other than their state of residency for legal reasons.
 You can also visit the county courthouse website and download forms from the internet.


In most cases you will fill out a Family Law Petition, giving the court information about your marriage and the orders you want the court to make. Have your lawyer help you fill out the forms.
Fill out a Summons, which describes standard restrictions regarding how your assets and debts will be handled during the proceedings.
Fill out a Property Declaration form to specify how your property should be divided.
Fill out forms regarding child custody and visitation if you have children under 18 with your spouse.
 Even if you think you have the situation under control, chances are, there's something you've missed. In order for the divorce petition to be processed smoothly, it's important that the forms be filled out correctly with accurate information, and it's worth it to get a lawyer involved.

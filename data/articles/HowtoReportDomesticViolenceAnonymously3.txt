 Many people who want to report domestic violence anonymously wish to do so because they fear the abuser. You may fear the abuser because you live in the same house, have had threatening contact with the abuser, or because you fear the victim. By reporting the abuse anonymously, you can protect yourself from potential payback.


You may also not be entirely sure if domestic violence is occurring. In this situation, you may be embarrassed if you are wrong. By reporting anonymously, you can avoid a later confrontation with the suspected victim or abuser.
 If you report anonymously, then the police will not have your name and they probably cannot use your report in court. An abuser charged with a crime has a right to confront witnesses in court. Accordingly, it may be difficult for the prosecutor to bring charges, especially if the victim refuses to testify.


If you are reporting abuse committed against yourself, then you should know that you will probably need to publicly accuse the other person of violence if you hope to see the abuser jailed.
If you are being abused and you want help on how to leave your abuser, then you should call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 with questions. The organization also has a website with links to resources, such as contact information for state agencies and brochures on how to create a safety plan.
 Know that if you report domestic violence anonymously, you can still identify yourself at a later date. If you hear abuse and fear that the victim is in imminent harm, you can report the violence anonymously and then reach out to the victim.


If the victim wants help putting the abuser in prison, then you can choose to come forward and identify yourself to police. At that point, you can share with police your documentation of all the abuse you have observed.

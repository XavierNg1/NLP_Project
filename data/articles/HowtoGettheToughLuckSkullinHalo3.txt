 To claim the skull, you must have begun the campaign level from the beginning and have attempted it on a difficulty of at least Normal. The Tsavo Highway campaign level can be accessed from the Campaign option on the main menu.;
, The area is located directly after a fight with the brutes, grunts and drones guarding the first shield door to the highway. There is a long stretch of piping running alongside the road to the left. If you see a Covenant phantom fly overhead, then you are in the right place.
 If you can't reach it, consider parking your warthog, or other vehicle, next to the piping and jump off onto it.
 There will be a yellow, grated barrier in front of it on the piping which you will need to jump over.
 You will see a small protrusion from the piping below with two bolts on it. You need to jump onto these and then onto the ledge far below.
 You will take a little bit of damage from the fall, but don't be alarmed. Walk towards the end of the ledge straight ahead and turn to your left. You will see the Tough Luck Skull resting on a rock ledge on the mountain.
 You may need to double jump or crouch jump, but if you time it well, simply jumping across normally will suffice.
 Congratulations, you've found it! Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics to see the Tough Luck achievement has been unlocked for 10 gamerscore. It is represented by a skull with a three-leafed clover on it. You will also be able to use the Tough Luck skull in your campaign games by pressing X in the campaign menu and selecting it. It gives you a x1.5 campaign score multiplier, but increases the chances of enemies dodging your shots and grenades.

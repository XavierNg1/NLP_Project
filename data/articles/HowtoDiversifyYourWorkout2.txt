 If you do a lot of cardio, chances are you're on the same incline. Changing that incline can not only make your workout more challenging, but change up your workout enough to avoid plateauing in your results.For example, if you walk or run on your treadmill, you probably use the same incline every day. Instead, on days when you're feeling energetic, increase the incline on your treadmill for all or part of your run.
You can also make this adjustment if you run outside rather than on a treadmill by varying your route. Choose one with more hills or inclines to vary your runs on days when you have lots of energy.
 As with incline, working out at the same speed every day can be boring and interfere with your health and wellness goals. For example, you could vary the speed of your runs by increasing the speed for a portion of your run. You can also run more quickly for a set period of time, then slow back down.
 Routine is great for working out, because it makes it a regular part of your day. However, using the same machines or moves every single day can get boring. Switching up your sets can bring diversity to your workout.For example, if you swim a lot, you can easily vary the speed and intensity of your swim workout by using different sets. Some days you can focus more on pull sets - where you use your arms to propel yourself through the water. Other days focus on working on your kicking. Finally, you can have some workouts where you work on both pulling and kicking.

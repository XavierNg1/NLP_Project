Download Real Alternative from the CNET website by going to the Real Alternative download page and clicking the "Download Now" button. Save the file in a location that you will remember on your computer and allow it to download completely.
Close your Internet browser. This is an essential step to make sure that the Real Alternative installer does not conflict with your Internet browser.
Double-click on the downloaded file to open it from its saved location. You will see a dialogue box appear saying that Real Alternative is being installed.
Let the dialogue box remain on your screen while Real Alternative installs in the background. The dialogue box will disappear automatically once Real Alternative has been installed successfully.

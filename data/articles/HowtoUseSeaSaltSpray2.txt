 Wash your hair using a normal or hydrating shampoo, then dry your hair using cool heat.


Avoid clarifying shampoos since they can strip your hair of its natural oils, which may reduce the textured effect you're trying to achieve.
The cool heat setting of your hair dryer is ideal since it should dry your hair without creating excess frizz. Avoid high heat settings. Don't towel dry your hair, either.
 Lightly coat your hair with sea salt spray, applying it from root to tip. Use a comb to brush the product through evenly.


Unlike beach waves, bead head styles should also extend throughout your entire hair instead of remaining restricted to the lower half. As such, you'll need to apply it to your roots.
You only need to use a light spritz, however. Applying too much can weigh your hair down, making it look flat and messy instead of voluminous.
 Continue shaking and mussing your hair until you've achieved your desired look.


For a more subtle approach, keep your hands off and simply shake your head back and forth. This should give you greater texture while keeping the mess to a minimum.
For an even messier look, tip your head upside-down while you tousle your hair with your fingers.
 The sea salt spray should dry quickly. Once it does, the resulting look should look like messy, yet controlled, bed head.


Avoid touching or combing your hair after your style sets. The more you mess with it, the quicker your hair will flatten out again.

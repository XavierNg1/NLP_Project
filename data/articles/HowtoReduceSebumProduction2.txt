 One way to help reduce the oil on your skin is to cleanse it properly. Use a gentle face wash or body wash. Using harsh soaps may cause your skin to produce more oil. Try a basic oil free cleanser, or one with salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, beta-hydroxy acid, or glycolic acid. These ingredients help to dissolve the oils and clean your skin.Try a small amount of the face wash on your skin before using it regularly. These ingredients may irritate your skin, so find one that works for you.
 When washing your face, make sure to use warm water instead of hot water. Hot water can irritate your skin. This can cause your skin to to produce even more oil. When washing your face or body, use lukewarm water., Though you may think that scrubbing your skin will help get rid of oil, that can actually be worse for your skin. Donâ€™t use rough wash rags or bath puffs on your skin. Scrubbing your skin with harsh materials can make your skin create more skin. Either avoid using anything on your skin or use a soft cloth., Your sebum production may vary depending on the season. Your hormone levels may change weekly or monthly and affect your oil production. When you notice that your face and body are oilier than usual, you may want to wash with a cleanser with oil-fighting ingredients more often than when your skin is not as oil.You may want to include toners or clay masks to your regimen when you have more oil. Only apply the toner or mask to the oily areas on your face or body. These products can over-dry your skin.
For example, your body may produce more sebum during the summer than during the winter. This means you may need a more intense cleaning routine during the summer than the winter.

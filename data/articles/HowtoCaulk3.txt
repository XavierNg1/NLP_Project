 A caulking gun isn’t necessary for all caulking jobs. Use 5 ounce squeeze tubes when you have a small, indoor project.Remove the cap from the squeeze tube, then trim the end off the nozzle with scissors. For the most control over caulk flow, cut the nozzle at a 45-degree angle.


Squeeze the bottle with steady pressure so your bead will look uniform and neat.
 Pressurized cans are usually about 7 ounces a piece. They are ideal when you need to create a uniform bead while you’re caulking overhead, or any other time you are caulking with only one hand.You should be able to obtain pressurized cans of caulk at any home improvement store.
 If you’ve never caulked before, it’s best to get a feel for how the caulk flows before applying it. Even if you have caulked before, it’s a good idea to get a feel for the specific caulk you’re using for this job. Practice by applying caulk on the inside corners of a cardboard box or on some other throw-away material.


Work on creating a steady flow and uniform bead.
Once you’ve got the hang of it, move on to the actual caulking task.

 Include:


Snacks. Steer clear of chocolate, potato chips (crisps), chewy candy and marshmallows! Instead go for healthy options such as apples, bananas, veggie sticks (make sure you pack tiny dip containers and fill them with ranch sauce etc.), mint gum and sandwiches (pack them for the entire family with their favorite fillings!).
Coloring books and crayons. Great for when you've got smaller siblings! Don't bring felt tips though, they can leak and smudge.
A small container with wet wipes, moisturizer etc. Clean yourself every thirty minutes or so.
Reading material like books and magazines. If you don't get carsick, it's great to keep your brain working.
Electronic devices. DVD players, DSIs, iPods, laptops...all great choices to keep you entertained.
DVDs and CDs. If you bring a laptop or DVD player, it's fabulous to chill out watching your favorite films!
A neck pillow. It will cause much less stress and pain!
A blanket. If you plan on falling asleep or at least have something to cuddle and play with, a warm blanket will make things much more comfortable.
A mini desk - if possible. Make sure it's always organized - preps are very neat!
Blinders. Pin them up on your windows if it's way too sunny. Fantastic if you want to get some sleep, too.
Nausea pills and paper bags. If anyone gets carsick, it's always best to be prepared.
A notebook, pens, stickers etc. Make things less boring! Write, draw and color. Who knows? - Maybe you're the next J.K Rowling.;
, Make sure you're very clean the night before.
 It will get you in a better mood the next day, car rides are terrible...but if you're cranky, they're even worse!!

 It only works for Sonic Colors and Sonic Lost World, although the last step can apply to Sonic Generations.
 Either grab these rings when they're sitting in plain sight, or use alternate routes and special items where necessary.
 Do this by beating all the levels in the bonus stages or extra game mode, or just beat the final boss to collect all seven.
 Collect 50 rings. Then jump in the air and press the power-up button (this button varies with each controller and/or console). You will become Super Sonic!

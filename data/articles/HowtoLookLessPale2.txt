 Donâ€™t use a bronzer that is more than one skin tone darker than your own. Check carefully when buying it at the store and test out a few on your face to see which color will work best for you. Avoid bronzers with orange tints -- these typically do not look good on pale skin. Go for bronzers that lean toward brown., Different products work well for oily, combination, and dry skins. Using testers, check at the store which products feel and spread best on your skin. Bronzers are supposed to add a healthy-looking shine to your skin, and can be very useful for making pale skin appear slightly darker. (They are not designed to make your skin look bronze, despite their name.), After getting some on the brush, tap off any excess before applying. Focus on your temples and cheekbones. Use only a little on your nose and chin, and blend a little on your neck.

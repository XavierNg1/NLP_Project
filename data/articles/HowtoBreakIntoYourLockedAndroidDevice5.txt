 A factory reset will wipe out all the data on the device, reverting it to its factory state (the state it was in when you bought it).This will delete all of the data on the device, and should only be used as a last resort if you can't bypass your lock screen.
If you're trying to bypass someone else's lock screen, you'll be out of luck if the phone is running 5.1 or later. Android 5.1 introduced Device Protection, which requires logging in with the original Google account after the device has been wiped. This is to prevent a thief from using the phone after stealing it.
 Just press down on the Power button and select “Power off” from the menu that pops up.


Alternatively, you can also just hold down the Power button for five seconds until your device powers off.
 If your device has a Home button, such as a Samsung Galaxy device, press and hold the Volume Up button, the Home button, and the Power button. Continue holding the buttons until your see the Android Recovery logo.
 Press the Power button to select it, which reboot your device and enter Recovery mode.
 Press the Power button to select this option.
 This will confirm that you want to erase all of the data on the device and reset it. The reset process will likely take 20-30 minutes.
 Once the reset is complete, you'll be taken through the device setup process. You can log back in with your Google account to restore most of your settings.


If the device is running Android 5.1 or later, you'll need to enter the original Google account and password to unlock the device. This is to prevent theft.

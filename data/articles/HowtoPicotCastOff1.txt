 Start by casting on two stitches how you normally would. To cast on, insert the working needle (right hand) in between the first two stitches on the main needle (left hand). Then, yarn over and pull this loop through the two stitches. Then, turn this loop and slide it onto the main needle.Repeat one time to cast on your second stitch.;
, Next, knit into the two stitches that you just cast onto the main needle. Knit these stitches as you normally would. To knit, insert the needle through the first loop, yarn over, and pull through the loop. As you do so, allow the old loop to slide off the main needle and the new loop to replace it on your working needle., Bind off one of the stitches you just knit. To bind off, simply pull the second stitch over the first stitch on the needle. Pull the second stitch over the end of the needle to complete the bind off. , Knit another stitch and then bind off one stitch again. Doing this multiple times will form your picots.Repeat the process of knitting one and binding off one stitch until you have bound off a total of four stitches.
This will complete your first picot.
 After your third bind off, transfer the leftover stitch back over to the main needle. This will allow you to repeat the process and keep making picots., Continue to repeat the entire process from cast on to slipping the leftover stitch back to the main needle. Keep doing this until you have bound off all of the stitches for your project.

, Dentists use abrasive agents, dental picks and polishing paste or air polishing powder to remove stains. Some of the yellowing or browning of teeth may be caused by tartar, which is only effectively removed with deep dental cleaning and scaling.


Doctors suggest a cleaning every six months to remove stains and protect teeth and gums.
 The main culprits are coffee, tea, juices, soft drinks and sports drinks. If you must drink them use a straw.


Rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth about 10 minutes after drinking these beverages if you continue to drink them daily, or they will counteract the work you are doing to whiten teeth.
Also, avoid smoking, which can cause permanent staining.
 Mix two tsp. of baking soda with enough water to form a paste. Dip a manual toothbrush in the paste and brush it in a circular motion on all your teeth surfaces, including the interior ones.


Dip the toothbrush in the paste several times throughout the process.
Repeat this method at least once a week, or up to three times per week, but not for more than four weeks in a row. Be aware that it is important to avoid this treatment if you suffer from enamel hypoplasia, so check with your dentist before starting this home treatment.
You can also replace the water with lemon juice for extra whitening power. Rinse your mouth afterward to get rid of residual acid, which can cause sensitivity.

 Talk with him often and build up a friendship with each other. Though this isn't as hard as it seems, some girls struggle with such things. If you're one of those girls, start gradually. Ask him for help with your books. Make sure he's not occupied because then you can spend more time with him. Chat it up while your at it.;
, If you have a friend who's friends with guys, become their friends. They probably know your crush(at least better than you probably do).
 He will open up to you more if you open up to him as well. Open up gradually.
 Talk to him as friends frequently, but not every second because that will make you look weird. Since you are in sixth grade, remember that not everyone has social networks or a phone.
 Try complimenting him one day or use body language to hint that you are interested.
 If he picks you, well there's your answer! If not, keep reading.
 See how he reacts. If he is calm or looks like he is not interested-just walk away and let it go. However if he looks happy or nervous, then he may like you too!

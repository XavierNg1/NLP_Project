 Angel hair pasta is especially healthy for you, but be careful - just because it's thin and light doesn't mean that you can eat more.;
, Don't use pre-made sauces like Ragu, instead buy cans of diced tomatoes or even just tomato sauce. These can also come flavored/spiced like Ragu, but are much healthier and give you more options about what to add.
 Throw in any form of spices that you like, things like paprika, salt, pepper, and anything you want to experiment with (all in moderation). Cook for a further 2-3 minutes, then stir in parsley and pull off the heat.
 Keep separate from the sauce until it's in your plate. You will tend to eat more if they are pre-mixed because you will subconsciously think that the sauce is taking up more room.

 Whether a cat is found to be stray or feral, both need the support of humans in their own way., Because of how wild and untamed feral cats are and their reactions to humans, it's best not to trap them yourself., TNR stands for "Trap-Neuter-Return", which is simply trapping the cats, neutering them, and returning the cats to their original "home area". Most vets also give the cat a rabies vaccination during the procedure.
 If you know a colony resides in the vicinity, get friends or neighbors to help you construct one or several "homes". Leftover lumber or small dog houses are most convenient and may be the easiest resources to find. Remember the bigger the house is, the less body heat is retained in the house. Straw is the recommended bedding material and don't forget to lay out food and water nearby.

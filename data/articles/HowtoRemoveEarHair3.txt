 Unless you are left with no other options, avoid using scissors to cut ear hair. Ear canals are very sensitive and the blades of a pair of scissors can easily damage them irreversibly. If you do use scissors, choose small, precise scissors and trim your ear hair slowly in a well-lit area., Avoid tweezing ear hair, which may cause damage to your sensitive ear canals. Tweezing can cause inflammation or lesions, which could lead to an infection. This method of hair removal is also very painful and time-consuming, so you should avoid it as a regular grooming ritual., While depilatory creams may seem like an easy way to remove hair from your ears, this method of hair removal should be avoided. The strong chemicals in hair removal creams can cause permanent damage to sensitive areas like the ears, eyes, and nose. Even milder depilatory creams (e.g. for underarms, upper lip, and bikini line) should not be used near the ears.

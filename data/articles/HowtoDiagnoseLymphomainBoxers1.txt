 Swelling lymph nodes is one of the most recognizable symptoms for lymphoma. Swollen lymph nodes are most often noticed when the owner is petting the dog. The two most common places you may find them are under the jaw and behind the knee.Lymph nodes that can be felt through the skin are paired, left and right. The swelling tends to be symmetrical, so if the lymph nodes in front of the left shoulder are enlarged, the one on the right side may be also.
Places to feel for enlargement include under the chin, in front of the shoulders, in the armpits, in the groin, and behind the knees.The swelling of the lymph nodes is not painful for the dog, so your dog may show no symptoms of pain. Many dogs with lymphoma are not obviously ill when first taken to the vet, so the swollen lymph nodes may be the only symptom.;

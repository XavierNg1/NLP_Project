 No matter where you are this will always be helpful; make sure all your archer and healer units are protected!;
, Nobody likes the sleep staff.
 Give your main characters an unused spare weapon just in case.
, Don't expect Dorcas to be a speed demon!

, Can Nino really catch up 20 levels in 5 chapters, on HHM?

, However, promoting the units early can really help out, especially in HHM.
 They are forced for some chapters.
 This can be handy. Whilst they aren't really for fighting, being able to survive the odd attack whilst looting is nice.
 Units get less XP as their level gets higher.
 Spreading too thinly could cause problems, using everybody might be tricky.
 Higher level units gain less for the same enemy and it may help your XP rank.
 For example:


Slim weapons are useful for units with low con, but they're generally inferior to iron weapons.
Iron weapons are cheap means of fighting weaker enemies. In NM, some of your stronger units can one round with them.
 Lyn's not going to do too well with an Iron Blade, it'll weigh her down.
 It has a significant effect on hit rate.
, Do they really help that much?

,, The handy conversations will up the supported unit's stats in battle by a small or large amount depending on the support level. However, if you're playing quickly, the odds are you won't get more than a C in most cases.
 It's not a bad idea to have a unit far from the action visit it before your lords get to the seize point.

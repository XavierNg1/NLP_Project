 You can find a basic pickaxe in the small house in the Barbarian Village. Pickaxes can be bought from Nurmof's Pickaxe Shop, which is found in the Dwarven Mines. There are two entrances to the mine: the first being in a building south of the east Falador bank, and the second being to the south of Ice Mountain (located north of Falador). The shop itself is found to the west of the entrance. You must go around the twisting passage, and the shop is north of the General Store.;
, There are several mining spots around the city of Varrock, and the Scorpion Pit mine near the desert town of Al Kharid.
 Do recognize the different colors of rocks, even though hovering your mouse over a rock gives you what type of mineral it is.

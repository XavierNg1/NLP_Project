 Put a line of hot glue across the bottom of the foam, then stick the top of the foam sheet to the glue.
 Cut strait lines from the folded part of the loop toward the glued edges. Stop cutting before you get to the glue line. Continue until you've made fringe all the way across.
 Begin at one short edge and roll the foam to the opposite end. When the roll is complete, dab some hot glue along the opposite end and press it down against the roll. Now start with one end of the foam and begin to roll to the opposite end.
 When the glue dries, use your fingers to open the flower by pulling out the "petals." Press each petal in the center so that it opens. Continue fluffing out the petals until the flower looks complete.
 Place a dab of glue in the center of the bottom of the mum. Lay the end of the pipe cleaner on the glue and hold it in place until the glue dries.

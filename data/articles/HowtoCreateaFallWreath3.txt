 Craft stores carry wooden wreath bases that are simply flat pieces of wood cut into a circular shape with a hole in the middle. If you can't find a wooden base, buy one that is plastic or styrofoam.
 If you live in a neighborhood with nut-bearing trees, you're in luck - just walk around the block with a paper sack and toss in acorns, walnuts, pecans, and buckeyes. Try to find nuts with intact shells and minimal bruises and cracks. Trim red berries from holly bushes and other plants that bear red, blue and blackberries in the fall.


You can use unshelled walnuts and pecans from the grocery store if you don't have access to nut trees.
Consider using faux berries from a craft store if you want your wreath to last more than one season.
 Hot glue guns are plugged into the wall and fed with clear hot glue sticks that melt and securely fasten craft items. Heat it up over a newspaper, since hot glue tends to get messy.
 Start by gluing a circle of nuts around the hole in the middle of the wreath. Glue a second circle around the first circle. Continue gluing nuts to the base until the entire wreath has been covered.
 Apply a bit of hot glue to the stem on a sprig of berries. Poke it in between a few of the nuts and hold it there for a few minutes so the glue has time to set. Continue adding sprigs of berries until you're satisfied with the way the wreath looks.
 A nut wreath is the perfect fall wreath to hang on a door in the kitchen. Hang it from a nail or rest it against the mantle, then enjoy the festive fall decoration you have created.

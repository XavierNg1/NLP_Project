 Brown sugar tends to get hard due to air exposure. If you want to keep brown sugar soft, you're best option is to store your brown sugar in a sealable, airtight container as soon as you open it up.Limit air exposure as much as possible when storing brown sugar. Choose a smaller container and pack the brown sugar to the top. Make sure to seal tightly, double checking for cracks and openings.You may not find a small enough container. In this case, use a small Ziplock bag. Squeeze out all the excess air before sealing the bag.;
, Kitchen shops and some grocery stores sell what are called terra cotta sugar savers. These are small, circular devices made from terra cotta clay. They are inexpensive, about $3 each, and can be easily used to soften brown sugar. They are designed to release moisture into your sugar, keeping it soft in storage.


After purchasing the terra cotta sugar saver, soak it in water for 15 minutes. Then, dry off the disk.Store the sugar saver with the brown sugar. Ideally, you should be using the terra cotta sugar saver alongside a sealable airtight container or plastic bag.If you add a sugar saver to a bag of brown sugar that's already hardened, it may take up to 8 hours for the sugar to soften., If you don't have a sugar saver, marshmallows work for some when it comes to keeping sugar soft. Throw a few marshmallows into your sugar container and see if it helps., Apples and bread are both fairly moist by nature. Adding a few slices of apples or a piece of bread to a bag of brown sugar can help keep it soft. The idea is the sugar will draw moisture from the bread or fruit. If you're adding apples or bread to hardened brown sugar, it may take a day before it begins to soften.

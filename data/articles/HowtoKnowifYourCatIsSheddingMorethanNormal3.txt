 All cats shed a little hair each day. You're probably aware of what's normal for your cat without even realizing it. The fact that you're concerned your cat may be shedding more may be a sign that your cat is actually shedding more hair.


You can look at your clothes, furniture, carpets, and the cat's resting spaces to see how much hair has been shed.
 If you have a short-haired cat, it may not shed as fast as a long-haired cat. You should also remember that shedding amounts will depend on if your cat is an indoor or outdoor cat. Outdoor cats usually have two large shedding cycles when the seasons and daylight amounts change. Your cat's shedding will be much steadier if it's a strictly indoor cat.If you have an indoor cat, it will probably shed steadily throughout the year because it isn't exposed to changes in daylight.
 Your cat will go through one or two long shedding cycles during the year. This will help your cat's coat adjust for changing seasons. For example, a long-haired cat may shed as the weather turns colder, so it gets a winter coat.If your cat is going through a seasonal shedding cycle, it will shed fur from all over its body, not just in one spot or patch.

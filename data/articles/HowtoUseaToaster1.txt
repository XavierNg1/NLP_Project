 If you are putting two pieces of bread into the toaster, then use both of the holes at the top.You can toast many things other than bread â€“ but stick to toasting bread slices until you are more comfortable using the appliance..;
, Use the adjustment knob on the front of the appliance to choose how dark you want the toast to be. On most toasters, the dial runs from 1-5: 1 being the lightest, and 5 being the darkest. For your first time, try setting the dial somewhere in the middle: 2 or 3., Wait for the food to toast. Keep your nose peeled to smell for burning! The toasting process should not take longer than a minute or two, depending on how dark you want the toast.
 When the lever pops back up, it means that the toasting cycle is done. The toaster may "ding." Take the toast out using your fingers or a set of wooden tongs. Then, put your favorite spread onto your toast before consuming!


Whatever you do, do not stick anything metallic into the toaster slots. The toaster heats the toast using powerful electrical currents, and a metal item will conduct the electricity up into your hand. Be safe!

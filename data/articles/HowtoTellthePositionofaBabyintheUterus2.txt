 Trained professionals can often tell what position the baby is in just by feeling your stomach. The next time they do this, ask them to guide you through it. They can offer tips and advice on what to feel for at home!Ask to feel along with them as they do it so you can get familiar with how different parts of your baby feel from outside your uterus.
 Though it won’t tell you everything about the baby’s position, finding the baby’s heart can give you some indication of how they are lying. If you happen to have a fetoscope or stethoscope at home, use it to listen on your belly. If not, ask your partner or a loved one to put their ear to your stomach in a quiet room. You can usually hear the heartbeat this way in the last two months of pregnancy – though exactly locating the heart might be difficult.Move around to different spots to see where the heartbeat is loudest and clearest.

If the heartbeat is loudest below mom’s belly button, the baby is probably head down; above the belly button, head up.
Try listening through a toilet paper roll to amplify the sounds!

, Ultrasound scans are the only way to tell for sure what position your baby is in. Ultrasounds use sound waves to make a picture of your baby in the womb. Schedule regular ultrasounds with your OB/GYN or Midwife to check up on your baby, or simply to determine how they are lying in your uterus.Schedule an ultrasound in your first trimester and again in your second trimester, or more frequently if your baby's health needs to be monitored. Ask your healthcare provider for details about when to get an ultrasound.Newer ultrasound technology can make amazingly clear images of the baby, though not all offices have these.

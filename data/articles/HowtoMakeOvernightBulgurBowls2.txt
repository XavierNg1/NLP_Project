 Adding brown sugar and ground cinnamon is a great option if you are craving a sweet, slightly spiced breakfast similar to spiced oatmeal. Once you have made your basic bulgur bowl, add in ½ teaspoon (2.46 ml) of ground cinnamon, 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of brown sugar, and a pinch of salt. Mix the sugar and spices in with the bulgur and enjoy!You can also add in pinches of ground nutmeg, cardamom or star anise to enhance the spice.
 If you want an especially sweet bulgur bowl for breakfast or dessert, add in shredded coconut and chocolate chips. After soaking the bulgur overnight, add in ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of plain yogurt and a handful each of flaked, sweetened shredded coconut and semi-sweet chocolate chips., Fruit compote is a syrupy spread of fruit and sugar that is a delicious addition to a bulgur bowl. To create fruit compote, add a pint of berries to a saucepan over medium heat, along with 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of water and 1 teaspoon (4.93 ml) of sugar or honey. Cook while stirring for 5-7 minutes, until the berries break down and the sauce becomes slightly thick. Then pour the compote over your bulgur bowl, along with any other toppings you wish!Blueberries, blackberries and strawberries are great options for fruit compote.
Since fruit compote takes some time to prepare, you may wish to make it the day before and reheat it in the morning if you want a quick breakfast.

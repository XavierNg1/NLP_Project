 Thoroughly wash the quince fruits. Peel and cut the flesh into cubes. Discard the stem and any fruit that is less than perfect.


Sometimes quinces that look beautiful outside can have brown parts inside or they might contain a visitor (like a worm).
Often quinces are cooked whole, but by cutting them you will ensure that they cook faster and not include any parts that cannot be eaten;
, Place the cubes of quince and the sugar in a pot. Stir the fruit so that the sugar is distributed evenly. Leave to stand overnight.


Quinces release juice which will form a syrup when mixed with sugar .
The color of the quince will change because oxidation occurs. This process is normal.
It is not necessary to place them in the refrigerator.
Allow the fruit and sugar to rest for at least 5 hours.
 Cover the pot and cook over high heat until the mixture of quince and syrup starts to boil. Let it boil for 4 or 5 minutes.


After 5 minutes, reduce heat to medium and let the quinces cook for about 1 hour (larger amounts of quinces require a longer cooking time).
To prevent burning, use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture occasionally.
The quinces are ready when they are soft and bright, and their color has changed significantly (the final product can vary from reddish to honey color, depending on the quince you use).
 Let the cooked quince cool (until warm, not cold) and then liquefy in blender.
 The containers / molds should simple and fairly shallow, so it won't be difficult to unmold the paste when it sets.


Wait until the quince paste thickens and sets before unmolding.
Kept in the refrigerator, this quince paste should last for several months.
 Cut the membrillo into slices and serve with slices of cheese, biscuits or crackers , or use it to spice up your favorite sweet tarts.

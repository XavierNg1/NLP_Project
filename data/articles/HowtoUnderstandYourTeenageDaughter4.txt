 Part of understanding your daughter is recognizing that, in addition to all of the other changes occurring, her brain is actually developing as well.Different parts of the brain mature at different times. The parts of the brain associated with things such as impulsiveness, reward and motivation actually mature earlier than parts of the brain associated with weighing the pros and cons of ones actions.
As a result, your teenager may not consider consequences in the same way you would. This is why it may be important to discuss risk taking behavior and their consequences, with her.
 It may be difficult to believe, but your daughter's tendency to stay up until the wee hours of the night is due in part to her changing brain.

Though the tendency may be to stay up late, lack of sleep further contributes to irritability and depression.
It's important to still regulate your teenage daughter's bedtime and to encourage her to get a full night's rest.
 It's not just your imagination; your daughter's emotions are heightened during the teenage years. The intensity of the emotions is also different than yours, so keep that in mind when you're in the midst of a discussion or an argument with her.If you notice your daughter is overreacting, give her some time to cool down. She may react strongly at first, but be sympathetic to the fact that her brain is going through a period of change as well.

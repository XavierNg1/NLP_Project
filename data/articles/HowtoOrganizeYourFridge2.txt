 If you do not have a lot of individual storage spaces in your fridge, stop by a local department store and pick up some baskets. Label each basket and separate food items by basket. For example, you can have a basket for cheese, a basket for deli meats, and so on.A bonus of baskets is that they easily slide out of the fridge, so you can access food quickly if necessary.
 If you have drawers in your fridge, label them. This will help you keep track of what items go where and, if you have guests, they'll know where to put things away in your fridge. Side drawers often get particularly messy, so label these. For example, one side drawer can be labeled "condiments" while another can be labeled "Drinks and milk.", Spills happen in fridges, even if you're well organized. A great way to keep your fridge clean and organized is plastic wrap. Remove all items from your fridge and lay down a layer of plastic wrap. In the event a spill occurs, simply remove the plastic wrap and replace it.Plastic wrap may work particularly well in areas where you keep sticky, messy items.
 Avoid storing leftovers in round containers. You're better off storing leftovers in square Tupperware containers, as these can be easily stacked in your fridge. This helps you make the most of your space., Most fridges have shelves that are removable and able to be repositioned. Take some time to think about and try different arrangements while your fridge is empty (either upon purchase or after a thorough cleaning). Position the shelves so that you minimize wasted space and maximize your ability to organize and access foods easily.

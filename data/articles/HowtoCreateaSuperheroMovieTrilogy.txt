 Don't copy Spider-Man or any other superheros because this isn't very original and if you do happen to strike it really lucky and make a film good enough for the independent film market, you will want something very original to capture peoples' imagination.;

Consider where they live - on Earth or somewhere else






Will there be one superhero or a group?






Choose names, clothes and special features.
 On a piece of paper or computer, put together a plan of your trilogy ideas:


Start with the first movie. You might wish to make it about the hero getting his or her super powers and having fun with them for a while until the villain shows up.






Second movie. This might be about the hero's personal life (love, money, violence etc.) and a character (villain) interfering with it.






Third movie. In this one, you will probably wish to create a climactic showdown with the toughest and most powerful villain that your superhero has to face.

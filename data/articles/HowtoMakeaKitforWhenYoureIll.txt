 You will need an old pencil case or make-up bag, or anything that is small and has a zipper. Make sure you don't buy anything too small, since you will need to put a lot of things inside your bag.
 These things are good to have with you when you are ill to prevent anything bad from happening. If you need more than just the items on this list, then make sure you add that too! These things include:

Tissues - you will want to put at least two packets in, as you never know when your nose won't stop leaking.
Lip Balm - tin or stick, it's never nice to have cracked lips.
Throat Sweets - they will line your throat when it needs a little help.
Mints - when you can't taste anything, a good chewing gum or mint is always nice.
Hand sanitizer - when you have just coughed, and your hands have lots of germs on.
 These items are not urgent, but very good to have at hand in your bag. These things include:

Camomile Teabags - when you fill a bowl of hot water, and add the teabags, you can get rid of mucus quick and easy.
Medicine - liquid or tablet, make sure you have some. If you have liquid, remember to take a meds spoon.
Ill Notes - for when you feel too sick to do P.E., or so the school knows you're taking medicine. Make your parents write at least three of them, signed.
Mini Handwarmers - good when you feel cold inside and out, and you need a bit of warmth.
Chocolate - when you're sick, you need a little treat to get you through the day!

, Put it at the bottom of your school bag or your locker, and get it out when you're feeling very sick. If you want, you can make more than one, and put them in various places if you have enough money and your parents approve.,

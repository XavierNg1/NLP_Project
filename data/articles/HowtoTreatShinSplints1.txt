 Since shin splints are almost always caused by exercising too much, the first thing to do is ramp down your workout routine to something you can accomplish without pain. Resting allows the swollen muscles along your shin bone to heal.


Avoid sprinting, running, or walking too quickly while recovering from shin splints.
If you still want to exercise during your recovery period, cross-train with low-impact exercises like biking or swimming.;
, Shin splints are most commonly caused by inflamed muscles, and icing them will ease the pain and reduce inflammation.


Fill a food storage bag with ice, seal it, and wrap it in a thin towel. Apply it to your shins in 20-minute intervals.
Don't apply ice directly to your body, since you could damage your skin.
 Drugs containing ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.


Make sure you take only the recommended dosage, since NSAIDs can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and ulcers.Don't medicate with NSAIDs as a way to kill the pain to allow you to exercise as usual; that's treating the symptom, not the problem, and you'll only make your shin splints worse.
 If your shin splints are making it difficult to get up and walk without pain, you should seek medical care. You may have fractures in your bones that are causing your legs to hurt. In rare cases, surgery is required to treat stress fractures and other causes of shin splints.

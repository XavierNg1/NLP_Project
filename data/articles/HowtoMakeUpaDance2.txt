 Watch music videos of dancers who perform in the same genre as the song you chose. This will help you start to get an idea of what your dance should look like. It’s okay to take a few moves from the videos here and there, but don’t copy it directly. Rather, pay attention to the way that they move their body and how you might like to emulate that style.For example, if you are planning to make up a hip hop and R&B dance pay close attention to how the artist you are watching uses their hips. Hips can help keep the rhythm and add a lot of spice to a dance.
Search for similar dances in the style you chose. Try searching for famous dances in the genre that you want to dance in.
 For example, if you already know that you can do cartwheels very well then you should consider incorporating that move into your dance. If you have great balance and coordination, maybe balletic moves are a better idea to incorporate. Consider the ways in which you are comfortable moving your body and cater your dance that way.
 Sometimes the best dance moves are the ones that will come most naturally to you. If you try to be too robotic by mimicking others the dance won’t look as good. Just move with the music and do what comes naturally. Start by swaying around a little bit and moving your arms and legs. If you’re alone you have nothing to be embarrassed about., If you’re really struggling to dance or you just feel awkward or uncomfortable, consider taking dance lessons. There are dance lessons for almost every genre of dance you can think of. You’ll be with a group of other beginners and you might find people who are willing to dance with you. You’ll learn a lot, become more comfortable, and find new moves that you can incorporate into your dance.

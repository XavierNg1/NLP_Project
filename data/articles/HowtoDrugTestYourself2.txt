 Check the instructions to be sure whether your kit tests urine or saliva. Fill the collection tube or cup with your sample up to the minimum fill line.If your kit tests saliva, check the instructions to see if you should wait after eating before you collect a saliva sample.
 Your kit will either provide individual test strips or a multi-panel strip that's the size and shape of a credit card. Dip the test strip into the sample container. Leave it in the sample for ten minutes, or as directed by the kit's instructions., After a few minutes, check the test strips for lines or colors that correspond with the results key included in the kit. Double check your kit's instructions so you know the specific window of time you'll have to read the results.Your results will likely be visible for around ten minutes.

 A Windows XP computer can be remotely shut down, using the shutdown command. Open a command prompt, and type:


shutdown \\<enter name of computer/ip address here>

Example: shutdown \\64.23.132.1 or shutdown \\kitchencomputer (you must use an ip address unless the computer is on the same network as you, as the computer name will not resolve over the internet)

;
, If you know how to use a programming language compiler, you can compile and execute exploits to take advantage of security flaw of software or the operating system on the computer. When an exploit is successfully executed you can run a command remotely, that includes the shutdown command mentioned previously. In this case though, you would simply enter "shutdown" (without quotes).

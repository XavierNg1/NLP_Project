 New York City is one of the most photographed places in the world.As you stop at each landmark, be sure to snap a picture. If you are on a guided tour, your guide may pause so that you can take pictures. You can ask them to take a picture of you and your travel companions. If you are on a self-guided tour, you can ask a local if they would be willing to get a picture of you.


Be sure to charge your phone or camera before you go on the tour.
 Don’t be afraid to ask questions while on your tour. If you’re on a guided tour, your tour guide will be trained to answer almost any question you have. You may be surprised by the answer. For example, you might ask:


"When was the Empire State Building built?"
"How did they build all of these skyscrapers?"
"What is the best place to eat in New York?"
"Can you tell me anything about Al Capone here before he moved to Chicago?"
"This street art is very interesting. What are the best places to see more of it?"

, There is as much to see inside as there is outside. You can plan to go inside museums, skyscrapers, and other landmarks on your tour. Plan these into your tour so that you can see everything. If you are a self-guided tour, you will have the flexibility to go in whatever building you want. If you are on a guided tour, you may ask your guide if you can duck into a building to see its architecture, although you may not have more than a minute to look inside.

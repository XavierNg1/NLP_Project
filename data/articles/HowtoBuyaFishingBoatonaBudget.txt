 A boat is a major purchase; it should not be made in haste. This is where most people get in trouble. The best deals are made when you can confidently and without regret, walk away from the bargaining table. If you are looking at a dealership, they will come in for the kill when they detect an impetuous shopper who hasn't done his homework.;
, This is vital if you are shopping at a dealership. Use the power of the Internet to find the best price, and use that as your benchmark.
 $5 is $5 regardless if you are buying a $4000 boat or a $40,000 yacht. Be prepared and have no regrets if you walk away from the deal when the bottom line was $4005 and you stuck to your guns at $4000.
 In a buyer's market, many sellers give up trying to unload their boat by owner and turn it over to an auction house. Though they will make less on the deal, you can get a great bargain.
 In most cases, you can get a better price buying from a private seller than from a dealership. Dealerships are usually in the thousands of dollars higher than an individual trying to sell his boat out of his garage. Chances are, he tried the same dealership and they offered him an insultingly low price.
 If you have to finance your purchase, it may be better to actually buy from the dealership than from auction or private sellers. The financing from your bank might be as high as 6 percent, but you might find a dealership that is offering 0 percent financing to move some stock. This could be a better deal in the long run than a smaller principal with a higher interest rate.

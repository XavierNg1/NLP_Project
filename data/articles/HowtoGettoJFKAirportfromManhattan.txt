 Venture from one line to another, until you reach a station that contains an E-line train. This train departs several stations in Manhattan and makes several Express stops through most other areas of the city and will arrive as a scheduled stop at Jamaica. Jamaica is one of two stops on the subway that allow you to get off and head for the AirTrain, which takes you to the airport.;
, The Long Island Railroad (LIRR) will allow you to get from some places in Manhattan to JFK Airport. Venture into Penn Station and inquire about the next train departure time for the JFK Airport station. You can buy your ticket at the station.
 Although expensive, and with some being quite a wild ride, take it from Manhattan to the Airport. And with the mess of one-way streets that aren't marked too well, taxis know the area better and can get you there a little safer. However, the road to JFK from Manhattan can be filled with traffic, so make sure you account for traffic and give yourself plenty of time to get there.
 Approximate travel time, not even figuring in traffic lights and lost time with one-way streets in bumper-to-bumper traffic, could take you more than 1+1/2 hours. If you have a GPS system, prepare it and use it to get you to your destination.


Severe traffic congestion occurs within midtown Manhattan. Be careful to not congest the streets even more than they normally are. New York City/Manhattan is nicknamed the "City that Never Sleeps" for a reason!

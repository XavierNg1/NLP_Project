 To do so, press and hold your iPhone's Power button until "slide to power off" text appears at the top of the screen, then swipe right over the text.

The Power button is either on the right side of your iPhone's casing (iPhones 6 and up) or on the top of the iPhone's casing (iPhones 5S and down).
 You'll have to remove your iPhone's case if it has one to do so. For most iPhones, the SIM card tray is located about halfway down the right side of the iPhone's casing.The iPhone 3G, 3GS, and original iPhone have SIM card slots on the top of the iPhone's casing.
 If you still have the SIM eject tool that came with your iPhone, go ahead and use that instead., The SIM tray will pop out., Do so gently, since both the SIM card and its tray are fragile., You can get another carrier's SIM from a carrier store, or you can simply borrow one from a friend for testing purposes.

Your replacement SIM must be the same size as your current SIM.
 Again, do this gently.

Make sure the tray is all the way back in the iPhone before continuing.
 Simply hold down the Power button until you see the Apple logo appear, then wait for your iPhone to open to the Home Screen.

If your iPhone has a passcode on it, you'll need to enter your passcode or use the Touch ID sensor to open the Home Screen.
 It's a green app with a white phone icon on it.

If you see a message requesting an "Activation Code", a "SIM Unlock Code", or a similar error before you can open the Phone app, your phone is carrier-locked.
 If doing so results in an error message, a "Call cannot be completed as dialed" recording for a valid number, or a similar circumstance, your iPhone is locked; if you're able to complete your call, however, your phone is unlocked and can use other carriers' SIM cards.

 While you wait in line or when you can see the big board with all the food choices on it, look for what you want. McDonald's has food from salads to cheeseburgers, so pre-preparation is a must. If you have passengers eating with you, ask them what they want and make a mental note of it.;
, While you're ordering, there will be an electronic sign with what you want on it and what your bill is. After you're done ordering, check it to make sure the staff isn't missing anything or that they haven't put too many food items on.

If they are missing something, tell them what they forgot or what they gave you too many of. For example, if you ordered two salads but only got one, say, "Excuse me, but I actually ordered two salads." You must do it at the electronic billboard, otherwise you may not get your second salad.
 After you move your car and are moving towards the first window, get your money ready. It not only makes the line faster, but it's easier for the staff and you.
 When they give you your food, check to make sure they put in everything you ordered. Just because it was on the electronic board doesn't mean it's in your bag. If they didn't give you everything, just say, "Oops, you forgot one of my salads". Then they will check, and give it to you.

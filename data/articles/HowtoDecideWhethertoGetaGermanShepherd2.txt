 Training will be one of the most important responsibilities you will have as an owner of a German shepherd. You will need to begin obedience training as soon as your German shepherd can train, i.e., around eight weeks, and continue this training throughout its adult life. Training, along with proper socialization, is essential to ensure that your German shepherd is well behaved.Obedience training classes range from $50 to $125 dollars for a four to eight week class.Take your dog to the dog park weekly to ensure proper socialization., German shepherds have a large number of health issues ranging from allergies to more life-threatening diseases, such as degenerative myelopathy. This means that you will need to take your dog to the vet regularly, i.e. at least once a year. You will also need to bring your dog to the vet if and when any of these health issues arises., Adult female dogs will reach a weight of 60 to 80 pounds, and adult male dogs will reach a weight of 70 to 90 pounds. Also, because they grow relatively quickly, a German shepherd puppyâ€™s diet needs to be closely regulated in order to avoid potential health problems. And, because they have two coats, German shepherds shed a lot and require constant grooming, such as brushing.On average, a German shepherd will cost $3,000 per year in food, grooming, and vet care.

 As you get better you can go faster. Don't go faster than you can run until you are really comfortable with wheelies.;
, Do whatever feels better. Generally a right handed person has their right foot forward. Left is the same. Place your feet like this, stronger foot in front.
 Your crank arms should be vertical with your strong foot at the bottom.
 When your strong foot is at the front lean your weight backward and pull up with your arms slightly and smoothly.
 If you're starting to flip backwards stop pedaling and let yourself coast in a manual. However, it may be more effective to tap your rear brake (not to be confused with coaster brake) to bring your front wheel down slightly. If you start falling forward pedal harder and faster.

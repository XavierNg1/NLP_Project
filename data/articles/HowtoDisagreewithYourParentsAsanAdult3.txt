 Staying grounded can help you to navigate disagreements with your parents. Listen to your body and pay attention if you find yourself getting anxious or upset. The more aware you are of these physical and behavioral symptoms, the better you can control them with time.


Patience takes practice. Practice stopping yourself before getting too upset with them.
Avoid getting defensive or reacting quickly when they make an accusation. Learn to express yourself through patience rather than frustration.
For example, if your mother makes a negative comment about what you're doing that makes you upset, stop yourself before reacting. Consider saying to her, “I’m sorry you feel that way. I don’t want to get into a battle about who’s right and wrong. Can we try to talk this through in a respectful way?”

, Stop and think before you start to attack what they said or did. If they're trying to seemingly give advice, give them a chance to speak. Don’t talk over them. Listen until they’ve finished their thought.The more times that you give them an opportunity to speak, the more times you can help to teach them to also listen rather than talk over others.
Be open-minded about why they may be saying or acting a certain way. Give them a chance in the same way you would want them to give you a chance.
 Avoid yelling, screaming, or bad-mouthing them as a way to make your point. While getting upset will happen from time to time, avoid making it the common way of communicating with your parents.Use ‘I’ statements to express your feelings about what’s bothering you. For example, say, “I feel frustrated when you express dissatisfaction with the person I’m dating.”
Show your parents that you are mature and able to express your thoughts without getting immediately upset.

 A sentence is a group of words that together express a complete idea that has meaning. When writing, it is a good idea to read your sentences aloud and ask yourself, "Does this sentence make sense? Does it express a complete idea?"For example, "Eggs near river" is not a sentence because it does not express a complete idea.
"I ate eggs near a river yesterday" is a sentence because it has a clear, complete meaning.
"Because I ate eggs" is a sentence fragment because it is incomplete; "because" sets the reader up for a cause-and-effect, but there is no effect here.
"Because I ate eggs near a river, I got wet" is a sentence because it completes the cause-and-effect established by the word "because.";
, Sentences in English begin with a capital letter and end with a punctuation mark. Proper terminal (end) punctuation includes a period (.), question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!). Punctuation marks inform the reader when your sentence is finished, as well as the tone of voice they should use when reading.


An exclamation mark indicates surprise, whereas a question mark indicates confusion or questioning.
 A subject is a person or thing that is being discussed in the sentence. The verb is the action word, which describes what the subject is doing.


For example, in the sentence "I ate eggs", "I" is the subject and "ate" is the verb.

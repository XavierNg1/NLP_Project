 Boundary disputes could show up on your title report. You should try to resolve any boundary dispute with your neighbor voluntarily. It would be cheaper and easier if you came to an agreement.


For example, if your neighbor is encroaching on your property, then you could sell that portion of the land to them. Alternately, if you have encroached on your neighbor’s property, then you could purchase the land you are using.
Try to be as open and honest with your neighbor as possible. Share copies of your survey and title report.By being honest, you help build trust which could lead to a resolution.
 You might not know where the boundary line should be. In this situation, you should have a professional survey done. Contact a surveyor and check how much he or she charges. You can find a surveyor in the following ways:


Ask your realtor. Call up the realtor you used to buy the home and ask if he or she could refer you to a surveyor. Many realtors keep lists of surveyors they have used.Search the phone book. Look under “surveyor” or “land surveyor.”
Get a referral from a professional association. Many states have surveyor associations which offer referrals. You can find them online by searching “your state” and “surveyor.”

, You and your neighbor could resolve the boundary dispute by establishing a boundary and then granting by quitclaim deed the property on either side. Each owner signs a quitclaim deed to the other and grants any land they own on the other side of the fence to their neighbor.See Get a Quit Claim Deed for more information.
 You might not be able to reach resolution with your neighbor. In this situation, you may have to file a quiet title action and ask the judge to fix the boundary to the property.

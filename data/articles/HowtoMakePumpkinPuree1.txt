 You can make pumpkin puree out of any type of pumpkin, but for the most concentrated flavor (and the best for making pie), go for the smaller pumpkins that are intended to be used in recipes, rather than choose jack-o-lantern sized squash. Each pumpkin will yield a cup or so of puree.


Look for pumpkins with bright orange flesh, no big bruises or gouges, and a relatively uniform shape.
Heirloom pumpkins often have striated colors like yellow and green in addition to orange. These make great puree, too, but the color may not be the classic bright orange you're used to.
Avoid decorative baby pumpkins - these don't contain enough meat to make much pumpkin puree, and they aren't grown to be eaten.;
, Run them under cold water and scrub away any dirt or other debris, especially if you got the pumpkins from your garden or a pumpkin patch.
 Start by chopping off the stems, leaving as much of the body intact as possible. Next slice the pumpkins in half, revealing their seeds.
 Use a large spoon to scoop all of the pumpkin seeds from the halves into a bowl. Save the seeds for later, since they're delicious roasted. Scoop out as many of the orange strings as you can, too.
 Finish processing the pumpkins by slicing the halves into quarters. You should now have 8 (or more, if you're using more than 2 pumpkins) wedges of pumpkin to work with.

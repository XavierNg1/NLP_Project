 Add 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of eggnog, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) vanilla extract to a large bowl. Stir the ingredients together with a whisk until a thick paste forms.You can substitute almond extract for the vanilla if you prefer.
 You want the frosting to have a spreadable consistency, so if it’s too thick, mix in more eggnog. Add up to 4 more tablespoons (60 ml) to get the consistency that you prefer.It’s best to add the eggnog a tablespoon (15 ml) at a time and stir after each addition. That way, you won’t accidentally make the frosting too thin.
If you add an extra 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the eggnog or more, the frosting will be thin enough to have a glaze-like consistency.
 When you’re happy with the consistency of the frosting, use a knife or offset spatula to spread it on the baked goods of your choice. It’s an ideal topping for scones, cookies, cupcakes, muffins, and cakes.Store any unused frosting in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to a week. Let the frosting warm up to room temperature before using it, though.

 This will be where the game is held.;
, The floor will need to be snow blocks, for you will use diamond shovels/spades to break these.
 Place lava one or more blocks below the snow, so when you fall you will die and be eliminated from the game.
 The number of players playing could be from two to infinity, depending on how many starting points you make.
 They will use these for breaking the snow and making other players fall.
, After the game, when snow blocks are broken and the arena is messed up, help remake it, or use WorldEdit to fix it, then play again!

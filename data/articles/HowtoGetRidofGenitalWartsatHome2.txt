 After a quick trip to the grocery store, you're ready to start treating those bad boys. If you can stomach it, simply apply a bit to a cotton ball (just like with the castor oil) and leave it on the wart overnight. Wash it off in the morning. The warts should be completely gone (and with a noticeable difference in hours) in 2-3 weeks.This method can be rather painful. If you've tried to leave it on overnight but can't handle the very literal burn, apply it to the wart in 15 minute increments throughout the day.
 It's official -- garlic is the duct tape of the kitchen. If you want to stay away from western medicine (and vampires), garlic is how you do it. As for vitamin E oil, a good substitute is fish oil (super high in Vitamin E).


For this method, rub the wart with the oil generously. Then, cover the area with crushed garlic. Place gauze over the wart (and garlic spread) and leave for up to 48 hours. After that window of time has passed, take it off and reapply., Second in command to the all-powerful garlic is the onion. Though science may beg to differ, grandmas and housewives alike swear by the stuff. Take a few onion slices to the wart and cover with a bandage, letting the juices do their magic. Reapply every few hours., If you didn't already know of the wonders of oatmeal for your health (super food to the rescue!), it's great for your skin, too. It won't get rid of the warts, but it will lessen the irritation, pain, and constant itchiness.If immersing your entire body in a warm bath isn't down your hygienic alley, make a scrub from 1 tablespoon oatmeal and water to use as an exfoliate. Having clean, dirt-free, fresh skin can help prevent future warts from appearing.

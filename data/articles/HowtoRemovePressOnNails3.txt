 Your nails can heal themselves if they get damaged, but it will take a few days. To give them time to heal, do not apply any nail polish or other press-on nails for at least a few days.








Try using a few drops of cuticle oil to give your nails a natural shine while you let them heal.
 Your nails may be brittle after you remove the press-on nails, so cutting your nails short may help to prevent them from breaking or chipping.Use a nail clipper to trim your nails down so that they are somewhat short.


You can also use a nail file to smooth out jagged edges if your nails are already short.
 Press-on nails can pull of pieces of your nails and leave them looking rough and jagged. You can repair some of this damage by gently buffing your nails.








Use a small buffing square and gently buff away any rough patches on your nails.
 Apply moisturizer to your hands after you take off the press-on nails and reapply it often as your nails recover.Keep a small bottle of hand cream in your purse or on your desk at all times so that you can reapply it often.
 Protect your nails before your next press on application by applying a couple of layers of a clear top coat. This will help to ensure that there is a barrier between your nails and the nail adhesive.

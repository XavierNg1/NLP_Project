 You will need to work over your sink. Even if you are not clumsy by nature, the water and soap you will be using will make the jewelry more slippery than normal. If the jewelry slips from your hands as you work, it could be lost down the drain if you do not plug the sink before you start.;
, Use your fingers or a soft bristled toothbrush to lightly scrub away any visible dirt particles as you rinse. Scrub gently, since being too abrasive could scratch the brass. If you cannot get the dirt out of interior chain links or other small crevices, do not worry. Stuck-on dirt can usually be loosened by soaking.
 Use a very mild soap, like a mild dishwashing detergent. Anything harsher could cause damage to the brass, and scented or specially formulated soaps can leave a film that can ruin the sheen of the brass. Use your hand to combine the soap and water until the blob of detergent dissolves and soapy bubbles form on the surface of the water.
 Allow it to soak for five to ten minutes. As it soaks, dirty particles that are caught inside chains or other crannies should be loosened and lifted away from the surface of the jewelry.
 Use a clean, soft cotton cloth and scrub the jewelry underwater. Use your thumb to move the cloth along the jewelry in small, circular motions, focusing on the edges of the jewelry more than the interior. Do not press down too firmly.


You can also use a soft bristled toothbrush instead of cloth.
 Run each brass piece under warm water to remove any soap residue. Make sure that your sink is still plugged before doing so.
 Lay it out flat on a clean towel or paper towel for 30 minutes, or until dry. You can also gently pat your jewelry with a clean towel to speed the drying along, but it will probably need to air dry before the water will be removed from the interior crevices.

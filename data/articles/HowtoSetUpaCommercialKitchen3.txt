 Any commercial operation that prepares food over an open flame, such as a stove top or a broiler, is required to have a range-hood and ventilation system installed. The range hood sits over the top of stove-tops and broilers, and uses fans to pull carcinogenic materials and heat through carbon filters up and out of the building. A range hood can be custom built to fit any location.
 A broiler or an open flame grill is primarily used to cook grilled meats. Commercial broiling units come in many sizes.


Lease or purchase a combination gas range and oven unit. These units, which are standard equipment in the majority of commercial food service operations, are available in multiple sizes and are typically categorized by the number of burners.
Consider purchasing or leasing a salamander. A salamander typically sits over the range burners and is primarily used to keep plated foods hot prior to service.
 Some commercial kitchens will need to purchase or lease additional items, such as a deep fat fryer, a flat grill or a convection oven.

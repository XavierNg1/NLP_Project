 If a teacher tells you about a test 2 weeks, or even a week in advance, start studying right away! 25 minutes a night for a week or two will eliminate the problem of multiple hours of studying the night before!;
, This will give you less homework to do at home, and you will have more free time.
 If he or she gives you two weeks, you could finish it in one week or less if you work on it 20-25 minutes a day.
, Many teachers do not like this and will take points off! An easier way of doing this is writing what you are going to talk about. Put the basic topic on the note card, and then you can put some bullet points below it in case you get stuck and don't know what to talk about. For example, if one of the things you need to talk about is the setting of the story put the word setting on the note card and maybe below it put bullet points that say Tundra, Antarctica, and then start talking about them more in depth.

 To improve your flexibility you need to stretch on a regular basis. Otherwise, your body will quickly return to its previous, inflexible state.Stretch five days a week for approximately ten minutes.
Don’t feel the need to “make-up” missed stretch time. Too much stretching can be counterproductive. If you miss a day, that’s OK—simply try to do better the following week.
 Deep, controlled breathing is essential for getting the most out of your stretches, and avoiding pain. Breathing deeply brings more oxygen into your lungs, which helps remove lactic acid from your muscles.Before every stretch, take a slow, deep breath.
As you move into the stretch, slowly release the breath.
When you reach the limit of your stretch take another deep breath in.
Slowly release the breath and move slightly further into the stretch. The increased oxygen in your blood should help you move further without additional pain.
 Contrary to popular wisdom, stretching is more effective and helpful if performed after a workout. This is because muscles stretch more when they’re warmed up and fatigued.After you’ve completed your aerobic or anaerobic workout, move directly into your ten-minute stretching routine.
If you don’t have time to workout before you stretch, take five minutes or so to either go for a walk or simply contract and release your muscles. Even this small amount of warm-up will improve your stretching routine.

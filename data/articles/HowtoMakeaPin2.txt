 The item should be no larger than your thumb. Flat items are best, but you can use a slightly-raised item, such as a button or cabochon. Here are some items that make great pins:


Cabochons
Decorative buttons (such as coat buttons)
Embroidered patches
Metal bottle caps
Wooden shapes

, Soak a cotton ball or tissue with rubbing alcohol and run it across the back of the item. This will get rid of any oils or dirt that might prevent the glue from sticking properly.
 When you place the safety pin behind your found object, you should not see it sticking out.
 You can use hot glue, but super glue or epoxy glue will work even better.
 Flip the object over, so that the back is facing you. Quickly press the safety pin onto the back. Try to align it horizontally, and make it as centered as possible.
 If you are using hot glue, this will only take a few minutes. If you are using super glue or epoxy glue, this may take several hours.

 There are various options available here:


Choose a different layer for each part of the box: An outside paper layer, an inside paper layer and a lid layer.
Choose the same layer for the whole box. Or dual layers of all the same inside the lid and box, and a different all the same outside of the lid and box.
Choose a layer of paper for inside the box and decoupage pieces for outside the box.
Paint or fabric line the inside of the box and only decoupage the outside of the box.

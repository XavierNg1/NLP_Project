 Go as high up as you can for your vocal range without straining your throat.;
, Ensure that this note is within an achievable range. Preferably, it was the last or penultimate note you could comfortably reach during the warm-up exercises.
 Next, breathe deeply into your diaphragm and back, and simultaneously drop your inner jaw and raise your soft palette without also dropping your tongue or raising your larynx. If this sounds hard to execute in a split second, it is.
 It helps to imagine that the top of your head is big and empty. Now sing the high note with gentle yet firm support from your lower body. You should have the sensation that you are hollering.
 While singing, your voice should reverberate in your head first before being projected outside of your body.
 Move on once you manage to achieve a rich tone for your high note.

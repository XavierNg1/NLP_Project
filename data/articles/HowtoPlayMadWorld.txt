 Playing this song will be different based on what instruments the musicians are using. In many variations of "Mad World" the major instrument is the piano. However, for other musical presentations, the guitar is the lead instrument. Think about which instruments are best for a specific rendition of this song.;
, Sheet music for the song shows the intro as being composed of two chords: F minor and B flat major. Playing these two alternately will provide the back-and-forth kind of sound featured in the introduction to "Mad World."

, When the song is played with F minor as the base chord, the verse chord progression would be from F minor to A flat, E flat and B flat and back to F minor.


Think about alternatives for the key of the song. Changing the key can make the song sound a bit different. For instance, some versions of sheet music for "Mad World" use the chords E minor and A major for the intro. Being able to change keys for a song quickly is part of what makes a musician more experienced and professional, and it's worth putting some time into the study of relative chord progressions in order to be able to effectively change keys.
 For example, if using the introduction chords F minor and B flat major, return to this same chord alternation for the chorus.


Listen to the way the alternating chords match the vocal chorus line: "I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad ..." Here, the timely resolution back to F minor is part of what makes the song feel a certain way. Getting this feeling right is part of playing this song well.
 The pace of the chords is very important for "Mad World." Again, listen to the lyrics and try to make the pace of musical play match the vocals and the overall ethos of the song. Getting the sound right will evoke associations with the original version and make your version sound good.

Select cell O5 and enter Thickness Looker.
Edit Go To cell range O6:O69 and enter 1 into O6 and do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Step Value 1, OK.
Edit Go To cell range P6:P17 and enter .8 and Fill Down. Enter .85 into P18,  .90 into P19, .95 into P20 and .5 into the cell range P21:P69 via Edit Fill Down.
Select cell range O6:P69 and Insert Name Define Name Thickness_Looker to cell range $O$6:$P$69 and Format Fill yellow. To the right of P, I have a column I copied and pasted values into P from, as multiplied P by 10, or divided by 100, or subtracted 30, or 50 -- it took a lot of hunting around to get the right values to make the chart come out so you should probably copy the  table and paste values for it in the Saves worksheet at some point, including ...
Select cell O3 and type Thickness and enter to O4 "=VLOOKUP(SPHERES,Thickness_Looker,2)" and do Insert Name Define Name Thickness to cell $O$4. Format Fill light blue and border red outline bold.
 Format Fill light blue.
Modified: Lem Sin: Edit Go To cell range B6:B17285 and enter into B6 w/o quotes the following formula,"=Thickness/2*(C6^2*Adjustment)*E6" and Edit Fill Down. Format Fill light blue.
Modified: Indicator: Select cell F6 and enter 1. Edit Go To cell range F7:F17286; enter into F7 w/o quotes the formula, "=IF((ROW()-7)/MAGIC=INT((ROW()-7)/MAGIC),1,IF((ROW()-7)=0,1,0))"and Edit Fill Down. This formula says, 'Take a look at the row I'm in, divide it by the number of rows per sphere (MAGIC) and if that number is an integer, return a 1, otherwise if I'm in the next-to-top row also return a 1, otherwise, return a 0.' So now there is an indicator of where 1 sphere ends and the next one begins, no matter how many spheres the user selects to chart. Format Number Number Custom 0.00000;; to stop the zeros from appearing.
Modified: Randy: Edit Go To cell range G6:G17286 and enter into G6 w/o quotes the following formula,"=RANDBETWEEN(0,10)/100"and Edit Fill Down. Warning: Make calculation Manual before adding this variable or column into your formulas, especially as a factor, as it can take 20 minutes to calculate and draw the new chart. It is not currently employed, but a copy of its formula has been saved at the bottom of the x and y formulas. Edit Go To cell range G6:G17285 and Insert Name Define Name Randy to cell range $G$6:$G$17285.
Modified: t: 0 to nπ: Select cell H6 and enter 0. Select cell H7 and enter the formula "=(2*PI()/MAGIC)". Edit Go To cell range H8:H17285 and enter w/o quotes into E8 the formula "=IF(F8=1,2*PI(),2*PI()/MAGIC+H7)" and Edit Fill Down.
Modified: z1_: Edit Go To cell range I6:I17285 and enter w/o quotes into I6 the formula "=CEE*COS(AYE*H6)" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range I6:I17285 and Insert Name Define Name z1_ to cell range $I$6:$I$17285.
Modified: Adj_x1: Edit Go To cell range J6:J17285 and enter w/o quotes into J6 the formula "=IF(F6=1,A6,J5)" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range J6:J17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_x1 to cell range $J$6:$J$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center every new sphere from Lem Cos, else it takes the value just above itself.
Modified: Adj_y1: Edit Go To cell range K6:K17285 and enter w/o quotes into K6 the formula "=IF(F6=1,B6,K5)" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range K6:K17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_y1 to cell range $K$6:$K$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center every new sphere from Lem Sin, else it takes the value just above itself.
Modified: x: No z: Edit Go To cell range L6:L17285 and enter w/o quotes into L6 the formula "=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_x1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*H6)*COS(AYE*H6))^0.5 *COS(H6)))+Adj_x1)" and Edit Fill Down. This is the x part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, without the z dimension added or multiplied in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work.
Modified: y: With z: Edit Go To cell range M6:M17285 and enter w/o quotes into M6 the formula "=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*H6)*COS(AYE*H6))^0.5 *SIN(H6))+z1_)+Adj_y1)" and Edit Fill Down. This is the y part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, with the z dimension added in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work. In the spirallic spheroids Garthwaite Curve, the z-dimension is multiplied into both x and y parts. Furthermore, no adjustment was made for the GOLDEN MEAN Long Leg, which was expected all along, until it worked without it. The other curve doesn't.
Modified: Select cell L17286 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=L6" and select cell M17286 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=M6". This makes the top connecting line from the last sphere to the first.
Modified: Planned Error Value -- Select cell L17287 and enter "=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_x1*(((BEE^2CEE^2*COS(AYE*H17287)*COS(AYE*H17287))^0.5*COS(H17287))) +Adj_x1)*Randy" or +Randy, etc. Warning: this can really take a lot of processing time -- set calculation to Manual first.
Modified: Planned Error Value -- Select cell M17287 and enter "=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2CEE^2*COS(AYE*H17287)*COS(AYE*H17287))^0.5*SIN(H17287)) +z1_)+Adj_y1)*Randy" or +Randy, etc. Warning: this can really take a lot of processing time -- set calculation to Manual first.

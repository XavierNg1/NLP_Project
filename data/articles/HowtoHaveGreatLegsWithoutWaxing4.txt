 Don't underestimate the way clothing can frame or emphasize your natural physical features! Fashion can have an insurmountable impact on the way you (and your legs!) are physically perceived by others. Generally speaking, you want to consider the occasion and your personal body type when picking out clothing. Your legs will be most directly framed by pants or shorts, but shoes and the rest of your outfit will have an effect. The quality of your legs regardless, dressing in short-shorts in below-freezing weather has never been a good look for anyone.
 A great deal could be written about a choice of legwear. If you're looking to emphasize the quality of your legs specifically however, tight-fitting pants (such as yoga pants) are a great choice, as they help tighten the look of your legs. If it's appropriately sunny outside, you might want to wear a fashionable set of shorts.


Try to avoid boxy or baggy clothing in this case. Baggy jeans and pants will do nothing for the look of your legs., Shoes can have a significant effect on the way your legs are perceived. Ankle and knee-high boots have a shortening effect on legs, so while they may look good, they're a better match for longer legs. If your legs are on the shorter side, you'll have the best luck with shorter shoes, slippers, heels and sandals.

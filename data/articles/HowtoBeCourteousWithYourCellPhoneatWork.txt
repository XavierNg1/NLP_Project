Review your employee handbook to familiarize yourself with the guidelines for using your cell phone courteously at work. Some companies have policies allowing employees to use their cell phones on breaks or when there are no clients on the sales floor. Make sure you know the appropriate times to use your cell phone.;

Be courteous with your cell phone at work by turning off your ringer when you're working. A ring tone, no matter how quiet or unobtrusive you might think it is, could disrupt the attention and work flow of those around you. Keep it muted or on a mode that allows it to vibrate and get your attention without distracting fellow employees.



Use your cell phone courteously at work by keeping private conversations quiet and respectful of other employees and coworkers. Keep your voice quiet and avoid profane language that could offend others around you. If your conversation includes this kind of language, take it outside.



Respect other employees if they request that you turn your phone off or take your conversation outside the workplace.



Clients could view this as discourteous and feel that you aren't giving them the attention they deserve. This could result in larger repercussions with your supervisors, so refrain from using your cell phone when there are clients or customers present.



Remember that you're still at work and keep any conversations or content on your cell phone workplace appropriate. Looking at inappropriate or offensive emails, pictures or videos could violate other workplace policies and get you in trouble, so keep any transmissions on your cell phone professional while you're working.



Your cell phone is second in importance to your job. Keep this in mind when you're working and using your cell phone. Never answer your cell phone in the middle of a meeting, when discussing an issue with another employee or when dealing with a client or customer. Do your job first and answer your cell phone when it's appropriate.

 If you have the room, a box might be the best choice. If you’re really embarrassed, you could put the kit into a box advertising something else — granola bars, cereal — so that people think you’re keeping a snack in your locker. If you choose a bag, it should be one you’re willing to keep in your locker at all times and only take home to restock in between your periods.
 Put in 10+ pads or tampons. Include some extra containers of wipes or other cleaning supplies. Keep track when you’re getting low so you can restock.
 Because a locker is larger than a binder or backpack, you will have some more room. Use this to cover the big possible emergencies: Add a few pairs of underwear. Find some other clothing to leave in your locker in case your pants get dirty. Black leggings are a good choice, since they roll up small and can be stored easily. Hopefully you won't need them, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.

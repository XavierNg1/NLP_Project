 Check that the board is thick enough to accept the pin when pushed through, just in case it needs to be cut shorter to stop it from scratching the wall behind. If it needs shortening, use wire craft snips or tin snips to shorten it (be sure to measure first).

To use, pull the earring off the post, push the pin into the board where you wish to hold the paper or photo in place. For even safer keeping, you can replace the earring backing to the post on the back of the board, but only if there is space and easy access to do so.
 These are very easy to make––all you need to do is remove the backing from the lone earring and glue the earring to a small magnet. The magnets can be purchased from craft or dollar stores; choose a size that is appropriate for the lone earring.

Try to make as many as you can for a very pretty refrigerator door.

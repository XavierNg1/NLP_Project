 First, sketch a circle for the head. Add an angled shape on the lower part of the circle for the chin and jaw. Use a line for the neck down to where the pelvis would be located. Draw an inverted dome shape for the thorax and attach more lines for the limbs. You can use a triangle as guide for the hands.
 Take note of the proportions and where joints are located. Add a crossed line on the face and thorax to help you determine accurate positioning of body parts later. Since this character will be wearing a swimwear, indicate where the breasts are located using two Teardrop shapes. Add a small slanted stroke for the navel.
 Position it with the help of the crossed line as outline. Add small curved strokes for the eyebrows. Sketch an angle for the nose and two small curved line for the lips to make the character looks like she is smiling.
 You can use curved strokes to make the hair look wavy. Add a C shape on each side for the ears, peeking a little from the thick hair of your anime girl.
 A two piece is a simple and common choice.

Under "Choose a configuration:", you'll see three options: Microsoft Windows, Non-Microsoft, and Custom. These options give you different choices for how to assign access to the programs on your computer. To choose your own rules, select Custom.



In this menu, you'll see a list of commonly-used programs. To the right of each is a check box. Uncheck each box to restrict access to the corresponding program.
Once a box is unchecked, the program will cease to appear in the Start menu and most other places where it previously would have appeared. However, this will not uninstall the program.



In the Program Access menu, you can also choose which of the programs that you do have enabled will be your default. To do this, simply click the circular "bubble" to the left of the appropriate program.
A default program is the program that Windows will automatically use for reading certain types of files. For instance, if you have Windows Media Player set as your default media player, if you double click a song or movie on your computer, it will launch in Windows Media Player.,


The "OK" button is at the bottom of the window next to the "Cancel" and "Help" buttons. Your changes will take place immediately.



If at any point you want to make a program that you've disallowed accessible again, simply return to the Program Access menu and re-check its box.
Click "OK" to re-save your changes.

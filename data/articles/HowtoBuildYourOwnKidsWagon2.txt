 The platform shown in the illustrations is about 18 inches (45.7cm) wide and 24 inches (60cm) long, but you can modify the size easily to fit your needs.
 Then scribe a circle on them, and cut them out with a jigsaw or bandsaw. Drill a 1/2 inch (1.2cm) hole in the center of each for the mounting bolts (described later).

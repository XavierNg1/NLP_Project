 The little kind you put on desks isn't gonna work. Next, you need to find a fitted sheet - the kind with the elastic on it that you have to tuck under the mattress. Finally, you will need a tall, heavy object like a chair or a small table.


If you plan on putting stuff in your fort, you may need a couple of things to use as paperweights to hold down light stuff.

, You don't want to get your fort all set up, and then find that you can't plug it in because it's too far away from an outlet!


The fan should be off right now.
 Stretch it out. Take the short end and put it over the fan. Now tuck it under the bottom like you would when making your bed.
 Grab the very end of the other end of the sheet, the one not tucked under a fan, and put your tall, heavy object on it.
 You should be looking at a big bubbly fort.
 Just put paperweights on light stuff so it does not blow away. Enjoy your fort!

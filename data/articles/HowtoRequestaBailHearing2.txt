 Some courts allow you to request a lower bail amount by filing a form to request administrative review.This is not available in all courts. You should check with the court clerk and ask how to request reduced bail.


If you are in jail, then ask friends or family members to check.
Courts which use an administrative review system often have printed forms you can complete. You should get one.
 Enter your information neatly, using black ink. Each form will be slightly different. However, they generally request the same kinds of information, which you should gather before sitting down to complete the form:Case number. This should be on any court form that you have received in the case.
Bail information. State the amount of bail and any other conditions.
Reason for modification. Make sure to state all of the reasons why you think your bail should be reduced.
Personal information. You should provide your contact information.
 The form should tell you how to submit it and who to address it to. Be sure to send it to the approved address, otherwise your request will not be considered. If you are in jail, then ask the officer in charge how you can mail or fax the form.
 The administrative department should review your application promptly. If they find that a modification hearing is appropriate, then they should schedule the hearing with the judge to reconsider bail.You should receive the hearing date in the mail.
If you donâ€™t hear anything from the administrative department within a week, then call and double check that they have considered your request.

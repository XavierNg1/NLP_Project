 Lie down on a fitness mat. Lie with your back flat on the ground, legs together and knees bent., With your knees remaining bent, turn at your waist and bring both of your legs to one side of your body, down to the floor. Your legs should be lying on top of each other.As you bring your legs down to the floor, keep your shoulder blades and the upper part of your back flat on the floor.
 Place your hands behind or at the sides of your head. Flex your abdominal muscles, and lift your shoulders off the floor. Be sure to keep your shoulders straight and level just as you would for a normal crunch. Hold the position for a moment, then release your constricted abdominal muscles to slowly bring your shoulders back down to the mat.Do not pull at your head and neck to complete the crunch. Your hands are merely resting near your head as you contract your abdominal muscles to lift yourself up and crunch.
This movement can be made easier by placing you hands and arms lower on your body (crossing arms in front of your chest) or harder, by placing your hands and arms past your head (arms extended above your head)., Once you have completed one set of crunches on one side of your body (about 10–15 reps), turn your legs over to do the crunches on other side of your body. It’s recommended to do this exercise 1–3 sets on each side, 2–3 times a week.

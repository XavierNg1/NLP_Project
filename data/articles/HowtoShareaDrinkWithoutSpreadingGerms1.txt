 Avoid sharing drinks that have already been opened or have been partially consumed.


This includes water bottles that have been refilled but not have been washed out. These can still harbor germs that can be passed through residual salvia.;
, Before opening the drink, make sure you wash your hands. This will limit the amount of germs that are transferred to the top of the drink. Washing your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of disease.You should first wet your hands with either warm or cold water.
Soap and lather your hands. Lather your hands for a minimum of 20 seconds. A good way to time this is to sing/hum “Happy Birthday.”
Rinse off your hands under clean water.
Dry your hands on a clean towel, or air dry them.

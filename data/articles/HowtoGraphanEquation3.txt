 This is the same formula used to graph regular linear equations, but instead of an ‘=’ sign being used, you will be given an inequality sign. The inequality sign will either be <, >, <, or >.


Slope intercept form is y=mx+b, where m=slope and b=y-intercept.
Having an inequality present means that there are multiple solutions.
 Find the y-intercept and the slope to mark your coordinates. If we use the example of y>1/2x+1, then the y-intercept is ‘1’. The slope is ½, meaning you move up one point and to the right two points.
 Before you draw it though, check the inequality symbol that is being used. If it is a “greater than” symbol, your line should be dashed. If it is a “greater than or equal to” symbol, your line should be solid.
 Because there are multiple solutions to an inequality, you must show all possible solutions on your graph. This means you will shade all of your graph above or below your line.


Choose a coordinate - the origin at (0,0) is often the easiest. Make sure that you note if this coordinate is above or below the line you’ve drawn.
Substitute these coordinates into your inequality. Following our example, it would be 0>1/2(0)+1. Solve this inequality.
If the coordinate pair is a point above your line and the answer is true, then you would shade above the line. If the answer to the inequality is false, then you would shade below the line. If the coordinate lies below your line and the answer is true, then you shade below your line. If your answer is false, then shade above our line.
In our example, (0,0) is below our line and creates a false solution when substituted into the inequality. That means that we shade the remainder of the graph above the line.

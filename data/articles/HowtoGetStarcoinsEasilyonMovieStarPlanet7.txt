 You can use multiple accounts to rate your own movies, increasing your views and earning you more StarCoins. First, you'll need to log out of your regular account. Click the "Log out" button in the upper-right corner and then confirm that you want to log out.
 This will start the new account creation process.
 Since you'll only be using this account to rate your other account's movies, you don't need to worry about looks.
 Again, don't worry too much about how your name sounds. Just create something quick and write it down so you can remember it later.
 Click the "Friends" button and then search for your original account's name. Click the "Add Friend" button to send your original account a friend request.
 You'll see the movies you made listed on the far-right side of your profile.
 Do the same thing you would if you were watching someone else's movie and watch it all the way through. Once it's finished, give it a rating.
 You can keep making new accounts and watching your won movies to boost your viewer ratings. This will make it more likely that other real people will watch your movie, earning your more StarCoins.

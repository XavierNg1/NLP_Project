 The first step to turning a banana split into a healthy snack is to use smaller portions. Instead of piling on three or four giant scoops of ice cream, limit yourself to a small scoop of lower-fat options. Use parfait glasses or mason jars instead of big bowls to help you keep your portion sizes in check., For the healthiest option, use low-fat Greek style yogurt or whole milk yogurt. These offer more nutrients and less fat than ice cream, and contain healthy probiotics. Their thick and creamy textures are great substitutes for ice cream, so you won’t be missing out on richness.You can also substitute ice cream with a low-fat or high-protein brand, or use low-fat frozen yogurt.
 Drowning your banana split in whipped cream, butterscotch, chocolate syrup, and other not so healthy toppings will send your calorie count soaring. Instead, you can splurge with a small amount of melted dark chocolate, and use nutritious, low-calorie fruits and nuts.Try sliced almonds, chopped peanuts, or a tablespoon of peanut butter.
Top your split with raisins, blueberries, diced pineapple, or sliced strawberries.
 A healthy banana split can be a fun, interactive activity for your kids, whether for dessert or an afterschool snack. Put out bowls of each topping, and try letting your younger kids serve themselves to practice using utensils and taking turns.If you’re an adult making a healthy snack for yourself, layering your banana split in a parfait glass or mason jar will add a touch of refinement to your dessert. In addition to keeping your portions in check, you’ll feel a little more fun and fancy.
 Cut a banana in half then slice each half lengthwise, so you have four long slices. Place them at the bottom of a bowl or jar, and add a scoop of yogurt, frozen yogurt, or low-fat ice cream. Top it with sliced strawberries, fresh blueberries, diced pineapple, or chopped nuts.You might be cutting down on calories, but there's no need to deprive yourself of a gorgeous, simple dessert!

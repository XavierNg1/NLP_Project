 If you have access to bulk grease in large containers, grease guns can be loaded more efficiently. To get started, unscrew the head from the cap. The head is the part with the handle and applicator tube attached. Unscrew the two pieces of the grease gun and separate them.









Make sure that the handle on the back of the barrel, which is the handle of the piston rod, is fully depressed into the barrel, or you risk sucking some grease through the gun during the process, accidentally.;
, Fill the barrel by holding the open end of the barrel down into the container of grease and slowly drawing back on the plunger rod to fill the reservoir, pulling grease back into the barrel.









Bulk grease containers are available at hardware stores and auto parts stores, widely, and are commonly used in garages in place of smaller cartridges. If you're a serious mechanic, this might be a good option for you.
 When the plunger rod has been fully withdrawn, lift the open end of the barrel out of the container of grease. Rotate the barrel to break it free from grease that may cling to the barrel. Use a cloth or rag to wipe excess grease from the end of the barrel.
 Different grease guns will work in slightly different ways. For some, it might be a matter of screwing the end cap on, while others need the nozzle screwed on. Either way, engage the threads and turn until the joint is fully seated.
 Press on the handle of the piston rod and squeeze the trigger of the grease gun until delivery of grease is seen at the end of the grease gun applicator tube. Wipe excess grease from the dispensing tip and the body of the grease gun. Use a cloth or rag to wipe the gun down and clean it to prepare for use.

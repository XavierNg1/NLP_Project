 There is no point forcing yourself to live less just so you can afford a new set of speakers.;
, There is a variety of options when it comes to this. Some speaker specific stores may have a greater variety in speakers, but may charge a lot more, whereas an electronics store may offer less choice, but it will sell them for a more affordable price.
 Some foreign brands such as Bose or Bang and Olufsen may cost a lot more than a commercial brand such as Polk, or Infinity. Make sure you put some substantial research in before making a choice, because you do not want to spend a lot of money, and end up with a system that does not fit your needs.

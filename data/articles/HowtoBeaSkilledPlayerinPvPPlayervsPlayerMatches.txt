 Is the goal to capture a flag, or destroy something or kill all players? Knowing various goals will get you where you want to be - skillful and resourceful to your team. Even if you don't have a natural skill for finding out the goal, figure out the goal and make sure you know what you're doing!
, Whatever game you are playing, if you don't have a high level of skill you will never beat those other players. Everyone has gotten upset at least once when a highly skilled player kept beating them. In addition, one should get very strategic - from using falls or other ways to accumulate damage on foes to luring your foe into a false sense of security and killing them when they're unaware that they're being attacked, there's all sorts of strategies, but it depends on the game., It takes time, but It allows you to formulate ideas and tricks you can use against your opponents later. This will naturally go with getting the idea of which strategies work, which strategies don't, and which strategies will get you banned for each individual player or server - try not to use the ones that don't work for that player in a 1v1 game but never use the ones that will get you banned on that server!, A lot of players will use this to their advantage to score extra kills in a free-for-all match, for example - find every camping spot, every weapon, and a lot more., If an advantage is available in one spot, use it. For example, If there's a good vantage point get there and keep an eye out for other players. If there's a hill from which you can snipe, get up the hill and shoot players with whatever ranged weapon you got.

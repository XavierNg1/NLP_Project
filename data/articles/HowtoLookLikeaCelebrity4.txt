 The most awkward question someone can ask you during Halloween is "who are you suppose to be?" In order to avoid any doubt of who you are dressing up as, it's best to choose a role that stands out. Fortunately, when it comes to celebrities, you have plenty of options from classic to current.
 If money is not an option, visit costume shops. The benefits of visiting shops are plentiful. Most outfits are either purchasable or rent-able. Depending on your budget, you can invest in a good celebrity costume that can be used or lent out for several occasions.
 If you are on a strict budget, no worries. Most celebrity iconic roles look like common outfits from an everyday wardrobe. After you narrow down some options that you'd enjoy, find the essential accessories of the costume. For example, the right sunglasses and sleek black gloves stand out for Audrey Hepburn's Breakfast at Tiffany's role., Finding the final details to make a costume come together may depend on the essential feature of a celebrity. Lucille Ball, for instance, is known for her red hair, so investing in the right wig will bring that costume together. All the celebrities who are icons stand out some way. Find out how, and go towards it.
 Aside from the clothes and the look, celebrities have unique mannerisms. The way they walk and talk have helped their allure. When you are dressing up, imitating those qualities will be the final step to making the costume come together.


Work on the celebrities accent and speech.
Use specific catch-phrases.
Copy the way they walk.
Hold items such as drinks or cigarettes the way they do in movies.

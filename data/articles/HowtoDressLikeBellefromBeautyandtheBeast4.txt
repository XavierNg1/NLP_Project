 Stick to the basics by using a light foundation to even out your skin tone. For your eyes, use a soft beige eye shadow and a chocolate brown or black eyeliner on your top lid only. Finish off with chocolate brown or black mascara on your top lashes only. Add a light rosy blush to make you look naturally flushed. Finish off with a light pink or nude gloss.
 For Belle's daytime look, draw your hair into a low-slung ponytail with a pretty ribbon. A great modern alternative to a ribbon is using a headband with a bow on it. Make sure to leave some hair out to frame your face. It should look effortlessly pulled back, like you didn't try too hard.
 Curl your hair, then pull it back in a half-ponytail. Put the top half of your hair into a bun, and leave the rest down. If you'd like, adorn it with pretty clips.

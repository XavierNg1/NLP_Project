 This is a must. If you don't the cut may get infected and you might end up in the hospital with a infection on your wound.;
, Estimate how many or how big you need the paper towels to be. If it is white and puffy seek medical help right away.
 This will keep out bacteria and help put pressure on the wound.


If your infected area is starting to tingle take off the paper towel. You are adding to much pressure to the wound.
 Small cuts which can be covered by a bandage at home likely will not require a trip to a doctor, but anything larger should probably be checked out by your friendly local medical practitioner.

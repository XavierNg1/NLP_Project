 Travel to Dawnstar. If you have just started the game, you can travel there by hiring a cart from the Whiterun stables.
 On the right side of town, to the left of the smelter and mine there's a tree with some rocks. There's also a chest in the empty space in the middle. You won't be able to see the chest. However, it has 750 gold as well as poison, enchanted equipment and grand soul gems, etc. because it's a merchant chest. This is the check known as the "Dawnstar chest".
 The chest belongs to a Khajiit merchant, named Ahkari. After you take what you need from the chest, go to her, save, attack her, and reload. Her inventory should be restocked with all of the gold and soul gems (the number of which is random).


Please note that you need to talk to her and ask to see her inventory as well, so the chest can refresh it's contents.
 Repeat the process until you have a large amount of money and soul gems.
 In the Jarl's building in Dawnstar, which is next to the mine and smelter, is an enchanting table. Take the equipment you took from the chest and disenchant it to learn the enchantments each time you use the chest.
 After doing this over and over again you should have enough septims to buy as many iron ingots and leather strips as you want. Go to the blacksmith in Dawnstar and buy them. Then save, attack him and reload so his inventory restocks.
 Go crazy making iron daggers. These are the easiest way to level up your skills.
 Enchant each one of the iron daggers and sell them back to blacksmith. When he runs out of gold, just save and attack and reload again so his gold replenishes.
 Have fun destroying everything with ebony weapons and armor that have two enchantments on them.

 Buyers should be encouraged to see themselves living in your home.;
, Remove items obstructing the view of counter tops, fireplace mantels, and hardwood floors. Buyers are typically looking to “upgrade." The less clutter they see, the more spacious the home will appear.
 Make sure the windows are spotless. The house should smell fresh. Carpets should be shampooed, pet odors neutralized. Use orange, lemon or eucalyptus-mint scents to mask unpleasant odors. You don't want smell to overpower, so keep it light.
 Busy, dated couches or bedspreads distract a buyer's eye. Paint, replace or cover items that look busy. Add softer, more neutral décor. This will help buyers envision the rooms decorated in their own style.
 If it's a family room, don't put a pool table or exercise equipment in there. If it's an office, don't use it to store kids' toys. Help potential buyers see how each room can be used.
 Plant seasonal flowers in pots by the front door and other entrances. Add new light fixtures by the doors if existing lighting is dated or in poor condition. If you have a large porch, add wicker furniture. It will look inviting and stand out from the competition.
 If you begin with the right price, you won't have to keep lowering it to attract interest.
 Stay informed about your agent's plan of action and marketing process. If you're aware of recent "walk-through" feedback, you can respond with appropriate tweaks and improvements.
 Avoid incentives such as gift certificates, vacations, or televisions. These can undermine your efforts by making you appear a bit desperate.

 The serrated edges of a bread knife will have an easier time slicing through the bread. If you do not have a bread knife, use a steak knife or other tool with a serrated edge.Although you can use a straight edge in a pinch, straight edges have a habit of tearing into bread, instead of cutting.;
, Place one slice of bread on top of the other. Doing two pieces at a time will cut down on time without sacrificing the appearance of the cubes.This is best done with fresh bread, as stale bread may break or flake too easily.
 Placing your knife about one half-inch in (1.27 cm) from the edge of the crust, begin cutting your bread into four strips lengthwise. Place the knife one half-inch from each edge to keep a clean, uniform shape.
 Once you have your four strips, turn your bread to a horizontal position. Straighten any strips that have gone askew--again, cutting as cleanly as possible to maintain a consistent shape.
 Once more placing your knife one half-inch in (1.27 cm) from the edge, cut your bread into four more strips. You should have 16 cubes at this point, each of them uniform in shape and size.A 16-cube piece assumes you are using a standard size bread loaf.

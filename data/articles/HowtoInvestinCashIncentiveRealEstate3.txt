 Your lender will do its own appraisal of the property and if an appraisal is not high enough, the investor can opt to put in a higher down payment. It will cost the same amount whether you hire your own private appraiser or the bank does its own appraisal, but it is not necessary to do both.
 Before you make your repairs and updates to increase the equity, check the details of local real estate ads that are similar in size and location to your property, known as "comps." Evaluate what they are selling for and how many bedrooms and bathrooms there are, square footage, and if the kitchen and bathrooms have been updated.


This information will help you decide where to invest your money in updating your property. For example, if just about every property in the price range you expect for your property has an updated kitchen, you know you will have to do the same.
A real estate broker can provide this information and advise you on what repairs and updates you will need to make. Your realtor can also provide comps and advise you on resale value after repairs have been made.
 These are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate. They invest in a variety of commercial as well as residential properties and shares are bought and sold like a stock. The value of your investment increases when the value of the property goes up, and for properties that are leased by tenants, you get cash flow from the rent payments., Like any investment, investing in real estate is not risk-free. It is important to consider the potential risks before you invest in real estate. For example, you might find that a certain property is not worth the costs of maintaining it, or an unexpected disaster could strike and destroy the property. Take some time to consider the risks before you purchase a property.

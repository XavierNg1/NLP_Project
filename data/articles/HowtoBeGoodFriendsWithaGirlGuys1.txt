 Sharing activities with the girl will improve your relationship with her.When you have a good time with a girl, she is more likely to remember the experience. Friendships are typically started because two people share a common interest, so it's important that you both share one before becoming better friends.


One way to avoid sending mixed signals is to tell the girl how much the activity costs. By doing this you are setting the tempo for a friendly hang-out and not a date.
You can go to a restaurant to eat, travel to an amusement park, attend another friend’s birthday party, go surfing, join an art class, or do anything else that you both like.
Hanging out inside and watching movies is always an option if there isn’t anything to do.;
, As humans we bond over conversation, especially if the topic of conversation is something that we hold emotionally dear.The more you have conversations about each other’s lives, the more connected you will feel. Being vulnerable means listening to her fears and emotions and being open to talk about yours.


Don’t be critical of her if she comes to you with a problem. The last thing a girl wants to hear is how she did wrong when she already knows she messed up.
Always listen for the girl’s perspective and see where she is coming from before giving your advice.
Asking a girl for advice will open up trust, and she will become more likely to seek you out for her own advice.
 Getting compliments makes us feel good and motivates us to do things.You should always compliment a girl when you admire something she has accomplished or achieved. However, you shouldn't compliment a girl when it comes to her looks, because it can put her in an uncomfortable place if you're just friends. Instead, take cues from the compliments that she gives to you. If she never mentions your physical appearance, it's best to not mention her looks.


Refrain from saying things like “you’re so beautiful,” or other general things about her appearance.

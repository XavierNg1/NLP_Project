 Make the cut on the inner side of the curve of the banana (inside the "U" shape). This works best if you have a banana that is medium ripe, so that you don't mush the banana too much. And the sharper your nails, the better.
 If you do this correctly, it won't mush the banana. Once you've made the cut, just use the opening to peel back the rest of the banana skin. This is a fun variation on peeling a banana the regular way.

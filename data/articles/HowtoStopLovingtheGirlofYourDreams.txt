 This is very important. As long as you can still see her, you'll remain attached. So get rid of them.;
, Also, should you end up walking past her at some point, just keep walking as if she isn't there. Seeing and talking to her will only make the process a lot harder!

, As long as you're busy, there won't be much free time for you to focus on other matters. We naturally focus on things we most want or is most important, so try to replace that most wanted (the girl) with something else. Even if it's another girl.
 Because you'd be focusing on her again, which contradicts the third step. Just go out, do the things you love and be with someone else who you really want to be with and not simply because of revenge.
 Feel free. This is your life, so why waste it on someone who either doesn't give a damn about you or hurt you by going off with other men.
 Not through memories or the temptation of going back to her. Otherwise you end up opening up all the wounds again. You'd put yourself at risk of more hurt. Don't give up and don't be tempted.
 You're doing what you think is best. Trust yourself and your decisions.

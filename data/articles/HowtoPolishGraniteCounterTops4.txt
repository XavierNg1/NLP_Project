 Not every liquid will stain or dull your counter top on contact, but better safe than sorry.
 The heat probably won't cause any problems (other than burning you if you forget the area is hot), but there may be something abrasive stuck to the bottom of the pot or pan that could scratch the counter top.
 Do this to avoid scratches, and also to avoid dulling your knives.
 Make sure to blot and wipe. The blotting will make sure that the spill doesn't spread out to a larger area.

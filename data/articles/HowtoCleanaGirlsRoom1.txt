 Take all pillows, cushions, stuffed animals, sheets, duvet and throws and take all the covers off of them, remove pillow cases, cushion cases, duvet sheets etc. Throw the sheets, cushion cases, etc which you just took off from the bed into a washing basket. You can put them into a laundry bag if you prefer, throwing them into a washing basket won't make the room any cleaner. This step is really just about removing any items from your bed and stripping off all bed linen and if you have bad acne going on change pillows .everynight this is very helpful.;
, Put it on the duvet and pillows/cushions and put those aside.
 (how you like it, but make it as neat as possible)

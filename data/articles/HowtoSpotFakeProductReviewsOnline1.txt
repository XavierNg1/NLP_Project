 As such, fake reviews often use jargon that a typical consumer probably wouldn’t. If a review reads like something that would be written on the back of the box, steer clear of it.This can include buzzwords like “one-of-a-kind,” “unique,” “award-winning,” or “revolutionary.”
This can also use the “brand approved” version of the product name, such as always typing the brand in all caps.;
, Additionally, some marketers will fabricate reviews to improve search-engine rankings. In these instances, fake reviews will include multiple instances of the full product name. Once again, no average consumer would normally speak this way.A review might say, “This XYZproduct240 was the best one I could find! The XYZproduct240 arrived quickly, and worked great.”

, Reviews that are scathingly negative are sometimes created by a competitor. Likewise, reviews that are flawless and glowing can sometimes be linked back to a marketer. In reality, most people will find some good things and some bad things in any given product. Reviews that go to either extreme should be given scrutiny. Most people will not categorize something as either the “worst” or “best” product.Watch out for negative words like, “horrible,” “worst,” or “awful.”
Beware of positive superlatives like “best,” incredible,” “life-changing.”

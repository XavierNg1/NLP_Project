 Spreading out study time is crucial to success in a biology course. This technique keeps your studying disciplined and predictable.The general rule for biology courses is that you should set aside roughly two hours of study time for each hour of class., Understand what types of information you retain best. You aren’t likely to have control over how the instructor lectures, but you will have control over how you study. Use this to your advantage and study the materials in the way you learn best. The recognized learning types are:Visual - You prefer to include pictures, images, videos, etc.
Auditory - You like hearing information and/or integrating music and sounds.
Linguistic - You learn information when it is in the form of language (written or spoken).
Kinesthetic - You are a “hands on” learner. Movement and physical touch help you retain information.
Mathematical - You rely on systems of logic to learn.
Interpersonal - Most of your learning occurs in a group setting.
Intrapersonal - Learning alone suits you best.
 Research shows that cramming is ineffective. Using the same amount of study time spread over days or weeks will allow your brain to retain more information than a single cram session. Focus on one biological concept at a time, and spread out complicated processes over multiple sessions. Remember to take a study break every forty-five minutes to rest your brain.Review old material each session.
Use note cards for quick, on the go studying.
 Studying as a social activity can be very beneficial. It allows you to see different points of view on biological concepts, and different study techniques. Offer your take on things as well, you might find that you know things that others in the group have missed.You can also tutor other students in biology courses.
If you need extra help in biology, consider seeking out a tutor.

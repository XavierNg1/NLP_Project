 Skye has a heart event, the green heart event. For the black heart you need no Affection points, you can just walk in when you have met the requirements for meeting the person (I.e. Rainy Tuesday). For the purple heart you need 10,000 AP. For the blue you need 20,000 AP. For the yellow however remember you won't just skip ten thousand because there is no green heart event (Once more Skye has one) so for the yellow heart event you need 40,000 AP. There is no Red or Orange heart event. You may propose only when the bachelor has a red heart otherwise they will reject you.;

 This is probably the most terrible and back breaking of all of the steps, it often helps to go to random locations about town and press A, plant a lot of crops, purchase many animals, and use the touch screen to pet them.
 It will be available as soon as you propose providing it is not a Tuesday or after 5 PM.

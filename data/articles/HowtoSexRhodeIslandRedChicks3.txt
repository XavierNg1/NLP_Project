 Sexing a chick based on sex-linked crosses will require a basic understanding of genetics.


Feather coloring is a genetic characteristic passed down through the sex-determining chromosomes of the parent chickens.
The mother hen will contribute one sex chromosome to the offspring and the father rooster will contribute the other. With poultry, the sex of the resulting offspring is determined by the mother's chromosome. Females carry a Z and W chromosome, while males carry two Z chromosomes.
As such, if the mother hen contributes a Z chromosome, the chick will end up with two Z chromosomes and will be male. If the mother contributes a W chromosome, the chick will have a Z and W pair, resulting in a female.
The feather color, along with the sex, will be determined by the mother hen based on the chromosome she passes down.
 Since Rhode Island Red chickens do not have an independent sex-linked coloration trait, the color of a chick's down will only be indicative of its sex when Rhode Island Red roosters are bred with hens of another breed.


As a result, you can only use the sex-linked method of sexing chicks if you know the breeds of both parents, and if those breeds are compatible with the process.
The Rhode Island Red parent must always be the father rooster.
There are several different breeds the mother hen can be, but in general, they will need to be silver, penciled, or barred breeds.
 Look at the down coloration of each chick. You should be able to make a judgment without even handling the chick.If the mother is a barred hen of some type, she will produce male chicks that are black or dark brown with a white spot on the head and female chicks with solid black or dark brown down.
If the mother is a silver or penciled breed, she will produce male chicks that are either silver, cream, white, or smoky in color. The female chicks will be gold, buff, or red.

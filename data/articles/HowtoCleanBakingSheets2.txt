 Take a plastic bag big enough to hold the baking sheet. Pour half a cup of ammonia in the bag. Seal the bag completely., The ammonia will take about a day to break down the debris on a baking sheet. Place the sheet somewhere outside, such as your porch or balcony, where it will be exposed to sunlight. This helps the ammonia break down grease and stains on the pan.Ammonia is toxic, so keep the pan out of reach of animals and children.
 After a day has passed, remove the pan from the bag. Use a steel wool sponge to scrub down the pan. This should remove any built up dirt, debris, and grease., It is very important to rinse ammonia off completely before using your pan again. Rinse your pan under running water or using a clean, wet rag. Make sure you get all remaining traces of ammonia off of the pan before using it again.

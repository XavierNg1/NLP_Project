 It should be low enough that the canvas is loose enough to remove from the track around the top.;
, It will make it much easier to work around the area; however, it will leave rusty staple marks/staples, depending upon the age and condition of the camper.
 If your canvas is attached in another way, undo that. You might find that you need to repeat this step later on if you don't unscrew enough of it.
 You don't need to remove it all, just the canvas near where you're installing the mount.
 Again, you only need to remove it starting from the corner, where it ends. If it's only stapled like in the Jayco 1207, you can remove it with a flat head screwdriver, using another handle as leverage. Use needlenose pliers and a small flat head screwdriver to remove the staples from the plastic.
 It goes behind the track and behind the canvas.
 Two feet (60cm) from the end of the camper works well, unless you want it to be closer to your A/C unit. Be sure to measure this distance and keep it the same for the mount on the other side of the camper.
 While holding the mount in place, move the plastic track out of the way and mark with a pencil through the top hole. Remove the mount and drill a 3/32" (2.4mm) wide, 1/4" (6 mm) deep starter hole in the roof.
, Drill a 1/4" (6.5 mm) hole through the premade hole in the mount and the wall of the camper.
 Screw a 1/4" bonded sealing washer onto 1/4"-20×1" round head machine screw.
 It helps to have a person on the outside with a screwdriver and a person on the inside with pliers or a wrench. Make sure the nut is on the inside and the washer is on the exterior.
, You may want to replace your screws if they are rusted (#8×3/4" flat head screws work well).
, The mounts are pre-threaded for this.

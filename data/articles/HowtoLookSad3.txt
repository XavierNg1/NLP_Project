 Messy, running mascara is a classic sign that someone has been crying, and you can use that to your advantage with some smokey eye makeup.
 Having color in your cheeks is a sign of passion or fire. When you want to look sad, it is better to keep the cheeks wan and pale. However, you can add a redness to your nose to suggest soreness from using tissues.


It might be easier to make your nose red by rubbing it than by using makeup.
 To communicate a lasting sadness or depression, keep the lips as colorless as possible as well as the cheeks. Brushing a subtle nude lipstick over the lips can help your entire face seem less vibrant and alert.

, You are now vulnerable to death by natural causes. Seek out food, water, and a place to sleep. Don't leave Goodsprings until you have a good steady supply. Find a place to store your items that you will remember.
 If it falls under the Weapons category in your Pip-Boy, it's your best friend. Stockpile weapons of every kind, especially guns.
 You can use the Scavenger perk to raise the chances of finding ammo. Ammo now adds to your weight, so only carry ammo of the gun(s) you are carrying.
 Stimpacks will no longer heal limbs, so you will need lots Doctor's Bags or caps to pay for an actual doctor.
 You can die of fatigue, so make sure to save before doing anything difficult.
 Food will barely help raise your health, but it will keep you from starving. There's no room for being picky; whether it's a juicy steak or a fried lizard, it will keep you alive.
 You are much more likely to die of a gunshot or poison wound now.

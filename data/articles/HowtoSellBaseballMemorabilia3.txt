 Use the item description(s) you wrote earlier, and be sure to include as many pictures as you can. You’ll need to decide on a number of settings:



Auction length: How long you want it to run. The top sites allow for short (1 to 3 day) or long (7 to 10 day) auctions, depending on how much of a hurry you’re in to sell your baseball items. The longer the auction, the greater the number of bids you’ll receive.

Starting price: The minimum bid for your item. Keeping the starting price low usually encourages a frenzy of early bids, since people see what they perceive to be a great deal and jump on it. Higher starting prices occasionally come with extra fees, so be wary.

“Buy it Now”: Bigger auction sites offer sellers the chance to set a price at which buyers can simply purchase the item outright. If a buyer selects “Buy it Now,” the auction ends automatically, and no more bids are accepted. This is a good option if you have a value in mind for your item and you suspect you can get someone to pay the set price.

Shipping price and options: How much will it cost to send your item? Do you plan to charge extra for insurance? Are there countries where you will not ship your item? Research your shipping options and include them with the item so bidders know how much more it will cost them to have it delivered.
 Auctions are time sensitive, so any inquiries you receive should be addressed as quickly as possible.
 Once the auction ends, the buyer will have a predetermined amount of time to pay. You will usually receive an email confirmation the moment the payment has been processed.
 Use great care when shipping, especially if it is an older piece of baseball memorabilia. Think about how you would want someone to protect a similar item if you were the recipient, and package it accordingly.

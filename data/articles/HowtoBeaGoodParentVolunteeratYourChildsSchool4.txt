 Think of your professional and educational background and choose a club that you can make the most impact in. For example, if you have a writing background you could help students create a poetry or creative writing club. If you have a finance background, you could think of innovative improvements to school fundraisers. Think of the skills that you have to leverage and use them to make the most impact on students.You can call the school and get a list of current programs.
Talk to your child about starting a school club that doesn't exist by saying something like, "So I noticed your school doesn't have a poetry club. I know you like writing, do you think you'd want to start that up? I can help you."

, Drama clubs, civic organizations, hobby clubs, and sports teams are sometimes in need of help due to limited resources and limited time. These activities and sports can hinge on the help of parent volunteers. Get into contact with activity leaders or sports coaches and talk to them about volunteer opportunities.


Parent volunteers are often needed as chaperones during away games.
If you have a sports background, you are better suited to helping children on the school's sports team.
 In some states and jurisdictions, parent's have a more active role in setting the policies and curriculum within a school.This means having to attend parent-teacher association meetings and being vocal in what you think is best for your children's education. As a parent, you have the right to know what kind of programs and supports are being implemented to help your child and all children within your local school.


See if you can get an hour-by-hour schedule of what will be discussed in the meetings so that you can create your own input.

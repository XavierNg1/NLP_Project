 For the first steps, you only need a steel scourer pad and something to scrape with, such as a screwdriver. For harder stains, you will need to resort to a professional response using acid. See "Things You'll Need".;
,, If you still have a few larger lumps try scraping with a blunt screwdriver to get the worst off and then the scourer.
 A grout haze remover may be of use. You can find this at a home store or tile shop. Follow the instructions on the container. You can use the stainless steel scouring pad as above, or you may try a man made scouring pad.
 If you have a lot of hard grout or tile adhesive on them, cleaning tiles like this calls for extreme measures. Tilers use diluted Hydrochloric acid as a last resort; it is also known as Muriatic acid. This acid eats at the cement base of the product you are trying to shift. It is important to read the warnings in detail before proceeding - cleaning tiles with acid must to be done in a responsible way:


Use a very small spot at a time and observe how it goes. This is important, as doing a small section at a time, you will be working safely and in control. Use a small bristle brush and dab a spot on at a time. When the bubbling stops wash it off with water, and try the spot with your scourer again and with a bit of luck it will come off easily.






Repeat the process as needed.






Wash clean and wash again, get rid of all traces of the acid.

 Ronidazole is believed to have carcinogenic properties in humans when exposure occurs over long periods of time. This means that you should not touch it with bare hands at all. Always wear gloves and avoid any skin contact with this medication.This medication usually comes in capsule form. Do not open the capsules unless directed by your cat's veterinarian, as this can pose the risk of inhalation.;
, While your cat is taking Ronidazole, you should protect yourself from contact with its urine and feces. This means that you should wear gloves while cleaning its feces. You should also double bag your cat's waste and used litter.Place the bags of waste directly into your outdoor trashcan.
Continue to wear gloves and double bag waste for three days after your cat finishes its course of medication.
 Those who are pregnant should not handle Ronidazole at all, even with gloves on. It has the risk of being toxic to embryos, so it should be avoided.Instead, find someone else in your family to give the cat its medication, and to clean out the cat's litter box.
 If one of your cats is found to have Trichomoniasis and others in your household are not, then the infected cat should be kept isolated. Trichomoniasis is spread via feces or oral contact, so other cats are likely to be infected if they are continually exposed to the infected cat.If one of your cats is infected, all of your cats should be tested for the parasite. It is important to have all infected cats in a household treated.

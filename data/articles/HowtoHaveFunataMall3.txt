 Mall free samples are a great way to get a free snack or two. Make sure you try everything they have to offer.


Make a visit to the food court when you first arrive at the mall and then a second trip a few hours later. You can get seconds on your free samples.
 Food courts are great because they have so much variety. Together with your friends, buy something small from all the different food court restaurants that you like.


Then, lay out all your tasty entrees, and share with your friends. That way, you get to have a bite of everything.
 Even if you donâ€™t want to pay for an entire meal, the food court can be a place to buy a small treat to fuel the rest of your mall adventure.


Get something like a cinnamon pretzel or a milk shake from your favorite food court restaurant.
 Buy something small like an ice cream for someone else as an act of generosity.

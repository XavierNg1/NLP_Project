 Most mobile phones will allow you to keep your number hidden every time you make a call. The process is different for smart phones and non-smart phones and varies by model.
 Look for a setting called "Show or Hide" or "Restrict My Identity" or something similar. Depending on the make and model of your phone, the exact wording may be different.



For most non-smart phones, click "Menu" and then choose "Settings." Once inside, find and click "Send my caller id" and change the setting to "No." Save your change if necessary.
 You can call your provider directly and request they change your preferences for your phone number. They can also provide assistance with your mobile phone model to know exactly which menus to access.

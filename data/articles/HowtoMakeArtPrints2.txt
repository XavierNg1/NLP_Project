 Take a piece of clear plexiglass and an etching needle. Etch your design directly onto the glass, creating grooves in the plexiglass where the paint will be deposited.
 Once your image is complete, gather your paints, cotton balls, or felt. Use the cotton balls or felt to dip into your paint. Lightly press it against the image.


You can press one color at a time, or apply multiple colors for a single pressing. Either way will give you slightly different results, so feel free to play around.
 Take a rag and carefully wipe across the plate, making sure excess ink from the surface of the plate is removed. You should only have ink in the grooves of your image.
 Use watercolor paper and soak the papers in water for several minutes. Remove them from the water, lay them on towels, and gently blot them dry.


Soaking and blotting your papers will make the fibers swell. This makes it easier to transfer your etched painting onto the paper.
 You'll need to use a print-making press in order to exert enough pressure. Set the prepared paper on top of your inked plexiglass etching and cover with a towel.
 Using medium strength, press your image onto the paper. Carefully remove the towel and lift up on the the paper to release it from the plexiglass etching. Your image should have transferred.
 Make sure the paint is completely dry before framing or hanging your print. Sign and number it before printing more.

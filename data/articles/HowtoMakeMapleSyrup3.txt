 When the sap is boiled it produces niter, or "sugar sand." The niter will settle to the bottom if not filtered. Filtering will remove niter and and other substrate that might have gotten into the syrup, like ash from the fire or bugs that flew in. Place a few pieces of cheesecloth over a large bowl and pour the syrup in; you may have to do this a few times to get all the niter out.

Filter the syrup while it's still quite hot, or else it will stick to the cheesecloth.
Special cotton filters made to absorb less syrup are available for sale online.
 Glass mason jars work well, or you could reuse old maple syrup containers that have been boiled. Put the lids on the syrup jars immediately., Do not plug the holes; they will close by themselves.

 By adding structures to your aisle, you can almost create the illusion of an elegant tunnel or path to walk through. Not only will your aisle look beautiful and elaborate, you will be able to truly create a grand entrance.


Consider things like floral arches, antique door frames, or sophisticated pillars.For example, a rustic wedding could have a baby's breath arch. Add some color with lavender sprigs.
 In other words, if your ceremony chairs are all white folding chairs, add a big wooden bench or pews as the very last row. This will create the illusion of an entrance to your aisle, and it also adds a bit of formality to the entire set-up. You can decorate these with flowers, greenery, photos, signs, and so on., You may or may not be able to suspend things above the aisle, depending on your venue. If you can, you can utilize this to create a beautiful and elegant touch to your aisle. Hanging draping can soften up your venue, and hanging chandeliers or other lighting can add a romantic touch.


You could also hang more flowers or even candles.

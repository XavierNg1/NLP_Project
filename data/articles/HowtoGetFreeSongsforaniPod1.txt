There are also applications that can convert Youtube songs at any time, like aTubeCatcher, YouTubeDownloader, and FreeStudio.The file will likely be found in your computer's "Downloads" folder if you can't locate it.
 Torrenting is a file-sharing program that makes it possible to download music, movies, games, and photos from any computer in the world, as long as that person makes it available. If you feel computer savvy, and know the risks of torrenting, then this may be the easiest way to get free music for your iPod. To torrent:


Download a torrent client-- this is a program that let's you open and find torrents. Try bitTorrent, uTorrent, Vuze, or Deluge.
Find your album on a torrent site like ThePirateBay or KickAssTorrents. You can also perform an internet search for "Your Album" + "Torrent."
Choose a torrent with good ratings. Most torrent sites have a discussion board underneath the torrent where people talk about the quality of the torrent. Also, if there are a lot of "seeders" (more than 10) this is a good sign.
Download the "Magnet Link" as this is usually safer. It will open up in your Torrent Client to download.
 iTunes has a handy function that lets you drag any music file into a folder labeled "Automatically add to iTunes," which sorts and arranges your new music so that it is easy to get on an iPod. To use it:

Click and drag songs from a USB storage device, hard drive, or online folder into "Automatically add to iTunes."
Open iTunes and add the new songs to your iPod.

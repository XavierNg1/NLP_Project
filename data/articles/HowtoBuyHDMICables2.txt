 Keep in mind if you go too short and need to move a component farther away later on, you'll have to buy another cable.


Unlike cat cable, HDMI cable isn’t easily changed if you need a longer or shorter length. Cat cabling allows you to cut the cable at the appropriate length and add the appropriate end, if you have the right tools. However, HDMI cable does not allow you to do that.
Allow for a little slack. If you ever need to pull a component out, you want there to be enough cable to allow you to do that. Otherwise, you’ll have to disconnect your HDMI cable every time you pull out your component.
 Standard HDMI cabling can transmit a 1080i signal for at least 49 feet (15 meters). A high-speed HDMI cable transmits a 1080p signal for at least 25 feet (7.5 meters).
 The later the version, the more information it can carry. Go for version 1.3 or later; it will carry the full bandwidth of picture and sound information for Blu-Ray.
 Promises of faster speeds and higher quality audio and video don’t hold much water when you compare various qualities of HDMI cables. There’s no reason to buy high quality HDMI cables from your local electronics store when you can buy virtually the same thing through discount stores or online retailers for much less.


By going online, you have better chances of finding and buying cheaper cables. You will not really gain anything in picture or sound quality by buying a more expensive cable. A reputable home theater magazine did some testing, and that is their conclusion. The only difference you will see is build quality. So it might be worth spending a little more if you will be frequently unplugging and plugging the cable in. Otherwise, save your cash.

Check the types of inputs and outputs available on your components. Make sure they’re compatible with HDMI. If not, you will require an HDMI adaptor.

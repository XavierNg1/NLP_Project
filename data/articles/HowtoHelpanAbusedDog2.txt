 Many animal rescues depend on volunteers, and one of the best ways you can help a rescue pet who experienced abuse is to help the shelter overall. If you have experience working with abused animals, let the shelter know.You may not work directly with abused animals if you do not have experience in that area, but volunteering your time helps give trained shelter staff more time to work with these abused animals.
Go online and fill out a volunteer application for your local shelter or call them and ask to see if they have any volunteer openings.
 If you cannot volunteer with a shelter or rescue agency, consider donating money or necessary supplies. Shelters are often underserved and underfunded. A direct monetary donation can help them get the things they need to operate correctly, while a donation of toys, food, leashes, dishes, or other goods can directly benefit the pets they service.Contact your local rescue and ask them, “What are the procedures for donating to your shelter? Do you accept donations of supplies, or just monetary donations?”
Be sure to follow the rescue’s donation policy. They may not be able to accept items that are gently used, or they may not be able to accept supplies donations at all. Ask them specifically what they need and what they are allow to take.
 When rescues cannot house an animal, either due to capacity or to due to the abilities of the dog, they turn to foster homes where the animal lives until it has recovered and can be adopted. Volunteer to foster an dog by calling your local rescue and letting them know you are open to working with abused animals in your home.Fostering an abused animal may require some commitment beyond a normal foster situation. You may be responsible for getting the animal to and from the vet, physical therapy, and training.
Abused animals may live in their foster homes for several months before being ready for adoption. They will require extra time and patience from their foster home.

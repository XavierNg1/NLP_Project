 Approach your family member with kind feelings. Obviously, the feelings won't be the same as what you'd feel for a crush, a lover or a close friend (unless you and your family members are also friends).
 Continuing to talk while hugging is okay.

Where you place your hands is not important because the person you're hugging won't think it over too much.
Press gently. You don't necessarily have to have hard contact.
Stroke your hands quickly across the top of the other person's back. Smile when you let go.

 This will definitely influence what they think of you. Don't become a dogsbody though, if people start dropping their pens and making you pick them up all the time, don't be a mug, realize, they are taking piss.;
, If they look like they're having a bad day or came out of a troubled relationship, or whatever the case may be, the last thing you should do is make fun of them. Be aware of the drama kings and queens in your class though. Many people relish the attention they get whilst they are experiencing 'trauma' such as a broken finger nail, a not totally up to date phone, end of a two week relationship or not getting 100 likes on their last new profile pic information Facebook within an hour of them posting it etc. It is okay to not sympathise with people who create thier own problems.
 The Debate Team, the Chess Club, the football team, the cheer squad, the Glee Club, the cricket team, Band, all are good, all are cool and any will earn you the respect and admiration of your classmate.
 Be a good sport.
 Following up to the last step, try cheering them up if you can. But if they don't seem to want you talking to them go away right away.
, As long as it's funny, and doesn't affect anyone personally, laugh. The last thing class clowns want is a serious party pooper. You don't have to be funny, but at least laugh, even if the joke is directed at you.
 Nobody wants to be near someone who tattle tales on everyone, nor does anyone want to have anything to do with a teachers pet.
, It's a good way to get liked and also a good way to stop people being mean towards you.
 If your friends invite you to any birthday parties or hang outs, always try to show up whenever possible.

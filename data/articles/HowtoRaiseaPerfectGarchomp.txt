, Jolly might be the best, because then Salamence, Pikachu, and Celebi will not be faster than your Garchomp, and you can outrun faster Pokémon such as Gengar. You can either keep on catching Gible until you get one or you can breed until you get one. Giving the Gible parent an Everstone to hold will probably increase the chances of getting a good nature. These natures are the ones that you'll want because they don't lower any of Garchomp's perfect stats.
 You can use Protein and Carbos for the first 100 EVs in each stat if you have enough money.
 If you do not mind extra training, then breed for a Gible egg. Its stats (could) be higher and it can learn powerful egg moves like Thrash. Placing it in the day-care will require a lot of walking, but allows higher EV training.
, If it is not in the daycare, train it in Attack and Speed. Fighting Pokémon with normally high Attack or Speed stats will raise Gabite/Garchomp's total ability.
, At level 49, the Gabite can learn Dragon Rush, a highly powerful but slightly inaccurate move. Evolving it at level 48 will give a marginal amount of extra Attack. Evolving it at level 49 lets you learn Dragon Rush earlier. It's your choice.
 When you have Garchomp, the following moves are highly recommended:


Earthquake
Stone Edge or Rock Slide
Dragon Claw, Dragon Rush, Dual Chop, or Outrage. Dragonbreath and Dragon Pulse are optional, as is Draco Meteor, but it wastes the use of Garchomp's Special Attack stat (but this can be easily changed by switching your Garchomp out).
Fire Fang/Crunch
Dragon Dance
Substitute
Protect

,, If you use Garchomp on the same team as a Tyranitar, Garchomp will get a 20% chance to avoid getting hit. Just remember to have other Pokémon that can take in Water, Grass, Ice, Fighting, and Fairy attacks. Another good idea if you want to do this is to give it a Yache Berry to hold. This will let your Garchomp survive most Ice type attacks.

 Launch your email client. This can be any email client (Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, Hotmail) on your PC or smartphone, and log in using your registered email address (or username) and password.
 A “Compose Mail” window should appear.
 This is the email address you got in Part 1.
 You can attach any file type and as many as your email client will allow you.
 Your email and attached files will be sent to the unique email address, and they will be stored under your SugarSync account under the folder “Uploaded by Email.” You can access your files there.

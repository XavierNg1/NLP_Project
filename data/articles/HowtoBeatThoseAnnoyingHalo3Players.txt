 These are the kind of people who scream "PWNED!" into their microphone, so don't let them get on your nerves.;
, The sniper rifle is arguably one of the best guns in most games, and so an irritating player may camp by the sniper spawn point. Occasionally, one of these players may team-kill you for your gun, so keep an eye and ear out for them.
 This is the formulaic showdown between two players (of equal shield) running directly towards one another, usually firing their assault rifles. The formula goes=run towards, fire rifle, melee, hope for the best. The rifle is really the key stage. Aim for the head constantly with the assault rifle and move in a zig-zag towards your target to make aiming harder for them.
 The sight of you taking away their former sniper rifle/shotgun can send your target round the bend, and it's twice as effective without the complimentary teabag.
 Instead, simulate a shaking head by moving the analog stick from side to side. Not only is this ten times more condescending than teabagging, it's also a lot more satisfying, and the victim will soon be frothing at the mouth trying to kill you and do the same thing to your corpse. But don't worry if they do manage to kill you and reenact the head shake - it's unlikely to satisfy them in the same way.

 For a clear assessment of your older cat's health, visit your vet for a thorough checkup. A number of ailments commonly affecting aging cats may cause the same sort of symptoms as CDS, so have your vet test for and treat any other illnesses before addressing cognitive dysfunction as a definite condition. Such illnesses could include:Vision loss
Dental disease
Hyperthyroidism
Degenerative joint disease (e.g. arthritis)
Kidney failure

, If you suspect that your cat is experiencing cognitive dysfunction, relay all the symptoms you’ve observed to your veterinarian. To ensure that you are presenting accurate information to the vet, record your observations in a journal before your visit. Note the frequency and intensity of certain behaviours, and be clear by saying specific things, such as:"My cat has been up every night for the past eight days."
"It has eliminated outside of its litter box four times this week, even though the litter box was clean."

, If CDS is affecting your cat, your veterinarian may be able to prescribe medication that will slow down the progress of the condition. While research is still being conducted in this field, the American Association of Feline Practitioners approves the use of the drug selegiline to slow down cognitive impairments and treat CDS in cats. Ask your veterinarian if selegiline would be an effective course of treatment for your cat, and inquire about its possible side effects., Ask your vet if a synthetic pheromone spray could be beneficial for your cat. Sprays like Feliway, a synthetic version of feline cheek pheromone, can have a calming effect on nervous cats and can help them relax. If the spray is approved as a treatment for your cat's CDS-related anxiety, purchase it from your veterinarian’s office or online.

 Before transporting your slow cooker, you should also consider safety. Always coil and secure the electrical cord so that you do not trip over it while transporting. For instance, you can roll up the cord and secure it with a twist tie or rubber band., Aside from transporting the slow cooker, you may also need to transport utensils, such as a ladle or serving spoon, as well as plates, napkins and bowls. If you are moving the slow cooker in a plastic bin or cardboard box, you could also put the extra utensils and plates in the box as well.
 Depending on where you are headed, you may want to have an extension cord with you so that you are able to plug in your slow cooker once you arrive at the event. For instance, if you are transporting chili in your slow cooker to attend a football tailgate, you should also bring an extension cord with you. This way you will be able to reach the electrical outlet that may be quite some distance from the food table.

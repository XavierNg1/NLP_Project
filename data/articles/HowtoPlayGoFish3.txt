 Hold the cards in a fan so that the other players can't see them, and take a look at what you were dealt. If you have two or more cards of the same rank, you may want to plan to pursue more cards of that suit to build a book. If you don't have any cards of the same rank, you may choose to pursue any of the cards in your hand.
 This player chooses someone else, it doesn't matter who, to ask whether he or she has a card of a specific rank. For example, the player might say, "Moirin, do you have any threes?"


If Moirin has threes, she is obligated to hand them over, and the player gets another turn.
If Moirin has no threes, she says "Go fish." The player then draws a card from the draw pile. If it's the card he or she asked for, another turn is granted. If not, game play moves to the next person on the left.
 As play moves around the circle, players start collecting enough cards to make complete books. When a book is complete, the player shows the other players the book, then lays the cards in the book face down.


As players ask each other for cards, try to remember which cards they asked for. When it's your turn, you'll have the advantage of knowing what's in their hand. For example, if you hear a player ask someone else for an eight, and you're hoping to collect a book of eights yourself, remember to ask that player for an eight next time it's your turn.
 Eventually the draw pile will dwindle and the cards will run out. When this happens, each player counts his or her books. The person with the most books is the winner.

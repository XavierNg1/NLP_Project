 Though this seems tricky, it is actually simple in practice. The imperfect tense is used for things that happened in the past, but not at a specific time. For example, phrases like, "when I was 10, I played hide and seek," or "Every week, they ate Chinese food." These expression could refer to one of the many times you played hide and seek, or the broader habit of ordering Chinese food.



Use Imperfect for: States of being, weather, habitual actions, emotions, age, background information.The simple past is for the events of a story (I bought candy, I ate it), and the imperfect is for background information (I was ten, I went to the store after school each day, it was sunny).
 This works for irregular verbs as well. Start the imperfect by dropping the "-ons" from the nous form. The same same thing happens in English: the stem of "to walk," for example, is walk (walk, walks, walked, walking, etc.). Examples include:


Parler: Parlons → "parl"

Finir: Finissons → "finniss"

Entendre: Entendons → "entend"

Avoir: Avons → "av"

Faire: Faisons → "fais"

The only exception to this rule is "être, since the nous form ("nous sommes") does not have an "ons." The stem of être is "ét."


, Unlike the passé composé, the imperfect tense is only one word. Simply add the endings to your stem and you've finished. The imperfect endings are "-ais, -ais, -ait, -ions, -iez, -aient." Using the verb "regarder" (to watch) as an example:



First person: "-ais." Je regardais → I was watching.


Second person: "-ais." Tu regardais &rarr: You were watching.


Third person: "-ait." Il regardait → He was watching.


Plural first person: "-ions." Nous regardions → We were watching.


Plural second person: "-iez." Vous regardiez → You all were watching.


Plural third person: "-aient." Elles regardaient → They were watching.

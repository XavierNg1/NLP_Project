 This will hopefully help the root mass to stay fairly intact when you extract it. If any parts of root are left in the ground they may revive and grow a new plant, which you obviously want to avoid!

, It’s a good idea to protect your arms when you do this – use heavy-duty gardening gloves and thick sleeves.
 When you come to dig, expect the root ball to mostly extend to about 6 inches (15.2 cm) out from the main stem of the rose. Aim to dig in this area using a spade.


Make every effort to avoid leaving any root parts behind as these may re-sprout. It may make sense to remove some of the surrounding soil just to be sure.
 It’s best to burn the rose bush once extracted, or throw it out with the household trash. Avoid composting it.


Any soil should also be removed from the premises so it does not contaminate a new area with sprouting rose roots.
If you are leaving the bush on a bonfire pile for later disposal or burning, make sure it isn't in contact with the ground, as it may re-root this way if left for long enough.
 After you are finished extracting the rose bushes, keep an eye on the area for a few months just to check nothing springs up in the area. This may indicate you have left roots behind in the ground that need to be removed.
 If you have a severe problem with new roses appearing from root runners and root sections left in the ground, consider using a chemical weed killer.


If you prefer to avoid this, you could try excluding the light from the area. Weed control fabric can be purchased which allows water to penetrate but not light.
Cover the area with the fabric and weigh it down with large stones. You’ll need to leave it for several months before the rose bushes die off.

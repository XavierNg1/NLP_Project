 The data file is provided in the link below. NOTE: Each case within the One-Way ANOVA data file represents one of the 20 metal plates (5 plates of 4 different alloys) and is characterized by 2 variables. One variable assigns a numeric value to the alloy. The other variable is used to quantify the number of pits on the plate after being underwater for 60 days.;
, The One-Way ANOVA dialog box opens.
,, The One-Way ANOVA: Options dialog box opens.
,, The Output Viewer window opens. If sample means are close to each other, this value is small. The Within Groups variation 335.600 is due to differences within individual samples. The Mean Square values are calculated by dividing each Sum of Squares value by its respective degree of freedom (df). The table also lists the F statistic 95.768, which is calculated by dividing the Between Groups Mean Square by the Within Groups Mean Square. The significance level of 0.000 is less than the threshold value of 0.05 indicating that the null hypothesis can be rejected. In conclusion, the alloys are not all the same.

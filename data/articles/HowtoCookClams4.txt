 Cover the grill grate with aluminum foil and pierce the foil with a knife to create holes. Let the grill heat to a medium-high temperature.


By covering the grill grate with foil, you will be able to catch more of the clam juice that leaks out. The foil can be omitted if desired, however.
If using a gas grill, preheat all the burners to a medium-high heat.
If using a charcoal grill, spread a single layer of coals over the bottom of the grill. Light, and let the flames go until white ash begins to form on the top of the coals.
Use oven mitts to reposition the grill rack so that it is 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the flames or coals.
 Scatter the clams onto the grill rack in a single layer.


Do not pile the clams into the rack in multiple layers. The top layers will not receive enough heat and the bottom layers will have too much weight on them to open.
If necessary, cook the clams in batches.
 Cook the clams on the grill, without turning or flipping for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the clams as soon as their shells pop open.


Discard any clams that refuse to open, as these have likely gone bad and are not safe to eat.
As the clams pop open, they will release clam juice. Collect this juice, if possible, to serve alongside the clams.
 Pile the clams onto a serving platter and serve with clam juice, lemon wedges, and melted butter.

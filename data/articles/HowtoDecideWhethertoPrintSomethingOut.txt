 If you don't, your printout could stop halfway until you have more paper. If you have something more important to print out, consider doing that first.;
, This is for the same reasons as before.
 Unnecessary or even 'pointless' printing costs money you don't need to spend and harms the environment.
 Can you e-mail, text, or put the information on a flash drive or CD instead of printing it? For example, if you are sending a chart to someone, you can usually just attach it to an e-mail or put it on a flash drive and give it to them in person, instead of using paper.

 Infants who are visually impaired but have some sight can find rooms with too much light difficult to sleep in. However, you should still allow some natural light to come into their room during the day and then make the room dark at night. Install window coverings that you can adjust, such as adjustable blinds or shutters, so you can control how much light comes into the room during the day and at night.Set up a lamp in their room with a flexible arm so you can control how much light is in the room during your infantâ€™s bedtime routine. As your infant grows, they can move the lamp based on how much light they would prefer in their room at night.
 Infants who have low vision but are not blind might be kept up at night by a glare in their room. Get rid of any surfaces that may cause glare, such as television screens, computer screens, or even tables with a polished surface. Place a dark placement or tablecloth on tables in their room to reduce glare.Play around with the adjustable window coverings to reduce the amount of glare that comes into the room during the day, as glare can be particularly uncomfortable for children who are visually impaired.
 If your infant is visually impaired but still has some sight, they may be sensitive to certain colors in their space. They could have a preferred color, such as blue or red, that they like or respond well to. Have items in their room in their preferred color, such as toys, pillows, or blankets, as they may be more inclined to sleep or relax in their room if it is to their liking.Keep in mind that even infants that are not visually impaired can only see 8-15 inches away.Try using contrasting colors in their room to help your infant see objects better. Put colored images on a white background in their room so they can see the images better. Have pillows and sheets in contrasting colors so they are easier for your child to identify.

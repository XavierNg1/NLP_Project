 Are you doing this on impulse? This is a very large commitment, and Old English Sheepdogs are not for first-time owners, let alone for first-time breeders. Hopefully, you've had lots of experience with other breeds and breeding dogs in the past, or this is going to be a fun, yet hard challenge for you.
 Owning, breeding, showing, traveling, vet bills, etc cost A LOT of money. Make a chart based on weekly, monthly, and yearly costs for owning one dog, and decide if you really can afford even more. Talk to breeders for information on costs, and travel to a dog show to see if you really want to make this commitment.
 If you want to breed conformation show-line dogs, you should probably get your bitch/stud from a champion-line breeder, knowing the commitment it takes to grooming, showing, and traveling to shows. Not to mention a grooming workshop for your breed, or expenses for trips to the groomer before a show. If you want to breed for herding, you should purchase your bitch/stud from a working line breeding kennel, yet knowing the commitment it takes to training, traveling, grooming, etc. of having a working sheepdog. You would also need to travel to your nearest open sheepdog classes to keep your herding dog entertained.
 Nobody cares for you to be just a "pet" breeder. You can be a show breeder and have pet-quality puppies that aren't fit for the ring, but you should always try to have nice, sound, healthy puppies for working or show stock. Please, none of this "just pets" stuff. These are working animals that need a job to stay entertained and healthy.

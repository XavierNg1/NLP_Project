 Use the keyboard to type "wholesale MAC makeup" into the search box. Look to see what products sellers are offering. Many sellers list items in bulk and include a variety of MAC products, which end up costing you less in the end because they are sold in lots. By selling items in lots, the buyer is able to sell a large amount of stock and the buyer is able to get a good deal on items that would normally be more expensive when purchased separately.;
, When you are looking for a general product rather than a specific item, do not check any of the boxes on the left hand side of the screen.
 Look over your returned results. Use the categories listed on the left hand side of the screen to check boxes for specific items. This helps to limit your choices.
, There will be a selection of choices, click on the "Site Map" selection. This will open up a new web page.
 Click on the "Post to Want it Now" selection, which will open another web page.
 Click on this selection to search for the specific items you are looking for. After you look at the selection of items available in this section and notice your item(s) are not available, you will need to go back to "Post to Want it Now" section and post your item in the proper section.
 Describe the item with as much detail as possible in order to find a seller who has exactly what you are looking for. Also, list how much money you are willing to pay for the item or provide a specific price range to let sellers know how much you are willing to spend on these item(s).
 However, keep in mind that if the item you are searching for is hard to find or a limited edition product, it can take several months to find a seller that has the product you are interested in buying.
 When you don't need the product right away, continue to check listings for however long it takes to find the items you need. When you need the item(s) within a few weeks, you will need to find the items elsewhere.

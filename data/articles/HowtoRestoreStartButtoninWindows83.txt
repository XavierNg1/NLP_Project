, Since Start8 is a paid app, it comes with three options:


Free Trial- In this installation, you'll get a 90days free trial period however you still have to activate the free trial through web by entering the generated code during the installation instructions.
Purchase- In this installation, you'll be directed to create an account and pay via debit.
Enter code- If you already have an activation code then you can use this installation type to continue the installation process.
 Here the uniqueness lies in the windows 8 "start" button theme which is absent in above two methods.
 You just got back your "Start" button on your Windows 8 operating system. You can launch the start menu by pressing the Start8's start button on the taskbar.

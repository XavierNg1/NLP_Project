 Eating disorders are frequently kept secret from those around you. Breaking out of this rut means talking to someone about what you're thinking, feeling, and doing each day. Find a good, nonjudgmental listener who is willing to offer you support and possibly be an accountability partner., Recovery from bulimia will require regularly meeting your dietitian and working at home to make sure you are meeting your nutritional needs. Learning to listen to your body to recognize what is hunger and what is an emotional need, such as loneliness or boredom, are huge aspects of nutritional therapy for bulimia. Your dietitian can also guide you in selecting foods that will satiate your hunger and prevent your need to binge., Think of your coping skills as a toolbox or arsenal - the more behaviors you pack inside, the better equipped you are at fighting bulimia. Get together with both your therapist and dietitian to brainstorm ideas for coping strategies. A few suggestions are as follows:Get involved with a hobby or passion to boost your self-esteem
Phone a friend when faced with a trigger
Connect with a friend from an online support group
Make a list of positive affirmation to read aloud
Walk or play with your pet
Start a gratitude journal
Read a book
Get a massage
Exercise, if appropriate for your treatment plan

, As you participate in therapy and support groups you will gain more insight into the things that trigger a binge cycle. Once you have identified these things, stay away from them, if at all possible.You might need to throw away your scale, toss out fashion or beauty magazines, unsubscribe from pro-mia websites or forums, and spend less time with friends or family members who regularly bad-mouth their bodies or obsess about dieting.

 One of the most monotonous parts of your day may be your commute into work. This is especially the case if you have a long commute and must endure a lot of traffic. To break the monotony up, try a different route.


You may want to consider a new route even if it takes 5 or 10 minutes more. In the big scheme of things, a happier drive will put you in a better mood and will likely bolster your productivity.
Avoid traffic if you can. Being stuck in traffic contributes to frustration and a helpless feeling., By rotating your schedule, you’ll constantly do different things at different parts of the day. Thus, you’ll avoid the monotony of doing the same activity at the same time every day.


Complete tasks randomly. For instance, don’t perform tasks in a particular order at work, but instead complete tasks as they present themselves to you.
Avoid sticking to a fixed schedule in everything you do. If you find yourself holding your pee to take a bathroom break at 11:15 every morning, you should consider changing up your schedule or embracing a more flexible one.
Space out enjoyable or exciting things throughout the day, instead of doing them all at one time. For example, if you have to visit the warehouse, human resources, and another department during the day, try to take individual trips, rather than hitting them all at one time., By incorporating a series of breaks into your day, you’ll break up its monotony. In addition, you’ll be able to get some rest and reenergize yourself for the rest of the day ahead.


Provide yourself with at least a five-minute break every hour. These breaks might be as simple has checking the weather.
Try to get up and walk around every couple of hours. Even a small walk from your office to the water cooler may help.
If you can’t spare too much break time, break your lunch break into multiple shorter breaks throughout the day.
Depending on your age, job, and where you live, you may be legally entitled to a certain number of breaks during the day.

 If over-lining your lips isn’t for you, don’t worry – this technique only requires you to line your natural lips. Choose a color in your lip liner that matches the lipstick you plan to use. Start in the center and move outwards to the corners on both your top and bottom lip.








You can over-line your lips if you want them to look even more full, but it’s not required.
 Double check your lip liner and make sure that everything looks clean and even. Then, use your same lip liner to color in your lips entirely. This will create a smooth, even base for your contouring., Just like you apply bronzer on your face to highlight your cheek and jawbones, a darker shade of lip liner will add dimension to your lips. The dark liner will look like shadows, creating the illusion that your lips are big and pouty.








Trace your cupid’s bow with the dark color. Then, run it along the inner corners on the top and bottom.
 This will accentuate the natural curves and add lots of dimension. Draw one line in the center of your bottom lip, lined up with the center of your cupid’s bow at the top. Then, add two more lines at each outer corner of your bottom lip., This will help blend the darker lip liner into the lighter color. Put some lip balm on your fingertip. Carefully, pat out the lines so that they aren’t so distinct. Apply the lip balm to your top lip as well., This will remove any excess product. It will also leave your lips looking perfectly matte. Double check that the contouring looks blended and natural, and you’re all set.Your lips should look big and full, with a simple optical illusion!

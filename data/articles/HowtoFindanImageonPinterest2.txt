 Click the search bar at the top of the screen and type in the username of the person you want to find. It is useful to use this feature if you can remember who posted it, but not where on your pin list it was located.
 His or her boards will be displayed on the screen.
 If, for example, you’re looking for that image of a creative fashion design, and the user has a board titled “Fashion Trends,” you would want to click that one since it’s closer to what you have in mind.


Clicking on a board will display all pins and saved images under that board category.
 Scroll through the pins until you find the picture you were looking for. Once you find the image, left-click it to expand the image. You can now save or re-pin the image by clicking the “Save” button at the top of the expanded image.

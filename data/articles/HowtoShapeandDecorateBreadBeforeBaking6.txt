 Divide the 1kg dough into 10 balls for large rolls, or 13-15 balls for dinner rolls. Ideally use a scale and calculator to divide the dough weight to get even sizes.
 Press the dough ball flat on the table in a round shape and form into a nice circle using one of the two methods:


Like the round loaf above, press the dough portions flat and pinch or press the edges into the middle. Once completed, pinch the centre and rock or rotate the ball on the benchtop to make a nice round finish. The roll is turned over so the more untidy pinched part will be the bottom of the roll.
For more practiced bakers, press the dough flat with the palm of your hand and rapidly roll the ball around with some pressure. What should be happening is the outsides of the dough will be pulled inwards and around in your palm and as you keep rolling in a tight circle, it will make a nice shape. Lighten the pressure as you go, but with this method it is a practice to develop - if the dough is to soft it doesn't always work, too tight and the dough ends up tough and needs longer to proof.
 You may dip in seeds or grains as per the Baguette method and / or slash them as per the round loaf. You may also snip the edges vertically with scissors around the edges for a more crusty roll, which will look similar to an artichoke flower if you snip all the way around. Place them directly on the baking tray to proof, or on a floured cloth from which you can later transfer to a hot stone. Proof until doubled in size. Also splash the oven with water if you desire a crisp crust.
 The rolls should be golden and hollow when tapped.

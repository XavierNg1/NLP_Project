 Before showering, run a bar of soap over the mirror lightly, making sure to cover the whole surface. Take care not to rub the soap too hard, or the soap scum will obscure the mirror completely.You can do this exact same experiment with liquid soap or Vaseline.If you are concerned about the appearance of your mirror after rubbing soap on it, use window cleaner to clean away any excess soap. This should leave your mirror looking clear, even after being subjected to steam.
If you don’t want to do the whole mirror or can’t reach parts, just cover the parts that you need (like the area where your face will be.);
, Pour a small amount of whatever shampoo you have available onto a folded paper towel. Use your paper towel to wipe the shampoo over whatever part of your mirror you want to keep clear. Then, take a clean paper towel and use that to wipe the mirror dry.Use twice the amount of shampoo you would normally use to wash your hair.
Make sure to wipe the mirror completely dry, otherwise you will end up with a blurry looking mirror.
This same trick can be done using shaving cream, toothpaste and laundry detergent. Use whichever one you have handy.
 To create your mixture, combine one cup of vinegar and one cup of water. Stir the solution until you are satisfied it has been sufficiently mixed. Pour the mixture into an empty spray bottle and spray the mixture directly onto your mirror. Use a paper towel to wipe the mirror down.


For a little more defogging power, add a few drops of dish soap to your mixture.
This method should last a couple of days, so continue to re-spray your mirror as necessary.

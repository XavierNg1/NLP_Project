 Go to a very populated area, such as Downtown, and host tryouts in your house. Make yourself and your house look appealing. Wear bright, but pretty clothes that any girl or boy would love! Decorate your house well. If people are interested, ask them basic questions, such as their favorite color or sport. Don't be too nosy though, and don't ask for personal information.;
, Be welcoming and nice. If you see someone that you might want to be friends with, buddy them and chat with them. You may become very good friends.
 Invite them to parties and give them happiness as you would with a physical friend. Be sure to be kind. Rudeness is a huge no-no here! Make sure you don't seem too nice; they may think you are a "fake" friend., Make sure you talk to them regularly while they are online. Try to stay in touch with them, without talking with them too much. You want to talk to them enough so that they still know you are there, but not so much that they think you are annoying. If they have any problems, be open to discuss with them, and find new solutions., If you followed all the above steps, you might become their closest and best buddy. This is key. Most people will delete "background" buddies to make room for new buddies. You don't want this happening to you!

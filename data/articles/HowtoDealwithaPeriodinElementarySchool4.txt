 Swimming while you have your period is perfectly okay. However, since pads absorb liquid, they will absorb water while you’re swimming and become quite useless. When swimming you may prefer to wear a tampon. If you don’t want to wear a tampon, you can try to wear a pad or pantyliner, but you should change it immediately when you get out of the water., Exercise is a great way to help your PMS symptoms like cramps and muscle aches. You can still do any activity when you have your period that you could do when you didn’t have it. You don’t have to change your day-to-day life when you get your period., Tracking your period can help you figure out when your period should start so you'll know when to have supplies on hand. You can find some period trackers online - just search for “period tracker” or “period calculator.”Keep in mind that everyone's body is different, and there's no sure way to predict exactly when your period will come.
 Discharge during your period isn’t 100% blood. Periods usually start out light and the liquid looks brownish-red. After a few days your period “flow” will get heavier, and it’ll turn a darker shade of red. After that it slows down and becomes lighter again until it finally stops. While the liquid can look like pure blood, don’t worry, it isn’t. The liquid is actually the lining of your uterus (the place where a baby would grow) being removed from your body. It’s mainly tissue and fluids, with a tiny bit of blood. It’s that tiny bit of blood that stains all the liquid a red colour.

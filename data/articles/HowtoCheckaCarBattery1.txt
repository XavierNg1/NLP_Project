, Check and clean the battery terminals.
 The positive lead on a voltmeter is usually red.
, If your battery is in good condition, the voltage should be between 12.4 and 12.7 volts. A reading lower than 12.4 volts means that your battery needs to be charged.









If the reading is lower than 12.2 volts, "trickle charge" the battery, which is a slow charge. And then re-check.
If the reading is over 12.9 volts, you have excessive voltage. Turn on the high beams to remove excessive voltage surface charge. Over voltage may be an indication the alternator is over charging the battery.

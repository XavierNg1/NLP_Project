 Don't slack off the exercise and diet routine. You should have lost at least 5 pounds by now, or gained some muscle weight. Try to mix up your exercise routine.
 Buy the closest things you can find to the original accessories. That means necklaces, scarves, earrings, bracelets, barrettes, pins, hats, headbands, chokers, etc.
 Get their ear piercings, stomach piercings, face piercings, etc. If your parents allow, get any body tattoos that they have. If your parents don't allow, just draw with permanent marker. It will last for several days.

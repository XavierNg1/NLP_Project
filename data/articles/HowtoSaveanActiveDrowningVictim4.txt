 Swim rescues should be used as a last resort. They require training and very good swimming skills. Victims are often thrashing and panicking which can make it hazardous to perform a swimming rescue., Do not attempt a swimming rescue without a buoy on hand; a drowning victim's first reaction will be to climb on top of you, so you'll need a flotation device to keep both of you safe and perform the rescue effectively. If you don't have a buoy, go in with a t-shirt or towel that the victim can grab onto., Use the freestyle stroke to quickly get to the drowning person. If you are in a large body of water, use ocean swimming techniques to avoid getting tossed back in a wave.Toss the buoy or rope for the person to grab.Instruct the victim to grab the object. Remember not to swim right up to the victim, since he or she is likely to push you under the water.
 Move in a straight line back to shore, towing the person behind you. Check back every few paces to make sure he or she is still holding the buoy or rope. Continue swimming until you make it safely back to shore, then exit the water.


Keep a safe distance between you and the victim.

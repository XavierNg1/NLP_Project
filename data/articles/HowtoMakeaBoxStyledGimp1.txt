 You can do this with two strands of one color, but it's easiest to keep track of what you're doing with two colors, especially if you're just starting. Choose any colors you like.;
, Place one on top of the other to make a cross. Make sure the pieces lay flat. 








When cutting the material, cut an equal length. The lacing isn't very expensive, and it's much easier to trim a bit at the end than to add more later.
Make sure you use a flat surface to start, after you started it, don't use a flat surface- pick up the strands to work with them.
 Hold one of the strands. Twist it around the other strand twice, making two loops over the straight piece.
 Take the other piece and weave it above the first one. Do the same to the other side of the strand. Move to the second color. Weave the second color over and under the two loops. Go straight across. Weave the other strand, repeating the stitch with the second color.









If using a flat material, avoid twisting the strands as you loop them over and pull them through.
 Make a gentle, slow pull to avoid twisting. Try to pull each stitch to a consistent tightness so that they will come out even. An easy way is to hold the center of the stitch and pull one strand at a time. Leave some extra length. You'll want to have about three inches at the end for attaching as a bracelet or to tie to an object.
 Use this stitch to make additional stitches, adding to the length of your bracelet or lanyard. Make two loops of one color, straight across the stitch you just made. Leave some extra length. You'll want to have about three inches at the end for attaching as a bracelet or to tie to an object.
 A box styled gimp can be as long or as short as you wish. No knotting or tying off is necessary on the ends; simply be sure the last stitch is tight, and it should hold the whole length of stitches in.

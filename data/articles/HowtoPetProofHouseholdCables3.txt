 Lemon juice, hot sauce, or pepper mixed in water will all deter most pets.


Observe electrical safety for yourself! Water conducts electricity, so make sure you're not touching the electrical wires or appliances while applying the spray. These substances will dissipate over time, so you'll have to reapply them periodically.
 Choose cords or cable-covering supplies that are a close color match to your floors and walls… if your cords don’t stand out, your pet will be much less likely to play with or chew on them.


You may be able to paint your electrical cords. If not, you can use colored electrical tape to match the surrounding colors.
 Pets who chew are often bored or frightened. Addressing the core problem by providing appropriate chew toys, playtime, and other activities may decrease chewing in general. Train your pet to chew a toy by associating it with food. Some toys come pre-flavored; others can be filled with food or treats.

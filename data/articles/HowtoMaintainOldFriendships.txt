 It's pretty tough to maintain a friendship if you never have contact. Even if they live in a different city, give them a call every once in a while.;
, Sometimes it is not possible to have regular contact. Try to understand your and your friend's time limitations and don't allow these realities to limit your friendship.
 It is possible to love someone through his or her changes. Although you may not realize it, you've changed too! Just give some time for you and your friend to adjust.
, Do not let past fights rule your relationship. You wouldn't want to get into an argument about what happened two years ago! Don't live in the past, live for what's happening right here and now.
 Don't require the best out of others. Like yourself, they're only human. Forgive and forget the little things.
 Don't let your friend feel like he/she is giving his best to you, while all your doing is taking. It's all for one and one for all.
 Don't cut down the people that your friend loves.

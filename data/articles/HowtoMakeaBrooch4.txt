 Do this 1/4" (.6 cm) from its unfinished edge. Knot the lace at one end.
 Do this a few inches at a time, in the opposite direction, until the trim bunches at the knotted end. This gives your lace a petal-like consistency.
 Brush on craft glue periodically to secure, until entire trim resembles a carnation. Tie the thread end and trim the excess.
 Using a hot-glue gun, affix the felt to the back of your coil of lace. Then glue a pin to the felt.


The lace is light enough that you should be able to glue to pin to the center. If you think the pin may fall under its own weight, glue the pin to the top of the felt circle.

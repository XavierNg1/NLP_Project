 Most cocktails can be made with one of the following base spirits: gin, white rum, vodka, bourbon, tequila and brandy. One bottle of each should be the foundation of any well-stocked bar cart. It’s not uncommon to include more than one bottle of each, especially if you already know which liquors you use the most frequently.You could expand the basics by including two bottles of each liquor – an average brand and a top shelf brand. The difference between them is, of course, the price. Top shelf liquors are more expensive than other brands.
Flavored liquors are popular, but they aren’t essential for a basic set up since their uses can be fairly limited.;
, You can make most cocktails with one of the following base mixers: dry vermouth, sweet vermouth or Lillet, Cointreau or triple sec and bitters (angostura, orange, etc.). One bottle of each mixer is fine. If you have favorites or anticipate using one of them frequently, go ahead and get a second bottle. The most common liqueurs and cordials to have on hand are limoncello, Bailey’s Irish Crème and Grand Marnier. One of each is plenty.Keep basic grocery store mixers on hand. Coke, orange juice, ginger ale and tonic are all very popular in cocktails.To avoid wasting mixers, buy the tiny bottles and cans. You can use these individually as needed.
 You won’t need these items for every cocktail you make, but it’s standard to provide fresh lemon and lime wedges with drinks. Cocktail cherries, olives and/or onions and simple syrup should be in any well-stocked bar cart. Keep a small, preferably covered bin or section in your cart set aside for these items.Don’t forget about cocktail sticks, which are essential for holding garnishes. Some people like to have them just for decoration.Straws and swivel sticks are also good to have in your bar cart.

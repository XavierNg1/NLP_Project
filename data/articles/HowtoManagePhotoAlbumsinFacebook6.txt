 Open a new web browser tab or window on your computer, and visit the Facebook website.
 Enter your email address and password into each respective box on the top left side of the screen, then click “Login.” After the login, you will be on your Facebook news feed.
 This will load your profile as other people see it.
 Clicking on photos will load all your tagged photos and albums.
 This will open a page with all the albums you created, with the most recently used one at the top.
 Depending on the type of album it is, it will either be a gear icon or the silhouettes icon, like the one that shows on Friends Requests.


If it’s the silhouettes icon, when you click it, a drop down menu will appear with the following options: Public, Friends, Only Me, Custom. Depending on what other lists you have on your Facebook account, the first two lists will appear and at the end it will say “See other lists…”. Here you can change and personalize the privacy settings on the album.
If it’s a gear icon, when you place your mouse over it, a message will appear. The message reads ”You can change the audience for each photo in this album”. What that means is that you will have to enter the album and change picture by picture the privacy settings you want for them.

 This will reduce mucking out, and your horse will be healthier.
 Mucking out tools should do the job well, without causing you pain or difficulties:


Buy tools that suit your build. Try them in the shop first. If you have a small frame, tools designed for children or teenagers might suit you better.
Buy tools suitable for the job. Depending on the type of bedding, you may want a four-pronged fork or a shavings fork.
Buy a large wheelbarrow to reduce the amount of times you need to go the muck heap.
 This means it must be suitable for your horse, easy to handle, easily composted or cheap, depending on your priorities. The cheapest beddings are those that are a by-product of another industry. Shredded paper and cardboard are the most common, but they are difficult to handle. Commercially packed wood shavings are easy to handle, but often compost badly. Straw is cheap and the best for composting, but is often dusty, so is unsuitable for some horses.


Install rubber matting. This is initially very expensive, but will reduce the amount of bedding you need to use, saving time, money and reducing the size of your muck heap.
 Skipping all the muck out on to that is often easier and faster then aiming for a small muck skip.
 The yard will only have to be swept once, and if you have a trailer, the muck can be taken away together.
 Consider the footing as well as the distance. If you have a trailer, the muck heap can be further from the stables.
 This involves removing only the dropping and putting fresh bedding on the top when necessary. This reduces the daily workload, but the whole bed will have to be stripped weekly (semi-deep litter) to yearly.

 Frozen plums will keep for several months, and up to a year. Choose plums that are at their peak flavor and ripeness - underripe plums won't taste good when you thaw them.


Wash the plums and dry them.
Slice the plums into wedges and remove the pits.
Lay the wedges on a cookie sheet.
Freeze the plum wedges.
Place the frozen wedges in a food storage bag or bin.
Label the food storage bag or bin with the date and put it back in the freezer.
 This is an excellent way to preserve your plums so they last for months to come. You'll need to peel your plums to remove the skins before combining the flesh with sugar, pectin and lemon juice. Store your jam in sterilized jars and enjoy it all through the winter months.

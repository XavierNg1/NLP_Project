 Let them soak for five to 10 minutes before exfoliating. This will loosen calluses and prepare for the best results.


You can add some extra virgin olive oil to the water to increase the softening of your calluses.
After soaking them, pat your feet dry with a towel.
 Take a brush (you can buy a physical exfoliation brush at a cosmetics store) and rub it in gentle circular motions along the bottom of your foot. Focus particularly on the heel, and on other areas of hard or dead skin; this is an effective way to get rid of loose and/or dead skin.


Alternatives to using a brush include a foot file, or the Ped-Egg product that has been marketed as an effective means of physically exfoliating your feet. You can also try an exfoliation cream designed specifically for your feet.,


Be sure to wash the pumice stone after use and to let it air dry before your next use.
 After exfoliating, using a moisturizing agent can help to ensure optimum protection for the new skin and will keep it healthier for longer. Put socks over the moisturizing agent to not slip while walking.
 If you do not want to do this yourself, you can always get a pedicure. During the pedicure they will soak your feet and trim your nails. Some only use a microdermabrasion to work on the hard spots while other will use a razor blade to shave off dead skin. They can also work on any calluses you have on your feet.

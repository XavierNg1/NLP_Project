 Follow the steps to work as a college coach. Get the education, experience (both coaching and playing) that make it possible to coach at the highest levels. Making it to the professional level can often be a question of luck., If you want to work on the professional level, do the same kind of work you did to get a college job, but with the pros. Focus on the events held by the national professional organization. Go to events, introduce yourself to people in professional teams and organizations, and keep up your skills. When an opening appears in the organization where you want to work, make sure that all the relevant people know you -- this means doing the hard networking before a job even appears. Go to meetings of the coaches’ association of your particular sport.


Go to more experienced coaches for advice. Most of us like giving advice, and it’s a good way to have a positive interaction with other coaches. Introduce yourself to the coach (if you don’t already know him or her) and ask for a piece of advice: “How were you able to get your players’ serves over 100 mph? I am having trouble getting them above 90, and I wondered if there was a conditioning drill that might help.”
Congratulate a coach that is doing well. “I am so impressed with your team this year -- they are so young but you have really brought out the best in them. What is your secret?”
Talk about sports. Ask them what they think about the college level of the sport they coach. “Who do you think will win the Rose Bowl this year? I don’t know if Alabama or Stanford is the better team.”

, Coaching an outstanding college team can be a great way to get the attention of professional organizations. Show that you are able to help your team to perform at the highest levels year after year. By being the best coach you can be, you can show the professional organizations your potential.

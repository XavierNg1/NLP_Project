 Before you introduce your dog to other dogs in the neighborhood, you should make sure they understand basic commands like sit, stay, and down. This will help you maintain control over your dog when they meet other dogs and prevent possible scuffles.
 You need to be keenly aware of your dog’s body language when you introduce it to other dogs. You should also pay careful attention to the other dog’s body language. Beware of wary or defensive behaviors from your dog or the other dog. Walk away calmly if you notice body language such as:Prolonged staring
Stiff legs
Baring of teeth
Hair standing up on the dog’s back

, If you notice defensive body language in another dog, or if the dog engages in aggressive behavior like barking or lunging, you should not approach the dog. Instead, leave the situation as calmly as possible. Try to distract your dog and calmly, but quickly, walk away from the other dog.

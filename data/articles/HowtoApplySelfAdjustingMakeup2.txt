 When you apply self-adjusting blush, it turns to the color of your natural blush. That being said, it’s important to apply it in the right place where your natural blush appears! To figure this out, give yourself a big smile in the mirror. The parts of your cheek that raise when you smile are the apples of your cheeks, and that is where the blush should be focused.You will want to apply it to the apples of your cheeks and then sweep it upwards along your cheekbone, ending at the top of your ear.
 Squirt a bit of the self-adjusting blush onto your fingertips. Smile, and then dot the product onto the raised apples of your cheeks. It will come out clear or white, but it may start to change color as soon as it hits your cheeks. Don’t be alarmed if it seems dark, because you will be blending it., After you’ve dotted it on your cheeks, start rubbing it into your skin. Blend it over the apples of your cheeks, and then bring the product upwards. It should follow the natural curve of your cheekbones, moving upwards to the top of your ears. The color will blend and adjust to a very natural, rosy blush.

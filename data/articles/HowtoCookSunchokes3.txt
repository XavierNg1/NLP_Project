 Coat the bottom of a spacious pan or skillet with about ¼” of vegetable or canola oil. Turn the cooktop on to a medium-high heat. Give the oil about 5 minutes to get hot enough to cook the sunchokes.Choose a broad pan with steep sides that can easily contain the sunchokes and a layer of oil without making a mess.
Take care not to burn yourself with splattering oil.
 Reduce the sunchokes to an appropriate size for frying. You can do this using a kitchen knife or a tool like a mandolin, either slicing them into rounds like potato chips or long thin strips like French fries. The thinner you cut the sunchokes, the crispier they will fry up.For this method of preparation, you can either peel the sunchokes beforehand or leave the skin on, as it will be edible after it’s been fried.
The sunchokes will shrink down a bit as they cook, so make sure you account for this with the thickness of your cuts.
 Carefully drop the sunchoke slices into the hot oil in the skillet. Fry the sunchokes one side a time until they begin turning a delightful golden brown. The amount of time it takes them to cook will depend on their size, degree of ripeness and how thinly they’re sliced, but they’ll most likely require 2-3 minutes on each side.Try not to overcrowd your pan. This will make the sunchokes harder to turn and fry to a consistent finish. Depending on how much you’re planning on making, you may have to cook them in batches.
When they’re done, the fried sunchokes will have a hearty crunch.
 Remove the sunchokes from the pan and onto a layer of paper towels while you drain the oil from the skillet. Fold the paper towels over and blot the sunchokes to remove excess oil and moisture. From there, arrange the sunchoke chips on a serving dish and shake on some salt, white pepper and garlic or onion powder. Dig in!Sunchokes contain a lot of sugar, so savory spices will nicely offset their natural sweetness, resulting in a complex, well-balanced flavor.

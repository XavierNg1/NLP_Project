 Using the explicit formula and some basic algebra, you can find several pieces of information about an arithmetic sequence. In its original form, a(n)=a(1)+(n−1)d{\displaystyle a(n)=a(1)+(n-1)d}, the explicit formula is designed to solve for an and give you the nth term of a sequence. However, you can algebraically manipulate this formula and solve for any of the variables.

For example, suppose you have the end of a list of numbers, but you need to know what the beginning of the sequence was. You can rearrange the formula to give you a(1)=(n−1)d−a(n).{\displaystyle a(1)=(n-1)d-a(n).}

If you know the starting point of an arithmetic sequence and its ending point, but you need to know how many terms are in the list, you can rearrange the explicit formula to solve for n. This would be n=a(n)−a(1)d+1{\displaystyle n={\frac {a(n)-a(1)}{d}}+1}.

 If you need to review the basic rules of algebra to create this result, check out Do Algebra or Simplify Algebraic Expressions.
 You may know that the 50th term of an arithmetic sequence is 300, and you know that the terms have been increasing by 7 (the “common difference”), but you want to find out what the first term of the sequence was. Use the revised explicit formula that solves for a1 to find your answer.

Use the equation a(1)=(n−1)d−a(n){\displaystyle a(1)=(n-1)d-a(n)}, and fill in the information that you know. Since you know that the 50th term is 300, then n=50, n-1=49 and a(n)=300. You also are given that the common difference, d, is 7. Therefore, the formula becomes a(1)=(49)(7)−300{\displaystyle a(1)=(49)(7)-300}. This works out to 343−300=43{\displaystyle 343-300=43}. The sequence that you have began at 43, and counted up by 7. Therefore, it looks like 43,50,57,64,71,78…293,300.
 Suppose you know all about the start and end of an arithmetic sequence, but you need to find out how long it is. Use the revised formula n=a(n)−a(1)d+1{\displaystyle n={\frac {a(n)-a(1)}{d}}+1}.

Suppose you know that a given arithmetic sequence begins at 100 and increases by 13. You are also told that the final term is 2,856. To find the length of the sequence, use the terms a1=100, d=13, and a(n)=2856. Insert these terms into the formula to give n=2856−10013+1{\displaystyle n={\frac {2856-100}{13}}+1}. If you work this out, you get n=275613+1{\displaystyle n={\frac {2756}{13}}+1}, which equals 212+1, which is 213. There are 213 terms in that sequence.

This sample sequence would look like 100, 113, 126, 139… 2843, 2856.

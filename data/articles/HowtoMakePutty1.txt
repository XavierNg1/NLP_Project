 Empty a full container of Elmer's glue or other white glue. Use plastic, not a glass or ceramic container.






;
, Fill the now-empty container of glue with liquid laundry detergent. Leave a little space at the top â€” you want a little less detergent than glue. Pour the detergent into the same cup.
 Mix all the ingredients together and the product should start to clump up. After about five minutes of stirring, it should be quite hard.
 Pour warm water into the cup and rinse out any extra detergent. Knead in more warm water, squeezing as hard as you can until it forms a putty-like substance. Make sure there are no more clumps of wet, runny glue or air bubbles. You're all finished.

, Items such as T-shirts can be hand-designed with a personal quote printed on to them which when worn will make them feel close to you.
 Boxes containing hand-picked personal yet useful items are great, such as bath products or sports related items like a drinking bottle, that can be used daily by your loved ones to ensure they are always thinking of you.
 Items such as a fluffy hot water bottle or teddy, a negligee or a beautiful candle to highlight how much you miss them at nighttime and wish you could be there with them.
 For example, a movie to watch together, or a gift certificate to a place you'd like to go. Looking forward to seeing each other can be a good way to temporarily forget how much you miss each other.
 Either send hard copies or send them by email. You could also send a video of you talking (if you can't Skype) or make a little "Day in the Life" video for them to watch.

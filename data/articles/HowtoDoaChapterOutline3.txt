 An outline can be one of the most helpful tools when you are studying for an exam or writing a paper. Used in combination with other methods, an outline can become even more effective. Making a study schedule is another way you can help yourself succeed.Look at your notes several times a week. It is better to study in small increments rather than trying to "cram" for several hours straight.
Set aside 10-15 minutes a day most days of the week. Use this time to look over your outlines and any other notes.
Review your notes after class. You will retain material best if you look at it within 24 hours of making the outline or taking notes.
 Studying can be difficult, and at times, even boring. Try to look for ways to tailor your study sessions with your personality in mind. For example, if you love being outdoors, try doing your reading outside.Maybe you are a very social person. Ask some classmates to form a study group with you.
Look for methods that are helpful to you. For example, maybe you learn best by making flashcards to go along with your chapter outlines.
 It's important to pay attention to your surroundings when you are studying. Look for a room that is not too loud. Avoid watching TV when you are looking over your outlines.Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature to you. Your mind will wander if you are too hot or too cold.
Try having a light snack before you study. A banana or some nuts will give you energy and help you focus.

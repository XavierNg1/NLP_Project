 This will make the body of your pouch. It can be any color you want, except for white. You will be adding a white tooth shape on top; if the pouch is white, the tooth won't show up!, You should have a Â½-inch (1.27-centimeter) gap between the two edges., You can sew on a sewing machine, or you can sew it by hand. If you are sewing it by hand, consider using embroidery thread in a contrasting color for a nice, homemade touch. If you don't know how to sew, you can use fabric glue or hot glue instead.If you are sewing it by hand, you can use a simple straight stitch or a blanket stitch.
If you used fabric glue, hold the edges shut with clothespins or binder clips until the glue dries.
 This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help give your pouch a nicer finish. If you used a blanket stitch, don't trim the sides down, or you'll cut through the stitching., At this point, you can topstitch along the top, folded edge to help hold the flap down.You can also simply press it flat with an iron., If you don't have any fusible webbing, skip this step.

Each brand of fusible webbing will be a little different, so be sure to follow the instructions on the package.
 Draw a tooth shape on the back of the felt, where the webbing is. It need to be about 2 by 2 inches (5.08 by 5.08 centimeters). Cut the tooth out when you are done., Avoid using too much glue, of the glue will soak through the felt., Place your tooth inside the bag and fold the top flap shut. Place the bag under your pillow and go to sleep. Wake up the next morning to find money in the bag.

, Start playing some music in iTunes at a normal listening volume.
 Stereo Mix is any sound that comes out of your speakers. ANY SOUND! So exit any program that makes sound like IM services, Email, etc.. Near the bottom left in audacity, set the "project rate" to 44100.
 See Audacity's help files for more info on this. Adjust the slider next to the microphone icon until the input volume stays around just over 3/4th's. This is called normalizing. The volume slider in iTunes should be at full.
 The test clip, should playback at the same volume and quality as iTunes. Once everything is good, click the 'X' on the new audio track to delete it.
, Once the song is over, press stop in audacity. Go to File > Export as MP3.
, No fields are required, but you want the keep your music organized, right? Do what you want with the original song. Your new copy can be copied indefinitely and can be treated as a regular MP3.

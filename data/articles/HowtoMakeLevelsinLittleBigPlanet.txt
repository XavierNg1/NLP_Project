 Do you want to save a princess and destroy the enemy's castle? Fight aliens in outer space? Make your choice.


Like a certain game, such as Mario, Kirby, Legend of Zelda, Spyro, etc.? You can make a level based on one of those games.;
, Don't be cheap and just put fire on the ground; be creative!

, Is it so easy a blind man could do it or is it so hard that you have to cheat to beat the level?

, There is a site called LittleBigPlanet Workshop you can go to and go to the Blueprint Room to make one as well.
 One thing you could do is make a person stand near the entrance and fill you in, like "Help! Our city is on fire!" or "Welcome to the carnival."

, Be creative and add lots of stickers! The only exception is a level theme where you have to recolour something!

, Make the waves curvier, or make the level look better with more stickers.
 Make a title, description, and just wait for the views to roll in.

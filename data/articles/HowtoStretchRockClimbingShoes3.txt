Depending on the extent of the stretching, you may not be able to return your shoes after performing this method.
 Socks, washcloths, or fabric remnants work well.  Any type of fabric may be used as long as it is small enough to stuff into a shoe., Be sure to pack in the fabric in tighter areas of the shoe such as the toes and heels.,  Heat the shoe for around a minute, or until the entire shoe feels warm to the touch.

You're extremely unlikely to melt the rubber on your shoes with a hairdryer, but for safety's sake, avoid using high heat, and if your shoe becomes too hot to hold comfortably, turn the heat down.
  Reach inside the shoe to press the fabric more firmly against any specific tight areas or pressure points.,, Having your feet in your shoes prevents the leather from shrinking back down as it cools and helps the leather mold the shape of your foot. If possible, go climbing before the shoes cool completely.

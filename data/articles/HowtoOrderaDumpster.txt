 A dumpster is important when you have garbage and disposable items that are in amounts greater than what your municipality will collect with the regular pick-up rounds. Dumpsters are also ideal for fast removal of garbage when you've little time, such as when moving quickly. Dumpsters can be useful when:


Renovating
Shifting house
Downsizing
Cleaning
Doing large garden clean-ups;
, Self-service will be a case of having the dumpster dropped off and collected once full, whereas if you get a dumpster with helpers, they will also clean away your garbage into the dumpster.
 Make sure that they can be placed in your neighborhood without taking up excessive room or blocking others entrance and exit ways.
 The dumpster should fit the amount of waste you have to dispose of. In general, bin sizes are:


15 cubic yards ( 12 x 8 x 4)
20 cubic yards (14 x 8 x 5)
40 cubic yards ( 20 long x 8 wide x 8 high)

, It's not nice having a dumpster turn up without warning, especially if it impinges on your neighbor's parking space or egress.
 Ask if they use bin pads and additional protectors to prevent pavement damage.
 Virtually everything can go in a bin, except, of course, hazardous material. Also, certain materials like soil and concrete cannot be mixed in with regular garbage. It is important in the latter case to order bins that exclusively hold either soil or concrete — just talk to to your dumpster provider first.
 For that, just call up your local municipality, or check their website.
 Your garbage needs to be level with the top of the container, so don't let anything stick out of the top — the dumpster company can't transport it otherwise.

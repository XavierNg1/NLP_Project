 "If you want to become whole, let yourself be partial." Tao te ching. Read some of the verses, especially when you are feeling anxious, fear, impatient, restless or any other negative emotions. Its because when you are in that state of consciousness, you are 'partial' and reading related verses, at that moment will help you understand them better. So allow yourself to be partial and then read. Makes sense?

 Oral medications are not very effective at treating adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease. In fact, adrenal tumors are strongly resistant to mitotane.Surgery is the only way to cure adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease, as long as the adrenal tumor has not metastasized (spread to other parts of the body).Surgical removal of a pituitary tumor is possible, but not commonly performed in pets, partly because it’s difficult to access the pituitary gland in pets.Adrenal tumors in dogs can metastasize.If your vet noticed metastasis on an abdominal ultrasound when diagnosing your dog, surgical treatment will not be a good treatment option.
 If your dog’s adrenal tumor has not metastasized, your vet may prescribe pre-surgical medication (trilostane or ketoconazole) to improve Cushing’s disease symptoms. You will need to give this medication for 8 to 16 weeks before surgery., To treat adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease, the entire affected adrenal gland needs to be removed (‘adrenalectomy’), not just the adrenal tumor.Because an adrenalectomy can be very challenging, your vet may refer you to a board-certified veterinary surgeon for the procedure.Adrenalectomies are high-risk surgeries. Because most dogs diagnosed with Cushing’s disease are older dogs, the surgical risk may be too high for these dogs., If your vet can remove all of the adrenal tumor, your dog’s symptoms will improve completely. In fact, a successful adrenalectomy for Cushing’s disease is considered to be curative.

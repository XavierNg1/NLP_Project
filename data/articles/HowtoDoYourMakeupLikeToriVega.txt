 If you are in a hurry, going without concealer is not a "biggy." To apply concealer and make it look like Tori's, it is simple. Mostly, just do your concealer as you would usually do it. Apply especially on blemishes, and even it out to get a fine and natural-looking skin tone. You can apply concealer with your fingertips or a foundation/concealer blush.;
, Swirl mostly on cheekbones, forehead, and your chin. That is all you will need for your foundation. Then, carefully blend out foundation to the rest of your face. It is best to use a brush made for foundation to blend this out and apply to the rest of your face, and your whole face in general. Also, if you apply foundation, you don't need to apply concealer. However, if you apply concealer, it is pretty (almost) vital that you apply foundation. Foundation balances out the concealer, helps you get the appearance of an even skin tone, and holds the concealer all together throughout your face.
 If you want to wear this popular eye makeup, consider wearing light blue, gray, light purple, and neutral colors.
 You can also use dark brown eyeliner, and black eyeliner, pencil, on the upper lid.
 Don't wear colored eyeliner if you want to wear it like hers, and try to stick to black and dark brown mascaras on a regular basis.
 Try them on your cheekbones and blend them out without being too overwhelming.
 You can try dark lipsticks, orange, or pink lip liners. You can fill in your lips, color the outline, add lip gloss, or even just add some lipstick!Â ;)

, Stay away from colored and glittery glosses. Try sticking to shiny and glossy!

 Most clippers come with several snap-on plastic guards. The guards ensure an even trim at the length you want - no one wants to cut their beard too short.









If you're not sure which of two guards is best, start with the longer attachment first. You can always go back over the beard with a shorter guard afterward, but if you trim too short, you'll have to wait for the hair to grow back.
Refer to your manufacturer's instructions for details about the various trim guards and speed settings on your trimmer.
If you want to shave your beard completely, leave the guard off.










Maintain balance between each side of your face by always starting at the ears and working down.
The guard should keep the trimmer from irritating your skin or cutting too much hair.
 Start under your nose and move toward the corner of the mouth, then proceed down to your chin. Pay special attention to hard-to-reach areas directly under your nose.









Keep your mouth closed to avoid a mouthful of hair!
Depending on the length of your beard, it may be easier to trim the mustache separately with scissors.
 Remove the guard from the trimmer and trim along your neckline to remove the remaining hair on your neck. Use your jaw as a straight edge.


If you like, you can also lather and shave your neck, depending on how you like it styled. Some prefer a clean cutoff line for their beard, while others prefer subtle neck stubble.

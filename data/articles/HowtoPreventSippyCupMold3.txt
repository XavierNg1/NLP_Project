 One way to ensure mold won’t grow in a sippy cup is to buy a cup with fewer parts. These fewer parts make the cleaning process easier. Fewer parts also help you make sure you clean everything.This means there are fewer valves, crevices, and other places for moisture and food to get trapped so mold can grow.
Check the way the cup is made before buying it. Because of the issues with mold growing, some companies like Tommee Tippee are developing sippy cups with easier to clean parts.
 Another way you can help prevent mold from growing in sippy cups is to replace them on a regular basis. Some people use sippy cups for months, even years. This allows more time for mold to grow from skipped cleanings or liquids remaining in them for too long.Think about replacing your child’s sippy cup every two to four months.
 Using disposable sippy cups might be an easy solution to preventing mold. Many disposable sippy cups are cheap enough to replace regularly. Also, many of these disposable sippy cups are made with valve-free lids that are easier to clean and less likely to grow mold.You can find these disposable cups through online or major retailers.
Some of the disposable sippy cups are as cheap as $3 for a 6-pack of BPA-free sippy cups.
 Another way to prevent sippy cup mold is to get rid of them completely. Instead of sippy cups, use alternatives.Cups with straws may be better for speech development.
Try letting your child use a regular cup with some supervision. While it may be messier, it may be healthier and better for her speech and teeth development.

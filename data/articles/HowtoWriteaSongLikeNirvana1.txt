 Make sure that all of the song fits cohesively to the one mood.;
, Kurt almost always started with the music. Stick to a simple, catchy riff.
 Kurt used power chords for the most part. Occasionally arpeggios and simple single note riffs were used, but they didn't follow a scale. Kurt didn't use scales.,


For riffs like those in Bleach, focus on heavy, dark sounding riffs. Hardcore punk was a big influence to Nirvana during the early years.
For Nevermind or In Utero, focus more on pop influences. Kurt based Nevermind on Sonic Youth's Goo album.
 While solos can be tricky to write, they're often worth it if done well.


Solos like those in Bleach: again, focus on heavier sounding solos. A lot of Kurt's solos during this era were noise and, as Butch Vig said, Kurt "strangling his guitar." so focus on these aspects and listen to Bleach for help.
For Nevermind or In Utero, again, more pop influenced, not as heavy. These should be more upbeat and more musical. If you want, copy the vocal melody like on "Smells Like Teen Spirit" or "Come As You Are".

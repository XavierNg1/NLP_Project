 Your baby's daily intake of milk changes three times in the first year: it ramps up in the first month or so of life, stays at the same high amount until solid foods are introduced, then drops to a steady amount, at least twenty ounces a day, once your baby gets accustomed to complimentary foods. If you are lucky enough to freeze 3,640 ounces (twenty ounces a day for 182 days) by the time your baby is six months old, don't assume your baby will only want 20 ounces. Instead, wait until your baby is taking two small meals of solid foods per day. Then calculate an adequate supply for the rest of the year as follows: (52 - your baby's age in weeks) x bottles offered per day x size of bottles x 7 = adequate supply.
 Either you'll go cold turkey or you'll pump to relieve engorgement but try to leave the breasts full. Your level of production, pumping history, susceptibility to mastitis, and tolerance for leaks and discomfort will all play a part in forming your plan to stop producing milk.
 Quickly put them back in reverse order, with the newest boxes at the bottom of your freezer. Pull out your first bag and place it in cool water in the refrigerator. It will thaw faster in contact with water than air, but just as safely.
 Only sell or give your milk to mothers who recognize what an awesome sacrifice you've made for your baby's comfort and health. Congratulations!

Find pretty jewelry to match your style. Avoid pieces that are too small or dainty; they give the appearance of being out of proportion.
Shoes are something you can fit into at a traditional department store. Look for comfortable pairs that offer a pop of color or pattern to enhance your outfits.
Try something new; a belt around the waist highlights an hourglass figure, while a scarf or headband will frame your face.



Keep your locks tamed and styled to add sophistication to your look.
Long hair is flattering no matter your size. If you want to elongate your body, try growing your strands to a length a bit longer than your shoulders.
To show off your upper body, cut your hair in a bob or pixie. These will frame your face and allow for viewing your collar bones, shoulders, and chest.
Layers are always a good option for keeping hair from falling flat. Limp hair will make you seem larger than you are. To avoid this, cut your hair at several different lengths to add volume.



Maintain the health of your skin by washing your face twice-daily and moisturizing regularly
A light coat of makeup is appropriate for a day-time look. Sweep on a little concealer, blush, mascara, and lip balm for a pretty natural look.
To enhance your makeup routine for a special event, try a vintage-inspired cat eye, a bit of red or berry lipstick, or a new glamorous hue of eyeshadow.
Keep a balance; donâ€™t wear heavy eyeshadow and bold lip rouge. Instead, focus on either your eyes or your lips.

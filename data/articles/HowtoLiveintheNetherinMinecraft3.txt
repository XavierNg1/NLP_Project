 It might seem fine at first, but when you click the bed, it will instantly explode. You wouldn't even be able to sleep when you are in the nether, as it is never nighttime.
 If you are going to be creating a doorway to the outside of the nether, then a good door to create is a pressure plate piston door. This way, you won't have to deal with clicking on anything.
 This is the easiest way to create a home. Simply replace the walls with something a little bit more sturdy, and you are good to go.
 Some might think that nether windows are not the best idea, but they do help you spot mobs, and they are not easily broken by ghasts. When they are broken, simply move the window to another place.

 You'll most likely be fighting ghasts alot, and you will build bridges more than you may think.
 There are lots of horse armor pieces to be found in the chests of the nether fortress. Might as well take advantage of it. Horses will also help you travel faster on long trips on bridges. However, be sure not to forget to bring apples with you for food for the horse.

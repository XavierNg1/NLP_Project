 Arrange to have your senior dog and new puppy meet on neutral ground, like a park or street that is not part of your regular walks or activities. This will prevent any territorial inclinations on the part of your grown dog. If you don’t want to travel too far, ask a neighbor if you can use their backyard or balcony., Ask a family member or friend to hold your puppy, either in their arms or on a leash. Lead your senior dog (also on a leash) towards the puppy and allow it to sniff the new dog on its own. Do not force your dog to approach the puppy. Make sure your friend holds the puppy firmly and allows your senior dog to sniff it first, before allowing the puppy to sniff the older dog., Dogs are very sensitive to their owners’ feelings and tend to reflect that in their behavior. Stay calm during the introduction to avoid having your dogs pick up on your anxiousness about the situation. Be reassuring and positive by offering praise and encouragement during the process., If your older dog demonstrates aggression or resistance during the introduction, break it up. Separate the dogs and allow them to calm down, give each dog a treat, and try a different approach. Take a walk around the neighborhood with both dogs, with the puppy walking behind your older dog. When your dog seems comfortable with the puppy being around, let the dogs interact again.While walking, do not allow your puppy to touch your senior dog.

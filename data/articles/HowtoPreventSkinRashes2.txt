 Intertrigo is caused by skin-to-skin friction, which causes irritation and a rash. It is common in areas of the body that are warm and moist, especially areas where skin can rub against other skin such as in the groin, under the breasts, between thighs, under arms, or between toes. It may also lead to bacterial or fungal infections. Unlike heat rash, it can happen in any environment.Keep your skin clean and dry, especially where it may rub against other skin. Apply antiperspirant to your underarms. You may find that petroleum jelly helps form a protective barrier for areas such as your inner thighs. Applying baby powder or medicated powder can also help absorb excess moisture.
Wear open-toed shoes or sandals.This will help reduce moisture in between your toes., Medicated barrier creams can be bought at most drug stores and pharmacies. Diaper rash ointment (such as Desitin) can be helpful for areas that are often moist and prone to friction, such as the groin area. Zinc oxide ointment may also be effective.If you have frequent trouble with friction rashes, ask your doctor about Tetrix, a prescription barrier cream that contains dimethicone. It is more effective than over-the-counter treatments.
 Clothing that rubs against your skin can cause friction rashes.Wear natural fibers such as cotton, silk, or bamboo when possible, as artificial fibers can irritate skin and often do not breathe well.
 Intertrigo is common in people who are overweight or obese, as there are more areas of skin that can cause friction. Talk with your doctor about whether your rashes might benefit from you losing weight.Do not begin a weight loss regimen without consulting your doctor first.

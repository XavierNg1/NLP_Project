 Snapping, popping, and clicking are all signs that the outer CV joint, which is the joint that connects your wheel to the axle, is starting to wear out. Sometimes, more severe turns will create a louder snapping or popping noise. If you hear this while you're driving, there's a good chance you have a bad axle.Listen to what side the rattling is on, so you have an idea of which wheel bearing is going bad.;
, When driving, worn out wheel bearings will sometimes sound like a break pad grinding or dragging. The longer you drive, the louder the grinding will sound. Drive down the road at 40 mph (17.8 mps) and listen for any grinding that you hear coming from your wheels., A common sign of a worn bearing is if the sound that's coming from your wheel changes as you accelerate or decelerate. If you already hear a buzzing or snapping sound, see if it gets more or less intense the faster you go. If the sound varies depending on how fast you're going, there's a good chance there's an issue with your wheel bearings.

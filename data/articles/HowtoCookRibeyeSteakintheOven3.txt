 Once you take the skillet out of the oven, you need to keep the heat going. Make sure the burner is hot before you take the skillet out. Set the skillet on the burner to ready it for the steak., Let it sear for 30 seconds on one side. Flip the steak, and sear it for 30 seconds on the other side.If the steak is especially thick, make sure to turn it on an edge with tongues for 30 seconds, too, so you sear the extra fat there., Once you've seared both sides, the steak goes back in the oven. Turn the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). For a thick steak, you'll need about 2 minutes on each side for medium rare.Cook it for an extra minute on each side of you want medium. You're aiming for 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) for rare or 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius) for medium, which you can check using a meat thermometer., After you pull the steak out of the oven, take it out of the pan. Give it a light cover of foil, and let it sit for 2 to 5 minutes. After the resting period, cut into the steak, and serve it.

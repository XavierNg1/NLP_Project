 If your custody arrangement allows it, call or video chat with your kids on the holiday. If you can’t speak with them directly on the actual holiday, talk to them the day before or after., Don’t make your kids feel like they’re leaving you behind or that you’re going to be sad because they aren’t there. Tell them to have lots of fun with their other parent!, If it’s a gift-giving holiday, send a gift for your kids to open. Keep any messages in the gift fun and upbeat--don’t write a card about how much you miss them and how sad you are without them. Don’t forget to coordinate gifts with your ex to avoid repeats!, Don’t sit at home alone during the holidays. Spend time with your extended family, a new partner, or some good friends. If you know other single parents spending the holidays without their children, plan a dinner or outing with them!, If you can leave town, a getaway might help cheer you up. A new place won’t have any of the same associations as your home, and you’ll be occupying your mind. If you can’t take a trip, try visiting a new restaurant, museum, or park., If your former partner has the kids on Thanksgiving Day, you can plan your own Thanksgiving dinner with your children the following Sunday. If this isn't possible, try to do something special later on with your kids in recognition of the holiday., Thinking of others is a great way to keep your mind off spending the holidays away from your kids. Spend some time at your local soup kitchen, homeless shelter, or animal shelter. You can also donate money or goods to charity., If you find the holidays stressful, spend some time doing something you enjoy. Read a favorite book, watch some television, or just relax with friends. This is especially important for parents who have primary custody--being a single parent makes it very difficult to find free time!

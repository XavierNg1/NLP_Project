 If you notice there is tension in the group, try to get all group members to do active listening. This may be useful if you notice conflict between two members in the group. Active listening will ensure that everyone listens to each other and responds thoughtfully to each other.As the leader of the group, model active listening for the group members. Start a discussion with a group member and listen intently to what they have to say. Make eye contact and maintain a relaxed body posture, with your body positioned towards them. Nod and smile to show you are listening.
Once the person is finished talking, rephrase their thoughts back to them and confirm you heard them correctly. You may say, “What I am hearing you say is…” or “I believe what you are saying is…”. Once they confirm you heard them correctly, you can respond to them.
 If you notice issues between group members, be direct and work with the group to resolve the issue. State that you are concerned about a conflict in the group. Use “I” statements. Ask open ended questions to get the group members to discuss the issue.For example, you may say, “I am feeling like there is tension between group members. How do you all feel about this?” or “I am feeling tension in the group. Can we talk about the issue as a group?”

, Sometimes issues in a group are best resolved privately, especially if it is between two individuals in a large group. If you notice conflict, pull the individuals aside. Ask them if you can all speak privately about the issue. Set up a meeting with you and the individuals to discuss the issue in a private setting.


Doing this can put the individuals at ease and make it easier for them to talk one on one, rather than in the big group.

 Regardless of the type of event you’re inviting your guests to, you should use a formal writing style on a formal invitation. This means spelling out dates and other words that are usually abbreviated.For example, you should write “Saturday, the nineteenth of November” instead of “Saturday, November 19th.”
You should also write “253212 Boston Street” instead of “253212 Boston St.”;
, Don’t use the shortened versions of guests’ names. Write “Stephanie Smith” instead of “Steph Smith" and always use last names.
 One of the most important parts of the formal invitation is the inclusion of the event's host(s). Listing the hosts tells your guests who is inviting them to the event. How you write the hosts' names and the order in which you should list them varies depending on who is hosting. These rules are particularly important if you are writing a formal wedding invitation.For example, you should start a dinner invitation by saying "Sam and Ellen Smith invite you to a dinner celebrating the graduation of their daughter Leslie from graduate school."

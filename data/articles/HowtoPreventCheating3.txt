 Teachers and parents can take steps to make it less likely a student will cheat.


Place an empty chair or desk in between each student during a test.
Make seating assignments random during exams. Instruct students to leave blackberries, smart phones, tablets, and notebooks elsewhere during a test.
 Not all tests are created equal. Some make it easier for a student to cheat.


Create two versions of your test. Students are less likely to cheat on tests that require essays than on tests with multiple choice or true and false questions.
 You can stop cheating by tackling the emotions that drive some students to cheat.


Encourage mistakes. If you don't make students feel they can make mistakes without being criticized, they might be more likely to cheat. Explain that mistakes are part of learning.
Schools that place heavy focus on grading statistics and class rankings instead of learning might find that more students will cheat.
Outline your policy on cheating. Explain plagiarism. Some students might not be aware what plagiarism is due to the easy availability of information on the Internet.

 You can backup WhatsApp from within its settings menu.


To back up WhatsApp, your Android must be synchronized with Google Drive.
 This should resemble three vertical dots., This should be in the lower right corner of your WhatsApp screen.
 This will open your Chats preferences.
 From here, you have a few options:


"Back up to Google Drive" - Backup your chats to Google Drive.
"Auto Backup" - Toggle auto-backup settings. You can choose "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", or "Off" (the default).
"Include Videos" - Swipe this option to "On" to include videos in your backup settings.
 This will prompt you to choose a backup frequency.
 As long as your phone and your Google Drive account both have enough space for the backup, this process will continue.
 If you don't have a Google account registered, you will need to tap "Add Account" and enter your email address/password., You can do this by tapping "Back up over", then tapping a network.


If you use data rather than wifi, you may get charged for the use.
 If this is your first backup, it may take a few minutes.

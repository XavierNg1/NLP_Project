 For this recipe, bigger is not better. This kind should be pop-in-your-mouth-able. Make sure they're even in color and firm.
 The great part about this recipe (apart from when you're finished and get to taste it, of course) is that you only have to peel the onions. No slicing, dicing, and crying required.
 Get it very, very hot. You're going to flash the onions with a bit of heat initially, to get the process rolling.


If you're thinking ahead, peel the onions while the stove is heating up. Not only can you cook, but you can multitask, too!

, And you thought that stuff was just for salad dressing! Toss the onions around, adequately covering them in the vinegar and oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. If you're particularly keen on another spice, add it now.
 These babies will be simmering for 45 minutes or so. Stir them occasionally to ensure they cook evenly.
 This recipe can be made a day in advance and then combined with other dishes -- meats, stews, curries, pastas, just about anything. Or if your mouth is watering, pop 'em in now!

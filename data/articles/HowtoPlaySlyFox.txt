 "The fox" then goes and stands by a wall or on an imaginary line. The others go to the opposite side. Make sure the "the fox" is not facing the others.;
, When "the fox" isn't looking, the others must run or walk to get closer to the fox. Seems easy, doesn't it?

, If the fox sees them moving, the person/people who were moving go back to the start. Remember if you are seen moving, you must go back to the start even if you didn't think you've moved!

, Count up who won the most rounds and declare a winner!

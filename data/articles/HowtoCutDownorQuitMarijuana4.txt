 You are your first and best form of support. Writing about what you are doing can help you explore and express what you are feeling as you cut back or quit using marijuana. It can also help you examine and address the underlying reasons for your use.


Keep a log or graph of your use. This visual reminder can show your progress, times when you are struggling, and serve as a general reminder of what you are doing.
Write about your struggles. When you slip and use again (or use too much), write about it. Explore where you were, what you were doing, who you were with, how you were feeling, etc.
Remember to write words of encouragement and celebration. Remind yourself that you can do this, that you are a great person, etc.
 While some people may not believe you, and some may even ridicule you, those people that really care about you will support what you are doing.Let them know why you are doing it. Although you don’t have to share your whole life story, try saying something like, “I’m trying to quit marijuana so that I can get a promotion.” The more they can understand about what you are doing, the more helpful they can be in supporting your goals.
Share your successes and setbacks with them. They can celebrate with you and encourage you to keep trying when you stumble.
This will also cut down on any confusion or misunderstandings caused by you "acting different."

, Connecting with others who are going through the same thing can help by letting you know you are not alone and by providing you encouragement.Your support group can also help you be accountable for your use.


This can even be an informal support group of friends that are also trying to cut back or quit using marijuana.
If you aren’t comfortable or simply don’t have the time to go to an in-person support group, consider visiting an online forum or group with use goals similar to yours.
 If you are using marijuana to self-medicate and/or feel that your marijuana use is having a negative impact on your life, it might be a good idea to speak with a professional about what’s going on. Some research suggests that just one session with a therapist has helped some people with their marijuana use.

 You must find an appropriate place to pack. Make sure it is big and nobody else in your family needs that room for a more important job. One suggestion is your bedroom.;
, Get your suitcase out from that spare room, it is time to pack! You can't pack in an untidy area, though. It is likely you will lose something under any rubbish which may be in that area.
 Get some paper and write down a few categories like footwear, clothing, hand luggage, tasks, essentials, etc. Write a few things you will need to take. It will act as a reminder to you as to what you need.
 Get all your money, toiletries, etc., in there. Remember to check limits on certain toiletries. Toiletries will include-make up, toothbrush/toothpaste, hairspray, deodorant, sunscreen, shampoo, body wash, conditioner, etc.
 Depending on how long you're staying, you will need many items of clothing. Remember your underwear, footwear, dresses, skirts, crop tops, t-shirts, cardigans, etc.
, This is simple: put any phones, crosswords, puzzles, magazines, etc. in. Be ready to put your passport and other documents in, even if you wait until the last minute to do so. Remember to check size limitations on hand luggage.
 Weight limits depend on the airline, and what exactly you need depends on how long you will be staying, but make sure the case is within the weight limit. If not, you could end up paying extra for extra luggage.
 If your case is too heavy, decide what to remove. Alternatively, move some things into a fellow traveller's case. If your case is over the limit, move some items into a family members case (if theirs is underweight).
 Search up on something about the holiday and enjoy the last day while in your home country.

 If you want to stay traditional, add one tsp (2.3 g) of tea leaves for every cup (29.57 mL) of water.Experiment with different tea leaf amounts to brew a tea that matches your preferences., The water temperature for rooibos tea should be 212°F (100°C). A rolling boil occurs when the bubbles pop on the surface of the water. You can achieve this by setting the heat on your stovetop to high., Pour your boiling water over your tea leaves and allow them to steep for five to seven minutes. After the tea steeps, you can pour it into individual teacups and serve it.You can run your tea through a filter or sieve to filter the leaves out of your tea., If you have an automatic coffee maker, you can also prepare your rooibos tea in it. Put the loose tea leaves into a regular coffee filter and fill it up with the appropriate amount of water. Again, you can use the same ratio of one tsp (2.3 g) of tea leaves for every cup (29.57 mL) of water.

You can also brew your rooibos tea in a French press style coffee maker.

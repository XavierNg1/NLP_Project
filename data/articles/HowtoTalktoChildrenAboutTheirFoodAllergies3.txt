No child wants to feel weird or different from his friends. Help him realize that his allergy is not a big deal by making sure he will not have to read labels or talk about his allergy in front of his friends. Make a food plan for your child before he goes out with his friends and discuss it with him so that he knows what he will be eating in advance and wonâ€™t have to think about it while he is out.
For younger children that are not your own, speak with the parents who will be in charge of your child while he is out. Inform them of his food allergy and be very specific about what he can and cannot eat.
Also make sure your child is well aware of what to do in case of an attack when he is out by himself.
 Food allergies can cause some children a great deal of anxiety. This is why it is important to always remain calm when talking about their allergy and to use a matter-of-fact tone when conveying information about the allergy.

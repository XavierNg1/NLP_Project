 This is the gray cog icon located on one of your home screens or in your “Utilities” folder.;
, This is in the third set of options in Settings.
 This will be at the bottom of the first set of options.
 This option is turned on by default, and your iPhone will only stop recording motion and fitness data once you turn this switch off.


Alternatively, you can restrict certain apps from accessing your motion and fitness data without turning off Fitness Tracking altogether. Motion & Fitness menu will list all apps that have requested access to your motion and fitness activity here. Slide the switch to the off position for apps that you want to restrict, and leave Fitness Tracking on if you just want to limit your motion and fitness data to a certain app, such as iPhone's native medical app Health.

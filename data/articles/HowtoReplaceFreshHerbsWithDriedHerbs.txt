 This is due principally to the evaporation of the essential oils when the herb dries, altering the flavour quite markedly. Nevertheless, this alteration can be ideal given the right cooking medium, amount used and properly matching the ingredients. And realistically, many herbal mixes only come in dried form, so using these mixtures can be a very important part of certain cuisines, such as Asian or Italian.;
, Dried herbs are much stronger than fresh herbs. Many cooks recommend using one-third to a half the amount of dried herb to fresh herb. As a general rule for the most commonly used kitchen herbs, it is considered accurate to substitute one teaspoon dried for every tablespoon fresh. Know that the test is in the tasting because even half or a third the amount might be overwhelming in the dried form. It is always best to add less and top up if the taste is not strong enough.
 Dried herbs work really well in dishes that are sautéed. When sautéed, the dried herbs have sufficient opportunity to release their flavours into the dish.

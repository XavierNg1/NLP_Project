 Put the honey in a clean bowl. Then, carefully pour the tea tree oil into the honey. Use a small spoon to mix the ingredients together.If the honey is very thick, you can warm it up over the stove to make it a bit softer. As it comes to room temperature it should become thinner, making it easier to combine with the oil.;
, Always wash your face before you apply any face masks. Use your normal facial cleanser to remove any bacteria, dirt, or dead skin on the surface of your skin.
 Use the back of the spoon to apply the tea tree and honey mixture to your face. Make sure you spread the mixture in an even layer over your face, excluding your eyes and mouth., Close your eyes and lay down with the mask on for 10-15 minutes. If your skin feels a little itchy due to the honey, use a clean finger to gently pat the area until the itch fades away.As the mask settles on your skin, it should be less itchy.
 After 10-15 minutes, use lukewarm water to gently remove the mask. Do not scrub or rub the mask off. Simply let the water melt the mask off of your face.


Once the mask has been washed off completely, pat your skin dry with a towel.

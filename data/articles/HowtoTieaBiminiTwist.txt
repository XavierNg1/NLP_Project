 Measure twice this length, then add a little extra.;
, You may wish to wrap the line around something to keep the loop formed, such as a partner's hands, a boat cleat or your own foot or knee.
 Make at least 20 turns or as many as 60. The more turns, the stronger your knot will be.


In general, the lighter the line used in making it, the more turns you should make when tying a Bimini twist.
 This will bunch the twists together. Spread the sides of the loop evenly, so the turns don't overlap each other. Once the twists have gathered about 10 inches (25 centimeters) below the free end of the line, you're ready for the next step.
 Let the free end first relax to a 90-degree angle with the twists, then let it roll over the twists. Keep pressure on the loop while holding one hand over the twists to keep them from unraveling.
 If you're right-handed, this will probably be the right-side strand; if you're left-handed, this will probably be the left-side strand. Draw this knot tight.
 Thread the free end of the line through this new loop to form a locking hitch.
 Your saliva will lubricate the line to prevent the knot from breaking as you draw it up.
 Once the knot comes together, trim off the free end. You may want to apply a drop of super glue or rubber cement to the knot to prevent it from unraveling.

 It's normal for the skin around your piercing to be red for the first few days after it is pierced, but redness after 3-4 days is a sign of possible infection. Similarly, changes in color of the skin around the piercing (e.g., to a yellowish tint) can indicate that it is infected. Check the color of your piercing site twice a day in the mirror, preferably before cleaning it., During the healing process, a slight, white discharge is normal. If you see pus with a yellow or green tinge, your piercing is probably infected. Check your ear for pus before cleaning the piercing, given that you might wash away traces of discharge., Prolonged bleeding of the piercing site is not normal and is a cause for concern. Similarly, swelling that does not go down after 3-4 days may be a sign of infection. Check the pierced area daily., If your piercing develops signs of a bacterial infection, contact your physician or visit a walk-in clinic immediately. A doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an anti-bacterial ointment to treat the problem. Left untreated, a cartilage piercing infection may lead to an abscess, which usually requires surgery and may leave ears deformed.

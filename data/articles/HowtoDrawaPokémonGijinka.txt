 If you are new to gijinka work, it would be best to pick a Pokémon with a basic design, like Clefairy. If you can't think of a Pokémon, go to http://www.wyncorporation.com/pokemon/index.php, and generate a random Pokémon.;
, A good place to look is http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/. Look especially at the behaviour section.
 This is so you can get an idea of what it would look like in human form.
 Try to make it pose like the image you are looking at, so it can be easier.
 For example, if you were doing Pikachu, make it have a Pikachu tail-like tie, or just include an actual tail.
 Congratulations!

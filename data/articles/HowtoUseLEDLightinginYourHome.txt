 One of the chief advantages of LED bulbs is their long life - often in excess of 10 years. This makes them ideal for hard-to-reach fixtures in which bulbs are a pain to replace. This can include recessed lighting on a very high ceiling or high-hanging pendant lamps.;
, Of course, you want to see a reduction in your energy bill to justify the high upfront cost of LED bulbs, so it makes sense to install them primarily in areas that get a lot of use. Replacing only the bulbs in your kitchen or living room, for example, will help you get the most out of the low energy consumption of these bulbs.
 LED bulbs typically provide a clean, bright light that is sometimes criticized against the warm glow of incandescents. However, this clean light makes LED bulbs ideal for task lighting. Consider using LED bulbs to light your desk or kitchen workspace, where they can actually reduce strain on your eyes by providing bright and clear lighting.
 Large halogen bulbs have long been the mainstay of outdoor security lighting, but these bulbs produce an intense amount of heat and burn out very quickly. Instead, try using LED bulbs in your floodlight fixtures. They use less energy, which makes keeping them on all night a more sustainable solution, and they do not have to be replaced as often, which is great for hard-to-reach flood lights.
 Another benefit of LED bulbs is that they are available in incredibly small sizes. This allows them to be unobtrusive, which is great for lighting a piece of artwork or an architectural feature without competing for attention. The clean light of LEDs also allows the artwork to be presented as naturally as possible.
 It opens up all sorts of new possibilities, not least because the bulbs don't give off heat and can therefore be placed in otherwise unusable locations. Bear in mind though that because LEDs tend to be extremely bright they are is often best used indirectly.

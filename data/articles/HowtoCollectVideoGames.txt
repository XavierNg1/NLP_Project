 This doesn't mean you should memorize every console for each game generation, but you should still have a feel for which consoles were the front-runners. Don't waste time learning about the Amiga CD32 if you could be spending that time learning more about the Nintendo 64. Once you have a basic knowledge of the blockbuster consoles and their games you can learn more about the more obscure systems and titles.;
, Buy a lot on eBay with a console, controllers and some games. This is the cheapest way to start a collection. When you have the big titles everyone knows about, start to buy more obscure games. Don't be afraid to get doubles or triples, game collecting is about playing games as well as storing them in a safe place for the future. If a game breaks, a double is a perfect identical replacement.
 Books and action figures make great collectibles. Books can expand a library as well as a game collection, and action figures give a nice touch to everything they are near. Strategy guides are also useful, and very collectible.
 Maybe the Playstation 2 was the best console of the sixth generation, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a large amount of good games on the Gamecube. Having medium amounts of games on each console can add some variety to an otherwise dull collection.

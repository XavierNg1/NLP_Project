 Hold it at a 45-degree angle with the bottom exposed.
 This causes a water hammer effect, raising the pressure near the lid and breaking the vacuum. Only slap hard enough to break the seal, but not hard enough to hurt your hand or break the jar. You should hear a "pop" sound when the seal breaks.
 Hold the jar upright and turn the lid to the left. It should come off without trouble if the seal was successfully broken.

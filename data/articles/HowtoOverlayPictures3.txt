 Open the Layer menu with View → Layer or Window → Layer and select the layer containing the superimposed image. You can now explore many options for altering its appearance.


There are many photo manipulation programs and they each organize their large variety of options differently. To find the common suggestions below, or experiment with your own effects, try the Filter and Layer menus.
 More subtle transparency can also make several superimposed images look better, if you used the Quick overlay method. This is a simple additional adjustment that requires little work.


Near the list of layers, which you learned how to view in an earlier step, there should be a box labeled Opacity. Here you can enter a number from 0 (invisible) to 100 (completely opaque), or adjust a slider to change the transparency gradually.
 The Drop Shadow effect adds a new shadow layer beneath the object to make it appear part of the background, although you may need to follow the suggestions below to make it appear more natural.


In GIMP, this option is found under Filter → Light and Shadow.
In Photoshop, find it through Layer → Layer Style → Drop Shadow.
Select the shadow layer to adjust it. If necessary, use the Filter → Blur command to make the shadow less sharp.
You can use the Edit → Free Transform command to change the shadow's position and shape to match the direction of light in the background photo.
 There are countless additional effects in each major photo manipulation program. Play around with the Blending Options to make the superimposed photo appear more natural, or with any of the effects elsewhere for silly or artistic alterations.

 Musicians and celebrities often like to hear from fans who have supported them in tangible ways, such as attending several live performances over the years or buying every copy of their album. Let Bieber know how loyal of a fan you really are by noting any Bieber shows you have attended and how many of his albums you own. You want to let him know that you are a loyal fan and are willing to support his music.
 Many celebrities like to receive fan drawn art like sketches, a collage, or a drawing created with online tools. Show Bieber how much you love him by including a personal touch in the form of a visual image of Bieber, singing on stage or hanging out with you in your hometown. This can help to catch his attention and let him know that you are the ultimate fan.

 As most people know, bananas are very rich in potassium. In fact, one banana contains 594 mg of potassium. However, there are other fruits that can help you restore your levels of potassium. These fruits include:


Tomatoes (one small tomato can contain 900 mg of potassium), oranges, cantaloupe, strawberries, kiwis and the dried versions of apricots, peaches, prunes, and raisins.;
, Fruits are not the only great source of potassium. Vegetables can also give your potassium levels a boost. Veggies that will kick start your potassium intake include:


Carrots (one cup of raw carrots contains 689 mg of potassium), potatoes, spinach and other dark, leafy greens, mushrooms, and acorn squash.
 Salmon is one of the best proteins to eat when trying to restore your potassium levels. Three ounces of this fish generally contains about 319 mg of potassium. Lean beef and white beans are also excellent sources of both potassium and protein., While eating all of these potassium-rich foods separately is great, making a meal out of them is even better. Try composing your meals so that they are as high in potassium as possible. Some meal ideas include:


Yogurt (which is also potassium-rich) with bananas and raisins.
Cooked salmon with sauteed mushrooms and a spinach salad.
A snack of dried apricots and raw carrots.

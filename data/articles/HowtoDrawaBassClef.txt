 Music paper is just paper with a staff on it. The staff consists of five lines, as shown in the image.
 After going up for a few centimeters, it should hit the top line, and then go down to the second.
 Make sure the dots are in the third and fourth spaces, one in each. This is also called "The F Clef" because the line ends on the line for "F".
 Draw another one directly below it, on the second line from the bottom.;
, The top of the heart should touch the top line.
 One should be in the top space, and the other should be in the second space from the top.

 Try wearing a long-sleeved top inside of woolen and knitted sweaters. Wear Long Johns or other warm leggings inside jeans, dress pants, or any other pant worn otherwise.


Choose a thick coat that falls below the waist, preferably reaching the knees. Layering your clothing helps to trap body heat within the layers, consequently insulating you.

Too many layers, however, have the capacity to cause sweating, which can become cold and defeat the purpose of layering. Try a few layers of good, warm materials such as wool, polyester, and thick synthetics. Avoid cotton directly on the skin, as it does not provide any warmth.

, Tight clothing does not trap any heat, whereas loose clothing allows for more insulation. Tight-fitting sweater dresses are only made for fashion and should be worn during the fall, not in very cold temperatures. Try fleece tops, woollen and knitted sweaters, and thick hoodies. If you wear hoodies, make sure you have 1-2 layers inside.
 Mittens do not allow you to have a strong grasp on objects, so you may choose to wear gloves. You can wear gloves where you are provided an option to cover your fingers with a flap that can be opened or closed. Your scarf should be knitted or woollen, and broad. Your cap should have ear flaps, as caps without ear flaps often slip off the head and provide no coverage for the ears. Sometimes, you can wear a thinner scarf inside your jacket, and a thicker one outside your jacket when you are outdoors. Some people also like wearing fashion scarves for style purposes - these should be indoor scarves. Even for the indoors, try wearing fashion scarves that have thick material and are broad. Thin scarves should be reserved for summer and fall.
 Warm blankets knitted, made of wool, polyester, and velvet, are very warm materials you can wear over your regular clothing inside or outside. Polyester throws are extremely soft and very comfortable and plush, which can help you have comfortable sleep as well.

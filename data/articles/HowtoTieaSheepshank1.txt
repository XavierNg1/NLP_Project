 Take one end of the rope. Twist it over itself to form a loop. Hold the first loop so it doesn’t come undone and twist the rope over itself to form a same-sized loop in the middle. Now take the free end of the rope and draw it over itself to make a third loop.








If the knot is being made on a damaged rope, the damaged area should be on the top of the middle loop.;
, Pull the right side of the middle loop under the right loop’s side and through the loop. Repeat the process, pulling the left part of the middle loop under and through the left loop.
 Grasp the ends of the middle loop poking through the side loops. Pull both ends in opposite directions away from your body. Tighten the loop as desired.

 Right after the chocolate has finished heating, drop a tablespoon into 10 cupcake liners. The chocolate has to be warm for it to spread, so donâ€™t wait between melting the chocolate and making the cups., After pouring the chocolate, use a pastry brush or other small brush to coat the bottom and sides of the inside of the cupcake liner with chocolate.Try to evenly distribute the chocolate around the liner so that the cup has an even thickness.
 After spreading the chocolate, put the cups immediately in the freezer and leave them there for 30 minutes. This will allow the chocolate to firm., Melt the leftover chocolate by microwaving and stirring every fifteen seconds. Since the chocolate has already been melted, it will take less time to get warm again. Stop when the chocolate is warm and easily stirred., Spoon another tablespoon of chocolate into the chocolate cups and spread it to form another layer. Making another layer ensures that the chocolate cups are the right thickness and won't be too brittle.
 Put the cupcake liners in the freezer to let the second layer harden. Keep the chocolate cups in the freezer for at least one hour so they can get completely hard.

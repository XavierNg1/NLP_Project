 Girls love to talk, and talking will help you get to know each other. Most girls appreciate a conversation much more than they appreciate playing video games with you.
 Asking for advice will show that you trust your friends, and they’ll likely return the sentiment. Be careful not to go overboard, though. You don’t want to seem clingy or whiny. Start with something small, if she responds well then you can keep going.
 Treat her like one of the guys! Include her in activities, even if it is something stereotypically “boys only,” like Poker Night.
 Don’t go overboard - if she is really upset, teasing her will make her feel like you don’t care about her problems. However, if she is working too hard or seems lost in thought, tease her gently or tell a joke to pull her out of it and lighten the mood.
 Teasing isn’t the only answer when she gets too serious—sometimes she’ll actually need someone to help her out, be it on her English essay or coping with a death.
 Show that you still realize that she’s a girl. Don’t act like you don’t notice her feminine side or treat her exactly the same as you treat your male friends.


Flirt a little. Don’t go overboard—you don’t want her to think you like her, but a little bit of flirting is effective, especially at the beginning of a relationship.
Give her compliments. They don’t have to be big or super frequent, but a couple will help boost her self esteem.

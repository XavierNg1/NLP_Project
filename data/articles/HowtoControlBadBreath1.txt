 It is difficult for you to assess your own breath because you become habituated to it.This is similar to how people can have body odor and not know it. However, if your breath is very bad, this may work:


Cup your hands over your nose and mouth.
Breathe into your hands from your mouth and inhale through your nose.
If your breath is very bad, you will probably be able to smell it.;
, This method can be used to determine whether your dry saliva smells unpleasant.Lick the inside of your wrist.
Allow the saliva to dry. This should only take a few seconds.
Go somewhere out of the wind, and then sniff the dried saliva on your wrist.
If the saliva on your wrist smells bad, then your breath does too.
 This is probably the most objective way to get an answer, as long as the person really will tell you if it’s bad.


Other people will be better at assessing your breath than you because they won’t already be used to it.

 While the directional signs in the airport are marginally helpful to get you to the nearest AirTrain terminal, feel free to ask an airport employee or security officer if you need assistance.;
, These map brochures are useful if you have no idea where you are going or where you may need to transfer to (if a transfer is needed), and also provide information about each station, which lines go where, the fares, etc.
 Be sure to pay close attention to when it has arrived at your stop, whether in another terminal or at the Jamaica/Howard Beach Stations.
 As of August 2014 it is $5.00 per person. If you are only traveling between terminals at JFK Airport, you won't need to pay a fare. But if you plan on debunking outside of the airport at a non-airport stop (Jamaica or Howard Beach Stations, as you'll learn about a little later), you'll have to pay the full fare when you arrive at either of these two stations.
 The AirTrain has two main stations on two separate spur-offs on the lines that can get you to the city and connect to the New York City subway system: One AirTrain ends at Jamaica Station and the other ends at the Howard Beach Station, you must make your choice. (Certain stations on the AirTrain will lead you to the certain end station.


To/From Jamaica Station: Transfer to MTA Subway or Long Island Railroad into Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan
To/From Howard Beach Station: Transfer to MTA Subway, Long-Term Parking lots (JFK) and Howard Beach

, If you arrive at Jamaica Station, for example, you can take the MTA Subway into Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc. (cheapest method), or take the Long Island Railroad directly into Manhattan (faster but more costly method). However, you can also take the Subway from Howard Beach Station to the City. That choice is solely yours to make.

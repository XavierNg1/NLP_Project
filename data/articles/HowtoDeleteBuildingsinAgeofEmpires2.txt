 This can be done either by double-clicking the AoE2: Age of Kings shortcut icon on the desktop, if it’s there, or by following this Start Menu sequence: Start button >> All Programs >> Microsoft Games >> Age of Empires II - Age of Kings. #Open the Main Menu. Press Enter repeatedly to skip through the pre-game cinematics and display the Main Menu.
 Load a previously saved game by clicking “Single Player,” “Saved Game,” and then double-clicking on the game from the saved games list.


You can also start an entirely new game by clicking “Random Map.” Select your preferred Civilization from the list, and then click “Play.”

, Do this by left-clicking the building you want to remove. Alternatively, you can press the building’s hotkey. Different buildings have different hotkeys that can be used to select them, e.g., T for Town Center and Control+B for Barracks.
 Just hit Delete on your keyboard. Note that in AoE2, no confirmation dialog box will appear, so make sure you really want to delete that particular building, because once you press Delete, it’s gone.


In AoE2, you cannot delete multiple buildings at the same time, and neither can you use the mouse as there is no delete icon you can click in the game.

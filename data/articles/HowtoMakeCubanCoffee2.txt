 If you have a moka pot, you can put the sugar directly in with the coffee grounds. This makes a weaker espumita (foam), but it's easy to make in a rush and might caramelize the sugar a little more.For moderate sweetness, use 1–2 tsp (5–10 mL) sugar for each espresso-sized serving of coffee. For extreme sweetness, use 1–1½ tbsp (15–22 mL).
The traditional ingredients are dark, Cuban-style roasted beans and raw demerara sugar.
 Do not tamp down the grounds, especially if your moka pot is aluminum. If you pack it too tightly, it can block the steam and cause uneven extraction, or even blow the lid off your pot., Pour water into the base of your moka pot, using preheated water for best results. Pour to the base of the safety valve.
 Screw together the parts of your moka pot and heat over medium-low. You'll know your coffee is ready when the moka pot gurgles.

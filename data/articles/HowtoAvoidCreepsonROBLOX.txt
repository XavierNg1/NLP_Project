 Calling someone a "creepy weirdo" just because they seem suspicious isn't very nice. Look around in games and see if a user is making others speechless with shock or fear, or being inappropriate.;
, If someone is stalking (following you to every game) you, and asks personal things or inappropriate questions, report them.
 If someone asks you for any personal information (where you live, your name, etc) don't answer, and report them. If they are your friend, tell them that you don't feel comfortable giving that information out.
 There are people who send messages to other robloxians saying stuff like," send this to 10 people or else you will die. " Please don't go into a panic if some person sends you this letter. All chainmail are hoaxes, so nothing's going to happen if you don't send the letter to other people. Also, don't believe any messages saying that it is from a Roblox admin, without checking their profile first.
 Remember, even if you are mature enough to handle bad words and the like, players as young as 5 years old play! By reporting this person, you save someone else the trouble.
 This is possible by going to the creep's profile, and clicking 'block user' under 'more'.

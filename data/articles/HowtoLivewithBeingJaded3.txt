 If you’re really jaded, it might seem like nothing is that important to you. But think back to the past -- what has been important to you? Consider some of the elements in your life that gave it meaning before, and whether any of those things might be able to bring you some joy and interest again.
 Being jaded often means finding others boring and of little importance, particularly if they are jaded as well and facing the same experiences you are. However, it is still important to forge connections with people, no matter how bitter you’re feeling about the rest of your life.


Think of something you do like, and then find someone else with a similar interest. Do you a have a friend who also loves Jurassic Park? Invite them over for a movie marathon. Have you been bitter that you haven’t had time to exercise? Ask a friend to meet you at the pool or track on Saturday afternoon for a workout.
Meet new people whom you find interesting and fun. You can meet people anywhere that you enjoy going: talks, seminars, your gym, or maybe even your workplace. Look for people who would want to do activities with you or try something new.
 If you’ve been jaded about life for a while, think about what made you happy in the past. Make a list of these things -- it could be games, reading, exercise, movies, painting, sports, or caring for something (i.e.; plants, pets). Think about how you might want to revisit these interests. Just because you’re jaded about one part of your life doesn’t mean that it has to bleed over into all of it.
 If you feel like you cannot deal with your feelings of being jaded on your own, you might need professional counseling. Reach out to your health care provider to see if you have options covered by your insurance.Many people try a couple of different therapists before they find the one that works best for them. Schedule meetings with a couple of different doctors to see whom you like the best and want to work with.

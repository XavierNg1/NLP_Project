 Your relationship as you knew it pre-cheating is gone, but if you've decided to move forward with your partner you're now entering a potentially rewarding new period of reconciliation, growth, and development. This new phase in your relationship will bring with it new rules and expectations. Discuss these rules and expectations openly to ensure you are on the same page., While continued communication and trust-building will be important, your fragile relationship will benefit from spending time and effort on new experiences.Consider activities you've enjoyed in the past that you could reestablish as productive habits.
Discuss your goals and interests. Perhaps your partner has always wanted to travel. You might consider spending some time researching trips or even pursuing language or cultural instruction to make that dream a reality. Perhaps he or she has been thinking about running a half marathon. If you can share this vision, commit to achieving this goal together -- or, if you aren't a runner yourself, commit to becoming your partner's top cheerleader.
 However painful, your cheating is now in the past. Focus upon the possibilities of your future together while recognizing you're now called to higher standards of accountability and emotional communication., If sexual intimacy was part of your relationship in the past, set a goal of reestablishing sufficient trust to renew this commitment.Be mindful that while your relationship is a partnership, the wounded partner needs to set the parameters for this process. Fulfilling intimacy requires considerable trust.
Ensure you've been tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Never risk your partner's physical health -- or the emotional devastation that would result from an STD diagnosis.

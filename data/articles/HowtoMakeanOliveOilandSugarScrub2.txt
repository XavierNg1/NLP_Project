 Add ⅓ cup (79 ml) of olive oil, 2 tablespoons (43 g) of honey, ¼ teaspoon (1 ml) of vanilla extract, and ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) vitamin E oil to a small bowl. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix the ingredients together.If you prefer a different scent, you can substitute your favorite essential oil for the vanilla extract. Lemon, grapefruit, and lavender are all good options.
 Once all of the liquid ingredients are mixed, stir in ½ cup (100 g) of brown sugar and ½ cup (115 g) of granulated sugar. Mix until the ingredients form a thick, grainy paste.You can use all brown sugar or all granulated sugar in the scrub depending on what you have in your pantry.
 When you’re ready to use the scrub, gently massage it into your skin. Work in circular motions, and be careful not to scrub too hard to avoid irritating your skin.You can use the scrub on your face and body. Just be sure to avoid the eye area.
 After you’ve massaged the scrub over your skin, rinse it off with warm water. Splash your skin with cool water to close your pores, and pat it dry with a clean towel.Apply a body cream or facial moisturizer after using the scrub to lock in the moisture.

 This method is a little more complex than the previous method and may take some practice to perfect.
 It doesn't have to be that corner, but if you're right-handed having it there will usually make it easiest.


If you're doing steaks (or similar cuts of meat), remember how many pieces are in each package. This'll come into play later on when you're labeling the package for freezing.
 The meat should lay perpendicular to the opposite corner of paper.
 This'll come in handy during the next step, so when you fold that same paper side over the meat, the corner will be nice and tight.



Try to keep the fold very tight against the side of the meat.
 Flip the meat towards the far end of the paper as you did the first time.
 Start by folding the edge of the paper a little over itself, then fold the entirety of that side of paper over the meat.


If the corner of the side of paper sticks out beyond the meat, you can either fold it back upon itself, or tuck the tail into the crease of the first side you folded over.
 Keep the meat inside the paper very tightly as you do this. It takes practice, but you'll improve with time.
 Usually two 2" pieces of freezer tape will suffice.
 You'll want to include the type of meat (beef, chicken, etc.), the cut of meat, and the date. If you're doing steaks (or similar cuts of meat), include how many steaks are in each package.


If you're freezing meat of several animals (such as several deer, or several cows), you may want to label each package for each animal. This way, if you find later that one of the animals has really bad meat, you don't have to dispose of all the frozen meat. One way to label the meat for this would be to label it as 'Cow #1, Cow #2', etc.

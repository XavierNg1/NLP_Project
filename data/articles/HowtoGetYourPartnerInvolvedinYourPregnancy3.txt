 Make sure that the announcements about your pregnancy include your partner. Don’t decide how to do it by yourself. Instead make sure they are involved in the decision and actual announcing. Tag them on Facebook, include them when you break the news to family on Skype, or send out a printed announcement with a photo of both of you., A baby shower doesn’t have to be all about the woman who is pregnant with the child. Your partner can be involved in the planning of the baby shower and can attend as well. This can help them feel involved in your pregnancy and the anticipation of the baby’s arrival., If your partner is a woman, ask her friends to throw her a Momchelor party. Your friends are planning a baby shower for you, and your partner also deserves a celebration before the baby arrives., Celebrating the baby's arrival begins in the delivery room. Give them roles they feel comfortable with. This can mean helping you with breathing and delivery or even cutting the umbilical cord.

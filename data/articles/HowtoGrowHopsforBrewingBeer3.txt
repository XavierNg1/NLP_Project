 In the late summer, when it's time to harvest the hops, examine the cones on the bines to see if they are mature. Hope cones are ripe when they're dry and papery, aromatic, springy, and filled with yellow lupulin powder. Test one by cracking it open to see if it is ripe.


Hop cones that are heavy and green aren't ready yet. Be patient; your hops might not ripen until early fall.
Don't leave cones on the vine until they turn brown.
 Gently twist off the ripe hop cones as they ripen. Some will ripen more quickly than others, so leave the ones that still need time.


You can use a ladder to pick the hop cones that are out of reach.
If it seems that all the hops are ripening at once, and you prefer not to use a ladder, cut the bines at their bases. Lay them flat and pull off the cones.
 Place ripe hops on a flat surface away from sunlight. Make sure they are only a single layer deep. Turn on a fan and let it blow over the hops for a few hours. Flip them over and continue drying them on the other side. Continue drying and flipping the hops until there is no moisture left on their surface.


You may also store your hops in a paper bag in a cool, dark and dry place to let them dry out over the course of a few weeks.
Check home-brewing websites for hop-drying kits that make the process faster.
 Hops should be stored in airtight food storage bags in the refrigerator. If you won't be using them for awhile, you can freeze them.

 To stretch your foot, you will need a few items. You will need a long shoelace or ribbon. You also will need a tube sock you have modified.


The tube sock needs a shoe lace or ribbon loop sewn into the toe of the sock and to the top of the sock. You can easily do this with needle and thread.
 To begin stretching your foot, sit down in a comfortable position. You may want to place your ankle on your opposite knee.Put the sock on your affected foot.


Make sure you keep your toes flexed during this so you get the best stretch. However, don’t stretch it so far that it feels painful.
 Gently pull your toes up toward your head. Keep your toes stretched so you feel the extension in your foot.Thread the shoelace or piece of ribbon you have through each loop on the tube sock. You should feel a gentle stretch and shouldn’t feel any pain.


Tie the shoelace or ribbon so that your foot remains in the stretched position, your toes pointing toward your face. You should also feel some stretch in your calf.
Be careful that you don’t overstretch the tendon.
 Be careful when you get out of bed during the night for any reason. Also use caution when you wake in the morning. Before you get out of bed, untie or loosen the shoelace or ribbon. Re-tie it when you get back into bed.


You stretch your foot at night so that your foot can heal in a stretched position. Keeping it gently stretched helps to loosen the tight or lengthen the shortened plantar fascia.

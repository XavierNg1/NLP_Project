 In some courts, a court reporter doesn’t sit and take down the testimony. Instead, these courts electronically record what was said. For example, many New York City family courts use electronic recording., The court needs to find the appropriate electronic recording. You should call the court clerk and tell them that you want a copy. You will probably have to provide the following information:your contact information (name, address, and phone number)
the names of the parties
the case docket number
the name of the judge or referee
the dates of the proceedings
which branch of the court heard the case

, If you are getting a copy of the electronic recording for your appeal, then you will need to have it transcribed into written form. Judges expect a paper transcript and won’t listen to a sound recording. You will probably have to use a court-approved transcription service to make the transcript.However, you might want the recording for another purpose, such as use it as an exhibit in a different case. In this situation, you might be able to hire your own transcriptionist to make a transcript.
 Check with your court to see if they have a list of court-approved transcription services. Before choosing a service, make sure to call several and ask the following:How long it will take them to make the transcript.
Their rate per page.
Acceptable methods of payment.
If they have a “rush” service, and what the price is.
 The transcriptionist probably wants you to pay before beginning the transcription. You should arrange payment, using an acceptable method of payment, such as a credit card or money order. Check with the transcriptionist.
 Look for errors. If you have a question about how something was transcribed, contact the transcriptionist. You should be able to listen to the sound recording and double-check whether something was transcribed accurately.


If you find errors, contact your attorney. He or she will know how to amend the transcript.

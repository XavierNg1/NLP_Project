 If you've developed an earache, that can be a sign that you have otitis media. The pain can be a constant, dull ache, accompanied by throbbing, or it can be sharp, stabbing pains that come and go, either alone or in combination with a duller ache.The pain results from the fact that you have infected fluid in your middle ear, which presses on the eardrum.This pain may also spread. You may experience a headache or neck pain, for instance.;
, You may also begin to temporarily lose some of your hearing. When fluid builds up behind the eardrums, it can slow down the signals that go to your brain as they pass through the tiny bones of the inner ear; therefore, you may experience some hearing loss.Some people also hear a ringing or buzzing in their ears that comes and goes., When your ear is infected, you may also have fluid drainage. Pay attention if pus or other fluids drain from your hurting ear. The fluid may be brown, yellow, or white. This fluid means your eardrum has ruptured, and you need to see a doctor., Sometimes, ear infections develop alongside other symptoms, such as a runny nose or sore throat. If you have these symptoms in conjunction with an earache, talk to your doctor about the possibility of having an ear infection.

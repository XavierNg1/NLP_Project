 Unwind it so that you have a long straight piece of stiff wire.
 This is used to catch hair clogs, and will be easier if it is a very small hook.
 With the other hand, reach the wire snake into the drain, targeting any large clumps of hair.
 If the hair clog is tight enough to block water, it will stick together as you pull it up.
 Pour a little water down the drain to see if water is moving more freely.

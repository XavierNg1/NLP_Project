 Did they hurt you or someone you know (physically or mentally)? If so, you may just have to forgive and forget. Or are they just an annoying person? If that's the case, you don't have to be around them while you pray for them. You can do that in the privacy of your own home.;
, Since no one is perfect, something is bothering them. Figure out what that is (this may require some actual talking to them). Who knows, you might even discover why they're so mean, or do an annoying habit.
 When it comes time to pray for them, be very focused. Don't think about what they do that annoys you, think about everything they're going through. Ask God to make everything better in their lives, and to make your relationship stronger.
 They'll probably appreciate the gesture, and you'll feel a ton better. If they're rude, don't retaliate, just let it go.
 Remember that your actions are your responsibility, don't give an eye for an eye until it's an absolute necessity.

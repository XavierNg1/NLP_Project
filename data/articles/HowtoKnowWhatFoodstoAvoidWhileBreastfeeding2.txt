 Eating spicy foods won't cause any harm to your baby when you are breastfeeding. However, some of that spicy flavor may transfer into your breast milk and your baby might not enjoy it as much as you do. If you notice your baby becoming fussy or refusing to eat after you've eaten something spicy, try eliminating those spices from your diet., While fish can be a great addition to your diet, providing omega-3 fatty acids and protein, some fish can also contain contaminants.

Eat no more than 6 ounces of fish a week.

 If you are using calla lilies as part of a wedding bouquet, let them sit in a vase in a cool place until 30 minutes before you need them. Remove them from the water 30 minutes before using them to avoid water dripping onto clothing.


It may be a good idea to dip the cut ends in melted wax to help seal them.
Alternately, try putting a cotton ball at the end of the stem and wrapping it with cloth underneath ribbon.
This will help seal the end to stop it brushing against clothing and leaving a stain.
 Calla lily pollen will stain clothing. You can remove the ‘spadix’ – that’s the yellow finger-shaped thing inside the flowerhead – but this ruins the appearance of the flower.


The best option to avoid staining is to just be careful when you are handling the flowers.
 If your callas are being transported some distance to their final destination, after arrival they need to ‘condition’ in a cool dark room for about 6 hours before you arrange them in a bouquet.


Cut the ends and let them sit in a bucket of lukewarm water in a cool dark place such as a basement
This helps them rehydrate after transport to preserve their lifespan and look their best.
If any are still looking limp after this time, recut the ends and repeat the conditioning.
If any pollen is visible on the flower petal, avoid using the flower.
This is a sign the flower head is more mature and won’t last as long as other flower heads that don’t have visible pollen stains.
Callas last well in a bouquet so long as they are fully hydrated before they are arranged.

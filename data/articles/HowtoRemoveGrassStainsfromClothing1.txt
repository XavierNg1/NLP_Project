 On the inside of your garment, there is a care label. Reading this label will give you an idea of what you can use on your garment safely.For example, an empty triangle is the symbol for bleach. If the triangle is black with a large “X” through it, you cannot use bleach of any sort. If the triangle is striped black and white, you can use non-chlorine bleach only.;
, Before using any cleaning product or detergent, read the label. The label can help identify which products are best for which garment. It can also tell you if it is safe on the type of garment you are using.For example, a detergent with bleach will be best for a white garment, but may not be the best choice for a dark colored garment.
 Before putting anything on a stained item of clothing, do a test spot first. A test spot will allow you to check that you can use your stain removal solution on the clothing without causing permanent damage like changing the colour.The inside hem is a great location to test a solution because it is very inconspicuous., Before doing anything with your item, you should remove excess dirt or grass from the stained location. Blot, rather than rub, to try get the excess out. Rubbing will only cause the stain to move further into your clothing.


Struggling to get some dirt off? Try holding the clothing taut between your fingers, and flicking from the inside of the garment. This should forcefully fling off any excess mud.

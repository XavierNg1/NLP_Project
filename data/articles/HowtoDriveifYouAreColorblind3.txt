 Colorblindness does not mean seeing all colors as shades of grey. Rather, colorblind individuals may see only certain colors muted out, or many have trouble distinguishing between colors. If you believe this applies to you, begin looking for specific symptoms.These may include:


Trouble distinguishing red and green (this is the most common form of colorblindness)
Trouble distinguishing blue and yellow
Disagreements with others about colors
Sensitivity to light
Increased night vision
Headaches

, Although there are numerous online and/or paper tests you can take to self-diagnose colorblindness, only a optician can make a definitive diagnosis. If you are experiencing symptoms related to colorblindness, make an appointment right away.If you suddenly lose the ability to see colors when you have previously been able to see them normally, contact your doctor immediately. Sudden color vision loss can indicate a serious problem.
 It most countries, including the US and UK, you are not required by law to disclose your colorblindness when you seek a driver's license. If you have worked to memorize the order of traffic lights, study some common road signs, and take the proper precautions, you will be able to drive safely and effectively.Some professions--such pilot or police officer--may be off-limits to colorblind individuals.

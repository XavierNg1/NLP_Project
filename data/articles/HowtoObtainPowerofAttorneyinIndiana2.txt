 Under Indiana law, you must have a separate power of attorney document for medical issues than the one you may use for purely financial or business reasons. You cannot, for example, grant someone authority to manage your business in the same document that you use to grant medical care decision-making., A durable power of attorney is one that is intended to last even if the individual becomes mentally or physically incapacitated. Under Indiana law, a durable power of attorney must be in writing, signed and witnessed, and becomes effective when the individual becomes incapacitated. It then lasts for the duration of the individualâ€™s life., Though not exactly a power of attorney, guardianship is another form of care that can be put in place for someone who needs assistance. Whereas a power of attorney is a document that the subject can sign while he or she is mentally competent, not everyone has one. As a result, if the person does eventually, through age or accident perhaps, become incapacitated, a power of attorney may not be available. In this case, you would need to go to court and petition for guardianship. This would give you effectively the same authority as a durable power of attorney.To seek guardianship, you should either consult with a family law attorney or contact your county probate or family court. The court may have a simple form that you can use to petition. You will need to provide the name of the person involved and be able to demonstrate why you believe a guardianship is necessary.

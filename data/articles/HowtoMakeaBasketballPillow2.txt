 Simply draw the typical basketball lines into place across the pillow, using fabric markers. Let the marker dry before using.
 This is slightly more work but looks better and will probably last longer. There are two methods––you could embroider the markings on but this should only be done where the embroidery will show clearly, and thus won't work on fleecier fabrics. Or, you can cut out strips of black fabric and stitch them into place to form the basketball markings.

 A combination/synthesis reaction is aptly named because it is a reaction where two or more products combine together to form one new product. Remember that the reactants of an equation are always on the left side of the arrow.Many reactions have just two reactants, but you can have combination reactions with more than two reactants.;
, As the name of the reaction indicates, the reactants must combine to form a new product. All products are found on the right side of the arrow. Very occasionally, there will be more than one product on the right side; however, most equations will only have one product.A synthesis reaction is the reverse of a decomposition reaction.
An example of a reaction resulting in two products: CO2 + H2O --> C6H12O6 + O2


, Examples are a great way to train yourself to recognize specific chemical reactions. The more examples you look at, the more likely you are to remember each type of reaction.Example 1: Cu + SO4 --> CuSO4

Example 2: CaO + CO2 --> CaCO3

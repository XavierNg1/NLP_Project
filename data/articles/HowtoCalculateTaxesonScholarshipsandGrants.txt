 Your scholarships and grants may be tax free if you attend an eligible educational institution. The IRS defines an eligible institution as one whose primary function is to present formal instruction. It must have a regular curriculum and faculty along with a regular student body enrolled in the school.The school can be a primary or secondary school, or a college or university.
The school must also be accredited by a national accreditation agency. If you are unsure, then stop into your Financial Aid or Bursar’s Office and ask.
You must also be a degree candidate at this school, though you can be part-time or full-time.;
, If your qualified educational expenses exceed your scholarship and grant money, then you will pay no taxes. It doesn’t matter if you actually used other money (such as employment income) to pay these expenses. Qualified educational expenses include the following:tuition
required fees
required books, supplies, and equipment

, For example, your total qualified educational expenses might total $40,000 in tuition and required fees. If your total scholarships and grants are less than this amount, then the entire amount is tax-free.


However, your scholarships and grants might exceed the total amount of your qualified educational expenses. For example, your expenses could total $25,000. If your scholarships and grants add up to $30,000, then $5,000 is taxable.
 Remember to hold onto all receipts and bills, so that you have proof of the amount of your qualified educational expenses.Put all of these documents into a folder and preserve the information for tax time.
 Some scholarships and grants are taxable, even if they are not in excess of your total qualified educational expenses. For example, a health insurance grant is taxable.


Look for scholarships and grants that are earmarked for expenses other than tuitions, fees, and books/equipment. This money is generally taxable.For example, a grant earmarked for room and board is taxable much like the health insurance grant. Neither health insurance nor room/board are qualified educational expenses, so money received to pay for them is taxable.
Grants and scholarships that are payments for teaching, research, or other services are also generally taxable. However, exceptions are made if you receive the money under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program or the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program., You should use IRS tax forms to make the process of estimating your taxes easier. You can find forms to print off at the IRS website. Choose the right form, based on the following:You can typically use Form 1040EZ if your taxable income is less than $100,000 and you are filing single or married filing jointly. You can’t itemize deductions on this form.
You can use Form 1040A if your income is less than $100,000 and you aren’t itemizing deductions.
All others must use Form 1040.
 The amount of taxes you pay will depend on how much income you have earned in a year. Your taxable scholarship/grant money will be considered income. However, you need to add up all other sources of income, such as the following:wages
salaries
bonuses
tips
child support
alimony payments
unemployment and disability payments

, When filling out your taxes, you must report all taxable income on a certain line. Remember to add your excess scholarship/grant money to your taxable income. You should write your income on the following line depending on which form you use:Form 1040EZ, Line 1
Form 1040A, Line 7
Form 1040, Line 7

, Each taxpayer can claim an exemption amount of $4,050 for themselves. You can also claim an exemption for your spouse and each dependent you are claiming. In 2016, the exemption amount is $4,050 per person. However, you can’t claim an exemption if someone else claims you as a dependent.For example, if your parents claim you on their tax return, then you can’t take an exemption.


If your income is less than the exemption amount, then you won’t pay taxes. For example, your total income might be $2,000. If you claim $4,050 as an exemption, you owe no taxes.
However, your income might exceed the exemption amount. In this situation, subtract the exemption.
 You can choose to itemize your tax deductions. However, most taxpayers will choose the standard deduction. In 2016, the standard deduction is $6,300 for a single person, $9,300 for a head of household, and $12,600 for married filing jointly.Subtract the standard deduction from your income.
As you can see, your exemption plus standard deduction means that a single person can have $10,350 in income before having to pay taxes. This means your scholarship or grant would have to exceed your qualified educational expenses by $10,350 before you pay any taxes on it (unless you have other income).
Most people who pay taxes on their scholarship probably also have other sources of income they are reporting.
 Once you have calculated all of your deductions, you will be left with a total taxable amount of income. You should find your tax table, which will depend on whether you are filing as a single person, married filing jointly, or as a head of household. The tax table for single people is as follows:10% tax on $0-9,275
15% tax on $9,276-37,650
25% tax on $37,651-91,150
28% tax on $91,151-190,150
33% tax on $190,151-413,350
35% tax on 413,351-415,050
39.6% tax on income over $415,051

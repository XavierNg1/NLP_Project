 Avoid drinking a boiling hot beverage to get rid of the brain freeze, as this will shock your mouth and could lead to a serious burn in your mouth. Go for a room temperature or slightly warmer than room temperature beverage, like warm tea or water, to heat up your mouth without burning., Rather than consume that ice cream or ice cold drink very fast, take your time and eat it in small bites or sips. This will lower the chances of developing brain freeze, as it gives your mouth time to get used to the temperature of the item.You should also move the food around in your mouth before swallowing it to give your mouth time to adapt to the temperature of the food.
 To really give your brain time to unfreeze, spit out the ice cold food into a napkin or remove it from your mouth. This will prevent more intense brain freeze and give your mouth time to recover from contact with the cold food.You can then wait it out and let your mouth and brain recover from the brain freeze on their own.

 If your compost pit isn’t quite full, you can add more to it later. Cover the materials in the pit with a fine layer of soil or carbon-rich material, like shredded paper or dead leaves, then close it up with a board.Animals may be enticed to your compost pit in hopes of getting an easy meal. Use heavy rocks to keep your board in place over the pit.So you don’t overfill the pit, use a permanent marker to write the date and height of the materials on the board covering.
Each time you insert fresh compost materials, cover the top layer with more soil or carbon-rich material. When the materials reach 4 in (10 cm) in height, it's ready to be filled.
 Once you have finished adding compost materials to the pit, you can backfill it with the soil you removed. Fill the pit until it is level with the surrounding soil.To prevent unsightly patches of dirt where you’ve dug the pit, cover it with sod or seed it with grass.
 Underground compost decomposes more slowly than above ground piles. Speed up this process by ensuring the area stays fairly wet with a garden hose.


During dry weather, soak the ground above the compost pit with a hose. Dryness will make it more difficult for microbes to break down your scraps.
If the area is kept sufficiently moist, underground compost should be fully decomposed in about a year., A major benefit of underground composting is that you don't have to perform any extra steps to harvest the compost. The best way to take advantage of this is to plant your plants directly over the compost pit.During the year, the decomposed scraps will work themselves into the soil, enriching it naturally.

 Always review the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) before using any hazardous material in the laboratory. This guide will provide you with any necessary warnings, proper protocol, and important information about the acid (or other material) you are about to work with.
 Before you begin preparing your solution, use a volumetric flask to measure your concentrated acid and distilled water. Be sure to use a flask made of borosilicate (or Pyrex), as this material will be acid-safe.
 To prepare an acid solution, begin by measuring out 2/3 the required amount of distilled water. Add the appropriate amount of acid to this, and stir to combine.
 When preparing solutions, you should always add acid to water, never the other way around. You should never add water to concentrated acid! This can generate acidic steam, and as a result, can very easily cause spills, accidents, and/or injuries.
 Once your solution has cooled to room temperature, add water to dilute the solution to proper volume. (This will be the remaining 1/3 of the required distilled water).

 A quiff is when the front of your hair is held up so that it curves back towards your head. There is a "wall" of hair above your forehead, and none of your hair reaches down past your scalp. The size and style of your quiff can make it unique.;
, Go online and search for the kind of quiff you want, then show the person who cuts your hair so that they have a good idea of what you want. There are a lot of different quiffs out there, so it helps to know what you want ahead of time:



Classic Quiff: Short on the sides and back, high in the front, this classic hairstyle has been famous since Elvis.

Short Quiff: This short, clean cut has become popular with businessmen and executive types. It is short on the sides and tops with 1-2 inches of coiffed hair at most.

The Pompadour: This is a big, wavy quiff, similar to James Dean or Johnny Cash's haircuts.

Undercut: This modern cut is when you buzz the sides of your head almost completely, fading into light hair on top and a small, short quiff, like Adam Levine.
 The one thing all quiffs have in common is that the sides are kept short. This allows you to create the dramatic quiff in the middle of your head without hair from the sides getting in the way.
 Pretty much anyone can carry off a quiff with the right products and tools, though itâ€™s probably best to avoid this style if you have thin, very curly, or ferociously frizzy hair. Straighter hair is easier to manipulate into the quiff and requires less product to style.
 If you've never had a quiff before, watch the barber or hairdresser as they style your hair after the cut. More likely than not, they will:









Get your hair damp.
Comb your hair to the side.
Apply a small amount of gel/wax with their fingertips.
Gently sculpt the quiff with their fingers.
Use a blow dryer to blow the quiff up and over, into shape.

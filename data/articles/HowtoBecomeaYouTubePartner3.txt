 This step only applies to US YouTube accounts. Once you reach $10 in earnings, you will need to submit your tax information to YouTube.


Sign into your account and navigate to the Account Settings page. In the Payments Settings section, click "Update tax information." Fill in the required fields.
 When you reach the equivalent of US$10 in ad payments, YouTube will send a PIN via mail to your address. You will then need to enter this PIN online to verify your physical address.

 When using this method, you'll need to temporarily connect a USB cable between your printer and computer.


Connect and disconnect the USB cable only when prompted by the software. It will guide you through connecting and configuring your printer's wireless connection.
In some cases, depending on your printer model, the software may automatically discover your wireless settings.
If this is a first-time installation of your printer, the software may not find your printer on the network. If this is the case, the software will guide you through the proper steps for creating a wireless connection to the printer.

 Remember that a fraction bar means “divided by,” so when you see a fraction over a fraction, you need to divide the top fraction by the bottom fraction.For example, you might see 2x2y−3x4{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}{\frac {x}{4}}}}. You can rewrite this as 2x2y−3÷x4{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\div {\frac {x}{4}}}.
;
, To  divide a fraction by a fraction, you take the reciprocal of the second fraction, and you change the division sign to a multiplication sign. A reciprocal is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are reversed.For example:2x2y−3÷x4{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\div {\frac {x}{4}}}becomes2x2y−3×4x{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\times {\frac {4}{x}}}


, Use parentheses to show the multiplication, but do not multiply any terms yet. Writing the expression this way may help you identify terms that can cancel.

For example,2x2y−3×4x=4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\times {\frac {4}{x}}={\frac {4(2x^{2})}{x(y-3)}}}.
 Use the normal rules for  simplifying a rational expression to do this. Cancel out terms common to the numerator and denominator.Remember that you cannot cancel out a single term (like y{\displaystyle y}) from a binomial (like y−3{\displaystyle y-3}). 

Also remember that if you have an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term in the numerator, and an x{\displaystyle x} term in the denominator, you can cancel out one x{\displaystyle x}, and the x{\displaystyle x} in the denominator disappears, and the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} in the numerator becomes x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, you can cancel an x{\displaystyle x} in the numerator and denominator in the expression 4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x^{2})}{x(y-3)}}}:4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x^{\cancel {2}})}{{\cancel {x}}(y-3)}}}4(2x)y−3{\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}}


, If you have any remaining parentheses in the numerator or denominator, simplify these by multiplying. The result will be your final simplified expression.

For example, 4(2x)y−3=8xy−3{\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}={\frac {8x}{y-3}}}. So, 2x2y−3x4=4(2x)y−3=8xy−3{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}{\frac {x}{4}}}={\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}={\frac {8x}{y-3}}}.

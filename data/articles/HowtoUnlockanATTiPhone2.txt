 The fees are constantly changing for unlock services as unlock servers come and go. You will most likely be paying around $50 to unlock the phone.
 The time it takes to receive your code varies by the service you choose, but expect to wait at least 48 hours. You should receive the code through the email address that you provided when you ordered the unlock.
 To complete the unlock process, you will need to restore your iPhone to factory settings. This means that all of your data and settings will be erased. To preserve this so that you can load it back on later, perform a backup of your iPhone using the Backup function in iTunes.
 Insert a SIM card from a carrier other than AT&T. To do this you will need to remove your old SIM card and insert the new one in its place.
 After you’ve backed up your phone and inserted the new card, restore your iPhone to its factory settings. You will be prompted to enter in the unlock code that you received from AT&T. Once you’re phone has been unlocked, you can restore your backup from iTunes to restore all of your data and settings.

 If you follow the recipe properly and use the cooking temperatures and times it has suggested, you have a greater chance of the cake being ready when the recipe says it should be. However, in reality, we all have different oven types (convection ovens change cooking times) and often we make substitutions to cakes that change the essence of the recipe and can alter the cooking times. So, it is handy to know how to test a cake for readiness.
), the cooking time will be longer.
For a cake that you have doubled or tripled the ingredients, the cake will need to cook for a longer time and at a lower temperature.
 One of the major errors in making a cake is to open the oven too soon and have the cake sink on you because it is exposed to the temperature difference before it has had a proper chance to rise.
 Use oven mitts to remove the cake from the oven.
 Use one of these items to poke the top of the cake slightly in the middle.

The hand method: Take your hand and spread it out. Palm face down, gently press your clean hand on the top of the cake. A firm top that does not give way under pressure and springs back means a ready cake. If the cake gives, it must cook more. This method is tricky and should only be used by advanced cooks - the cake may sag if pressed too hard and it must be performed very quickly as the cake is hot!

, You will know whether or not the cake is ready by seeing:

If it comes up with some wet batter, crumbs or stickiness on it, the cake needs to bake some more.
If it is dry, then the cake is done.
 Otherwise, leave your cake out to cool for 5 -10 minutes in the pan and then transfer to a rack to cool before adding frosting (icing) to the top. Or, if you cannot wait, eat some warm cake with butter - that is always delicious.

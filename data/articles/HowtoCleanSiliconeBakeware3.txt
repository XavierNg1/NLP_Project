 One of the worst things you can do to silicone bakeware is let the residue sit for long periods of time before cleaning. As soon as you finish baking, you should rinse out the silicone bakeware with grease-cutting dish soap. This will help maintain the integrity of your silicone bakeware and make future cleaning much easier.At the very least, fill the silicone bakeware with water and dish soap immediately after use so you can go back and clean it later.
 Scrubbing silicone bakeware with abrasive sponges will not work any more effectively in cleaning than a regular sponge or cloth will. And it may even damage your silicone bakeware in the process.Using an abrasive sponge can chip off pieces of the silicone and, over time, minimize the nonstick elements of the pan.
 Silicone bakeware is considered nonstick in its own right, so you donâ€™t need to use nonstick cooking sprays with this type of bakeware. It will not help you get items out of the silicone pan any quicker than you would be able to with it.Additionally, using cooking sprays with silicone bakeware will contribute to the sticky, greasy mess you have to clean up later and cause more damage to your pan over time.

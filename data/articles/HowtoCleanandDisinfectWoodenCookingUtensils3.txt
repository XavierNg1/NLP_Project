 Examine your wooden utensils for any signs of warping, cracking, or splitting. Check for any fuzziness that develops from the grains swelling as they get wet over time. Notice any discoloration, such as stains left by cooking with turmeric.








Create a routine “check-up” for your wooden utensils and extend their lifespans by treating stains, sanding rough surfaces, and conditioning the wood.
 If it feels fuzzy, it is probably because the grain of the wood has been raised from the soaking. If it’s just a little fuzzy, take a fine grit sandpaper to gently smooth the utensil. For rougher patches, you should to begin with a courser grain sand paper and finish with a finer grit.








Keep a supply of 100, 200, and 400 grit sandpapers on hand just in case.
If you opt to work from a coarser grit to a finer grit sandpaper, wet the spoon in between sanding sessions. Give it a rinse in hot water, then towel dry and let it sit to further air dry for a half hour or so.
When you sand with the finest grit sandpaper for the final time, wet the paper and the spoon for best results.Steel wool will work in a pinch if sandpaper is not available.
 Conditioning a wooden spoon using one of a variety of options will help extend its life. You can use a paper towel or a small piece of clean cloth to administer the oil to the utensil. Let it sit for about 20 minutes, then wipe thoroughly with a clean, unoiled cloth. You can use a variety of oils:









Mineral oil, a food safe oil that is commonly used by restaurants to increase the longevity of wooden utensils.Coconut oil, preferably that’s not been processed by high heat.Vegetable or canola oil will work in a pinch.
You can purchase a specialty non-toxic oil from a cook’s warehouse or restaurant equipment store.
Oil your wooden spoons up to once every month.

 With a large knife, cut your grapefruit in half along its equator, leaving an equal-sized top and bottom half. Do not peel the grapefruit halves.
 Rest each half on a cutting board so that the flesh is facing you. If want a little more stability, you can cut off the bottoms of each half.
 Take a paring knife and slice along the perimeter of the grapefruit where the flesh meets the pith. Be sure to angle your knife towards the center in order to follow the fruitâ€™s curve. Cut all the way around the perimeter until you reach the place where you started.
 Use a grapefruit or paring knife to cut along the inside of the membrane towards the center of the fruit. Repeat the process on the other side of the segment. Move around the inside of the grapefruit until all of the segments have been cut from the membrane.
 Use a grapefruit or paring knife to separate the segments by cutting along the inside of the peel. You can also use a serrated spoon to scoop out each segment.








If you are making Grapefruit Brulee, do not remove the segments. You will want to leave them in place.A grapefruit knife has a serrated blade that is curved sideways at the end

, After all the segments are removed, squeeze the remaining juice from the membrane. Be sure to throw away or compost the remaining peel and membrane.

 Just as most jobs are now advertised online, most cover letters are submitted by email. If you are applying via letter, it is most likely for a company that is more traditional or a position that is higher ranking.
 If you do not have letterhead, it is ok to skip this step. If you are currently employed as a consultant or if you are applying for a contract, you should have letterhead made.
, This should follow the standard format of a formal letter.
 Before you start the letter with “Dear Hiring Manager:” look at the email, company website and job posting to see if they contain the name of the person in charge of hiring.


This attention to detail and personalization in your salutation can make a big difference next to hundreds of cover letters that say “To Whom it May Concern:”
If you cannot find the name of the person, address it “Dear Department Head” with the name of the department to which you are applying.”
If you cannot find the name of the department, try “Dear Director” or “Dear Hiring Manager.” Use LinkedIn to find the hiring manager’s name.
 This is the preferred opener for all cover letters, because it establishes a connection to the company.


For example, “John Smith recommended that I get in touch with you about the general manager position at EnviroRent.”
If you do not know anyone at the company, do some research to establish a distinctive first line. Your next choice can be admiring a recent lecture, job or initiative the company did that attracted you.
If you have a strong alumni association, use it to get in touch with someone, and references someone, who attended your college.
 After your intro sentences, your next goal is to summarize your career in 1 to 2 sentences. Next, include a paragraph with your accomplishments and a paragraph explaining how you plan to be in touch.

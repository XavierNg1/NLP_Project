 The ball of your foot is the spot between your toes and your arch.Keep your back straight through your landing.
Keep your heel off the ground, so that only the balls of your feet are touching.
 You don’t want to lock your knees, or you’ll injure them. Keep a soft bend in your legs so your hamstrings can take the absorption of your landing., Putting your arms out to the side or in front of you can help with balance., Once you know you can maintain your balance through the landing, you can set your heels down onto the ground so that you’re standing on your entire foot.
 You’ve landed your jump!

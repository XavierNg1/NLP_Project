 The simplest way to avoid questions about your scars is to wear clothes that cover them. Long pants and long-sleeved shirts are an easy way to hide most of your skin.If you are a woman, you may be able to stay cooler in the summer by wearing long skirts, sheer tights, and light cardigans.
For one-time events when you cannot cover up with clothes, consider using a professional concealer. You can get this from a dermatologist. Another option is to cover your arm with a light shawl.
 If covering your scars with clothing isn’t an option, you can use body makeup to minimize their appearance. If you want to permanently cover the scars, consider getting a tattoo.If you choose to use makeup, look for a heavy-duty concealer that’s designed to cover tattoos or scars. Many regular foundations don’t provide adequate coverage.
Do not put makeup on a scar until it is fully healed.
 Ask your doctor about the best way to reduce the appearance of your scars. An over-the-counter topical treatment may be able to help fade smaller scars. For more severe cases, procedures such as dermabrasion and laser resurfacing can help smooth out the appearance of your skin.

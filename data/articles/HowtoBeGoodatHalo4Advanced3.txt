 If you want to improve in Rumble Pit, play it! You don't have to be good at everything to be good at the game! Pick one skill at a time!,, Do you like to use the jet pack armor ability! Choose Default! Or if you are overly reliant on it, choose bumper jumper! It lets you have a devastating strafe, really good aim, and combined with the hold to crouch layout, it is awesome! But mess around with them and see what suits you., Most pro players find their sensitivity between 3-5. Higher sensitivities are always better, but if you are having trouble aiming, use a lower one. If your aim is spot on but you can't react as fast, just move it up. Practice makes perfect!

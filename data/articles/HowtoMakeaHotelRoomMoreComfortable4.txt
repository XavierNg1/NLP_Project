 When you rent a hotel room, you can move the furniture in any way you like. If you believe that the flow of a hotel room works better when the nightstand is on the left side of the bed rather than the right, give it a try. If you don’t like where you’ve moved a piece of furniture, you can always move it back, or move it to a different spot altogether.Experiment with the locations of various items of furniture to find an arrangement that makes you feel most comfortable.

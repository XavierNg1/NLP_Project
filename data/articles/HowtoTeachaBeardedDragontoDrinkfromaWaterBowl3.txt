 This is extremely important. If the dragon’s water bowl is not big enough, it will not recognize the bowl as something that it can bathe in. Make sure the bowl is full of fresh, clean water.A dish from a frozen dinner is the perfect size for a bearded dragon to bathe in. It's also easy for the dragon to get in and out of.
You can buy special reptile water bowls at your local pet store.
Fill the bowl with water up to the dragons elbows.
 To pick up your dragon, place your hand under its abdomen and simply scoop it up. Curve your fingers around its abdomen so that it feels secure.Be gentle and move slowly, remembering that you’re much larger than your dragon.
 Slowly place the dragon into the bowl of water. It should be willing to lie in the water and enjoy the feeling of getting a bath.Make sure the water is not hot or cold to the touch.
You can put a piece of cloth on the bottom of the bowl for traction. This can comfort dragons who are uneasy about baths.
 Your dragon may still not understand that the bath water is also for drinking. Splash a little bit of water from the pool onto its nose and head. The dragon may drink some of this water if it’s thirsty.Repeat this step if necessary. Ideally, the dragon will see the water being splashed from the bowl and will associate the moving water with the pool.
 If your dragon is dirty or has feces on its body, let the dragon soak for 10-15 minutes and then scrub it gently with a soft bristled tooth brush.Dry the dragon off thoroughly after the bath.
Clean the water bowl very well each day. Many dragons will defecate in standing water, and drinking from this dirty water can be bad for their health.

 It is important to start training your dog early so that they understand what you want from them from the beginning. Start with showing them what kind of behavior you want and then reinforcing this behavior with treats and praise.Though you can start teaching simple concepts (e.g., housebreaking, sleeping in crate, not jumping/biting/dominating people) to young puppies using positive reinforcement, training more advanced obedience is only recommended for puppies four months and older.
 For a high energy dog like a Collie, obedience training is essential. Not only will it provide essential stimulation for your BC, it will also make your life with an extremely energetic, mischievous dog somewhat easier. A professional trainer will be able to your dog with obedience training so that it will be easier for you to continue the training at home.Border Collies are intelligent dogs and often respond best to training techniques in which they can think problems out for themselves, such as clicker training.
 Read books on Border Collies, join an Obedience/Agility group, or talk with experienced BC owners. Do anything to learn more about your beloved pup and what you can do to make their life healthier and happier. Learn about dog nutrition and how important exercise is for your dogâ€™s wellbeing.Consult your veterinarian if you have questions about your Border Collie.

 If the tag on your clothes says "dry clean only" you shouldn't put them in a conventional washing machine. Instead, sponge the area with cold water.If the stain is not coming out, you can lubricate your sponge with mineral oil or lard to help lift the stain from the fabric. Make sure to lubricate the stain thoroughly and keep it wet as soon as you notice the stain., Create a mixture using 1 teaspoon (4.92 mL) of a mild liquid detergent with one cup (240 mL) of water. Using a dropper, carefully put some mild detergent on the surface of your stained clothing. You only need a few drops before sponging and dabbing the area again. You should start to see the stain begin to lift. Continue to sponge the area with water and mild detergent until you lift the stain., You can use 3% hydrogen peroxide to remove stubborn chocolate milk stains. Use the dropper again to apply the hydrogen peroxide to the stain, before blotting up the area with a spare cloth. Continue to do this until you lift the stain from the piece of clothing., Once there is no visible sign of the stain, you can flush the mild detergent off of your shirt with cold water. You don't need to get the entire garment wet, you only need enough water to flush the chemicals from your shirt fully. Do not allow visible stains to dry on non-washable fabric because they will be harder to remove later on.


When you're done, you can take your clothes to a professional dry cleaner to ensure that the stain is completely removed.

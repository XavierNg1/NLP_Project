 Gather some hair from the thicker side of the part. It should be perpendicular to the part, not parallel to it. Split it into three sections. Each one should be no thicker than your finger., Cross the front strand under the middle one, then cross the back strand under the middle one. This will be the start of your Dutch braid. It is very important that you cross the left and right strands under the middle one and not over, otherwise you'll get a French braid instead., Gather some hair from your hairline, and add it to the front section. Cross the front section under the middle one. Gather some hair from just behind the back section. Add it to the back section, then cross it under the middle one.Keep the braid about an inch (2.54 centimeters) from your hairline.
 When you reach the nape of your neck, brush your hair back to hide the part, then continue adding it into the braid as before. Braid across the back of your head, then stop., Pull all the hair from the other side of your head into the Dutch braid. Finish off with a regular braid. Your braid needs to be long enough to wrap around the side of your head and reach just past the part.If you hair isn't long enough for this, continue Dutch braiding until you reach the part, then finish off with a regular braid.
 Keep the braid right against the inside edge of the Dutch braid. Tuck the tail-end of the braid underneath the braid, then secure everything with bobby pins.Use bobby pins that match your hair color.
Depending on your hair length, you may have to wrap the braid a few times around your head. This is perfectly fine; Leia herself had very long hair!

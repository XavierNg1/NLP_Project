 The most distinctive trait of a Cornish Rex is its short, curly coat. The coat should be soft and fall in tight, uniform waves. The breed comes in a variety of colors and patterns, including solid colors, bicolor (one color and white), and tortoiseshell.The wavy coat results from a genetic mutation that originated in 1950.;
, The Cornish Rex is long and slender with curved body contours. Its naturally arching back and deep chest make its profile dramatically curvy. Its body shape is often compared to that of a Whippet., A Cornish Rex has thin legs and dainty paws. It stands high on its legs, which appear to be unusually long in proportion with the rest of its body. Its thighs and hips also appear disproportionately muscular for its slender frame., The arched back and tucked up hips flow into a long, thin tail. The tail should be whip-like and flexible. It should taper, or slightly narrow, toward the end.

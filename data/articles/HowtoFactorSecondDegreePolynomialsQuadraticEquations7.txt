 You will use the equation solver, also known as the screen.
 Once you've entered your equation, press - you should see a smooth arc representing your equation (and it will be an arc since we are dealing with polynomials).
 Since polynomial equations are traditionally written as ax2 + bx + c = 0, these are the two x values that cause the expression to equal zero:(-1, 0), (2 , 0)
x = -1, x = 2


If you cannot identify where your graph crosses the x axis by sight, press and then . Press or select "zero". Slide the cursor to the left of an intersect and press . Slide the cursor to the right of an intersect and press . Slide the cursor as close as possible to the intersect and press . The calculator will find the x value. Do this for the other intersect also.
 If we term our two x-values h and k, the expression we will be using is:(x - h)(x - k) = 0

Thus, our two factors must be:(x - (-1))(x - 2) = (x + 1)(x - 2)

 Place the generator as far away from your home as you can with the cable that it comes with. This is to prevent your home catching fire, should something go wrong with the generator, and to avoid the deadly carbon monoxide poisoning from the generator exhaust. This is a basic safety precaution, and should not be ignored.
 Match the holes at the end of the generator's cord to the prongs on your hookup. Plug it in. You will likely have to then turn the plug connection to complete the connection (usually about 15 degrees).
 You generator should have come with a cable to use to connect to your house. Plug it in, select which voltage you want (if you can), and do the same turn that you did with the other end and the receptacle.
 Check that the throttle for the engine is in the correct position and that the engine has enough oil. You may also need to preheat the engine with the glow plug, depending on where you live.
 Start your generator's engine according to manufacturer's instructions.
 Go to your breaker. Flip off the utility main and turn on the generator main.
 Flip the breakers on the system that you installed, turning on all of the loads one by one (slowly).
 In order to return to use of utility power, reverse the order of operations.

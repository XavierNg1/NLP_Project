 Canning requires boiling your jars full of marmalade, but your glass jars shouldn't be directly on the heat of the stove. This small, metal rack will elevate the jars enough to keep them safe. If you don't have a canning rack, you can use:


Round cake rack
Metal mesh basket
Folded kitchen towel

, Cover your rack, cans, lids, etc. with enough water that there is an inch of it over the top of the highest can. This first boil will sterilize your equipment. Boil for ten minutes.If you have a serialize, you can simply use this instead. Sterilizers use boiling water to kill germs for you.
 Keep the water boiling, however! Once you're done sterilizing, remove the cans and carefully pat them dry -- they'll be hot!

, As the mixture cools, it will expand slightly, so be sure to leave some room at the top. The jars must still be pretty warm -- adding hot marmalade to cool jars will crack them., Close them up like normal, putting on the lid and then tightening the ring around it securely.
 If necessary, add more water to ensure the cans are covered completely. Make sure they are not touching each other, or the bottom of the pan, and simply let them boil for 10 minutes.


If you are at or higher than 6,000ft above sea level, you must let the jars boil for 15 minutes, not 10., Set the jars out on the counter in a cool, dry place and let them drop back to room temperature. After the first few hours (when they don't burn to the touch) loosen the rims on the jars a half turn to prevent them from rusting or sticking., Everyone has played with this little top on jelly jars from the store, but this is the time actually use it. If canned properly, the "button" should simply pop back up. Well-canned marmalade will last up to a year.

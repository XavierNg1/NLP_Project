 Be aware however that some people (i.e. siblings or roommates) can share one IP and some people use their home computer for their own account and, for example, a school/workplace connection for their sockpuppet. So it isn't a sure thing, but still a good one to start with.;
, Also, shared opinions, education or hobbies could raise the sockpuppet-suspicion. In this case: be aware that some sockpuppets are created with their own "personality" sometimes including a history of their own, as well as maybe some intentional misspellings or different interests from the real person behind the puppet.



Is it "evil"?
Is it in any way unfair (For example, is this person getting double votes and trying to swing a vote or discussion)?
Are the con's bigger than the pro's?

,, Be sure to include some evidence supporting your claim and explain why the sockpuppet is a problem (e.g. if it is being used to swing a vote).

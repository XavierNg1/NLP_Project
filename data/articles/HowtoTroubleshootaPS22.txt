 Make sure that all the correct wires are hooked up to the correct slots. Also, make sure that the wires are pushed in all the way. Sometimes, if a wire isn't in properly, the console will not work. Check all of the wires by pushing them in to the slot. If one turns out to be loose, that might just solve the problem.;
, If the wires look bent or used, they might be broken inside. While you won't be able to check the inside of the wires, you can still look for evidence on the outside of the cover. Evidence of a broken wire includes broken, chewed up or cracked casing. The actual metal plug part might also show these signs.
 The main power button can be found at the back of your console. Without the main power, the console will not work. Make sure that the button is flicked to the on position. If it was off, that might have been the problem. Still try everything else though, just in case it wasn't.
 Chances are, the wires were loose or the main power switch was turned off. If the console still isn't turning on, try disconnecting it all and starting all over again. If re-connecting the whole console still doesn't do the trick, the PS2 is probably useless now. Either get rid of it or buy a new one. You can also sell it for spare parts.

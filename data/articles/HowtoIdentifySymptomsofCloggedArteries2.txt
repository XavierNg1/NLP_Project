 Your physician will likely order blood tests to evaluate for the presence of certain sugars, cholesterol, calcium, fats and proteins in the blood that can raise the risk of atherosclerosis or clogged arteries.The doctor may also order electrical studies of the heart using electrocardiogram to record electrical signals indicating if you have had a heart attack in the past or having one presently.
Your doctor may also request imaging studies including echocardiogram, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to evaluate how the heart is working, see blocked passages in the heart, and visualize any calcium deposits which may be contributing to narrowing or clogging of the heart arteries.A stress test may also be conducted. This will allow the doctor to measure blood flow to the heart muscle under stress conditions., Your physician may order a serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and blood urea nitrogen test to evaluate your kidney function. These are all different tests on your urine. An ultrasound and CT scan may also be used to visualize blocked arteries or calcium deposits., Peripheral Artery Disease is a circulatory disease, in which your arteries are narrowed. This narrowing of the arteries reduces circulation to the limbs.One of the simplest tests is to have your physician evaluate the two different pulses in your feet during a routine physical examination.

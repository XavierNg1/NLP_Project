 If you have a rare bottle of wine stashed away in your home, you may find yourself in a position to want to sell it. Fortunately, many companies buy rare bottles of wine. The first step is figuring out how much the bottle is worth so that you can decide whether you want to sell it or not.The best place to figure out what your bottle is worth is to search online wine databases/stores that specialize in wines, such as http://www.wine-searcher.com/ or http://www.2020wines.com/.
 Most people buying high-dollar wine aren't interested in buying a single bottle of wine at once. Rather, they prefer lots or cellars of wine, primarily because it is easier to assess how the collection has been kept., Auctions are a common way to sell wines. Big-name auction sites that specialize in things like antiques and fine art will auction off wines, such as one of the most famous auction companies, Christie's. However, you can also use sites that specialize in auctioning wine. Most will auction the wine for you, such as http://www.zachys.com/ or https://www.winebid.com/., Another option is to sell directly to corporate buyers. Some wine stores specialize in buying up rare wines, and then they sell them to other customers. Usually, you either ship or take the wine into the store, and it's evaluated. Then they make you an offer or return the wine to you if they don't want to buy it.Generally, all you need to do is find a store or business that buys wine. Your best bet is finding a website that offers this service. You don't need a special license or registration as long as you're selling your personal collection of wine.

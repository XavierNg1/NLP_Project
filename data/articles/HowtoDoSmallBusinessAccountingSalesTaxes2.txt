 This can be obtained from your state department of Finance and Taxation. Before any data is entered into the spreadsheet, design the spreadsheet around the informational requirements set forth in the remittance forms. Line descriptions should precede all data. Determine which cells will contain the formulas to calculate the sales tax.


You will need to calculate sales taxes for a specific month or quarter. Create different tabs on your spreadsheet for different months and quarters.
 In states such as Arizona, it matters whether the client is a retail business or a contractor. For contractors, every single transaction that resulted in revenue, whether taxable or nontaxable, must first be entered line by line on the spreadsheet. For retail businesses the sum total of all revenue, both taxable and nontaxable, should be entered into the spreadsheet with line descriptions that give the nature of the revenue.
 Create separate columns to report all taxable sales, exempt sales and amount of tax due. Enter a formula to add up the total for each column at the bottom.
 A point-of-sale device or system can automatically keep track of all sales while calculating and recording the tax collected on each sale. They can be programmed for each state's respective sales taxes, and they will often automatically upload the data to a spreadsheet for you.

A point-of-sale system will often include a cash register, debit/credit card reader, computer with POS installed, and/or a bar code scanner.

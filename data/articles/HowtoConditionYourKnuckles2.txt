 Use heavy-duty cotton wrist wraps to wrap your hands and prevent injury. Wraps will come with a loop that is placed around your thumb. Secure this loop around your thumb, then start wrapping the cloth around your wrist. Continue to wrap, moving the cloth upward until your entire hand and fingers are covered in 2-3 layers of secured cloth. Then, finish with one last wrap around your wrist.


Secure the wrap with Velcro or by tucking the end of the wrap underneath the cloth on your wrist.
Wrap both hands.
Never use a punching bag without first wrapping your hands, even if you want to condition your knuckles.
 This increases the pressure on your hand bones and will allow your knuckles to become stronger. Remember to start off with only a few minutes of punching per day, then increase the time you punch the bag by a few minutes each week.
 Give your knuckles a break if they feel sore, and do not punch the bag without gloves until your knuckles are not sore to the touch anymore, which may take up to 2 weeks.

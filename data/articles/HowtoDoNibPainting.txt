 For this project, you'll need both straight and round nibs. The remaining items needed are listed at the end of the article.
 Glue it in place. This becomes the work board that you can use again and again for the paintings., Do some small and simple painting to get a feel for how the nibs work with the oil paints., Mark two centimeters along the perimeter of the cloth to enable the painting to be framed. This area will not be painted, so check the size against the frame you'd like to use before you begin painting. Lay over the felt piece in readiness for drawing and painting on., You can either mark this directly onto the fabric, or use tracing paper and transfer the image to the fabric., Place it on your index finger. For smoothing the paint, use the nib and rub the paint in the same manner as you'd mix sugar into milk., Start applying the paint from nib onto the cloth, in its respective place.

While painting, you will note that it appears like a line. You have to paint like this all over, continuously adding more lines to form the image parts.
You can mix two colors while painting, to get beautiful shading in the scenery or image.
 For example, if small flowers are to be painted, use a round nib. Just keep the nib in the paint and make sure not much paint is settled on the top of the nib. Press the nib where the petals of a small flower or a cloud are to be made.

Take your time. There is no need to finish the painting at one sitting. You can take several days to complete it, as desired.
 Once the painting is done, leave it aside for two to three days to dry up. It won't be ready for framing until it is completely dry.

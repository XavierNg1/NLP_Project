 Wait for your crops to ripen. Plants will grow more quickly when they are irrigated and well-lit – including at night. Try using bone meal on plants to make them ready more quickly. Two doses of bone meal should bring a freshly-planted wheat seed to full maturity.


Wheat will grow up slowly from green to golden-brown. When it fills the full air-block, you'll know that it's time to harvest. If you aren't sure, look online for photos of mature Minecraft wheat.
 Left-click or "punch" mature plants to harvest their bounty. You can also use your hoe, although there's no advantage here. The crops will fall to the ground, ready for you to pick them up, and a few seeds may also scatter in the process. Collect and store the harvested wheat, pumpkins, melons, etc. Your crops may not all ripen at the same time unless you are very efficient in your planting process.
 Most of the time, harvesting a crop will reveal seeds. This is especially true of wheat: you may only get one seed per plant, or you may find several. Either way: quickly replant seeds in each of the tilled, harvested blocks to keep your garden growing. You may need to re-till some spaces.
 As you collect more seeds and more varieties, you may want to plant more crops and make your garden larger. You may be able to slowly and "naturally" grow your garden by planting any extra seeds that you get from the harvest. Remember that the larger your garden grows, the more water you will need to keep it evenly irrigated.


Read up on efficient ways to organize your garden. Get creative. Try to figure out how you can grow the most plants with the least water, or how you can harvest the plants more quickly.
There is no limit to the size of your garden. You may find that even a small wheat garden relatively quickly fulfills your survival needs – but it doesn't hurt to expand!

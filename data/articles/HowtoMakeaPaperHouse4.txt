 If you don’t have loose-leaf paper lying around you can also take out paper from a notebook.. Take a sheet of paper and put it in some water. Make sure you get it really wet. , You don't want to squeeze it into a pulp, you just want it to be a soft balled up material. Eventually you should have a ball of wet paper that has the consistency of Play Dough. Add water or wring it out until you find the right consistency.
 It should look sort of like a worm. You need to wait until you get it into a clay-like substance before you do this. , You need the tray so you can make the small house and put it out in the sun later. Make 3 more little lines out of the wet paper. Place them to form a square that is missing one side. , You should make three or six more lines depending on how high you want your house to be. Put them vertically on the corners of the square that you’re making.
 After each corner has a line on it, start mixing more of the paper into a play dough consistency. Now instead of making more lines, just make them into little flat blocks. These will be your walls. Put them on the vertical lines until you have a cube that's missing 2 faces -the one on top and one of the sides should be missing.
 Be creative if you’d like, or just add a basic flat root over the top of it. You’ll follow the same process of wetting the paper to make the roof.
 This is the final step, and it will hold everything together. Now you can put your fairy house out in the woods somewhere, in your backyard, or just keep it in your house.

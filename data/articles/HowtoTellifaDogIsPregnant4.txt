 A dog may not show any signs of pregnancy in the first 2-3 weeks (which is the first third of the pregnancy). Her appetite should remain normal.


Pregnant female dogs absolutely do suffer from morning sickness like people do, however not until approximately day 21 after being mated. It usually lasts 1-2 weeks. Also on day 21, you can look at your female's gums. If the mating took, her gums will be white instead of the normal pink. This is because the fetus' are attaching in her uterus and the blood in her body is gathering there, so for a day or two, her gums will appear white. There is nothing to worry about. If it continues after 2 days, call your vet.
 Some people first suspect their bitch might be pregnant because she is a bit quieter than usual, but this is more anecdotal observation than proven fact. Pregnancy causes changing hormone levels and this affects each dog differently.


Some dogs may become quieter than usual, others may become more affectionate and clingy, and still others could withdraw and want to be left alone. , Whilst a change in a dogâ€™s apparent mood or behavior can indicate pregnancy, this is a vague sign that could also indicate that she is unwell. Therefore, you should monitor her closely for any symptoms of ill health such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, sneezing, or vaginal discharge.


If your dog has been mated but subsequently goes off her food in the next few days or weeks, this is unlikely to be related to pregnancy and she should be checked by a veterinarian. This is also the case if you see a vaginal discharge (not normal during pregnancy) or if she is vomiting regularly.

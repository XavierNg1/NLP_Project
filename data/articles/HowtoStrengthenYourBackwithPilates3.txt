 The breathing is the same as in the previous exercise but here it will be performed in four breaths.


Change your position to lie face down on your mat. Have your feet and legs together and the tip of your nose lightly resting on the mat. Place your hands either side of your shoulders, so that your elbows rest comfortably on the mat.
If you feel a lot of pressure on your lower back in this position, place a small towel just under your hip bones for support.
 As you exhale, draw your shoulders down on your back, keeping the neck in line and extend up off the floor.
 Think of lengthening forwards from your head, then exhale, to gently return back to the mat.
 Do the same thing four times, concentrating on maintaining your abdominals firm throughout. You will feel your upper back and shoulders working.

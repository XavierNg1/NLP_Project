 Selecting your Pokémon can be tricky, especially since you have a lot to choose from, but the best rule of thumb to use is to select one of each main type (Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Flying and Dragon/Psychic/Steel etc.) This will make sure you have a Pokémon to counter almost any team, and it'll make it hard for your rival to pick a weak spot as you'll have most major bases covered.;
, If you can successfully defeat all of these trainers without any problems, your team is fully prepared for what's to come if you want to battle online or against a friend. However, if you have some difficulty, head back to the drawing board and make any necessary changes to your line up.
 Try replacing a move with another, or making that Pokémon hold an item to boost a stat. Don't be afraid to use the weather to your advantage as well, e.g. Blizzard or Sandstorm, as Pokémon who aren't an Ice or Ground Type will get heavily damaged by those moves above.
 For example, if you struggled with Gardenia, and used a Water Type Pokémon beforehand, by adding an Ice or Flying Type move, you'll be able to easily defeat her as Grass is weak to Ice and Flying.
 This way, you can really iron out any kinks in your team and prepare yourself for the Battle Frontier (if you have Pokémon Emerald, Platinum or HeartGold/SoulSilver). The Battle Frontier is filled with tough battles that will challenge even the most die-hard Pokémon trainers and their teams, so, as the saying goes... practice makes perfect!

, Share to level up lower-levelled Pokémon. However, don't just use Rare Candy, as even though your Pokémon level up, they won't grow as strong as a Pokémon who's been trained up properly, with help from a good friendship between the trainer and itself and with these steps you can make a good team

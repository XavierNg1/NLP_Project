 For any hair-straightening method you use that requires using heat to straighten your hair, it's important to condition it a few days beforehand. Heating dry hair will cause it to get brittle and may even make it break. Use a good deep conditioner on your hair about 2-3 days before you want to straighten it.


Olive oil or coconut oil-based deep conditioners are great for your hair. Consider using these chemical-free options.
You can also use a high-quality silicone-based conditioner a few days before you straighten your hair.
 Don't shampoo it, just wet your hair when you're ready to straighten it, and blot it with a towel until it's damp but not dripping wet.
 You're going to blow your hair dry piece by piece. Start with one section and use a round brush to brush it straight, starting at the roots and brushing all the way to the tips. Make sure it's tangle-free.
 Smooth it all over your hair, from roots to tips, to protect each strand from the damaging heat of the hair dryer. This will also help your hair stay straight for a longer period of time.
 Take your brush and position it at the roots of the section of hair you're blowing out. Turn on your hair dryer and position it right next to the brush, at the roots of the hair section. Move the brush and the blow dryer down the hair section to the tips, slowly drying and straightening the hair at the same time.Don't move down the shaft of hair too quickly; you want to do it slowly, so the hair has time to dry.
Use either the warm or hot setting on your hair dryer for best effect.
 Repeat the process, section by section, until your entire head of hair is dry and straight.

 Decide how large you'd like the nameplate to be first, then draw a simple five-sided star to these proportions. Cut the template out.
 Trace around the template design. Keep the template for making other star designs, as needed.
, Paint several layers, allowing it to dry in between each layer.


If you paint the star light red, consider painting a gold border all the way around the edges of the star.
 If it helps you to keep neat, use stencil letters or cut out paper templates from printed letters and attach these, then trace around them.
 Take care not to go over any lines; use a fine paintbrush for the edges. Allow to dry before proceeding.


If preferred, use a Sharpie marker to color in the letters.
 This step is optional but can add some pizazz to the design. Either use glitter glue or spread glue on the star where you'd like the glitter to go, then sprinkle on the glitter. Allow to dry before hanging.
 Simply brush over the whole design and allow to dry.


Be sure to follow any other instructions indicated by the packaging of the sealant chosen.
 Thread a cord, piece of string or filament thread through this hole. Tie in a strong knot, to form a hanging loop.
 Depending on its size, either add a hook to the door for hanging from, or just hang it from the doorknob.

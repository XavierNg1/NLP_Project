 Getting bangs would be a good idea too, only if they look good on you.;
, If you can't, then either buy a wig or straighten your hair to get a similar style. If you really want to get into the look, you can even add the darker purple and pink stripe she has down her mane onto your own hair!

, Twilight is a bookworm, so get only a slightly muscular shape.
 Because Twilight's main scheme is mostly lavender and royal purple, wear those colors often. In addition, go for clothing that looks professional and has the look of a classic school girl (think pleated skirts, collar blouses, vests, etc).


Dress appropriately. Try to dress smartly, and avoid shirts with the words 'LOL', or other things like that printed on them.
 Wear purple, pink and blue eye shadow, with a silver lip gloss. Make sure to keep your skin free of acne too.
 Twilight is into books, not fashion. If fashion is more your thing, look for articles on how to be like Rarity.
 It's also a good idea that when you buy them, you make sure they are either washable, or are able to be washed by a cloth.
 Try to buy your clothing in violets, lavenders, and light blues!

, Twilight Sparkle is very into books. She even lives in a library! Read and study a lot.


Read fact books, or non-fiction.
 Because Twilight Sparkle reads a lot, she is also very smart. Build up on your grammar and writing skills.


Choose something you're interested in (History, Culture, Architecture, etc...) and study it! Find out who started it/invented it, what it used to be like when it was first started/invented! Some good ideas are: Math, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, History, Biology and Culture.
 This is the most important step. Twilight would never get a bad grade, and always studies. So, do your best in school, and study away.
 Even if she is the princess of friendship, she's still a bit of an introvert.

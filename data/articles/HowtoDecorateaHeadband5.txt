 Take three different colors or patterns of duct tape, as you will be using them to make a layered bow.
 Cut a long piece of duct tape, about a foot to a foot and a half in length, depending on how big your want your bow.
 Fold the tape in half lengthwise (so you are halving its width, not its length), leaving just a tiny bit of the sticky part exposed. Now fold the sticky edge over. This will give your clean edges on both sides of the bow.
 Grab the two outside thirds and fold them in half.


Now bend the two lower halves towards each other so they meet in the middle, and bend the two outside halves outwards to form a bow shape.
This is very difficult to describe in writing, so it's best to look up "Make a Duct Tape Headband" on Youtube to get a visual.
 Cut off another small strip of duct tape and wrap it around the center of the bow to secure

, Repeat the same method with the next two colors/patterns, making each bow slightly smaller than the last.


Sit the smallest bow on top of the middle bow and the middle bow on top of the biggest bow.
Make sure the centers are aligned, then use another small piece of duct tape to secure the stack of bows.
 Use a scissors to trim the long pieces of duct tape, cutting them at a 45 degree angle.
